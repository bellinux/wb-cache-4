5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of medicinal plants is being systematised in the Medicinal Plant <b>Transcriptomics</b> Database, which by 2011 provided a sequence reference for the transcriptome of some thirty species.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of <b>transcriptomics</b> technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to study the}} whole transcriptome {{began in the early}} 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made <b>transcriptomics</b> a widespread discipline. <b>Transcriptomics</b> has been defined by repeated technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA-Seq, which uses high-throughput sequencing to capture all sequences.|$|E
25|$|Operomics aims to {{integrate}} genomics, <b>transcriptomics</b> and proteomics {{to understand the}} molecular mechanisms that underlie the cancer development.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcriptomics</b> allows {{identification}} of genes and pathways that respond to and counteract biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. The non-targeted nature of <b>transcriptomics</b> allows the {{identification of}} novel transcriptional networks in complex systems. For example, comparative analysis {{of a range of}} chickpea lines at different developmental stages identified distinct transcriptional profiles associated with drought and salinity stresses, including identifying the role of transcript isoforms of AP2-EREBP. Investigation of gene expression during biofilm formation by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans revealed a co-regulated set of genes critical for biofilm establishment and maintenance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcriptomics</b> {{has been}} characterised by the {{development}} of new techniques which have redefined what is possible every decade or so and render previous technologies obsolete. The first attempt at capturing a partial human transcriptome was published in 1991 and reported 609 mRNA sequences from the human brain. In 2008, two human transcriptomes, composed of millions of transcript-derived sequences covering 16,000 genes, were published and, by 2015, transcriptomes had been published for hundreds of individuals. Transcriptomes of different disease states, tissues or even single cells are now routinely generated. This explosion in <b>transcriptomics</b> has been driven by the rapid development of new technologies with improved sensitivity and economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of microarrays relies on micro and nanofabrication techniques. Microarrays for <b>transcriptomics</b> typically fall {{into one of}} two broad categories: low-density spotted arrays or high-density short probe arrays. Transcript presence may be recorded with single- or dual-channel detection of fluorescent tags.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>transcriptomics</b> {{technologies}} {{can be used}} {{to generate}} the necessary data to analyse. DNA microarrays measure the relative activity of previously identified target genes. Sequence based techniques, like RNA-Seq, provide information on the sequences of genes in addition to their expression level.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcriptomics</b> studies {{generate}} {{large amounts}} of data that has potential applications far beyond the original aims of an experiment. As such, raw or processed data may be deposited in public databases to ensure their utility for the broader scientific community. For example, as of 2016, the Gene Expression Omnibus contained millions of experiments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcriptomics</b> is most {{commonly}} {{applied to the}} mRNA content of the cell. However, the same techniques are equally applicable to non-coding RNAs that are not translated into a protein, but instead, have direct functions (e.g. roles in protein translation, DNA replication, RNA splicing and Transcriptional regulation). Many of these ncRNAs affect disease states, including cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcriptomics</b> is {{the study}} of the transcriptome, usually by characterizing the {{relative}} abundances of messenger RNA molecules the tissue under study. According to the central dogma of molecular biology, genetic information flows from double stranded DNA molecules to single stranded mRNA molecules where they can be readily translated into function protein molecules. By studying the transcriptome, one can gain valuable insight into the regulation of gene expressions.|$|E
25|$|All transcriptomic {{techniques}} {{have been particularly}} useful in identifying the functions of genes and identifying those responsible for particular phenotypes. <b>Transcriptomics</b> of Arabidopsis ecotypes that hyperaccumulate metals correlated genes involved in metal uptake, tolerance and homeostasis with the phenotype. Integration of RNA-Seq datasets across different tissues {{has been used to}} improve annotation of gene functions in commercially important organisms (e.g. cucumber) or threatened species (e.g. koala).|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcriptomics</b> {{technologies}} are the techniques {{used to study}} an organism’s transcriptome, {{the sum of all}} of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst non-coding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell.|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{may be used}} to {{identify}} genes within a genome, or identify which genes are active at a particular point in time, and read counts can be used to accurately model the relative gene expression level. RNA-Seq methodology has constantly improved, primarily through the development of DNA sequencing technologies to increase throughput, accuracy, and read length. Since the first descriptions in 2006 and 2008, RNA-Seq has been rapidly adopted and overtook microarrays as the dominant <b>transcriptomics</b> technique in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Cyanines dyes {{are usually}} {{synthesized}} from 2, 3, 5 or 7 methine structures with reactive groups on either {{one or both}} of the nitrogen side chains so that they can be chemically linked to either nucleic acids or protein molecules. Labeling is done for visualization and quantification purposes. Biological applications include comparative genomic hybridization and gene chips, which are used in <b>transcriptomics,</b> and various studies in proteomics such as RNA localization, molecular interaction studies by fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescent immunoassays.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcriptomics</b> {{methods are}} highly {{parallel}} and require significant computation to produce meaningful data for both microarray and RNA-Seq experiments. Microarray data is recorded as high-resolution images, requiring feature detection and spectral analysis. Microarray raw image files are each about 750 MB in size, while the processed intensities are around 60 MB in size. Multiple short probes matching a single transcript can reveal {{details about the}} intron-exon structure, requiring statistical models to determine {{the authenticity of the}} resulting signal. RNA-Seq studies produce billions of short DNA sequences, which must be aligned to reference genomes composed of millions to billions of base pairs. De novo assembly of reads within a dataset requires the construction of highly complex sequence graphs. RNA-Seq operations are highly repetitious and benefit from parallelised computation but modern algorithms mean consumer computing hardware is sufficient for simple <b>transcriptomics</b> experiments that do not require de novo assembly of reads. A human transcriptome could be accurately captured using RNA-Seq with 30 million 100 bp sequences per sample. This example would require approximately 1.8 gigabytes of disk space per sample when stored in a compressed fastq format. Processed count data for each gene would be much smaller, equivalent to processed microarray intensities. Sequence data may be stored in public repositories, such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). RNA-Seq datasets can be uploaded via the Gene Expression Omnibus.|$|E
25|$|The term genomics, {{referring}} to the organism’s whole genome, {{is also used to}} refer to gene informatics, or the collection and storage of genetic data, including the functional information associated with the genes, and the analysis of the data as combinations, patterns and networks by computer algorithms. Systems biology and genomics are natural partners, since the development of genomic information and systems naturally facilitates analysis of systems biology questions involving relationships between genes, their variants (SNPs) and biological function. Such questions include the investigation of signaling pathways, evolutionary trees, or biological networks, such as immune networks and pathways. For this reason, genomics and these approaches are particularly suited to studies in immunology. The study of immunology using genomics, as well as proteomics and <b>transcriptomics</b> (Includes gene profiles, either genomic or expressed gene mRNA profiles), has been termed immunomics.|$|E
25|$|During {{preparation}} for sequencing, cDNA copies of transcripts may be amplified by PCR to enrich for fragments that contain the expected 5’ and 3’ adapter sequences. Amplification {{is also used}} to allow sequencing of very low input amounts of RNA, down to as little as 50 pg, in extreme applications. Spike-in controls can be used to provide quality control assessment of library preparation and sequencing, in terms of GC-content, fragment length, as well as the bias due to fragment position within a transcript. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are short random sequences that are used to individually tag sequence fragments during library preparation, so that every tagged fragment is unique. UMIs provide an absolute scale for quantification and the opportunity to correct for subsequent amplification bias introduced during library construction, and accurately estimate the initial sample size. UMIs are particularly well suited to single-cell RNA-Seq <b>transcriptomics,</b> where the amount of input RNA is restricted and extended amplification of the sample is required.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{individual}} transcripts were being performed several decades before any <b>transcriptomics</b> approaches were available. Libraries of silkmoth mRNAs were collected and converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) for storage using reverse transcriptase {{in the late}} 1970s. In the 1980s, low-throughput Sanger sequencing began {{to be used to}} sequence random individual transcripts from these libraries, called Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The Sanger method of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). ESTs came to prominence during the 1990s as an efficient method to determine the gene content of an organism without sequencing the entire genome. Quantification {{of individual}} transcripts by Northern blotting, nylon membrane arrays, and later Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were also popular, but these methods are laborious and can only capture a tiny subsection of a transcriptome. Consequently, the manner in which a transcriptome as a whole is expressed and regulated remained unknown until higher-throughput techniques were developed.|$|E
500|$|The genetic events {{found in}} ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} {{have been well}} characterized, and complete exome sequencing has been done for the common types of tumor. Four genes have each {{been found to be}} mutated in the majority of adenocarcinomas: KRAS (in 95% of cases), CDKN2A (also in 95%), TP53 (75%), and SMAD4 (55%). [...] The last of these are especially associated with a poor prognosis. [...] SWI/SNF mutations/deletions occur in about 10–15% of the adenocarcinomas. [...] The genetic alterations in several other types of pancreatic cancer and precancerous lesions have also been researched. <b>Transcriptomics</b> analyses and mRNA sequencing for the common forms of pancreatic cancer have found that 75% of human genes are expressed in the tumors, with some 200 genes more specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer as compared to other tumor types.|$|E

[...] Following a mutual decision to collaborate, this effort later became a wider collaboration between groups such as FGED, PSI and MSI in response to the needs of areas such as <b>transcriptomics,</b> proteomics and metabolomics and the FuGO (Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology) was created. [...] This later became the OBI covering the wider scope of all biomedical investigations.|$|E
2500|$|The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) {{addresses}} {{the need for}} controlled vocabularies to support integration and joint ("cross-omics") analysis of experimental data, a need originally identified in the <b>transcriptomics</b> domain by the FGED Society, which developed the MGED Ontology as an annotation resource for microarray data. OBI uses the basic formal ontology upper-level ontology {{as a means of}} describing general entities that do not belong to a specific problem domain. [...] As such, all OBI classes are a subclass of some BFO class.|$|E
