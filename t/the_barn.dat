5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barn</b> and the {{surrounding}} Manor Farm property were purchased in 1986 by the John Wiltshier Group, a builder/property developer which aimed to restore <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> {{to serve as a}} showcase for the company. The farm underwent major changes, with several of the more dilapidated buildings demolished and a new L-shaped office building constructed facing <b>the</b> <b>barn.</b> Planning permission was granted on the basis that income from the new offices was supposed to pay for ongoing repairs to <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> following an initial renovation carried out in 1989. However, in 2006, the company went into receivership. The other buildings were individually sold to new owners but the receiver's attempts to sell <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> separately fell through.|$|E

The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works, declassifying <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed building. This enabled the notice to be issued more speedily, overriding the owners' objections.|$|E

50|$|The farm complex {{comprises}} <b>the</b> farmhouse, two <b>barns,</b> a corncrib, an icehouse, a slaughterhouse {{and several}} additional outbuildings. <b>The</b> <b>barns</b> are <b>the</b> dominant {{features of the}} farm. <b>The</b> larger <b>barn</b> was built in two sections on a limestone foundation, with two levels. The wood frame is laid out in ten bays, with a three-section lower level. <b>The</b> small <b>barn</b> adjoins <b>the</b> larger <b>barn</b> at a right angle and is about half as large as <b>the</b> first <b>barn,</b> with three bays. The lower level is fitted for horse stabling.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barn</b> {{was briefly}} in royal {{ownership}} but {{passed into the}} hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex.

English Heritage stepped in, using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner's consent, and eventually purchased <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> in January 2012. It is now open to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> has {{provided}} inspiration {{to a number}} of architects in the 19th and 20th centuries who were involved with the Gothic Revival movement. Sir George Gilbert Scott visited <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> in 1850 and sketched it, using its design as the basis for proposals for the new ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand. The library of Mansfield College, Oxford designed by Basil Champneys in the late 1880s also owes its inspiration to <b>the</b> <b>barn.</b> Bedales School's library, completed in 1922 and designed by Ernest Gimson, may also have had its origins in the barn's design.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barn</b> owl has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} {{detection of}} sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barn</b> {{was built}} {{sometime}} around 1871, possibly even before, and is constructed {{of the same}} soft brick that makes up {{the exterior of the}} home.

The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50feet (15m) tall, with a width of 30feet (9m).|$|E
