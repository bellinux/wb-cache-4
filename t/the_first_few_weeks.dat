Usually for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> people are advised to rest, change their activities, take pain medications, and stretch. If this is not sufficient physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. If other measures do not work extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery may be tried.|$|E

40|$|This {{approach}} yields {{an estimate}} of two days for the lifespan of productively infected cells during primary infection, a value {{that is consistent with}} results obtained by drug perturbation experiments. We find that all patient data sets considered are consistent with a target-cell limited model from the time of initial infection until shortly after the peak in viremia, but some data sets are not consistent after the peak value with the assumptions of such a model. We illustrate that two possible immune response mechanisms, cytotoxic T lymphocyte destruction of infected target cells and cytokine suppression of viral replication, could account for declines in viral load data not predicted by the original target-cell limited model. We conclude that some additional process, perhaps mediated by CD 8 + T cells, is important in at least some patients. 2 1.

5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce spent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> {{of his term}} sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, {{forced out of the}} group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of 2010, {{there was}} renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits.

5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the tour, {{as he struggled}} to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months of infection.

The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
40|$|The {{emphasis}} on the class struggle in revolutionary thinking has obscured the significance of traditional sex roles and nowhere is this more apparent than in the mistaken belief that child rearing is, of necessity, the responsibility of women. In fact, other than <b>the</b> optional <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months of breast feeding, there is no biological connection between the bearing of children and their rearing. Women both in and outside the Women’s Liberation movement are busily mouthing this radical idea, but {{it is evident that}} as far as their own lives are concerned, and in their attitudes to others, it remains an empty ideal...|$|R

5|$|In October 1944, the Banat and Bačka were {{captured}} by Soviet troops. Subotica was captured on the 12 October. After a few weeks, they withdrew and ceded {{full control of}} the region to the Partisans, who established a military administration in the Banat, Bačka and Baranja on 17 October 1944. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> after Bačka returned to Yugoslav control, about 16,800 Hungarians were killed by Serbs in revenge for killings during the Hungarian occupation. In November 1944, Tito declared that the Volksdeutsche of Yugoslavia were hostile to the nation, and ordered the internment of those living in areas under Partisan control. About 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche had been evacuated from Bačka; while an additional 30,000–60,000 from Bačka were serving in the Wehrmacht at the time.|$|E
5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was more}} often {{substitute}} than starter in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of 2012–13 under new manager Robert Maaskant, but {{went on to}} re-establish himself in the side. A minor knee injury sustained during the mid-season training camp meant he missed a couple of matches, and thereafter his appearances in the starting eleven were intermittent, whether through suspension or just not being selected. Groningen finished in seventh place, albeit 19 points behind Twente whom they faced in the play-offs. Kieftenbeld put in a strong performance in the first leg in a 1–0 defeat at home, but a 3–2 loss in the second leg confirmed that Groningen would not qualify for the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only {{four hours and}} made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings {{with a total of}} 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease. He rectified this, and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test. Five more centuries {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E
50|$|Residents of South Euclid {{eventually}} wanted autonomy {{from the}} larger Euclid Township, and voted on October 13, 1917, to be incorporated as a village, with Edward C.

5|$|Polyakov {{underwent}} medical assessments before, during, {{and after}} the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning to Earth. When researchers compared {{the results of these}} medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of spaceflight and return to Earth. However, Polyakov's mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as manned missions to Mars.|$|E
5|$|The America's Response Monument, a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue {{commemorating the}} actions of U.S. Special Operations Forces in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the War in Afghanistan, was {{unveiled}} to the public during the Veteran's Day Parade in New York City on November 11, 2011. The statue was displayed on a float, which traveled along Fifth Avenue north from 23rd Street to 56th Street. It was dedicated that same day, in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant-General John Mulholland, commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan. It was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, {{four-horned antelope}}s may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of their birth. The young remain with the mother for about a year.|$|E
50|$|Ohtahara {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} but severe epilepsy syndrome usually starting in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days or <b>weeks</b> of life.

The prognosis is poor with about half of the infants dying in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> year of life; most if not all surviving infants are severely intellectually disabled and many have cerebral palsy. There is no effective treatment. A number of children have underlying structural brain abnormalities.|$|R
30|$|Gender {{and age of}} {{bus drivers}} are not {{correlated}} with either injury severity or on-board injury occurrence, {{with the exception of}} young drivers under 24  years old increasing the probability of severe injuries by 52.2  % and fatal injuries by 66.3  %. Notably, the percentage of young drivers involved in bus accidents is extremely low (1.8  %) and most bus drivers (67.9  %) are between 25 and 55  years old. This finding is in opposition with results for the U.S. where young and elderly drivers were related to increased bus accident severity [18]. It should be noted that bus operators in Denmark are extremely active in promoting pleasant and safe environment to passengers with the campaign “Chauffører med karakter” that leads to the election of the best bus driver of the year [23]. Possibly, bus operators could further enhance the smooth entrance in the rotation of young drivers by possibly extending <b>the</b> current <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of supervision by more experienced drivers.|$|R

5|$|With {{this dispute}} settled {{collaboration}} could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists {{as possible so}} long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat {{refused to give up}} his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so that he could travel to America. Chadwick spent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.|$|E
5|$|As the {{invasion}} began, the Germans pursued the fleeing Red Army, leaving a security vacuum. Reports surfaced of Soviet guerrilla {{activity in the}} area, with local Jews immediately suspected of collaboration. Heydrich ordered his officers to incite anti-Jewish pogroms in the newly occupied territories. Pogroms, {{some of which were}} orchestrated by the Einsatzgruppen, broke out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. Within <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of Operation Barbarossa, 40 pogroms led to the deaths of 10,000 Jews, {{and by the end of}} 1941 some 60 pogroms had taken place, claiming as many as 24,000 victims. However, SS-Brigadeführer Franz Walter Stahlecker, commander of Einsatzgruppe A, reported to his superiors in mid-October that the residents of Kaunas were not spontaneously starting pogroms, and secret assistance by the Germans was required. A similar reticence was noted by Einsatzgruppe B in Russia and Belarus and Einsatzgruppe C in Ukraine; the further east the Einsatzgruppen travelled, the less likely the residents were to be prompted into killing their Jewish neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Finding American {{distributors}} {{proved more}} troublesome. Memento was screened for various studio heads (including Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein) in March 2000. Although {{most of the}} executives loved the film and praised Nolan's talent, all passed on distributing the picture, believing it was too confusing and would not attract a large audience. After famed independent film director Steven Soderbergh saw the film and learned it was not being distributed, he championed the film in interviews and public events, giving it even more publicity, {{although he did not}} secure a distributor. Newmarket, in a financially risky move, decided to distribute the film itself. After <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of distribution, Memento had reached more than 500 theaters and earned a domestic total of $25million in its box-office run. The film's success was surprising to those who passed on the film, so much so that Weinstein realized his mistake and tried to buy the film from Newmarket.|$|E
