5|$|Bowman {{finds himself}} in a bedroom {{appointed}} in the neoclassical style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and as Bowman reaches for it, he {{is transformed into a}} fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially sitting up in bed, their skin may stick to the sheet, making them susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Bryson's escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and the search warrant earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson's claims to have been restrained and tortured in a second floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom {{on the second floor}} was found to have burnt ropes attached to the posts at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Also in the room was an electrical transformer, plugged into a wall, and with wires leading to the bed. A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops was also close to the bed. Also found in the room were a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts. Investigators also noted that although Bryson's restraints had been tied to posts at each corner of the bed, other posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to these posts, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, infill at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope has a {{stabilising}} {{effect on}} a translational or deep rotational landslide, in which the landslide surface at the top submerges and describes a sub-vertical surface that re-emerges in <b>the</b> area at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> infill at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope may include construction of berms, gravitational structures such as gabions, or reinforced ground (i.e., concrete blocks).|$|R
5000|$|Outer Continental Shelf limits {{greater than}} 200 {{nautical}} miles {{but less than}} either the 2,500-meter isobath plus 100 nmi or 350 nmi are defined by a line [...] seaward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continental slope or by a line seaward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continental slope connecting points where the sediment thickness divided by <b>the</b> distance to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope equals 0.01, whichever is farthest.|$|R

500|$|Other {{examples}} of the more comical nature of the story at this point include suggestions for a [...] "fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied" [...] Queen. The Prince was also more of a clown, and was to serenade Snow White in a more comical fashion. Walt Disney encouraged all staff at the studio {{to contribute to the}} story, offering five dollars for every 'gag'; such gags included the dwarfs' noses popping over <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> when they first meet Snow White.|$|E
2500|$|British {{railways}} had a {{head start}} on American railroads, with the first [...] "bed-carriage" [...] (an early sleeping car) being built there as early as 1838 for use on the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway. [...] Britain's early sleepers, when made up for sleeping, extended <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> into a boot section {{at the end of the}} carriage. [...] The cars were still too short to allow more than two or three beds to be positioned end to end.|$|E
2500|$|Despite initial {{misgivings about}} Carisa's design with a desk built into <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> (one judge remarked that an active boy could easily hurt {{himself on the}} rough edges), her design was {{named one of the}} best that night. Goil's design, with a bed {{equipped}} to roll away inside the wall when not in use, and a crawl space for the child to hide if he so chose, was also liked by the judges. Erik's design, revolved around a wooden [...] "pirate ship" [...] (the client he had expressed an interest in pirates), won top prize.|$|E
50|$|Generally, areas above 3,000 metres {{are covered}} by glaciers, the two largest being the Ried Glacier {{situated}} at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nadelgrat and the Fee Glacier, at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dom itself, below the east face.|$|R
50|$|It {{is an easy}} {{climb and}} an {{excellent}} starting course. The climb from <b>the</b> bivouac to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier <b>of</b> Etançons takes 2½ hour. From <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier to the summit takes 1¼ hours.|$|R

That--especially the occasional china--was what Baxter had heard.|$|R
2500|$|Olympia's body {{as well as}} {{her gaze}} is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the {{reference}} to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work. A contemporary critic denounced Olympia's [...] "shamelessly flexed" [...] left hand, which seemed to him a mockery of the relaxed, shielding hand of Titian's Venus. Likewise, the alert black cat at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> strikes a sexually rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino.|$|E
60|$|Forester {{turned back}} and {{advanced}} to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> There was a high foot-board at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and Forester leaned upon it with the lamp in his hand.|$|E

5000|$|On 27 April 2009 at the Australian Christian Churches National Conference, Southern Cross College officially {{changed it}} name to Alphacrucis. The new name {{derives from the}} star that sits at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern Cross {{constellation}} named Alpha Crucis. The principal, Stephen Fogarty, says, “Alphacrucis is {{the brightest star in}} the Southern Cross, and it’s at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross. … We want our students to shine brightly at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Field {{trips to}} Pace University are called [...] "the bridge to bridge walk" [...] because Pace High School {{is located at}} <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Bridge, and Pace University is located at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brooklyn Bridge (a 10-15 minute walk).|$|R
50|$|Various {{hardware}} {{is found}} {{attached to the}} boom. The hardware could include fairleads, blocks, block tracks, and cleats. For attachment, screws are used on wooden booms and screws or rivets on aluminium booms. If <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail {{is attached to the}} boom, there may be hoops from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail, around the boom, or there may be a track on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boom into which fittings on <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail are slid.|$|R

50|$|The North Wales Path, a long {{distance}} coastal path between Prestatyn and Bangor, crosses <b>the</b> bridge at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> falls.

5000|$|At <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier is a {{lake that}} was created by glacier recession.
