40|$|AbstractConvenient, economical, {{and reduced}} labor fish harvest and {{transfer}} systems {{are required to}} realize operating cost savings {{that can be achieved}} with the use of much larger and deeper circular culture tanks. To achieve these goals, we developed a new technology for transferring fish based on their avoidance behavior to elevated concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2). We observed this behavioral response during controlled, replicated experiments that showed dissolved CO 2 concentrations of 60 – 120 mg/L induced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to swim out of their 11 m 3 “growout” tank, through a <b>transfer</b> <b>pipe</b> carrying a flow with ≤ 23 mg/L dissolved CO 2, into a second 11 m 3 “harvest” tank. The research was conducted using separate groups of rainbow trout held at commercially relevant densities (40 – 60 kg/m 3). The average weight of fish ranged from 0. 15 to 1. 3 kg during the various trials. In all trials that used a constant flow of low CO 2 water (≤ 23 mg/L) entering the growout tank from the harvest tank, approximately 80 – 90 % of the fish swam from the growout tank, through the <b>transfer</b> <b>pipe,</b> and into the harvest tank after the CO 2 concentration in the growout tank had exceeded 60 mg/L. The fish that remained in the growout tank stayed within the area of relatively low CO 2 water at the entrance of the <b>transfer</b> <b>pipe.</b> However, the rate of fish transfer from the growout tank to the harvest tank was more than doubled when the diameter of the <b>transfer</b> <b>pipe</b> was increased from 203 to 406 mm. To consistently achieve fish transfer efficiencies of 99 %, water flow rate through the fish <b>transfer</b> <b>pipe</b> had to be reduced to 10 – 20 % of the original flow just before the conclusion of each trial. Reducing the flow of relatively low CO 2 water near the end of each fish transfer event, restricted the zone of relatively low CO 2 water about the entrance of the fish <b>transfer</b> <b>pipe,</b> and provided the stimulus for all but a few remaining fish to swim out of the growout tank. Results indicate that the CO 2 avoidance technique can provide a convenient, efficient, more economical, and reduced labor approach for fish transfer, especially in applications using large and well mixed circular culture tanks...|$|R

40|$|Pile heat {{exchangers}} have an increasing {{role to play}} in the delivery of renewable heating and cooling energy. Traditionally the thermal design of ground {{heat exchangers}} has relied upon analytical approaches which take a relatively simple approach {{to the inside of the}} heat exchanger. This approach is justified while the heat exchanger diameter remains small. However, as larger diameter piled founda-tions are used as heat exchangers, the transient heat transfer processes operating within the pile become more important. To increase our understanding of these processes and ultimately lead to improved thermal design approaches for pile heat exchangers it is important to ex-amine the heat transfer within the pile in detail. To accomplish this, a new numerical approach has been implemented within the finite ele-ment software ABAQUS. Coupling of the convective heat transfer due to fluid flow within the heat <b>transfer</b> <b>pipes</b> and the heat transfer by conduction within the pile concrete is the most important facet of the model.

40|$|Three auger {{pressure}} grouted (APG) test piles {{were constructed}} {{at a site}} in Richmond, Texas. The piles were each equipped with two U-loops of heat <b>transfer</b> <b>pipes</b> {{so that they could}} function as pile heat exchangers. The piles were of two different diameters and used two different grouts, a standard APG grout and a thermally enhanced grout. Thermal response tests, where fluid heated at a constant rate is circulated through the pipe loops, were carried out on the three piles, utilising either single or double loops. The resulting test data can be used to determine the surrounding soil thermal conductivity and the pile thermal resistance, both essential design parameters for ground source heat pump schemes using pile heat exchangers. This paper uses parameter estimation techniques to fit empirical temperature response curves to the thermal response test data and compares the results with standard line source interpretation techniques. As expected, the thermal response tests with double loops result in smaller thermal resistances than the same pile when the test was run with a single loop. Back analysis of the pile thermal resistance also allows calculation of the grout thermal properties. The thermally enhanced grout is shown to have inferior thermal properties than the standard APG grout. Together these analyses demonstrate the importance of pile size, grout thermal properties and pipe positions in controlling the thermal behaviour of heat exchanger piles...|$|E
40|$|Pile heat {{exchangers}} {{are expected to}} make a significant contribution to meeting UK and EU renewable energy and carbon dioxide reduction targets. However, design for the thermal capacity of pile {{heat exchangers}} has to date been largely based on methods developed for borehole heat exchangers. Piles have a much smaller aspect (length to diameter) ratio than boreholes and consequently their thermal behaviour is different in a number of important ways. This thesis explores these differences and makes recommendations for improved assessment of pile heat exchanger thermal capacity. Traditionally vertical heat exchanger design assumes separation of the thermal effects in the ground and in the pile. A transient temperature response function is used to assess temperature changes in the ground and a steady state resistance is applied to the pile concrete. In this thesis existing approaches to temperature response functions are critically assessed for use with thermal piles. It is important {{to take into account the}} larger pile diameter, which causes increased temperature changes in the short term. In the long term, the shorter pile length will result in reduced temperature changes as steady state is reached more quickly. Simple 2 D numerical modelling has been carried out and the results used to derive a new method for determining pile thermal resistance. However, for large diameter piles, the time taken for the pile to reach steady state suggests that the use of a constant thermal resistance in design is not always appropriate. In these cases it is recommended that a transient temperature response function is used to assess the response of the ground and the concrete together. The applicability of short duration thermal response testing for pile heat exchangers has been examined. Modelling and case study data has shown that the technique is only reliable for piles of 300 mm diameter or less. For the special case of large diameter piles with centrally placed heat <b>transfer</b> <b>pipes</b> then it is possible to use the test to determine the thermal conductivity of the pile concrete, but not pile thermal resistance.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the potential propagation of bacteriophage in biofilms of cheese starter cultures. It was hypothesized that the biofilms of the starter cultures may form in cheese and casein plants, perhaps in whey drain lines and become a reservoir and site of propagation of phage particles. Phage can infect and destroy the bulk starter cultures used for cheese production and this might cause a severe economic loss in the cheese manufacturing industry. Bacteriophage attacks against thermophilic dairy starter bacteria are now recognized as the main cause of slow or faulty fermentative production in dairy plants. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the starter cultures are capable of producing biofilms and to investigate the ability of phage to propagate inside them. The project was started by examination of attachment and biofilm formation by S. thermophilus, a common starter bacterium used for the manufacture of cheese. The initial experiments showed that these starter cultures have the capacity to attach and produce biofilms on stainless steel coupons at a temperature of 30 ºC, which showed that they were capable of attaching to the whey effluent lines in a cheese factory and thereby become potential sites for phage propagation. An experiment was conducted by infecting an existing biofilm with phage. The results showed that phage have the capacity to penetrate an existing biofilm matrix and produce an infection, causing the number of cells to decrease sharply. The results of this study has confirmed the fact that phage not only attack planktonic cultures, but have the ability to propagate in biofilms. The experiment was repeated, observing the fate of the cells in the biofilm over a prolonged duration. It was observed that the number of cells in the biofilm decreased with concomitant increase of phage numbers. However, over the period of observation, there remained viable cells in the biofilm. Therefore it is evident from this study that phage particles replicate within a biofilm, and thus biofilms are a potential reservoir of infection in cheese and casein plants. It is suggested that the incidence of phage in the cheese industry can be reduced by preventing the growth of biofilms in whey and casein <b>transfer</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|E

All three {{sections of}} pipe, ranging in length between 6 and 8 in., were received at the 222 -S Laboratory still in the pipe-in-pipe assembly. The annular spaces were filled with urethane foam injected into the pipes for as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) purposes. The 3 -in. primary <b>transfer</b> <b>pipes</b> were first separated from the outer encasement, 6 -in. pipes. The pipes were cut into small sections, or coupons, based upon {{the results of a}} non-destructive pipe wall thickness measurement which used an ultrasonic transducer. Following removal of the foam, the coupons were subjected to a series of analytical methods utilizing both optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to obtain erosion and corrosion information. The ultrasonic transducer analysis of the SN- 285 primary pipe did not show any thinned locations in the pipe wall which were outside the expected range for the 3 -in. schedule 40 pipe of 216 mils. A coupon was cut from the thinnest area on the pipe, and analysis of the inside surface, which was in contact with the tank waste, revealed a continuous layer of corrosion ~ 100 11 m (4 mils) thick under a semi-continuous layer of tank waste residue ~ 20 11 m (1 mil) thick. This residue layer was composed of an amorphous phase rich in chromium, magnesium, calcium, and chlorine. Small pits were detected throughout the inside pipe surface with depths up to ~ 50 11 m (2 mils). Similarly, the SN- 286 primary pipe did not show, by the ultrasonic transducer measurements, any thinned locations in the pipe wall which were outside the expected range for this pipe. Analysis of the coupon cut from the pipe section showed the presence of a tank waste layer containing sodium aluminate and phases rich in iron, calcium, and chromium. This layer was removed by a cleaning process that left a pipe surface continuous in iron oxide/hydroxide (corrosion) with pockets of aluminum oxide, possibly gibbsite. The corrosion layer was ~ 50 11 m (2 mil) thick over non-continuous pits less than ~ 50 11 m deep (2 mils). Small particles of aluminum oxide were also detected under the corrosion layer. The ultrasonic transducer analysis of SN- 278, like the previous primary pipes, did not reveal any noticeable thinning of the pipe wall. Analysis of the coupon cut from the pipe showed that the inside surface had a layer of tank waste residue that was partially detached from the pipe wall. This layer was easily scraped from the surface and was composed of two separate layers. The underlying layer was ~ 350 11 m (14 mils) thick and composed of a cementation of small aluminum oxide (probably gibbsite) particles. A thinner layer on top of the aluminum oxide layer was rich in carbon and chlorine. Scattered pitting was observed on the inside pipe surface with one pit as deep as 200 11 m (8 mils) ...|$|E
