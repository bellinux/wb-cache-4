5|$|Jordan's total {{foreign debt}} in 2012 was $22 billion, {{representing}} 72% of its GDP. In 2016, the debt reached $35.1 billion representing 90.6% of its GDP.

According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees have cost Jordan more than $2.5 billion a year, amounting to 6% of the GDP and 25% of the government's annual revenue.

30|$|We {{observe that}} holding cost of {{supplier}} is insensitive while that of manufacturer is less sensitive and of retailer is highly sensitive. From the table {{we note that}} if the holding cost of manufacturer increases then the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> also increases. This is true in reality because the manufacturer has to hold the item which it produces and thus the <b>total</b> <b>costing</b> of manufacturer increases and hence the <b>total</b> inventory <b>cost</b> increases. But, if the holding cost of retailer increases then the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> also decreases. This is because the demand of the retailer is price and stock dependent and so to optimize the retailer try to keep less stock thus the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> of the retailer decreases which in turn decreases the <b>total</b> <b>costing</b> of the inventory.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the early 1990s productions, the mid-1990s Disney animated features presented a trend of diminishing returns. Pocahontas, released in summer 1995, was a critical and commercial disappointment compared to its predecessors, earning $346 million worldwide while still winning two Academy Awards for its music by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. The next film, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), partially produced at the Paris studio, performed better critically and grossed $325 million worldwide. The following summer, Hercules, grossed $252 million worldwide and received positive reviews, but it was responsible for beginning the decline of traditional animated films. The declining box office success became doubly concerning inside the studio as wage competition from DreamWorks had significantly increased the studio's overhead, with production costs increasing from $79 million in <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> (production, marketing, and overhead) for The Lion King in 1994 to $179 million for Hercules three years later. Moreover, Disney depended upon the popularity of its new features {{in order to develop}} merchandising, theme park attractions, direct-to-video sequels, and television programming in its other divisions. The production schedule was scaled back, and a larger number of creative executives were hired to more closely supervise production, a move that was not popular among the animation staff.|$|E
