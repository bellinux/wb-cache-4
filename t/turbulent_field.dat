In order to predict the received boom signature, the wave front is searched for eigenrays after it has propagated to the receiver.

Advancing downstream, these regions change relative size with the ratio of the two jets' mass fluxes as the main parameter. The <b>turbulent</b> <b>field</b> of these flows is much more complicated due to the difference in the effective transport coefficients and turbulence level from region to region.

40|$|The {{problem of}} cosmic-ray {{scattering}} in the <b>turbulent</b> electromagnetic <b>fields</b> of {{the interstellar medium}} and the solar wind is of great importance due to the variety of applications of the resulting diffusion coefficients.

Here, an overview is given of the interaction processes of cosmic rays and <b>turbulent</b> electromagnetic <b>fields.</b> First, the formation of <b>turbulent</b> <b>fields</b> due to plasma instabilities is treated, where especially the non-linear behavior of the resulting unstable wave modes is discussed. Second, the analytical and the numerical side of high-energy particle propagation will be reviewed by presenting non-linear analytical theories and Monte-Carlo simulations.

40|$|A {{sonic boom}} {{signature}} {{with a long}} rise time {{has the ability to}} reduce the sonic boom, but it does not necessarily minimize the sonic boom at the ground level because of the real atmospheric turbulence. In this study, an effect of the turbulence on a long rise-time pressure signature was experimentally investigated in a ballistic range facility. To compare the effects of the turbulence on the long and short rise-time pressure signatures, a cone-cylinder projectile that simultaneously produces these pressure signatures was designed. The pressure waves interacted with a <b>turbulent</b> <b>field</b> generated by a circular nozzle. The turbulence effects were evaluated using flow diagnostic techniques: high-speed schlieren photography, a point-diffraction interferometer, and a pressure measurement. In {{spite of the fact that}} the long and short rise-time pressure signatures simultaneously travel through the <b>turbulent</b> <b>field,</b> the turbulence effects do not give the same contribution to these overpressures. Regarding the long rise-time pressure signature, the overpressure fluctuation due to the turbulence interaction is almost uniform, and a standard deviation 1. 5 times greater than that of the no-turbulence case is observed. By contrast, a short rise-time pressure signature which passed through the same <b>turbulent</b> <b>field</b> is strongly affected by the turbulence. A standard deviation increases by a factor of 14 because of the turbulence interaction. Additionally, there is a non-correlation between the overpressure fluctuations of the long and short rise-time pressure signatures. These results deduce that the length of the rise time is important to the turbulence effects such as the shock focusing/diffracting...|$|E
40|$|Frothers {{are used}} in {{flotation}} to aid generation of small bubbles, but {{little is known about}} the mechanisms that take place in the flotation machine to produce such an effect. Coalescence prevention is the common explanation, although the exact mechanism is obscure and almost no attention has been paid to a frother effect on bubble break-up, the other possible mechanism. This thesis presents a technique to study the effect of frothers on bubble coalescence at the generation stage (at a capillary tube) and a technique to study the effect of frothers on bubble coalescence and break-up in a <b>turbulent</b> <b>field.</b> The first technique is based on the sound bubbles emit when they form and coalesce. The sound signal was linked to bubble formation and coalescence events using high-speed cinematography. The technique has a resolution capable of detecting coalescence events that occur within 1 - 2 ms. The second technique allows discriminating between coalescence and break-up and is based on the exposure of a mono-size distribution of bubbles to a <b>turbulent</b> <b>field</b> generated by a three-bladed axial flow impeller. Analysis of bubble size distributions after contact with the <b>turbulent</b> <b>field</b> gives the coalescence and break-up fraction. The results show frothers reduce coalescence and alter the bubble size distribution of bubbles generated by break-up. In the course of high-speed imaging an effect of frother on bubble shape and motion after formation was detected. Analysis of this forms the third major component of the work. A dependence of velocity on bubble aspect ratio is shown, which is in line with recent literature...|$|E
40|$|Turbulent {{phenomena}} {{are found}} in both natural (e. g. the Earth's oceans, the Sun's corona) and artificial (e. g. flows through pipes, the plasma in a tokamak device) settings; evidence suggests that turbulence is usually the normal behaviour in most cases. Turbulence has been studied extensively {{for more than a}} century, but a complete and consistent theoretical description of it has not yet been proposed. It is in this context that the motion of particles under the influence of <b>turbulent</b> <b>fields</b> is studied in this work, with direct numerical simulations. The thesis is structured in three main parts. The first part describes the tools that are used. Methods of integrating particle trajectories are presented, together with a discussion of the properties that these methods should have. The simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is discussed, while also introducing fundamental concepts of fluid turbulence. Particle trajectory integration requires information that is not readily available from simulations of turbulent flows, so the interpolation methods needed to adapt the fluid simulation results are constructed as well. The second part is dedicated to the study of two MHD problems. Simulations of Kolmogorov flow in incompressible MHD are presented and discussed, and also simulations of the dynamo effect in compressible MHD. These two scenarios are chosen because large scale structures are formed spontaneously by the turbulent flow, and there is an interest in studying particle transport in the presence of structures. Studies of particle transport are discussed in the third part. The properties of the overall approach are first analyzed in detail, for stationary predefined fields. Focus is placed on the qualitative properties of the different methods presented. Charged article transport in frozen <b>turbulent</b> <b>fields</b> is then studied. Results concerning transport of particles in fully developed, time-evolving, <b>turbulent</b> <b>fields</b> are presented in the final chapter. en Sciencesinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{develop a}} robust plume {{tracking}} strategy using mobile sensor networks in three dimensional (3 D) fields. Inspired by the plume tracking behavior of blue crabs, we propose a stochastic model of plume spikes detected by sensing agents {{based on the}} Poisson counting process, which enables us to transform the <b>turbulent</b> plume <b>field</b> detected by sensing agents to a continuously-differential field, the minimum of which is considered as a source in the field, and shares the same location with the plume source. The transformation allows us to design and analyze source-seeking algorithms in smooth fields instead of in <b>turbulent</b> <b>fields</b> with higher fluctuation spatially and temporally. Inspired by fish schools that seek darker (shaded) regions in environments with complex lighting variations, we develop a distributed source-seeking algorithm using mobile sensor networks without explicit gradient esti-mation. The velocity of each agent is designed using only the measurements taken by the agent and the relative positions to its neighboring agents. We prove that, using this design, the moving direction of a three-agent group will converge to the opposite gradient direction of the field, thus, the group moves towards a source in the field. We also prove that the tracking system is input-to-state stable (ISS), indicating {{that the system is}} robust to disturbances. We then generalize the design to N-agent groups, and demonstrate the strategy in both smooth <b>fields</b> and <b>turbulent</b> <b>fields</b> in simulations. I...|$|R
40|$|By {{considering}} the Reynolds stress equations {{as a possible}} descriptor of complex <b>turbulent</b> <b>fields,</b> pressure-velocity interaction and turbulence dissipation are studied as two of the main physical contributions to Reynolds stress balancing in <b>turbulent</b> flow <b>fields.</b> It is proven that the pressure interaction term contains turbulence generation elements. However, the usual 'return to isotropy' element appears more weakly than in the standard models. In addition, convection-like elements are discovered mathematically, {{but there is no}} mathematical evidence that the pressure fluctuations contribute to the turbulent transport mechanism. Calculations of some simple one-dimensional fields indicate that this extra convection, rather than the turbulent transport, is needed mathematically. Similarly, an expression for the turbulence dissipation is developed. The end result is a dynamic equation for the dissipation tensor which is based on the tensorial length scales...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of high-energy cosmic rays through giant molecular clouds constitutes a fundamental process in astronomy and astrophysics. The diffusion of cosmic-rays through these magnetically turbulent environments is often studied {{through the use}} of energy-dependent diffusion coefficients, although these are not always well motivated theoretically. Now, however, it is feasible to perform detailed numerical simulations of the diffusion process computationally. While the general problem depends upon both the field structure and particle energy, the analysis may be greatly simplified by dimensionless analysis. That is, for a specified purely <b>turbulent</b> <b>field,</b> the analysis depends almost exclusively on a single parameter [...] the ratio of the maximum wavelength of the <b>turbulent</b> <b>field</b> cells to the particle gyration radius. For turbulent magnetic fluctuations superimposed over an underlying uniform magnetic field, particle diffusion depends on a second dimensionless parameter that characterizes the ratio of the turbulent to uniform magnetic field energy densities. We consider both of these possibilities and parametrize our results to provide simple quantitative expressions that suitably characterize the diffusion process within molecular cloud environments. Doing so, we find that the simple scaling laws often invoked by the high-energy astrophysics community to model cosmic-ray diffusion through such regions appear to be fairly robust for the case of a uniform magnetic field with a strong turbulent component, but are only valid up to ∼ 50 TeV particle energies for a purely <b>turbulent</b> <b>field.</b> These results have important consequences for the analysis of cosmic-ray processes based on TeV emission spectra associated with dense molecular clouds.
