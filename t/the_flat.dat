5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat, which was still in <b>the</b> <b>flat.</b> He found that her purse and keys were also at <b>the</b> <b>flat,</b> and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the South Glamorgan County Council leased {{the island}} for the next 99 years. In March 1995, the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50-year lease from the Crown Estate {{starting}} on 12 December 1995. Flat Holm is now designated as a Local Nature Reserve, as stipulated in that lease. It is managed by the Cardiff Council as <b>The</b> <b>Flat</b> Holm Project. The project team operates the Lewis Alexander, a boat which was purpose-built for the crossing to Flat Holm and which is able to carry up to 45 passengers and essential supplies to the island. The work of <b>the</b> <b>Flat</b> Holm Project {{is supported by the}} registered charity <b>the</b> <b>Flat</b> Holm Society.|$|E

25|$|The line then {{contains}} a large loop {{allowing it to}} turn from west-southwest to south-southeast, cross over the CSX tracks and travel along the east bank of <b>The</b> <b>Flats.</b> There are two stations in <b>The</b> <b>Flats,</b> Flats East Bank and Settlers Landing. In <b>The</b> <b>Flats</b> are three grade crossings, the only ones west of Shaker Square.|$|R
40|$|The design {{concept and}} {{configuration}} of <b>the</b> <b>Flatbed</b> transport aircraft are presented. <b>The</b> <b>Flatbed</b> configuration combines into one frame, {{the ability to}} haul cargo, virtually unrestrained by cross sectional dimensions of the fuselage. The feasibility and capability of <b>the</b> <b>Flatbed</b> is discussed in depth...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Flats</b> is {{surrounded}} by the neighborhoods of Arlington, South Shore, South Side Slopes, and across the Monongahela River, Bluff, Hazelwood, and South Oakland. East Carson Street runs the length of <b>the</b> <b>Flats,</b> and four bridges, Liberty Bridge, South 10th Street Bridge, Birmingham Bridge, and Hot Metal Bridge, connect <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> to other locations across the river.|$|R
5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp {{to head a}} {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> tax.|$|E
5|$|Speedy's, the {{sandwich}} shop below <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> used as Holmes' residence, reported a {{sharp rise in}} new customers who recognised it from the show.|$|E
5|$|The Starrs {{lived there}} until Epstein's {{accountant}} {{suggested that the}} group members should move to houses near his, in Esher. On 24July1965, Starr bought Sunny Heights for Â£30,000 ($72,000), on South Road, St George's Hill, but retained the lease on <b>the</b> <b>flat.</b> He rented <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> to The Fool, who were employed by Apple for various endeavours, such as painting the Apple Boutique in Baker Street, London, and designing psychedelic clothes for all four Beatles, as well as The Hollies, Marianne Faithfull, Procol Harum, Donovan, and Cream.|$|E
50|$|The {{land around}} <b>the</b> Kafue <b>Flats</b> are an {{important}} agricultural area in Zambia. As well as supporting {{a large number of}} subsistence and small-scale farmers, <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> are also a source of irrigation water for three large commercial farming operations concentrated around the eastern end of <b>the</b> <b>flats.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Flats</b> {{comprised}} {{three major}} areas: <b>the</b> upper <b>flats,</b> and <b>the</b> {{north and south}} lower <b>flats.</b> <b>The</b> houses on <b>the</b> upper <b>flats</b> were popular and in high demand {{because they were not}} affected by the flood waters in the spring. The upper and lower flats were separated by a cliff. Houses on <b>the</b> upper <b>flats</b> rented for about $15-20 a year, compared to <b>the</b> lower <b>flats</b> which ranged from $.50-2.00. Reaching <b>the</b> lower <b>flats</b> required a descent of 79 stairs. <b>The</b> upper <b>flats</b> had more room than <b>the</b> lower <b>flats,</b> comparatively. By 1885 <b>the</b> west side <b>flats</b> were covered with small, frame dwellings from the foot of 2 1/2 Street South to the foot of 20th Avenue South. By 1892 formal streets had appeared, which were named Wood, Cooper, and Mill reflecting the occupations of many of the residents.|$|R
5000|$|The Cuyahoga River splits <b>The</b> <b>Flats</b> in half {{where the}} two sides are {{referred}} to appropriately as the East Bank of <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> and <b>the</b> West Bank of <b>the</b> <b>Flats.</b> While <b>the</b> East Bank of <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> was once <b>the</b> popular nightlife district in Ohio, its demise in the early 2000s spurred a complete redevelopment where a majority of the existing buildings were demolished. In its place, an 8-story Aloft Hotel and a 21-story office tower were built. Restaurants, apartments, and a riverside promenade are planned for Phase II of this mixed-use project. [...] The West Bank of <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> contains <b>the</b> majority of the district's residential population, primary stemming from a set of apartments and condos known as Stonebridge. The areas also boasts bars, restaurants, jet ski rental, strip clubs, and, most recently, the home of the Greater Cleveland Aquarium.|$|R
5|$|The face is <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> {{vertical}} plane at the foremost {{edge of the}} muzzle (and of the entire piece).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flat</b> {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|The road {{runs along}} {{the west side of}} the Rock of Gibraltar, leading to <b>the</b> <b>Flat</b> Bastion fortification.|$|E
50|$|The centre {{included}} eight flats. While initially {{popular with}} some residents, <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> suffered from poorly constructed roofs and leaking walls. Only one tenant was left by March 1979 and <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> were later boarded up.|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> {{residents}} {{worked at}} the Heinrich Brewery {{at the south end}} or the Noerenberg Brewery (1870) {{at the north end of}} <b>the</b> <b>flats.</b> Others worked in the sawmills and flour mills farther upstream. The St. Paul and Pacific Railroad bridge (1887) and the original Washington Avenue bridge (1884) went over <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> with houses directly beneath. The residents of <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> were responsible for establishing churches in Northeast Minneapolis, Cedar-Riverside, and Prospect Park, and traveled to the city center and beyond for their jobs. Members of the community likely attended Americanization classes at nearby centers, such as the Pillsbury House in Cedar-Riverside or the Seven Corners Library.|$|R
5000|$|The {{legal status}} of a Tyneside <b>flat,</b> and <b>the</b> {{responsibilities}} between their landlords, is complicated by their interdependency. <b>The</b> upper <b>flat</b> shelters <b>the</b> lower <b>flat,</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>flat</b> supports <b>the</b> upper <b>flat.</b> This has led to specific legal schemes, known as Tyneside flat, criss-cross, or crossover lease arrangements.|$|R
5|$|There are few farms {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> route, as {{the soils}} {{in the region}} are very thin and underlain by a limestone bedrock.|$|E
5|$|Using Iraqi passports, Oan {{and three}} {{other members of the}} DRFLA arrived in London on 31 March 1980 and rented a flat in Earls Court. They claimed they had met by chance on the flight. The men {{typically}} returned to <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> drunk, late at night, and sometimes accompanied by prostitutes. Within a week, the housekeeper asked them to leave. They soon found another flat, where they told their new landlord they were moving because they had been joined by other men and required larger accommodation. Over the following days, the group swelled, with up to a dozen men in <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|After its completion, Winslow Ames {{used the}} house as a rental {{property}} until 1949 {{when he went to}} work in a museum in Springfield, Missouri. The house was sold to Connecticut College. Connecticut College continued to rent it to staff and students until 2004, when plans were made to demolish the house. Changing <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> roof to a gable roof was a significant alteration from the original plan; the date of the alteration is unknown, but it preceded 1995.|$|E
50|$|By {{this time}} St. Mary's on <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> was unfit for use, and Janietz {{obtained}} {{the use of}} the Franciscan Monastery Chapel, on Hazen St., for the Poles. In 1879 St. Mary's on <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> was practically abandoned.|$|R

50|$|In <b>the</b> 1940s, Maplewood <b>Flats</b> was {{inhabited}} by {{a community of}} squatters living in dilapidated cabins along the area's intertidal zone.

5|$|An {{important}} parameter {{determining the}} future {{evolution of the}} Universe theory is the density parameter, Omega (Î©), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether Î© is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, <b>the</b> <b>flat,</b> open and closed universes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} was {{a mobile}} pillbox {{that could be}} driven out onto the airfield. This {{was known as the}} Bison and consisted of a lorry with a concrete armoured cabin and a small concrete pillbox on <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> bed.|$|E
5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly shallows towards the south. This shallowing forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the magmatically inactive Pampean flat slab region farther south. This magmatic inactivity occurs because <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> slab removes the asthenospheric wedge.|$|E
50|$|Located in {{the east}} bank of <b>the</b> <b>Flats,</b> <b>the</b> 150-room Aloft Hotel by Starwood Properties opened in the summer 2013.

40|$|Distribution of Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, grubs and {{dispersal}} of an entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar âOswego' strain (an isolate from New York state), were examined for 5 wk within soil-filled flats containing grass. Japanese beetle grubs uniformly dispersed to all sections of <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> not infested with H. bacteriophora âOswego' strain. In flats infested with H. bacteriophora âOswego' strain, however, greater proportions of Japanese beetle grubs were recovered in sections near the nematode release site or center sections of <b>the</b> <b>flats.</b> H. bacteriophora âOswego' strain dispersed to all sections of <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> but dispersed more rapidly within <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> infested with Japanese beetle grubs than in flats not infested with Japanese beetle grub...|$|R
50|$|Hunslet's {{redevelopment}} in {{the late}} 1960s was perhaps most notable {{for the construction of}} <b>the</b> Hunslet Grange <b>Flats,</b> usually called informally <b>the</b> Leek Street <b>Flats.</b> Construction of <b>the</b> 2,500 <b>flats</b> started in 1968 following a widespread slum clearance project in <b>the</b> area. <b>The</b> <b>flats</b> were commissioned by Leeds City Council and constructed by Shepherd Building Group. <b>The</b> <b>flats</b> were built as a large complex, sprawling over much of Hunslet. While <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> enjoyed a degree of popularity in their first few years, this did not last, the layout of the complex and severe condensation lead to them being attributed to many health and social problems in the area, and only 13 years after construction began, in 1983, the council began to demolish the complex.|$|R
5|$|Be Reasonable is {{a monthly}} {{interview}} show that engages guests with ideas {{outside the mainstream}} scientific consensus, such {{as a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Flat</b> Earth Society. In the first episode, on 28 January 2013, hosts Hayley Stevens (until June 2014) and Michael Marshall described the show as an examination of their guests' beliefs and their structure, and the evidence they believe supports these beliefs. Guests have discussed past life therapy, aura photography and the presence of aliens on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Carboniferous Period (359â299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors.

5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by <b>the</b> <b>flat,</b> coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above {{the level of the}} cross.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Northbourne <b>Flats</b> {{are located}} {{on both sides of}} Northbourne Avenue in Braddon and Turner. <b>The</b> <b>flats</b> {{provided}} <b>the</b> first high-density housing project on Northbourne Avenue, now characterised by high-density living.

50|$|In <b>the</b> mid-1980s, <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> saw a {{resurgence}} as an entertainment destination, {{a focal point}} of the renewed attention given to Cleveland's deteriorating downtown. Underground music venues appeared on the East Bank, while mainstream development first took place on the West Bank. The Powerhouse, built to power the city's cable cars, was renovated to include multiple bars, restaurants, and an outdoor music venue. Other warehouses and buildings were also renovated into nightlife destinations. At its peak in the early 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> had <b>the</b> highest concentration of bars in the Midwest, with both locally owned bars and national restaurant chains lining both sides of the river from the mouth to the Oxbow bend. <b>The</b> <b>Flats</b> and Cleveland had soon become an entertainment mecca and destination for <b>the</b> region. <b>The</b> <b>Flats</b> Oxbow Association was formed to help redevelop <b>the</b> <b>Flats,</b> and housing development soon followed {{on both sides of the}} river, with new construction and warehouses being converted into condominiums and apartments.|$|R
