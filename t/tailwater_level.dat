The laboratory’s hydraulic circuit {{is equipped with a}} reserve line enabling independent standing models of hydro-technical structures to be connected. Two interactive instructional models are designed for this laboratory. The first is a model of a concrete dam. The dam is equipped with one bottom outlet, a hydraulic power plant and an emergency spillway crest gate. The discharge part of the model is equipped with a downflow baffle for regulating the <b>tailwater</b> <b>level</b> and a measuring weir enabling the flow rate to be measured at the discharge point from the model. The total capacity of the model is 10 l/s. The second model is a model of a weir structure. The weir structure consists of a controlled segment sluice gate weir composed of three sections. The model includes a one-nave lock chamber and hydraulic power plant. The <b>tailwater</b> <b>level</b> can also be regulated using a downflow baffle. The total capacity of this model is 20 l/s. The models can be used for teaching the subjects of hydraulics, hydrology and hydro-technical structures.

The physical model included the spillway, the chute, the stilling basin and about 220 ft of the channel downstream. The model was built at a scale of 1 : 16. Three series of tests were conducted in this model study. The first test series were conducted under the probable maximum flood condition with two tailwater levels, and under the standard probable flood condition with one <b>tailwater</b> <b>level.</b> The test results showed that the maximum velocity is about 10 fps and occurs downstream of the stilling basin on the flat section and the section with an adverse slope of 20 %.

The second test series were to examine the possibility of washing the existing backfill out of the stilling basin under the above flow conditions.

Purposes of the test were (1) to establish design criteria for high-head Francis-type turbines that will provide optimum fish passage, and (2) to establish the best method of operating existing Kaplan- and Francis-type turbines that will provide maximum survival of fish under prevailing conditions. Tests at Allis-Chalmers 2 ̆ 7 Hydraulic Laboratory, York, Pennsylvania, using 12 -inch diameter model turbines, demonstrated that mortality among fish passing through a model was of appropriate magnitude to allow comparative studies of mortality in various model installations, that mortality was greatly influenced by turbine operating conditions (efficiency) and relationship of tailwater elevation to runner setting, and that increased clearances in the water passageways reduced mortality if turbine efficiency could be maintained.

The last few decades have seen the {{development}} of new construction materials, design techniques and applications: e. g., embankment overtopping protection systems. Although it is commonly acknowledged that free-surface aeration is significant in stepped chutes, experimental data are scarce, often limited to very steep slopes (a ~ 50 º).

40|$|Abstract: A {{surprising}} hiatus affects fish {{research and}} management. Those of us working in fish passage strive to move fish past barriers. Aquaculturists, {{on the other}} hand, move fish around fish farms safely and effectively. Marrying these two approaches presents an exciting opportunity for fishway development. Millions of fish-passage barriers remain in rivers globally, together with many under-performing and costly fishway investments, resulting in declining biodiversity and production of freshwater fish. Better approaches to fishway design are urgently needed to aid in halting this worldwide loss of connectivity. Multidisciplinary work at UNSW Australia aims to refine and test a pump fishway. This novel concept integrates technologies from fish passage and aquaculture to improve fishway performance and reduce costs. Fishways knowledge is being combined with pumping techniques routinely used in aquaculture to safely transport large biomasses of fish from across a broad size range. The pump fishway uses a helical fishway section to provide sufficient elevation for fish to be gravitated into a transfer chamber, which is then pressurized with water piped from the reservoir. This flow carries fish up a rising transfer pipe and a small auxiliary pump finally delivers fish into the reservoir. A pump fishway offers many potential benefits: effective upstream passage for migrant fish communities; lightweight, modular construction with few moving parts; applicability to diverse sites and barriers 3 ̆e 1. 5 m high; energy-independence using hydraulic power from the reservoir to drive the system; continuous operation with brief transfer cycles; and potential barge-mounted use providing mobility, flood protection and fewer constraints due to <b>tailwater</b> <b>levels.</b> Large savings on capital and operating costs are predicted.

40|$|In dams {{with low}} <b>tailwater</b> <b>levels,</b> the {{hydraulic}} jump may not {{occur on the}} protected apron. This {{could result in a}} severe local scour on the downstream river bed which could endanger the safety of the dam. A traditional solution is to place crushed rock in the scour hole to prevent further scour; however, this method is not a permanent solution. The focus of this research is to investigate the effect, on the scour profile, of installing a secondary stilling basin downstream of the primary basin. This results in a dual stilling basin. The primary stilling basin is the original inadequate basin while the secondary stilling basin provides for the additional energy dissipation required to prevent excessive scouring in the river bed. In this research, the physical model of the Shand Dam was used as a case study. A 1 : 49 scale model of the Shand Dam was constructed in a 4. 9 m long by 3. 0 m wide by 0. 8 m deep basin in the Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory (B 03, Essex Hall) at the University of Windsor. Experimental work was carried out for various flows and end sill configurations in the secondary stilling basin. It was observed that within a few minutes a scour hole formed close to the structure; this {{is referred to as the}} short-term scour. A long-term scour formed farther from structure and increased by time. All the scour tests were conducted for half an hour to study short-term and long-term scour. Scour depths were measured at 56 points. From the scour profiles the best end sill slope to get minimum scour far from the structure was determined. Velocities were measured at selected locations at 0. 2, 0. 5 and 0. 8 of the depth within the secondary stilling basin and above the end sill. Pressure values at different points on the secondary stilling basin were recorded with a data acquisition system. Spatial correlations in both longitudinal and lateral directions were determined in order to establish dynamic loading on the floor of the secondary basin.

In recent decades, several researchers have developed new strategies and methodologies to control the scour morphology, including different jet arrangements and structures located in the stilling basin.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the generalized design rules for a new stilling basin for use with the straight drop spillway. This generalized stilling basin design was developed because experience in the field had shown that there was no satisfactory stilling basin for the straight drop spillway. However, limited field experience indicates that this new design will adequately protect the downstream channel from scour. Water falling over the spillway crest falls onto a flat apron. The nappe is broken up by floor blocks, which also prevent damaging scour of the downstream channel banks. Scour of the downstream channel bed is prevented by an end still. Flaring wingwalls, triangular in elevation, prevent erosion of the dam fill. For proper operation of the stilling basin, the contraction of the flow at the ends of the spillway opening must be partially suppressed. The stilling basin can be used {{for a wide range of}} discharge, head on the crest, crest length, height of drop, and downstream <b>tailwater</b> <b>level.</b> An important finding is that the stilling basin length computed for the minimum tailwater levels. Dangerous scour of the downstream channel may occur if the nappe is supported sufficiently by high tailwater so that it lands beyond the end of the stilling basin.

Furthermore, successive studies analyzed the erosive process due to multiple jets. The analysis of the scour process was conducted in the presence of both vertical and symmetric crossing jets. It has been experimentally proven that these two geometric configurations, in most of hydraulic conditions, determine a reduction of the scour hole lengths. Nevertheless, the scour process due to crossing jets is a complex phenomenon, as it depends on many parameters, including the crossing angles and the distance of the jet crossing point from the stilling basin water surface. To the authors’ knowledge, no studies are present in literature dealing with vertical crossing jets of different diameters. Therefore, a dedicated experimental apparatus is built in order to simulate two vertical crossing jets with different diameters. Experimental tests are conducted for different tailwater levels with different jet diameter ratios. The resulting morphology is compared with that due to a single plunging jet. This last configuration is obtained simply removing the pipe with smaller diameter from the experimental apparatus. The comparison is conducted in order to understand for which geometric configurations the presence of the smaller diameter jet becomes negligible in terms of scour hole characteristics...|$|E
