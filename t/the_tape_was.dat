5|$|The Skanska case {{occurred}} during Kirchner's presidency, during which {{several members of}} de Vido's ministry were accused of bribery in requests for tender for pipeline construction, based on a tape recording of Skanska employees discussing the bribes. The case was closed in 2011, when it was ruled that <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> not acceptable evidence {{and there was no}} overpricing. It was reopened in 2016 (with Cristina Kirchner out of the government), and <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> accepted as evidence.|$|E

Van der Sloot indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E

50|$|He was {{commissioned}} between 1992 and 1993 to help Princess Diana to develop her public speaking voice, having {{been introduced to}} her by her personal fitness instructor, Carolan Brown. Settelen video taped Diana talking about her private life.

5|$|Copies were {{leaked to}} the press via a Dutch news agency during the 1983 general {{election}} campaign. The U.S. State Department and British Government believed the tape to be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the tape and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E
5|$|During {{their brief}} existence, Wicked Lester {{performed}} in public twice. The first show {{took place at}} the Rivoli Theatre in South Fallsburg, New York on April 23, 1971. The second, in late summer 1971, was at an Atlantic City, New Jersey hotel hosting a B'nai B'rith Youth Organization event. Not long after that show, the band suffered a major setback when they had all of their musical gear stolen. After a chance meeting with Electric Lady Studios engineer Ron Johnsen, Wicked Lester was given the opportunity to record some demos in late 1971. Johnsen, who produced the demo tape, shopped it to a few labels, with no success. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> screened by Epic Records, who purchased the masters and agreed to fund the recording of a full album. One of the conditions, however, was that Stephen Coronel be fired and replaced with a better guitarist.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} model is {{provided for the}} peeling of a tape from a surface to which it adheres through cohesive tractions. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be a}} membrane without bending stiffness and is initially attached everywhere to a flat rigid surface. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> assumed to deform in plane strain, and finite deformations in the form of elastic strains are accounted for. The cohesive tractions are taken to <b>be</b> uniform when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> within a critical interaction distance from the substrate and then to fall immediately to zero once this critical interaction distance is exceeded. When the distance between <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and <b>the</b> substrate <b>is</b> zero, repulsive and attractive tractions balance to zero; in this segment, sliding of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> relative to <b>the</b> substrate is forbidden when we pull <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> up somewhere in the middle, though we permit such sliding when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> peeled from one end. In the cohesive zone and where <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> detached, <b>the</b> interaction of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> with <b>the</b> substrate <b>is</b> frictionless. Results are given for the force to peel a neo-Hookean tape at any angle up to vertical when one end of it is pulled away from the substrate, as well as for scenarios when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> lifted somewhere in the middle to form a V shape being pulled away from the substrate...|$|R

5|$|In 2007, {{analysis}} of an audio tape {{recording of the}} shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag, that thirteen shots were fired, even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds. Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible. The presence of more than eight shots on <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen, Denmark, and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Some other acoustic experts, however, have stated that no more than eight shots were recorded on the audio tape.|$|E

25|$|The main {{contention}} of Anderson's appeal {{is that a}} secret, illegally recorded tape of him discussing Bonds' steroid use {{was the basis for}} the grand jury questions he refused to answer. Prosecutors, however, said <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> legal and was made in a face-to-face meeting with Anderson. Although Judge Alsup dismissed Anderson's tape claim and others, the 9th Circuit Court sent Anderson's appeal back to the judge, saying Alsup's ruling regarding <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> not clear enough. In clarifying his order, Alsup said he agreed with prosecutors that there was ample evidence beyond the tape to question Anderson. Prosecutors also said the questions they wanted answered were based on athletes' secret testimony in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case and a search of Anderson's house that turned up drug records, some with Bonds' name on it. Other than the tape dispute, the 9th Circuit Court had rejected the merits of Anderson's appeal.|$|E

25|$|This {{operation}} was exposed by ISI when it obtained a VHS tape containing the conversation between two former army officers and {{former members of}} ISI, from the Intelligence Bureau (IB). <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> confiscated by ISI director-general Lieutenant-General Shamsur Rahman Kallu, who showed it to Benazir the next day.

Though the Brigadier failed to prove General Beg's involvement, General Mirza, on the other hand, sharply denied the accusation and started a full-fledged courts martial of these officers, with Benazir being the civilian judge of JAG Branch to proceed the hearings. The officers were removed from their positions and placed at Adiala military correctional institute in 1989. The officers were released from the military correctional institute by order of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Mascis {{listened to}} classic rock {{artists such as}} the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, {{elements}} of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound. In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr.'s members also combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock in their songs, which often featured {{a large amount of}} feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the master tape of You're Living All Over Me arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was the way he wanted the album to sound. To accentuate their use of volume, the band employed and popularised the quiet–loud change of dynamic in many of its songs, a technique that would be later popularised by Pixies, Nirvana and alternative rock in general during the 1990s.|$|E
