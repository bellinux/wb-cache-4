40|$|Bacteria in the biofilm mode {{of growth}} are {{protected}} against chemical and mechanical stresses. Biofilms are composed, {{for the most}} part, of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The extracellular matrix is composed of different chemical constituents, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular DNA (eDNA). Here we aimed to identify the roles of different matrix constituents in the viscoelastic response of biofilms. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown under different conditions yielding distinct matrix chemistries. Next, biofilms were subjected to mechanical deformation and stress relaxation was monitored over time. A Maxwell model possessing an average of four elements for an individual biofilm was used to fit the data. Maxwell elements were defined by a relaxation time constant and their relative importance. Relaxation time constants varied widely over the 104 biofilms included and were divided into seven ranges (500 s). Principal-component analysis was carried out to eliminate related time constant ranges, yielding three principal components that {{could be related to}} the known matrix chemistries. The fastest relaxation component (IMPORTANCE The protection offered by biofilms to organisms that inhabit it against chemical and mechanical stresses {{is due in part to}} its matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) in which biofilm organisms embed themselves. Mechanical stresses lead to deformation and possible detachment of biofilm organisms, and hence, rearrangement processes occur in a biofilm to relieve it from these stresses. Maxwell analysis of stress relaxation allows the determination of characteristic relaxation time constants, but the biofilm components and matrix constituents associated with different stress relaxation processes have never been identified. Here we grew biofilms with different matrix constituents and used principal-component analysis to reveal that the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, together with the absence of bacteria, is associated with the fastest relaxation, while other EPSs control a second, slower relaxation. Extracellular DNA, as a matrix constituent, had a distinguishable role with its own unique principal component in stress relaxation with a <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> <b>range</b> between those of other EPSs. ...|$|E

It was found that parasitic current collection was insignificant (0. 3 percent of the solar array delivered power). The measured arcing threshold ranged from - 210 to - 457 V with respect to the plasma potential. Furthermore, the dynamic response of the panels showed the panel <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> to <b>range</b> between 1 and 5 microsec, and the panel capacitance to be between. 01 and. 02 microF...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the turtle has a consensual pupillary light response (cPLR), and if so, to compare it to its direct pupillary light response (dPLR). One eye was illuminated with different intensities of light over a four log range while keeping the other eye in darkness. In the eye directly illuminated, pupil diameter was reduced by as much as ∼ 31 %. In the eye not stimulated by light, pupil diameter was also reduced but less to ∼ 11 %. When compared to the directly illuminated eye, this generated a ratio, cPLR–dPLR, equal to 0. 35. Ratio of slopes for log/linear fits to plots of pupil changes versus retinal irradiance for non-illuminated (− 1. 27) to illuminated (− 3. 94) eyes closely matched at 0. 32. cPLR had <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 60 to 1. 20 min; however, they were comparable and not statistically different from those of the dPLR, which ranged from 1. 41 to 2. 00 min. Application of mydriatic drugs to the directly illuminated eye also supported presence of a cPLR. Drugs reduced pupil constriction by ∼ 9 % for the dPLR and slowed its <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> to 9. 58 min while simultaneous enhancing constriction by ∼ 6 % for the cPLR. <b>Time</b> <b>constant</b> for the cPLR at 1. 75 min, however, was not changed. Results support that turtle possesses a cPLR although less strong than its dPLR...|$|R
5000|$|Augmentation is {{differentiated}} {{from the}} three other components of enhancement by its <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> of decay. This is shown in Table 1 where {{the first and second}} components of facilitation, F1 and F2, decay with <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> of about 50 and 300 ms, and potentiation, P, decays with a <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> than <b>ranges</b> from tens of seconds to minutes depending on the duration of stimulation. Also included in the table are two components of depression D1 and D2, along with their associated decay <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> of recovery decay back to normal. Depression at some synapses may arise from depletion of synaptic vesicles available for release. Depression of synaptic vesicle release may mask augmentation because of overlapping time courses. Also included in the table is the fraction change in transmitter release arising from one impulse. A magnitude of 0.8 would increase transmitter release 80%.|$|R
40|$|Random {{telegraph}} noise (RTN) measurements are typically {{carried out at}} the device level using standard probe station based electrical characterization setup, where the measured current represents a cumulative effect of the simultaneous response of electron capture/emission events at multiple oxygen vacancy defect (trap) sites. To better characterize the individual defects in the high-j dielectric thin film, we propose and demonstrate here the measurement and analysis of RTN at the nanoscale using a room temperature scanning tunneling microscope setup, with an effective area of interaction of the probe tip that is as small as 10 nm in diameter. Two-level and multi-level RTN signals due to single and multiple defect locations (possibly dispersed in space and energy) are observed on 4 nm HfO 2 thin films deposited on n-Si (100) substrate. The RTN signals are statis- tically analyzed using the Factorial Hidden Markov Model technique to decode the noise contribu- tion {{of more than one}} defect (if any) and estimate the statistical parameters of each RTN signal (i. e., amplitude of fluctuation, capture and emission <b>time</b> <b>constants).</b> Observation of RTN at the nanoscale presents a new opportunity for studies on defect chemistry, single-defect kinetics and their stochastics in thin film dielectric materials. This method allows us to characterize the fast traps with <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> <b>ranging</b> in the millisecond to tens of seconds range...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{processes}} are determined the energy consumption of cooling and air conditioning. The research was realised in field {{of theory and}} practice. Measuring on a specific chilled ceeling has shown a <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> in <b>range</b> of a few minutes. The simulation of cooling load has shown a higher <b>time</b> <b>constant.</b> So it's possible to cut the simulation into simulation of chilled ceeling and cooling load. The simulated cooling of porks come to the result, that the <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> is {{in the field of}} a few hours. Because of that, it is possible to separate the simulation of freezing and the cooling equipment. (orig.)

40|$|We {{describe}} a puffing method for changing solutions near one surface of lipid bilayers that allows simultaneous measurement of channel activity {{and extent of}} solution change at the bilayer surface. Ion adsorption to the lipid headgroups and screening of the bilayer surface charge by mobile ions provided a convenient probe for the ionic composition of the solution at the bilayer surface. Rapid ionic changes induced a shift in bilayer surface potential that generated a capacitive transient current under voltage-clamp conditions. This depended on the ion species and bilayer composition and was accurately described by the Stern-Gouy-Chapman theory. The time course of solute concentrations during solution changes could also be modeled by an exponential exchange of bath and puffing solutions with <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> <b>ranging</b> from 20 to 110 ms depending on the flow pressure. During changes in [Cs+] and [Ca 2 +] (applied separately or together) both the mixing model and capacitive currents predicted [Cs+] and [Ca 2 +] transients consistent with those determined experimentally from: 1) the known Cs(+) -dependent conductance of open ryanodine receptor channels and 2) the Ca(2 +) -dependent gating of ryanodine receptor Ca 2 + channels from cardiac and skeletal muscle...|$|R
