25|$|TK1 is {{synthesized}} by {{the cell}} during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly {{and does not}} pass to body fluids after normal cell division. There is a feed-back regulation of the action of thymidine kinase in the cell: <b>thymidine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (TTP), {{the product of the}} further phosphorylation of thymidine, acts as an inhibitor to thymidine kinase. This serves to maintain a balanced amount of TTP available for nucleic acid synthesis, not oversaturating the system. 5'-Aminothymidine, a non-toxic analogue of thymidine, interferes with this regulatory mechanism and thereby increases the cytotoxicity of thymidine analogues used as antineoplastic drugs. The reaction kinetics of thymidine and thymidine analogues phosphorylation is complicated and only partly known. The overall phosphorylation of thymidine to <b>thymidine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the various phosphates of thymidine and uridine interfere with the phosphorylation of each other.

25|$|Thymidine monophosphate is also {{produced}} by the cell in a different reaction by methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate, a product of other metabolic pathways unrelated to thymidine, by the enzyme thymidylate synthase. The second route is sufficient to supply thymidine monophosphate for DNA repair. When a cell prepares to divide, a complete new set-up of DNA is required, and the requirement for building blocks, including <b>thymidine</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> increases. Cells prepare for cell division by making some of the enzymes required during the division. They are not normally present in the cells and are downregulated and degraded afterwards. Such enzymes are called salvage enzymes. Thymidine kinase 1 is such a salvage enzyme, whereas thymidine kinase 2 and thymidylate synthase are not cell cycle-dependent.|$|E

Thymidine kinase {{activity is}} best with deoxyadenosine triphosphate or deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) as the phosphoryl donor, whereas the best deoxyadenosine kinase activity is obtained with dGTP or adenosine triphosphate. Deoxyguanosine kinase activity functions optimally with deoxycytidine triphosphate as the donor. Although the thymidine kinase activity of crude extracts {{does not have}} a demonstrable divalent cation requirement, the addition of Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + is necessary for the formation of <b>thymidine</b> di- and <b>triphosphates.</b> The synthesis of thymidine kinase appears to be partially derepressed by thymine starvation. Incubation of extracts with deoxyadenosine and dGTP results in the substantial accumulation of deoxyadenosine di- and triphosphates.

40|$|Several unique {{proteins}} {{accumulate in}} soybean (Glycine max) leaves when the developing fruits are removed. In the present study, {{elevated levels of}} nucleotide pyrophosphatase and phosphodiesterase I activities were present in leaves of defruited soybean plants. The soluble enzyme catalyzing these reactions was purified nearly 1000 -fold, producing a preparation that contained a single 72 -kD polypeptide. The molecular mass of the holoenzyme was approximately 560 kD, indicating that the native enzyme was likely octameric. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed nucleotide-sugars, nucleotide di- and <b>triphosphates,</b> <b>thymidine</b> monophosphate p-nitrophenol, and inorganic pyrophosphate but not nucleotide monophosphates, sugar mono- and bisphosphates, or NADH. The subunit and holoenzyme molecular masses and the preference for substrates distinguish the soybean leaf nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase I from other plant nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase I enzymes. Also, the N-terminal sequence of the soybean leaf enzyme exhibited no similarity to the mammalian nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase I, soybean vegetative storage proteins, or other entries in the data bank. Thus, the soybean leaf nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase I {{appears to be a}} heretofore undescribed protein that is physically and enzymatically distinct from nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase I from other sources, as well as from other phosphohydrolytic enzymes that accumulate in soybean leaves in response to fruit removal...|$|R

25|$|Early {{long-term}} higher-dose {{therapy with}} AZT was initially associated with side effects that sometimes limited therapy, including anemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy.

Anemia due to AZT was successfully treated using erythropoetin to stimulate red blood cell production. Drugs that inhibit hepatic glucuronidation, such as indomethacin, nordazepam, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and trimethoprim decreased the elimination rate and increased the therapeutic strength of the medication.

25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via reverse transcription and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (<b>thymidine</b> <b>triphosphate))</b> are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E

Extensive metabolism {{is a prerequisite for}} conversion of these pyrimidine prodrugs into active compounds. Interindividual variation in the activity of metabolising enzymes can affect the extent of prodrug activation and, as a result, act on the efficacy of chemotherapy treatment. Genetic factors at least partly explain interindividual variation in antitumour efficacy and toxicity of pyrimidine antagonists. In this review, proteins relevant for the efficacy and toxicity of pyrimidine antagonists will be summarised. In addition, the role of germline polymorphisms, tumour-specific somatic mutations and protein expression levels in the metabolic pathways and clinical pharmacology of these drugs are described. Germline polymorphisms of uridine monophosphate kinase (UMPK), orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT), thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and gene expression levels of OPRT, UMPK, TS, DPD, uridine phosphorylase, uridine kinase, thymidine phosphorylase, <b>thymidine</b> kinase, deoxyuridine <b>triphosphate</b> nucleotide hydrolase are discussed in relation to 5 -FU efficacy.

40|$|To {{examine the}} concept of {{polymerase}} active site tightness as a criteria for DNA polymerase fidelity, we performed pre-steady- state single nucleotide incorporation kinetic analyses with sugar modified <b>thymidine</b> 5 '- <b>triphosphate</b> (TTP) analogues and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1) reverse transcriptase (RT). The employed TTP analogues (TTP) are modified at the 4 '- position of the sugar moiety with alkyl groups, gradually expanding their steric demand. Introduction of a methyl group reduces the maximum rate of nucleotide incorporation by about 200 -fold for RTWT and about 400 -fold for RTM 184 V. Interestingly, the affinity of RT for the modified nucleotide is only marginally affected. Increasing the size to an ethyl group leads to further reduction of the rate of incorporation and first effects on binding affinities are observed. Finally, substitution for an isopropyl group results not only in a further reduction of I. incorporation rates but also in a dramatic loss of bin,ding affinity for the nucleotide analogue. By increasing the steric demand the effects on RTM 184 V in comparison with RTWT become progressively more pronounced. Mis- incorporation of either TTP or (TTP) -T-Me opposite a template G causes additional decline in incorporation rates accompanied by a drastic decrease in binding affinities. This results in relative incorporation efficiencies [(k(pol) /K- d) (incorrect) /(k(pol) /K-d) (TTPcorrect) ] of of 4. 1 X 10 (- 5) for TTP and 3. 4 X 10 (- 6) for (TTP) -T-Me in case of RTWT and 1. 4 X 10 (- 5) for TTP and 2. 9 X 10 (- 8) for (TTP) -T-Me in case of RTM 184 V...|$|R

In vitro, {{the incorporation of}} radioactive <b>thymidine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> into acid-insoluble material is dependent upon {{the presence of the}} enzyme, all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, Mg 2 +, and a DNA template. Incorporation occurs on native, alkali-denatured, and strictly double-stranded DNA. The in vitro synthesized product is a polydeoxynucleotide with a chain length shorter than the template; it has the same buoyant density as wheat embryo DNA when this DNA is used as template; and it forms a double-stranded complex with the DNA template. These data suggest that the in vitro DNA synthesis catalyzed by proteins extracted from wheat embryos occurs in a semiconservative way...|$|E
