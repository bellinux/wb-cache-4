25|$|The {{ignition}} coil {{consists of two}} <b>transformer</b> <b>windings</b> — the primary and secondary. These windings share a common magnetic core.

25|$|Based on the Mark 1 {{bodyshell}} design, the Class 303 units utilised electrical gear made by Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick). The Class 303s {{were originally}} dual voltage - {{parts of the}} North Clyde Line and Cathcart Circle electrification was limited to 6.25 kV (rather than the standard 25 kV arrangement) due to limitations in insulation technology, although this feature was rendered redundant as 25 kV was eventually standardised across the entire line. Following a series of transformer explosions, caused by damage to the <b>transformer</b> <b>windings</b> from backfires in the mercury arc rectifiers, the entire stock of Class 303s had to be hastily withdrawn from service {{after only a few}} weeks' service. The old steam-operated service was temporarily reinstated whilst urgent modifications were made. This also delayed the handing over of the Cathcart Circle service to electric operation.|$|E

40|$|Power {{transformers}} are {{an integral}} part of almost all electrical transmission and distribution networks. Their reliable service is of the utmost importance in modern society which is dependent on a constant electricity supply. There are a range of factors that can hinder the operation of a power transformer. This dissertation presents the results of investigations into one of these factors through an analysis of the effect that direct current has on the operational characteristics of a power transformer. There are a host of adverse effects that can accompany the presence of a direct current in a <b>transformer's</b> <b>windings.</b> The predominant effect that is witnessed is half cycle saturation. This leads to increased harmonic distortion, increased reactive power losses, overheating and elevated acoustic noise emissions. Direct current can be found in a <b>transformer's</b> <b>windings</b> as a result of imperfections in connected equipment and also due to magnetic disturbances of the earth's field. Tests conducted indicate that personal computers are a potentially significant source of DC when a large number of units are connected to a common point of coupling. Similarly the possibility exists for AC and DC induction motor drives to contribute sizeable quantities of DC Bias...|$|R

25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the <b>transformer</b> <b>windings.</b>|$|E
500|$|The circuit shown {{consists}} of two stages of amplifier in common emitter topology. [...] The bias resistors all serve their usual functions. [...] The input of the first stage is coupled in the conventional way with a series capacitor to avoid affecting the bias.

500|$|A further {{detail that}} {{may be seen in}} this kind of {{amplifier}} is the presence of taps on the <b>transformer</b> <b>windings.</b> [...] These are used for the input and output connections of the transformer rather than the top of the windings. [...] This is done for impedance matching purposes; bipolar junction transistor amplifiers (the kind shown in the circuit) have a quite high output impedance and a quite low input impedance.

2500|$|For a given load, sizing of a {{smoothing}} capacitor is a tradeoff between reducing ripple voltage and increasing ripple current. The peak current is {{set by the}} rate of rise of the supply voltage on the rising edge of the incoming sine-wave, reduced by {{the resistance of the}} <b>transformer</b> <b>windings.</b> [...] High ripple currents increase I2R losses (in the form of heat) in the capacitor, rectifier and <b>transformer</b> <b>windings,</b> and may exceed the ampacity of the components or VA rating of the transformer. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers specify the maximum capacitance of the input capacitor, and SS diode rectifiers also have current limitations. [...] Capacitors for this application need low ESR, or ripple current may overheat them. [...] To limit ripple voltage to a specified value the required capacitor size is proportional to the load current and inversely proportional to the supply frequency and the number of output peaks of the rectifier per input cycle. Full-wave rectified output requires a smaller capacitor because it is double the frequency of half-wave rectified output. [...] To reduce ripple to a satisfactory limit with just a single capacitor would often require a capacitor that's infeasibly large.|$|E
2500|$|Conversion ratio (also called [...] "rectification ratio", and confusingly, [...] "efficiency") η {{is defined}} as the ratio of DC output power to the input power from the AC supply. [...] Even with ideal rectifiers, the ratio is less than 100% because some of the output power is AC power rather than DC which manifests as ripple {{superimposed}} on the DC waveform. [...] The ratio can be improved with the use of smoothing circuits which reduce the ripple and hence reduce the AC content of the output. Conversion ratio is reduced by losses in <b>transformer</b> <b>windings</b> and power dissipation in the rectifier element itself. This ratio is of little practical significance because a rectifier is almost always followed by a filter to increase DC voltage and reduce ripple. [...] In some three-phase and multi-phase applications the conversion ratio is high enough that smoothing circuitry is unnecessary.|$|E
