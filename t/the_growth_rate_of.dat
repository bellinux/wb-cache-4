5|$|In 1946, Szilard {{secured a}} {{research}} professorship at the University of Chicago {{that allowed him}} to dabble in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates {{for males and}} females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E
40|$|Using an {{electron}} distribution function {{measured in the}} auroral zone, <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> both ordinary and Z-mode radiation are calculated via the cyclotron maser mechanism. <b>The</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> Z-mode radiation are much {{more sensitive to the}} background plasma density than those of ordinary mode radiation, which are essentially constant over a wide range of the ratio of the background electron plasma frequency to the gyrofrequency. In very low density regions, Z-mode waves are dominant over the ordinary mode, but as the ratio of the electron plasma frequency over the gyrofrequency increases, <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> Z-mode are substantially reduced, leading to an eventual dominance of the ordinary mode over the Z-mode.

5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. <b>The</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E

5|$|Since LAGs can be obliterated by bone remodeling, this {{represents}} an underestimate {{of the true}} number of LAGs that had actually developed; McDonald and colleagues estimated three or four missing LAGs by examining the spacing between the visible LAGs. This indicates that the animal was eight to nine years old when it died. The spacing between the LAGs decreases significantly towards the outer surface, indicating that growth was slowing, {{but the lack of}} the external fundamental system (a series of tightly-spaced LAGs) indicates that growth had not yet ceased. This is consistent with the unfused sutures between the centra and neural spines in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the unfused sutures between the sacral centra and their corresponding ribs. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> Eolambia appears to have been comparable to that of Hypacrosaurus and Maiasaura, which reached maturity after seven or eight years.|$|E
40|$|Methods for inactivating {{bacterial}} viruses in serum {{were developed}} {{through the use}} of heat and ionizing radiation, and the effects of these treatments on <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> cultured cells were tested.

Simultaneous application of heat and radiation caused a considerably greater reduction in viability of both phages in serum, but also caused a significant decrease in <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> L cells in medium supplemented with serum treated in this manner. Treatment of serum with these same doses but given in the sequential fashion of heat followed by radiation caused little or no change in <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> L cells.

5|$|Mating in the {{epaulette}} shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously. Courtship may be {{initiated by the}} female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with his mouth and lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about {{one and a half}} minutes. Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums, even in tanks as small as 135 gallons, but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20ndash&50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120ndash&130 days, at a length of 14ndash&16 cm (5.5ndash&6.3 in). <b>The</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 in) per year after three months.
