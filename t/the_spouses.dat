5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations between <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> {{for some}} time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E
