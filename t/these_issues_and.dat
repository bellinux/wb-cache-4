5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least-developed countries. The economy is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian {{government}} depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, environmental protection, and becoming financially independent amidst widespread overpopulation and unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> the country's outlook appears to be improving, with {{a rise in the}} economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explains}} many of {{the issues}} facing Voice over IP (VoIP). Many of <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> such as compression/decompression of the speech frame and propagation delay, are inherent to VoIP. With careful planning and solid network design these effects on VoIP networks can be minimized. This paper details <b>these</b> various <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> explains how they can affect packet networks...|$|R
25|$|Continued {{progress}} in neuroscience {{has helped to}} clarify many of <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> its findings strongly support physicalists' assertions. Nevertheless, our knowledge is incomplete, and modern philosophers of mind continue to discuss how subjective qualia and the intentional mental states can be naturally explained.|$|E

25|$|While some non-military {{families}} may {{share some of}} these same attributes and experiences, military culture has a much higher incidence and concentration of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> experiences in military families as compared to civilian populations, and by tightly-knit military communities that perceive these experiences as normal. Studies show that growing up immersed in military culture can have long-lasting effects on children, both in positive and also some negative ways.|$|E

25|$|Socrates {{praises the}} Spartans {{as the best}} {{people in the world}} not only because of their fierceness in battle but because of their wisdom and {{philosophical}} skills. This is contrary to the common belief that the Spartans lacked in <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> devoted themselves exclusively to physical training but Socrates claims that they are masters at concealing their skills. While they appear to be unimpressive speakers, at just the right moment, they can provide pithy phrases of wisdom (342e). He adds that Laconic brevity was the earliest characteristic of philosophy (343b).|$|E
25|$|Even the Culture has to {{compromise}} its ideals where diplomacy {{and its own}} security are concerned. Contact, the group that handles <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> Special Circumstances, its secret service division, can employ only those on whose talents and emotional stability it can rely, and may even reject self-aware drones built for its purposes that fail to meet its requirements. Hence these divisions are regarded as the Culture's elite and membership {{is widely regarded as}} a prize; yet also, as described in many of the novels, something that can be shameful as it contradicts many of the Culture's moral codes.|$|E
25|$|From 1987 to 2003, Amtrak managed all of Boston's {{commuter}} rail. The {{relationship between}} MBTA and Amtrak was often rocky, and Amtrak did not submit a bid when the contract expired in 2003. MBTA observers saw Amtrak {{as having been}} a reliable manager and operator, but Amtrak sometimes experienced strained relations with the MBTA. Quibbles centered on equipment failures, crewing issues {{about the number of}} conductors per train, and responsibility for late trains. Because of <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> Amtrak's repeated statements that the MBTA contract was unreasonable, few were surprised at Amtrak's decision not to bid again.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} link {{sequence}} read abundance to {{expression of a}} particular gene, transcript sequences are aligned to a reference genome, or de novo aligned to one another if no reference is available. The key challenges for alignment software include sufficient speed to permit billions of short sequences to be aligned in a meaningful timeframe, flexibility to recognise and deal with intron splicing of eukaryotic mRNA, and correct assignment of reads that map to multiple locations. Software advances have greatly addressed <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> increases in sequencing read length are further reducing multimapping reads. A list of currently available high-throughput sequence aligners is maintained by the EBI.|$|E
25|$|Senator Hatfield {{made several}} recommendations. He asked that a {{transcript}} of the Winter Soldier Investigation be read into the Congressional record and {{made available to the}} public. Hatfield also asked congress to hold hearings discussing {{the use of military force}} in Vietnam and their relation to international agreements ratified by the United States legislature. He sent the testimony to the Department of Defense, the Department of State asked Marine Commandant, Leonard F. Chapman, Jr., to investigate the allegations. He recommended consideration be given to forming a special commission that would look into <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> provide a forum to determine the moral consequences of American involvement in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of methods}} that allow early {{detection}} of possible failures, in safety engineering, are integrated into the design process. At the same time, decisions made {{at the beginning of}} a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system, and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> make critical decisions. No method guarantees today's decisions will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived. However, there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering. Examples include soft systems methodology, Jay Wright Forrester's System dynamics method, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML)—all currently being explored, evaluated, and developed to support the engineering decision process.|$|E

It shows that smear negative TB patients have high mortality even with proper TB treatment. It also observed that HIV patients having low CD 4 count had low TB organism in sputum. TB is a multisystem disease. TB {{is number one}} cause of death, in HIV infected patients specially children. TB and HIV are correlated with each other; if we can decrease the incidence of HIV we can decrease the incidence of TB both in morbidity and mortality, I will discuss all <b>these</b> <b>issue</b> <b>and</b> facts in this topic.|$|R

25|$|In 2001, Jobs {{was granted}} stock {{options in the}} amount of 7.5million shares of Apple with an {{exercise}} price of $18.30. It was alleged that the options had been backdated, and that the exercise price should have been $21.10. It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that he did not report, and that Apple overstated its earnings by that same amount. As a result, Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations, though an independent internal Apple investigation completed on December 29, 2006 found that Jobs was unaware of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} {{state that}} ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated to address <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> limitations because, as these authors state, it {{is a comprehensive}} theory of human nature, {{and it is an}} open system that enables exploration of therapeutic intervention without deviating from the theory itself. What this means is that therapists integrate multiple therapies simultaneously because what one theory lacks insight into, another theory provides; even though the theories may be contradictory among themselves. Ontological hermeneutics therapists, on the other hand, state that it is comprehensive enough to provide adequate insight into human nature as a starting point, but also provides a framework through dialogue to uncover truths about clients in therapy, therefore evading any problems of contradiction. Since ontological hermeneutics theory is a single theory, it avoids the problems of therapists creating their own forms of therapy.|$|E
25|$|After Simon Fraser’s {{arrival in}} 1808 and the {{establishment}} of Fort Langley in 1827 the gold rush began in 1858. With the discovery of gold came the influx of over 30,000 miners with goals of striking it rich. These miners created many problems as they encroached closely to Stó:lō communities, resources, and homes. With the fierce competition over land many disputes arose concerning the ownership of land and the damage that was being caused by the miners. Governor James Douglas recognized <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> tried to separate the Stó:lō and miners by creating separate territories for each group to occupy. This began the long history of land disputes between the Stó:lō and settlers. As the miners left in large numbers by 1860 the whiskey peddlers came in selling their “fire water” to the Stó:lō. Shortly after this more permanent immigrants arrived and began to establish farms. Because no treaties had been signed between the Stó:lō and the government, the settlement of this land was not in accordance with the Royal Proclamation of 1763 that stated that all land acquisition from the Aboriginals had to be done legally through a treaty process.|$|E
