40|$|Given a set V of n {{sensor node}} {{distributed}} on a 2 -dimensional plane {{and a source}} node s ∈ V, the interference problem deals with assigning transmission range to each v ∈ V such that the members in V maintain connectivity predicate P, and the maximum/total interference is minimum. We propose algorithm for both minimizing maximum interference and minimizing <b>total</b> <b>interference</b> of the networks. For minimizing maximum interference we present optimum solution with running time O((P_n + n^ 2) n) for connectivity predicate P like strong connectivity, broadcast (s is the source), k-edge(vertex) connectivity, spanner, where O(P_n) is the time complexity for checking the connectivity predicate P. The running time of the previous best known solution was O(P_n × n^ 2) [Bilò and Proietti, 2008]. For the minimizing <b>total</b> <b>interference</b> we propose optimum algorithm for the connectivity predicate broadcast. The running time of the propose algorithm is O(n). For the same problem, the previous best known result was 2 (1 + (n- 1)) -factor approximation algorithm [Bilò and Proietti, 2008]. We also propose a heuristic for minimizing <b>total</b> <b>interference</b> {{in the case of}} strongly connected predicate and compare our result with the best result available in the literature.

Under this premise, the <b>total</b> power of <b>interference</b> {{can be considered as}} a positive, when the memory effect plays a major role. The power of interference becomes weak as the memory effect is reduced. On the contrary, when nonlinearity plays a key role, the <b>total</b> power of <b>interference</b> is a negative.

However, since the sub-Gaussian part of the interference lies outside of the baseband, cascading a 65 -MHz notch filter with the lowpass filter would reduce this part of the interference without affecting either the signal of interest or the PSD of the impulsive interference around the baseband. Then, as shown by the black lines and text in Figure 6, the interference becomes super-Gaussian (10.8 -dBG peakedness), enabling, as illustrated further in Section 4, its effective mitigation by the NDLs.|$|E
