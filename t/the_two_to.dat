5|$|Amir's {{mother died}} in 1931, and his father the year after, meaning that his {{education}} {{could no longer be}} funded. After his AMS studies concluded, he wanted to continue to study at a law school in Batavia. As such, he wrote to his brother, Jakfar, who arranged for the remainder of his studies to be paid for by the Sultan. In 1932 Amir was able to return to Batavia and begin his legal studies, taking up a part-time job as a teacher. At first, his relationship with Sundari was continued through letters, though she soon continued her studies in Lembang, a city much closer than Surakarta; this allowed <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> meet furtively– when Sundari's parents had discovered their relationship, Amir and Sundari had been forbidden from meeting.|$|E
5|$|At the end {{of season}} five, Ross and Rachel drunkenly get married while vacationing with their friends in Las Vegas. In season six, their {{annulment}} request is denied because of Rachel having leveled unfounded allegations against Ross, forcing <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> file for a divorce instead. In season seven, Ross and Rachel unwittingly conceive a child when their birth control fails. Rachel gives birth to a girl in season eight, naming the baby Emma Geller-Green; the name Emma is a gift from Monica, who had previously been reserving the name for her own child. Rachel and Ross live together as non-romantic roommates {{during the first half}} of season nine.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurus was a hadrosaurid (a duck-billed dinosaur), {{a member}} of a family of dinosaurs which to date are known only from the Late Cretaceous. It is {{classified}} within the Saurolophinae (alternately Hadrosaurinae), a clade of hadrosaurids which lacked hollow crests. Other members of the group include Brachylophosaurus, Gryposaurus, Lophorhothon, Maiasaura, Naashoibitosaurus, Prosaurolophus, and Saurolophus. It was either closely related to or includes the species Anatosaurus annectens (alternately Edmontosaurus annectens), a large hadrosaurid from various latest Cretaceous formations of western North America. The giant Chinese hadrosaurine Shantungosaurus giganteus is also anatomically similar to Edmontosaurus; M. K. Brett-Surman found <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> differ only in details related to the greater size of Shantungosaurus, based on what had been described of the latter genus.|$|E

5|$|For {{missions}} beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA {{has been}} directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During {{a speech at the}} Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E
5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually grey or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. In Tasmania, three species have been recorded. Terns are in general medium-to-large birds, typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter-bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. In Tasmania, thirteen species of gulls and terns have been recorded, five of which are vagrants. The two groups have been considered separate families, but some findings that the noddies and white tern are offshoots to the combined group have led <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> be classified as a single family for the time being.|$|E
5|$|In 77 BC, {{the senate}} sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, Gnaeus Pompey Magnus, {{to put down}} an {{uprising}} in Spain. By 71 BC, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission, and around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, Marcus Licinius Crassus, had just put down a slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the populare party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution, and so they attempted to forge {{an agreement with the}} populare party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected Consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The promise of both Pompey and Crassus, aided by the presence of both of their armies outside of the gates of Rome, helped to 'persuade' the populares to elect <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> the Consulship. As soon as they were elected, they dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.|$|E

5|$|Johann Georg Wagler {{gave the}} species its current {{binomial}} name in 1832 when he erected the new genus Eudocimus, whose only other species is the scarlet ibis (E.ruber). There {{has long been}} debate on whether the two should be considered subspecies or closely related species, and the American Ornithologists' Union considers <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> be a superspecies as they are parapatric.

The southward expansion of the Jurchens caused the Jin to transition their decentralized government of semi-agrarian tribes to a bureaucratic Chinese-style dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Merriam and Goldman had {{recognized}} {{that a number}} of Central American species, including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions, are related to the marsh rice rat. O.couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas, where its distribution meets that of the marsh rice rat. In 1960, Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the contact zone were intermediate between the local forms of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat, and accordingly included the former in the marsh rice rat. While reporting on the ecology of Texan O.couesi in 1979, Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat there were in fact distinct, with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color; their karyotypes were also distinct. Since then, the two have generally been retained as distinct species, as supported by further research; a 1994 study even found <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> occur at some of the same places (in sympatry) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico.|$|E

The operating system is running on more than 400 million active devices and has an estimated usage share of 27.72% on traditional PCs and 12.53% across all platforms (PC, mobile, tablet, and console). Windows 10 use now exceeds Windows 7 globally on weekends, and has already become more popular overall in some regions including in Europe and North America, i.e. most developed countries, such as first in Iceland and later, Japan, Australia and the US.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{worked at}} Mohawk Valley Bank for six years. During {{this time he}} {{developed}} an interest in counterfeit money. He collected counterfeit bills and assembled a scrapbook of these for study. He then had another book of genuine bills; he then compared <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> learn the counterfeiters' techniques. He became an expert in detecting counterfeit bills. This became a valued interest to the bankers and Myers was given all the bank notes to pass through him for approval of genuineness. This ultimately became {{a basis for the}} present day method of detecting counterfeit bills.|$|E
5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E

5|$|Operation Swath-10 (also {{known as}} Bilogora '91) was planned by the Croatians {{to regain control}} of the Virovitica–Lončarica–Grubišno Polje road, cutting off and {{destroying}} the TO forces deployed {{in the area of the}} road (the northernmost part of western Slavonia captured by the TO or the JNA). Those objectives were also designed to deny the Banja Luka Corps support if it attempted to break through towards Virovitica; control the last remaining supply route between Zagreb and Slavonia; shorten the Croatian defensive positions, and improve troop and civilian morale. The offensive was originally scheduled for 15 October, but was postponed for two weeks due to the unavailability of the 105th Infantry Brigade and the special police. The plan of operation called for the ZNG to first cut off <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>TO</b> battalions on the Bilogora Mountain within 48 hours, with the second stage of the offensive destroying the trapped TO force. The operation was authorised by Colonel Miroslav Jezerčić, commander of Bjelovar Operational Zone, on 7 October.|$|E
5|$|Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also {{consider}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> {{be a single}} species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America {{after a period of}} separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} multiple endings. During {{the original}} playthrough, if Class Zero accept the Vermillion Bird Crystal's offer {{for them to}} become l'Cie, they go into battle against the Rursus and die, dooming Orience to be destroyed in Tempus Finis and reborn in another spiral of history. In a sequence unlocked during the second playthrough, it is revealed that Cid wanted to free Orience from the Crystals' control, and killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Gala from using him. After the Arbiter's defeat, Joker and Tiz speak with Arecia and show her the memories of Class Zero {{and the people of}} Orience to make her reconsider restarting the experiment. After speaking with Machina and Rem, Arecia decides to abandon the experiment and returns <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> human form. In an alternate ending, Arecia chooses to remove the crystals from Orience's history, creating a new timeline where the war never occurred and the world's population can live happily.|$|E
