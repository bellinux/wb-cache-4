40|$|AIM: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the influence of the experience of the operator and the assistant on the survival rate of proximal ART- restorations after 2 years when placed using two methods of tooth-isolation and three glass ionomer cement-brands. STUDY DESIGN: A clinical intervention study. METHODS: Each of 804 children aged 6 - 8 years received one proximal restoration in their primary molars. <b>The</b> <b>restorations</b> were placed by ‘experienced/inexperienced' operators randomly paired with 'experienced/ inexperienced' assistants. The atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) approach was used with 3 brands of glass ionomer cements (GIC) and 2 tooth-isolation methods (rubber dam vs cotton rolls). Trained and calibrated evaluators evaluated <b>the</b> <b>restorations,</b> soon after placement and after 2 years. STATISTICS: The data collected were analyzed using SPSS 14. 0, to determine and relate the survival rate of <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> to <b>the</b> operator and assistant with respect to the other factors such as the restorative material used and the isolation method applied. RESULTS: After 2 years, the survival rate of <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> was 30. 8 %. In general, there were no statistical significant differences in the survival rate of <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> made by <b>the</b> ‘experienced' vs ‘inexperienced' operators, but individually, the operator with more experience was associated with a significantly higher survival rate of <b>the</b> <b>restorations.</b> <b>The</b> experienced assistants were associated with significantly higher survival rates of <b>the</b> <b>restorations.</b> <b>The</b> most ‘experienced' operator paired with any ‘experienced' assistant and using rubber dam tooth-isolation method, was associated with a significantly higher survival rate of <b>the</b> <b>restorations.</b> CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> combination of the ‘experienced' operator and assistant using rubber dam tooth-isolation method had the best chance of survival for proximal ART <b>restorations,</b> irrespective of <b>the</b> material-brand used...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of 3 glass ionomer cement (GIC) brands and the postrestoration meal consumed on the survival rate of proximal atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) restorations. Methods: A total of 804 proximal restorations were placed in primary molars by trained operators and assistants using 3 GIC brands. The materials' mixing/placement times, the room temperature and <b>the</b> post- <b>restoration</b> meal consumed by the subjects were documented. <b>The</b> <b>restorations</b> were evaluated soon after placement and after 2 years by trained and calibrated evaluators. Results: After 2 years, approximately 31 % of <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> had survived. There were no statistically significant differences in the survival rate of <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> in relation to the GIC brands. The postrestoration meal consumed, which was of "hard consistency," was associated with significantly lower survival rate of <b>the</b> <b>restorations.</b> Conclusions: <b>The</b> survival rate of <b>the</b> proximal <b>restorations</b> was not significantly affected by the glass ionomer cement brands used, but was significantly influenced by the consistency of the next meal consumed by each child...|$|R

40|$|AIM: This was to {{evaluate}} the influence of two methods of tooth-isolation on the survival rate of proximal ART <b>restorations</b> in <b>the</b> primary molars. METHODS: The {{study was conducted in}} two rural divisions in Kenya, with 7 operators randomly paired to a group of 8 assistants.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aims of this {{prospective}} {{clinical study}} were (1) {{to evaluate the}} clinical performance of Signum composite inlays over a 3 -year period; (2) to investigate the clinical efficacy of composite inlays in premolars versus molars; and (3) to evaluate differences between 1 - or 2 -surface inlays and multisurface inlays. METHOD AND MATERIALS: One hundred thirteen composite inlays were placed in 30 patients by a clinician. All the inlays {{were made by the}} same laboratory technician using only one composite material (Signum, Heraeus Kulzer). All <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> were bonded with a 3 -step bonding system and a composite luting cement. <b>The</b> <b>restorations</b> were assessed after placement by a clinician who had not been involved with the placement of <b>the</b> <b>restorations,</b> in accordance with the modified US Public Health Service criteria. RESULTS: Three of <b>the</b> 113 experimental <b>restorations</b> had to be replaced; the total failure rate was 2. 6 % after 3 years. At baseline, 88. 5 % to 100 % of <b>the</b> inlay <b>restorations</b> were rated as excellent (Alpha). Statistically significant (P <. 05) differences were observed during the study for surface roughness, anatomic form at the margin, marginal integrity, and inlay integrity. The comparison of the clinical outcome of inlays in premolars versus molars and with 1 or 2 surfaces versus multisurfaces showed no significant differences, except for the parameters anatomic form at the margin and marginal integrity. CONCLUSION: Composite inlays demonstrated a very high success rate (97. 4 %) after 3 years.

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim of this}} {{randomized}} controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the 4 -year clinical performance of a self-adhesive resin cement, RelyX Unicem (3 M ESPE), used for cementation of ceramic inlays. In addition, the influence of selectively acid-etching enamel prior to luting on the clinical performance of <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> was assessed. Methods: Sixty-two IPS Empress 2 inlays/onlays were placed in 31 patients by two experienced clinicians. <b>The</b> <b>restorations</b> were luted with RelyX Unicem with (=experimental group: E) or without (=control group: NE) prior enamel etching with phosphoric acid. At baseline, 6 months, 1, 2 and 4 years after placement, <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> were assessed by two calibrated investigators using modified USPHS criteria. Ten selected samples of each group were investigated under SEM regarding morphological changes at the cement-inlay interface. Results: The recall rate at 4 years was 97 %. Two restorations (1 E, 1 NE) were lost, and one (E) had to be replaced due to inlay and tooth fracture resulting in a survival rate of 95 %. No {{significant differences between the}} experimental and control group were noticed regarding all criteria (McNemar, p< 0. 05). An obvious deterioration in marginal integrity was observed after 4 years as only 5 % (E= 7 %; NE= 3 %) of <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> exhibited an excellent marginal adaptation. In 90 % of <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> small, still clinically acceptable marginal deficiencies were observed. SEM of the luting gap showed an increased wear of the RelyX Unicem cement over the 4 -year period. Conclusions: The self-adhesive luting cement RelyX Unicem can be recommended for bonding of ceramic inlays/onlays. Additional selective enamel etching does not improve the clinical performance of <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> within <b>the</b> 4 -year period. status: publishe...|$|R

NCCLs were randomly assigned to two groups: control (placebo solution) or test group (2 % CHX solution for 60 s after acid etching and before the adhesive application). Class V restorations (n= 169) were performed with an etch-and-rinse adhesive system and composite resin by 10 trained operators.
