25|$|Its main {{undercarriage}} had a wide track, with <b>twin</b> <b>wheels</b> on short axles mounted below each engine on inverted V struts, themselves further braced {{to the lower}} fuselage longerons.|$|E
25|$|It had a circular-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage with a nose air intake. A range-only radar {{was fitted}} in the conical inlet cone {{of the air}} intake. The wings had a sweep angle of 55° at quarterchord. Two wing fences were fitted on the upper surface of each wing. The horizontal stabilizer was midway down the rear fuselage and two air brakes were fitted on its underside. The cockpit canopy was faired into the spine that {{ran the length of}} the top of the fuselage. The tandem undercarriage had a single wheel on the forward unit and <b>twin</b> <b>wheels</b> on the main unit with outrigger struts that retracted aft into wingtip fairings.|$|E
25|$|The Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight is a medium-lift tandem-rotor {{transport}} helicopter, {{furnished with}} a set of counter-rotating main rotors in a tandem-rotor configuration. It was typically powered by a pair of General Electric T58 turboshaft engines, which were mounted {{on each side of the}} rear rotor pedestal; power to the forward rotor was transferred from the rear-mounted engines via a drive shaft. For redundancy, both engines are coupled so that either one would be capable of powering both of the main rotors in the event of a single engine failure or a similar emergency situation. Each of the rotors feature three blades, which can be folded to better facilitate storage and naval operations. The CH-46 features a fixed tricycle landing gear, complete with <b>twin</b> <b>wheels</b> on all three legs of the landing gear; this configuration results in a nose-up stance, helping to facilitate cargo loading and unloading. Two of the main landing gear were installed within protruding rear sponsons; the free interior space of the sponsons are also used to house fuel tanks, possessing a total capacity of 350 US gallons (1,438 L).|$|E

500|$|The I-21 was a twin-engined, all-metal, single-seat jet fighter, with {{straight}} laminar flow wings, mid-set on a circular fuselage. The fighter's [...] Lyul'ka TR-2 turbojet engines were mounted below the wings {{much like those}} on the German Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter. Underneath the engine nacelles were hardpoints that could carry [...] bombs or drop tanks. The slightly swept tail unit was cruciform in layout with the tailplane set at approximately half-fin span with slight dihedral. The aircraft's structure was generally constructed from high-strength B-95 duralumin, although high-strength steel and [...] "Elektron" [...] magnesium alloy were used for some components. A hydraulically retractable tricycle undercarriage was fitted, using <b>twin</b> <b>wheels</b> for the nose and main landing gear. Hydraulically actuated airbrakes were fitted {{either side of the}} rear fuselage. Alekseyev initially planned to arm the aircraft with three [...] Nudelman N-37 autocannon, each with 30 rounds, but later decided upon a pair of [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon with 75 rounds per gun.|$|E

50|$|It was in Sweden that Parnell shows true British ingenuity. He {{was there}} for the 1947 Swedish Winter Grand Prix at Rommehed, which he duly won, leading an ERA clear sweep of the podium, as the only three cars to finish. Their chief rivals - the French - were {{stranded}} miles away from the circuit, on a ship stuck fast in the ice. The organiser decided to rerun the event as the Stockholm Grand Prix, on Lake Vallentuna. Meanwhile, between the two races Parnell had the idea of fitting <b>twin</b> rear <b>wheels</b> to his ERA to improve its road-holding on the ice. When he arrived at the race, the lead French driver, Raymond Sommer immediately objected but Parnell had checked the rules beforehand and found that there was nothing to preclude <b>twin</b> rear <b>wheels.</b> Despite temperatures of -15° Fahrenheit, Parnell's extra wheels really made the difference, as he skated to victory.|$|R
50|$|From 1959 to 1972 {{at least}} 500 units were built for various general-transport, utility, {{firefighting}} and flying-crane duties, {{the last two}} sub-types not being fitted with the large fixed wings, which in other versions bear part of the lift in cruising flight and thus enable higher speeds to be attained. The <b>twin</b> nose <b>wheels</b> and large low-pressure main wheels do not retract.|$|R
