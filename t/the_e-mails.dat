5|$|In June 2009, Commissioner Tanya Perrin-Johnson wrote {{a series}} of e-mails that were sent to about 20 {{employees}} in her department directing them {{to work on the}} mayor's re-election campaign. The Office of Special Counsel began an investigation to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>e-mails</b> represented a violation of the federal Hatch Act, which, among other things, prohibits employees involved in federally funded programs from using their authority to influence political campaigns. As a result of the probe, in 2010 the Common Council decided to delay her reappointment as commissioner until the investigation concluded. She had been serving in an interim capacity. In April 2011, Perrin-Johnson resigned her position.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{system log}} (syslog) files of <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> and <b>the</b> DNS cache servers in Kumamoto University were {{statistically}} investigated when receiving {{a lot of}} spam mails. The DNS query traffic between <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> and <b>the</b> DNS cache servers increases when many traces of spam and/or junk mails are found in syslog file of <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server. <b>The</b> DNS query traffic decreases when preventing access between <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server and <b>the</b> spam/junk transferring SMTP clients. This is because the DNS query between <b>the</b> DNS and <b>E-mail</b> servers are mainly driven by the SMTP access in <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server. Therefore, we can detect abnormality of <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server by monitoring the DNS query traffic from <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server to <b>the</b> DNS server and get access-controlling list by analysis of the SMTP syslog files...|$|R

The IP address used in <b>the</b> <b>e-mails</b> was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
