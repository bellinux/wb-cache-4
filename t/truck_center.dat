25|$|The Gummed Products Company rule proved {{difficult}} to administer. In 1962, the board adopted a four-part test in Hollywood Ceramics Co. {{to determine what}} constituted an egregious fabrication.

In 1977, the NLRB overturned Gummed Products Company in Shopping Kart Food Market. But after the appointment of more conservative members to the NLRB, Shopping Kart Food Market was overturned in 1979 in General Knit of California, Inc., which adopted the Hollywood Ceramics standard again.
