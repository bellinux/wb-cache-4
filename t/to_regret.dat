5|$|Fischer and Cristina {{often did}} outdoor {{activities}} together, but Fischer's stepmother {{thought they were}} only friends. She said that she never saw them hold hands or behave {{in a way that}} suggested intimacy. According to his friends, Fischer went with Cristina to South Padre Island, Texas, during spring break and had sex with her in her parents' condominium.

In June 1992, Fischer broke up with Cristina; he told one of his friends that their relationship was only physical, and he did not feel an emotional attachment to her. Fischer had given Cristina his ring while they were dating, and once they broke up he asked her to return it. Cristina refused.|$|E
5|$|With the {{encouragement}} of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 {{so that he could}} request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned his son that he would live <b>to</b> <b>regret</b> the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. An under-funded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that experiential purchases tend to yield greater enduring satisfaction than material purchases. The present work {{suggests that this}} difference in satisfaction is paralleled by a tendency for material and experiential purchases to differ {{in the types of}} regrets they generate, {{as well as in the}} conditions required <b>to</b> prompt <b>regret.</b> In chapter one, I present five studies demonstrating that people's material purchase decisions are more likely <b>to</b> generate <b>regrets</b> of action (buyers remorse) and their experiential purchase decisions are more likely <b>to</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>regrets</b> of inaction (missed opportunities). These results were not attributable to differences in the desirability of or satisfaction provided by the two purchase types. This pattern of regret is driven by the tendency for experiences to be seen as more singular-less interchangeable-than material purchases; interchangeable goods tend <b>to</b> yield <b>regrets</b> of action, whereas singular goods tend <b>to</b> yield <b>regrets</b> of inaction. While chapter one identifies differences in what types of regret are most likely for material and experiential purchases, chapter two considers how likely a <b>regret</b> is <b>to</b> form in the first place, and what might prompt it. I present six studies that examine the relationship between dissatisfaction and regret, and find that the slope of that relationship is different for material and experiential goods. It takes just a little dissatisfaction <b>to</b> prompt <b>regrets</b> of action for material goods, but people must be significantly more dissatisfied with an experience before they regret their purchase. Interchangeability mediates this effect, and I also explore potential mechanisms for this effect, finding that purchase type-by way of interchangeability-influences both the likelihood that someone will engage in counterfactual thought, and the degree to which those counterfactual thoughts are emotionally impactful. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R

5|$|Asad {{then left}} Mazara under Abu Zaki al-Kinani, {{and turned to}} Syracuse: the Muslim army {{advanced}} along the southern shore towards the island's capital, but at Qalat al-Qurrat (possibly ancient Acrae), it was met by an embassy from the city which offered tribute if the Muslims halted their advance. The proposal was probably designed to buy time {{for the city to}} better prepare itself for a siege, but Asad, either persuaded by the emissaries' assurances or needing to rest his army, halted his advance for a few days. At the same time, Euphemius began <b>to</b> <b>regret</b> his alliance with the Aghlabids, and opened secret contacts with the imperials, urging them to resist the Arabs. The Muslims recommenced their advance soon after, and laid siege to the city. Byzantium, which at the same time was forced to face a threat much closer to home at Crete, was unable to send much aid to the beleaguered island, while the Muslims received reinforcements from Africa. Giustiniano Participazio, the dux of the imperial protectorate of Venice, came to the city's aid, but was not able to raise the siege. The besiegers however suffered from lack of supplies as well as the outbreak of a disease in spring 828, which cost Asad his life. He was replaced by Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari. When a Byzantine fleet arrived, the Arabs raised the siege and tried to sail back to Africa, but were hindered by the Byzantine ships. Thwarted, the Muslim army burned its ships and retreated over land to the castle of Mineo, which surrendered to them after three days.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start <b>to</b> <b>regret</b> the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to issues}} {{regarding}} his legal {{status in the}} Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play. Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o. He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League, where he played his best match to that point. After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the Champions League, his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. Messi worked to regain fitness {{in time for the}} Champions League final, but on 17 May, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came <b>to</b> <b>regret.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We study online regret {{minimization}} algorithms in a bicriteria setting, examining {{not only}} the standard notion of <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> the best expert, but also the <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> the average of all experts, the <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> any fixed mixture of experts, and the <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> the worst expert. This study leads both to new understanding {{of the limitations of}} existing no-regret algorithms, and to new algorithms with novel performance guarantees. More specifically, we show that any algorithm that achieves only O (√ T) cumulative <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> the best expert on a sequence of T trials must, in the worst case, suffer regret Ω (√ T) to the average, and that for a wide class of update rules that includes many existing no-regret algorithms (such as Exponential Weights and Follow the Perturbed Leader), the product of the <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> the best and the <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> the average is Ω(T). We then describe and analyze a new multi-phase algorithm, which achieves cumulative regret only O (√ T log T) to the best expert and has only constant <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> any fixed distribution over experts (that is, with no dependence on either T or the number of experts N). The key to the new algorithm is the gradual increase in the “aggressiveness ” of updates in response to observed divergences in expert performances. ...|$|R

During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts <b>to</b> <b>regret</b> what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E

On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car while {{he is in the}} middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir, they eventually resume their journey. Upon reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that he has chosen deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Buñol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan.
