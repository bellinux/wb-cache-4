25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} before <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E
25|$|Religion is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. Some religions also have a moral code. The evolution {{and the history of}} the first religions have recently become areas of active scientific investigation. However, in the course of its development, religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an afterlife), the origin of life, the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and what is moral or immoral. A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in transcendent divine beings such as deities or a singular God, although not all religions are theistic. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the soul or spirit, {{is one of the many}} different approaches humans take in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the meaning of life, and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on mystical or supernatural concepts such as karma and God.|$|E

500|$|Halloween is a 2007 American slasher film written, directed, and {{produced}} by Rob Zombie. The {{film is a}} remake/reimagining of the 1978 horror film of the same name; {{the first in the}} rebooted Halloween film series and the ninth installment of the Halloween franchise. The film stars Tyler Mane as the adult Michael Myers, [...] Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis, and Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode; Daeg Faerch portrays a ten-year-old Michael Myers. Rob Zombie's [...] "reimagining" [...] follows the premise of John Carpenter's original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the question of what drove him to kill people, whereas in Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{received}} positively by critics. Ethan Gilsdorf of the Boston Globe stated that [...] "it’s {{fun to watch}} as Munroe tackles each question and examines every possible complication." [...] According to Gilsdorf, What If? gives a view into [...] "Munroe’s playful yet existentially-tinged worldview" [...] by contrasting cataclysmic scenarios with more heady ideas, such as examining {{the effects of a}} magnitude minus-7 Richter scale earthquake. The Huffington Post remarked that [...] "What makes Munroe's work so fantastic is a combination of two elements: his commitment to <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> even the weirdest question with solid science, and his undeniable sense of humor." [...] Rhett Allain of Wired praised What If? because even his 12-year-old son was able to enjoy it, though he found a minor error in one of the sections.|$|E
500|$|Critic Darcy Sullivan saw {{the book}} as {{presenting}} how Brown's Playboy obsession affects his ability to relate to women. [...] Sullivan called The Playboy stories [...] "he most honest sex in comics" [...] of the early 1990s, [...] "and the most damning exposé of pornography" [...] as it deals [...] "with nothing more than Brown's relationship with Playboy". [...] He praises how quickly Brown matured as a storyteller {{over the course of}} The Playboy, and for the believability of scenes {{which may or may not}} have happened as Brown depicted them. [...] While seeming to acknowledge feminist concerns, Brown depicts himself as [...] "a victim of his urges", and that [...] "Playboy has kept him mentally separate". [...] Sullivan asserts the book shows that pornography does not merely satisfy a need, but fosters an addiction. [...] Brown's comics raise questions, rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> them, an approach Sullivan compared favourably to that of Joe Matt's less subtle body of work, which also details a pornography obsession: he wrote that Matt's comics analyze and rationalize his obsession, while Brown's reveal.|$|E

500|$|Scarface {{provoked}} outrage mainly {{due to its}} unprecedented violence, {{but also}} because of its shifts of tone from serious to comedic. Dave Kehr, writing in the Chicago Reader, said that the film blends [...] "comedy and horror in a manner that suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun." [...] In one scene, Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way. His bumbling assistant, following orders from Camonte, keeps <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the phone instead of ducking even after the gangsters make several passes by the cafe. After the barrage is over, Camonte picks up a tommy gun one of the mobsters dropped, and exhibits child like wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy. Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone (who was also the blatant inspiration for Little Caesar) were being applauded in movie houses all across America. Some of the biographical details that were used for Muni's character in Scarface were so obviously taken from Capone, and the detail so close, that it was impossible not to draw the parallels. Capone sent several members of his gang to threaten screenwriter Ben Hecht, but Hecht was able to convince them the picture was based on other gangsters. When Scarface was released however, Capone adored the film, and purchased a personal copy. The film remained out of circulation, until Hughes's death in 1976. Universal then re-released the picture, but some scenes from the film's original cut are lost.|$|E

Later that night, Slater stated on social media, [...] "I'm going to start focusing on ME!!! I'm better on my own... It's about time I get what I deserve," [...] cementing their breakup. Shortly afterwards, Slater debuted a shorter haircut. At WrestleMania 31, Slater competed in the 30-man Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which was won by Big Show. Slater returned to the scenes on the April 20, 2015 edition of Raw {{when he was at}} catering, only to receive an RKO through the table by Randy Orton. On the May 28, 2015 edition of Superstars, Slater picked up a victory against Adam Rose. Slater would appear mostly on Superstars and Main Event losing to the likes of Fandango, Neville, R-Truth, and Zack Ryder. Slater started appearing on Raw, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> John Cena's United States Championship Open Challenge, but was denied each week.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the history}} of the origin of the use of the concept and meaning of 'good' are diverse, the notable discussions of Plato and Aristotle on this subject have been of {{significant}} historical effect. The first references that are seen in Plato's The Republic to the Form of the Good are within the conversation between Glaucon and Socrates (454 c–d). When <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> such difficult questions pertaining to the definition of justice, Plato identifies that we should not “introduce every form of difference and sameness in nature” instead we must focus on [...] "the one form of sameness and difference that was relevant to the particular ways of life themselves” which is the form of the Good. This form is the basis for understanding all other forms, it is what allows us to understand everything else. Through the conversation between Socrates and Glaucon (508 a–c) Plato analogizes the form of the Good with the sun as it is what allows us to see things. [...] Here, Plato describes how the sun allows for sight. [...] But he makes a very important distinction, “sun is not sight” but it is “the cause of sight itself.” [...] As the sun is in the visible realm, the form of Good is in the intelligible realm. It is “what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower”. [...] It is not only the “cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge”.|$|E
