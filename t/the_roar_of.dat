5|$|My dearest mother, This morning, {{about four}} o'clock, I was got up, just one hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six {{we were going to}} Richmond. At six we started. The rebs had gone at three, along a road strewn with all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. <b>The</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the bursting shells was terrific.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} coast of Scotland, the Cailleach ushers in winter by washing her great plaid (Gaelic: féileadh mòr) in the Gulf of Corryvreckan (Gaelic: Coire Bhreacain - 'cauldron of the plaid'). This process is said to take three days, during which <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the coming tempest is heard as far away as twenty miles (32km) inland. When she is finished, her plaid is pure white and snow covers the land.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E
60|$|For {{half an hour}} all was quiet, save <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> winter wind.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} {{absolutely}} still save for <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sloths in the distance.|$|R
50|$|Far off resounds <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lion, {{what time}} Parjanya fills {{the sky with}} rain-cloud.|$|R
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Roar</b> <b>of</b> Love is a 1980 concept album by Christian band 2nd Chapter of Acts {{based on}} The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.|$|E
25|$|At 08:35 on 24 November, {{the seven}} battalions of the {{artillery}} group {{opened fire on}} the Japanese positions {{in front of the}} 3rd Marine Regiment. <b>The</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the cannon fire and the sharp blasts of the explosions in the jungle ahead merged into a near-deafening thunder for more than 20 minutes, with more than 5,600 shells from 75mm and 105mm howitzers fired at the Japanese positions. Smoke shells were also fired into the hills east of the Torokina River to reduce the ability of the Japanese to observe the Marine positions.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned on}} his heel, erect, dignified, and walked away amid <b>the</b> <b>roars</b> <b>of</b> my gleeful comrades.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} <b>the</b> <b>roars</b> <b>of</b> wrath in <b>the</b> {{distance}} {{changed to a}} shout of triumph followed by silence.|$|R
60|$|Just at {{that moment}} a long, melancholy wail rose above <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire and clanking of the engines.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, von Furst {{is aware}} that his wife still has strong {{feelings}} for Gibby. He sabotages the aircraft Gibby is to fly for a dangerous stunt, secretly applying acid to a control wire, not only out of jealousy, but also {{to add to the}} realism of his film with a real crash. However, unbeknownst to him, Woody decides to do the stunt in Gibby's place. Red sees von Furst tampering with the wires and alerts Gibby. Gibby takes off in another aircraft and catches up to Woody, but cannot make himself understood over <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> their engines. The cable breaks, and Woody crashes and is killed.|$|E
25|$|Early rocket-engine-testing {{began in}} the Arroyo Seco in 1936 and {{this led to the}} {{establishment}} of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) {{at the mouth of the}} Arroyo Seco by the California Institute of Technology. During the 1950s, JPL was heavily involved in rocket testing, and <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> rocket engines could be heard emanating from the Arroyo Seco area for miles. These rocket projects were terminated at the facility by 1958. By the mid-1960s, JPL had become instrumental in the development, launching, and tracking of a number of unmanned near-Earth and deep-space space probes for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. One notable project was the Mars Rover, which has returned a number of panoramic photos of the Martian surface.|$|E
25|$|The final {{orders for}} the strike were issued at 17:30 hrs on Friday 3 December 1971. The first {{formations}} were in flight and heading for their targets by 17:40 hrs. Officially, it was announced via government channels that the airstrikes were launched in response to attacks along the western border on Pakistan Rangers' outposts by regular troops of the Indian army, which the Indian Air Force was providing support to. The Indians would later deny any engagement on the Western Front. However, the Indian air defence radars failed to detect the approaching formations. The first indications for the Indians of the impending assault was <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the strike aircraft over their airfields, while in Delhi, the air-raid sirens were the first indications for newsmen, gathered for the daily brief of the East-Pakistan situation, that something was going on.|$|E
60|$|The {{girls in}} the cabin heard the crash above <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements, and let up a scream of alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Boat, ahoy!" [...] murmured Boltrope, {{through a}} trumpet, which, aided by his lungs, {{produced}} sounds not unlike <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> a bull.|$|R
60|$|The others listened, {{and above}} <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{wind in the}} pines {{overhead}} they heard the sharp bark of a dog.|$|R
25|$|According to {{the biblical}} {{account of the}} giving of the {{instructions}} and teachings of both the Written and the Oral Torah, Sinai was enveloped in a cloud, it quaked and was filled with smoke, while lightning-flashes shot forth, and <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> thunder mingled with the blasts of a trumpet; the account later adds that fire was seen burning at {{the summit of the}} mountain. In the biblical account, the fire and clouds are a direct consequence of the arrival of God upon the mountain. According to the biblical story, Moses departed to the mountain and stayed there for 40 days and nights in order to receive the Ten Commandments, the Written and the Oral Torah, and he did so twice because he broke the first set of the tablets of stone after returning from the mountain for the first time.|$|E
25|$|At dusk, {{with the}} dead and wounded piling up, Anderson sent two {{ambulances}} filled with critically wounded men to the bridge under a flag of truce, requesting that they be allowed to pass through to the Allied lines beyond. The Japanese refused, and instead demanded that the Indian brigade surrender, offering {{to care for the}} wounded. Still hopeful of relief, Anderson refused to consider surrendering. The Japanese then ordered that the ambulances were to remain on the bridge to act as a roadblock, and they would be shot if they attempted to move. After dark, Lieutenant Austin and a driver, both of whom were themselves wounded, slipped the brakes of the ambulances, and let them run quietly backwards down the slope from the bridge. Amid <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> gunfire, they started the engines and drove back to the brigade.|$|E
25|$|The Romans finally {{captured}} the Antonia Fortress {{and began a}} frontal assault on {{the gates of the}} Temple. Titus was apparently bent on ending Judaism as a religion. He sought to slaughter their animals, kill their men, rape their women, enslave their children, and kill their God. When he finally did breach the walls, his soldiers set upon everyone – man, woman, child, those who stayed loyal to Rome, and those who did not. The city went up in flames. <b>The</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the inferno mixed with screams of agony as the Romans swept through the upper and lower city, literally clambering over dead bodies in pursuit of the rebels, until they reached the Temple, set it aflame, and reduced it to dust. When the fires subsided, Titus gave the order to destroy the remainder of the city, seeking that no one would remember the name Jerusalem. The Temple was demolished, after which Titus' soldiers proclaimed him imperator in honor of the victory.|$|E
5000|$|Singing [...] "We are the Timbers..." [...] {{to section}} 107 (Timbers Army), {{eventually}} spelling out T-I-M-B-E-R-S (the R extended, imitating <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> a chainsaw) ...|$|R
60|$|His {{voice was}} drowned by {{distance}} and <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gale, but Mr Webster and Annie had heard {{enough to fill}} them with alarm.|$|R
60|$|Outside, in the {{darkness}} of the tangled jungle, she could hear <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> lions, <b>the</b> laughing of hyenas, and the countless, nameless noises of the midnight jungle.|$|R
25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of}} the river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E
25|$|Stoney Creek Bridge (originally bridge number 26, now bridge 30), {{in front}} of Stoney Creek Falls, is built on a 4 chain (80m) radius curve and was {{designed}} by the government engineer John Gwynneth. The design is unique in Queensland, the curve being {{the only way to}} avoid tunnelling. By the end of 1887 the concrete foundations on which the wrought iron trestles (Phoenix columns) were erected were well underway. It is one of only two Queensland railway bridges constructed with wrought iron trestles, the other being Christmas Creek Bridge, further up the line. A visit to Cairns by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Henry Wylie Norman, in April 1890 was taken as an opportunity to inspect the construction works. A marquee, covering a banquet table and open to the waterfall, had been set up on the almost completed Stoney Creek Bridge with planks laid over the sleepers. There were no speeches due to <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the waterfall immediately behind the bridge. The bridge passed load testing on 30 June 1890.|$|E
25|$|Deep inside Hades' lair, {{an injured}} Hook awakens and notices {{a young woman}} who is also trapped with him in the chamber. As he struggles to move Hook convinces the young woman to run for help and asks for Emma. As they reach the exit, a three-headed hellhound creature, Cerberus, chases after the two. Above at the cemetery, Mary Margaret and David look at the gravestones of those who Mary Margaret felt she had failed as alluded in the flashback, But David is {{confident}} that they can protect Emma and tells Mary Margaret that she can be able to succeed. When she sees the tombstone of Hercules, David is surprised to learn that she knew the Demi-God, and believes that he has unfinished business with her, which gives them the idea to help him while seeking out Hook. Regina and Robin meet up with Emma and Henry. Regina tells Robin that she has maps at the Mayor's office and Henry and Robin head there but when Regina turns around Emma has took off and calls for her. Emma notices fresh blood and traces the direction, but instead they find the young woman and she says she knows Killian. As soon as they hear <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> Cerberus, Emma uses her magic to take them to the Underworld version of Mary Margaret's apartment. Later on at Granny's Diner, Emma and Regina are joined by Mary Margaret, and thanks to the Blind Witch, they find Hercules, who they hope he will complete his Twelve Labors before he can move on, being Cerberus.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned a}} white, intent face towards the house. Duncombe could hear nothing for <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind, but the girl's face was once more convulsed with terror.|$|R
60|$|O they rade on, {{and farther}} on, And they waded thro rivers aboon the knee, And they saw neither sun nor moon, But they heard <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angry {{bears in}} the cartoon {{seems to be}} the same sound effect used for <b>the</b> monster's <b>roar</b> in <b>the</b> feature film The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, which was also {{produced}} by Warner Bros.|$|R
25|$|In the {{swirling}} cloud and snow they abandoned plans to descend via the sharp, unclimbed east ridge. Grove’s partner, Edward North Buxton, suggested {{remaining on the}} summit {{for a couple of}} hours to see if the weather would improve, but the rest of the party rejected his proposal, recognising there was neither sufficient daylight left for them to descend the impossibly exposed and unknown east ridge, nor to down-climb the sheer route they had just ascended. They chose instead to attempt a descent down the unknown southern side of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. They found it trying work to descending the steep ice bank from the summit in the furious storm, but managed eventually to find their way down through one stone-raked couloir to another on the mountain’s south-east face. As twilight fell they reached the head of the Glacier de Bionnassay Italian which formed the northern arm of the huge Glacier du Miage. Here, at a height well above that of the Col de Miage (3,300 m) upon which they could look down, they found refuge amongst rocks beside the steep glacier. They tried to rest there, having had nothing to drink all day except a little brandy and some tasteless wine that they had brought with them; glacial meltwater flowing beneath the rocks on which they sat were totally inaccessible to them. They were also wet through from the storm which by now had passed over, revealing a clear, starry sky. The trickles of water ceased as the temperature dropped below freezing and the night slowly became calm until the silence was shattered by <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> rockfall over their heads. Abandoning their bivouac site, they took refuge amongst steeply sloping rocks which offered protection from stonefall, but no comfort whatsoever. After a miserable night’s rest, dawn eventually arrived and the ice-rimed party again began to descend the glacier, led by their guide, Cachat. Eight hours later they arrived at the village of St Gervais and sought appropriate refreshment in a well-to-do hotel, much to the disapprobation of the other guests who regarded their appearance and clothing with horror.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{sounds of}} the forest are entirely obliterated by <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the motor. The smell of pine needles and flowers and herbs and freshly turned dirt {{and all the other}} {{delicate}} odors of the forest are drowned in the stench of gasoline. The feeling of wind blowing in the face and of soft ground under foot are all lost." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Mitchell {{writes in}} Hiking the Endless Mountains: Exploring the Wilderness of Northeast Pennsylvania that Ganoga Glen has his [...] "favorite place" [...] in the park: [...] "Here the trail wraps around ledges and {{underneath}} overhanging rocks, {{right next to}} the waterfalls. <b>The</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the falls reverberates against their rocky confines. The state park trail map says that Seneca, Delaware, and Mohican Falls are here, {{but it is hard to}} discern which falls are which because they explode from everywhere and are continuous." ...|$|E
60|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north {{wind rose}} the clamour of voices, {{the cries of}} hate and disgust, the deep groaning sobs of fierce and militant anger. The {{man and the woman}} {{exchanged}} quick glances.|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{they began}} to descend a path which led them into the woods. They heard <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, which grew louder and louder as they drew nigh, and then Rollo {{suddenly}} stopped and said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come aft, poys," [...] shouted Ian, whose voice, strong {{though it}} was, could {{scarcely}} {{be heard in}} the bow owing to <b>the</b> <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gale; [...] "she's trinkin' too much; come aft, an' look sherp!" ...|$|R
