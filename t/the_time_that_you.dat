25|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a common}} term {{for all of the}} {{behaviors}} which relate to the promotion of good sleep. These behaviors are used as the basis of sleep interventions and are the primary focus of sleep education programs. Behaviors include the use of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. Exercise can be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are planning on going to sleep. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or distressful thoughts from view.|$|E

It's an honor that everybody wants your music fast, {{but on the other}} hand, it's another thing when the music gets out before you [...] Because that's your art. You feel attached to it.

You take parts of your life and you put it on these records and then for it to just be traded and moved around [...]|$|E

6000|$|Odd <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never knew, in {{all these}} years, that the train was there every afternoon, puffing up steam in the city station, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might have boarded it any day and gone home.
