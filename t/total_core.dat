An assay prototype designed {{to detect and}} quantify <b>total</b> HCV <b>core</b> antigen (<b>total</b> HCV <b>core</b> Ag) protein in serum and plasma in {{the presence or absence}} of anti-HCV antibodies has been recently developed. A comparison between a <b>total</b> anti-HCV <b>core</b> Ag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a quantitative HCV RNA assay based on reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (Amplicor HCV Monitor test) was performed using a large (n = 305) cohort of ELISA HCV 3. 0 HCV-negative and -positive patients on maintenance dialysis. The concentrations of HCV core Ag and HCV RNA levels (measured by RT-PCR) were significantly correlated (r = 0. 471, P = 0. 0001) over a wide range of HCV RNA levels and were maintained among different HCV genotypes (HCV genotype 1, r = 0. 862, P = 0. 0001; HCV genotype 2, r = 0. 691, P = 0. 0001).

40|$|Aims In {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, histological grading needs to be performed on core needle biopsies (CNBs) {{that may not be}} representative of the whole tumour when they are small. Our aim was to study the influence of biopsy size on agreement rates for histological grade between CNBs and subsequent surgical excision biopsies (SEBs). Methods and results We calculated agreement and Cohen's κ between CNBs and SEBs of 300 early-stage breast cancers. The number of cores, <b>total</b> <b>core</b> length, total tumour length and tumour/tissue ratio were assessed for each CNB set. Agreement rates for grade were calculated for different classes of core number and tumour/tissue ratio, and for <b>total</b> <b>core</b> lengths and tumour lengths per CNB set in 5 – 15 -mm intervals. Agreement on grade between CNBs and SEBs was 73 % (κ = 0. 59), with underestimation of grade in CNBs in 26 % of cases and overestimation in 1 % of cases. There was significantly higher concordance between CNBs and SEBs at a <b>total</b> <b>core</b> length of ≥ 50 mm than at a <b>total</b> <b>core</b> length of < 50 mm (83 % versus 68 % agreement, P = 0. 007), at a tumour length of ≥ 15 mm than at tumour length of < 15 mm in CNBs (79 % versus 67 % agreement, P = 0. 036), and at three or more cores than at fewer than three cores (75 % versus 58 % agreement, P = 0. 048). The tumour/tissue ratio, pathological tumour size and radiological tumour size were not statistically different between concordant and discordant cases.

40|$|Abstract: The {{measurement}} of <b>total</b> <b>core</b> recovery is apparently a simple measurement {{to make and}} so there is little guidance available on how to actually carry this out. As core drilling is carried out in an increasingly wide range of materials, the difficulties in recording this simple index also increase. This technical note sets down some of the procedures that need to be followed for efficient and accurate record taking. The logging of rotary drill cores requires that the <b>total</b> <b>core</b> recovery (TCR) is measured to provide a record of the proportion of core recovered. Although this index gives little information on the character of the material its measurement is required in the logging of cores recovered from rocks, soils and made ground such as concrete and brickwork. There are a number of practical difficulties in recording the TCR whenever the recovery is not 100 %, a situation that has increased in frequency with the use of rotary coring methods in an increasingl...|$|E
40|$|Fe- 6. 5 % Si alloys {{have good}} {{magnetic}} properties {{due to their}} high electrical resistivity, very low magneto-stric-tion, and low crystalline anisotropy. Despite their strong potential, these alloys have seldom been used in mag-netic applications because of the very poor ductility of Si-steel above 3. 0 wt % Si [1 - 4]. It is difficult to achieve compressed Fe- 6. 5 % Si powder cores with excellent properties because of the low density due to poor ductility. In compressed powder cores, high density is essential {{in order to obtain}} high magnetization and permeability. In this study, an attempt was made to produce Fe- 3 %Si powder cores because the Fe- 3. 0 wt % Si alloys have relatively good magnetic properties and room temperature ductility. Gas atomized Fe- 3. 0 wt % Si powder was compressed into toroid shape cores. By reducing the Si content to 3. 0 wt%, the hysteresis loss could be greatly reduced and thus the <b>total</b> <b>core</b> loss could be minimized.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{national}} study was to utilize quantitative methods to examine institutional characteristics, financial resource variables, personnel variables, and customer variables {{of public and private}} institutions that have and have not implemented enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, from a resource dependence perspective. Resources were examined within the context of resource dependency theory as it relates to organizations seeking to manage their environments by: using strategies to enhance their autonomy and pursue their organizational interests; acquiring, maintaining and controlling critical resources from the environment, and understanding that social context matters in the relationship between organizations and their external environment. There were several findings of this study. Two institutional characteristics and eight resource variables predict institutions of higher education that have implemented ERP systems: size 20, 000 and above, Carnegie 2000 - Doctoral/ Research Universities, <b>total</b> <b>core</b> revenues, investment return, <b>total</b> <b>core</b> expenses, research expenses, total FTE staff, instruction-research-public service FTE staff, executive-admin-managerial FTE staff, and other professional FTE staff. In addition, four institutional characteristics and three resource variables predict IHEs that have not implemented ERP systems: age group between 51 and 100; size between 1, 000 and 4, 999; Carnegie 2000 - Masters Colleges and Universities; Carnegie 2000 - Associates Colleges; revenues of tuition and fees; student service expenses, and institutional support expenses. Lastly, there were similarities and differences for IHEs that have and have not implemented ERP systems. When compared between FY 06 and FY 10, five resource variables are consistent among IHEs that have and have not implemented ERP systems. These are: <b>total</b> <b>core</b> expenses, instruction expenses, other core expenses, instruction-research-public service FTE staff and reported FTE undergraduate enrollment. For institutions that have implemented ERP systems, the following eight resource variables are significant, in addition to the five mentioned previously: tuition and fees, state appropriations, research expenses, student service expenses, academic support expenses, total FTE staff, other professional FTE staff, and reported FTE graduate enrollment. Further, for institutions that have not implemented ERP systems, the following two resource variables are significant, in addition to the five previously mentioned: <b>total</b> <b>core</b> revenue and reported FTE graduate enrollment. Overall, there was a significant decrease in institutional support per student FTE for IHEs that have implemented ERP systems. This research provides a baseline regarding IHEs that have and have not implemented ERP systems in higher education, and raises additional questions for further research...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} {{the significance of}} focal prostate cancer found in sextant biopsies in men participating in a biennial prostate specific antigen (PSA) based screening program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 1995, 10000 men 50 to 65 years old were randomized to biennial screening with PSA testing. Sextant biopsies were recommended when total PSA was 3 ng/ml or greater at screening rounds 1 and 2, and 2. 54 ng/ml or greater at subsequent screening rounds. Focal cancer was defined as total a core cancer length of less than 3 mm in the biopsy specimen. Low volume cancer {{was defined as a}} total tumor volume of less than 0. 5 cm in the radical retropubic prostatectomy specimen. RESULTS: The number of men who underwent biopsy and the number of cancers detected in the 5 possible sets of biopsies were 1725 and 402, 706 and 124, 307 and 36, 103 and 9, and 13 and 0, respectively. The risk of detecting focal cancer was 7. 9 %, 10. 2 %, 7. 5 %, 5. 8 % and 0 %, respectively, but the relative ratio (focal-to-all cancers) increased 34 %, 58 %, 64 %, 67 % and, not applicable, respectively. In men with a <b>total</b> <b>core</b> cancer length of less than 10 mm there was no correlation between core cancer length and total tumor volume, as measured in the prostatectomy specimen. Two-thirds of men with a <b>total</b> <b>core</b> cancer length of less than 3 mm had a tumor volume of greater than 0. 5 cm, while the risk of low volume cancer was less than 5 % only in men with a <b>total</b> <b>core</b> cancer length of greater than 10 mm.

40|$|Abstract—Transport Triggered Architectures (TTAs) possess many advantageous, such as modularity, flexibility, and scalabil-ity. As {{an exposed}} {{datapath}} architecture, TTAs can effectively reduce the register file (RF) pressure in both number of accesses {{and number of}} RF ports. However, the conventional TTAs also have some evident disadvantages, such as relative low code density, dynamic-power wasting due to separate scheduling of source operands, and inefficient support for variant immediate values. In order to preserve the merit of conventional TTAs, while solving these aforementioned issues, we propose, MOVE-Pro, a novel low power and high code density TTA architecture. With optimizations at instruction set architecture (ISA), architecture, circuit, and compiler levels, the low-power potential of TTAs is fully exploited. Moreover, with a much denser code size, TTAs performance is also improved accordingly. In a head-to-head comparison between a two-issue MOVE-Pro processor and its RISC counterpart, we shown that up to 80 % of RF accesses can be reduced, and the reduction in RF power is successfully transferred to the <b>total</b> <b>core</b> power saving. Up to 11 % reduction of the <b>total</b> <b>core</b> power is achieved by our MOVE-Pro processor, while the code density is almost the same as its RISC counterpart...|$|E

40|$|A new approach, {{suitable}} for real-time implementation, is introduced for estimation of non-uniform internal temperature distribution in cylindrical lithium-ion cells. A radial 1 -D model {{is used to}} estimate the distribution using two inputs: the real or imaginary part of the electrochemical impedance of the cell at a single frequency, and the surface temperature. The approach does not require knowledge of cell thermal properties, heat generation or thermal boundary conditions. The model is validated experimentally, {{the first time for}} such an approach, using a cylindrical 26650 cell fitted with an internal thermocouple. The cell is heated by applying (1) current pulses of up to ± 20 A and (2) a 3500 s HEV drive cycle current profile, whilst monitoring the surface and core temperatures and measuring impedance at 215 Hz. During the drive cycle test, the battery core temperature increases by 20 °C and the surface temperature increases by 14 °C. The mean absolute error in the predicted maximum temperature throughout the cycle is 0. 6 °C (3 % of the <b>total</b> <b>core</b> temperature increase), in contrast to a mean absolute error of 2. 6 °C if the temperature is assumed to be uniform (13 % of the <b>total</b> <b>core</b> temperature increase). © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Background: Psychomotor {{symptoms}} are putative distinguishing features of melancholia that may guide treatment decisions. Hence, {{there is a}} need for valid instruments to assess psychomotor symptoms. The objective of this study is to examine the construct validity of the CORE, an observational instrument designed to quantify psychomotor symptoms in depression. Methods: Associations between CORE scores and levels of motor activity measured by accelerometry were examined in a sample of 25 elderly depressed in-patients, for various time intervals, during 24 h of follow-up. Results: <b>Total</b> <b>CORE</b> scores (as well as CORE retardation and agitation sub-scale scores) were negatively correlated with activity scores, with depression severity increasing the correlational strength substantively. For <b>total</b> <b>CORE</b> scores and retardation sub-scale scores, the highest associations were quantified across morning intervals. Limitations: Given the nature of the study mild levels of depression were overrepresented, monitoring of motor activity lasted only 24 h and non-motor activity items in the CORE were not measured. Conclusion: Associations between CORE total scores and retardation sub-scale scores support the validity of the CORE as well as quantifying associations between severity of psychomotor disturbance and clinical depression severity. Study results also support the application of accelerometry tools in quantifying components of clinical depression. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
