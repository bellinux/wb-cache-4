40|$|This paper {{represents}} an extension {{and integration of}} recent empirical and theoretical research on default risk and taxability. The purpose of the paper is to develop and test a model of interest rate spreads which incorporates both the effect of <b>taxes</b> and differences <b>in</b> <b>default</b> probabilities <b>in</b> a theoretically correct manner. There is an important fundamental difference between our approach to explaining yield spreads and the approach most commonly taken in literature. Unlike {{nearly all of the}} previous work, we do not begin with a yield spread model, i. e.,one which begins by examining differences in yields, but rather begin with an expected return or pricing model, which can then be expressed in the yield spread format. This is a fundamental difference in approaches which we feel leads to a superior theoretical formulation which can then be tested empirically without many of the problems inherent in the alter-native approach. The theoretical model is a simple extension of earlierwork on default by Bierman and Hass (1975) and Yawitz (1977), altered appropriately to take explicit account of tax effects. While there is a considerable literature that analyzes the effect of taxability on rate spreads, we are unaware of any previous study that considers <b>tax</b> consequences <b>in</b> the event of default, a rather surprising omission. ...|$|R
40|$|Every {{year over}} three-quarters of US taxpayers receive income tax refunds, {{indicating}} tax prepayments above {{the level of}} tax liability. This amounts to a zero interest loan {{to the government and}} in some cases may hinder consumption smoothing. Previous studies have suggested two main explanations for this behavior: precautionary behavior <b>in</b> light of <b>tax</b> uncertainty and/or a forced savings motive. I present evidence on a third explanation: inertia. I find that tax filers only partially adjust <b>tax</b> prepayments <b>in</b> response to changes <b>in</b> <b>default</b> withholdings or <b>tax</b> liability. I use four different settings for identification: (1) a 1992 change <b>in</b> <b>default</b> federal withholding, (2) a panel study of child dependents and tax liability, (3) the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) during the 1990 s and (4) a change <b>in</b> <b>default</b> enrollment rules for the Advance EITC option. In the first two cases, I find that individuals o¤set less than 30 % of a shock to the refund level in the …rst year, and less than 60 % of this shock after three years. Adjustments <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> prepayments by EITC recipients o¤set no more than 2 % of the change <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> liability. <b>In</b> the case of the Advance EITC, I show that informational interventions have the potential to greatly reduce default effects.

40|$|Global {{economic}} crises appear to strongly affect corporate bankruptcy rates. However, several prior {{studies indicate that}} changes <b>in</b> <b>default</b> risk are strongly negatively related to equity returns, which in turn depend predominately on country-specific factors. This suggests that country effects – and not global effects – should dominate changes <b>in</b> <b>default</b> risk. To analyse this issue, we decompose changes <b>in</b> <b>default</b> risk, changes <b>in</b> the fundamental determinants of default risk and equity returns into global, country and industry effects. We proxy for default risk through Merton (1974) default risk estimates and CDS rates. Our evidence reveals that changes <b>in</b> <b>default</b> risk always depend most strongly on global and industry effects. However, the magnitude of country effects in equity returns correlates positively with economic stability, rendering it dependent on the sample period.
