The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend <b>that</b> <b>started</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E

5|$|Sangay (also {{known as}} Macas, Sanagay, or Sangai) {{is an active}} {{stratovolcano}} in central Ecuador. It is the most active volcano in Ecuador, despite erupting only three times in recorded history, because the eruption <b>that</b> <b>started</b> <b>in</b> 1934 is still ongoing. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern boundary of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's approximately 500,000-year-old history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today.|$|E
