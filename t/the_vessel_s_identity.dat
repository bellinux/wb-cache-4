40|$|A {{life cycle}} cost {{comparison}} study between a newly built LNG ferry and a 21 year old conventional ferry {{was carried out in}} this study. The objective was to study <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> cost effectiveness compared to an equivalent existing vessel of mature age. It has been assumed that both vessels are to be operating according to <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> current production pattern at a specific ferry service. The study has a time span of 30 years. Another assumption is that both vessels are assumed to be procured from respectively the newbuilding market and the second-hand market. This study emphasises primarily <b>vessel</b> generated costs. <b>The</b> cost elements that are investigated are among other: capital costs, fuel costs, lube oil costs, maintenance costs, downtime costs, NOx emission costs and income due to scrapping. Costs such as port fees and management costs are not included. Due to the high level of uncertainty related to many of the cost elements, a sensitivity analysis is performed. A cost breakdown structure has been derived to identify the relevant cost elements which are to be studied. Data are gathered from the shipping company that owns <b>the</b> <b>vessels.</b> This is done by use of their databases and records. Documentations and specifications are also provided by the shipping company s suppliers. Estimations which lacked sufficient input data have been partly founded on expert opinions. It has been found that the total {{life cycle cost}}s of <b>the</b> conventional <b>vessel</b> are 12 % lower than <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s.</b> <b>The</b> most significant cost elements are identified to be the capital costs, fuel costs, maintenance costs, NOx emission costs and downtime costs. If an internal rate of return is applied, <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> disadvantage when it comes to total life cycle costs will increase. This is due to <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> high initial costs. The results show that the capital costs related to the procurement of <b>the</b> conventional <b>vessel</b> in real term value are only 8 % of <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> capital cost. It has been found that <b>the</b> conventional <b>vessel</b> has 19 % lower energy consumption than <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel.</b> Despite of this, it is estimated that <b>the</b> conventional <b>vessel</b> will have 9 % higher total fuel cost over the time period. The main {{reason for this is that}} the existing gap between the two energy prices is forecasted to increase over the time period. It is estimated that <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> has 9 % lower maintenance cost over the time period. One of the reasons for this is the expectation of reduced deterioration of the fuel supply system and other components such as engine nozzles and exhaust valves. <b>The</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> total NOx emission costs are estimated to be only 15 % of <b>the</b> conventional <b>vessel</b> <b>s,</b> which is one of the most significant differences between the ferries. This is due to the LNG engine s ability to operate at very low NOx emission rates. An analysis regarding a measure that may reduce <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> life cycle cost is also conducted. <b>The</b> <b>vessel</b> has installed a hybrid shaft generator system. The main engine is able to deliver power to <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> electricity grid by use of the shaft generator. Vice versa, the shaft generator is able to function as a motor and thus use electric power for propulsion. In other words, the shaft generator gives <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> flexibility with respect to power consumption and power production. The measure is to replace <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> shaft generator with a new unit which has sufficient capacity to supply all the main switchboard s consumers without having to run <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> standby generator. Then the main engine will alone be able to provide sufficient electricity power to <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> grid. This is assessed to enable savings of fuel, NOx tax and maintenance cost due to among other increased efficiency of electricity production. Data for this analysis regarding the current operation of the propulsions system is gathered from <b>the</b> LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> power management system. Information regarding the system s components is provided by the suppliers. It has been found that the yearly savings due to the reduced fuel, maintenance and NOx expenditures are in lower edge of 1 million NOK. This measure will reduce <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> NOx emission significantly. The measure therefore qualifies to a significant support from the Norwegian NOx fund, which may reduce the financial cost of the replacement to about 1 million NOK. Consequently, the payback time is about one year, which is a relatively short time period. However, it is important to underline that there is uncertainty related to these calculations and the inherent limitations which are associated with the measure...|$|R

40|$|The {{maritime}} {{activity in}} the Arctic waters has increased during the recent years due to diminishing ice and exploration of resources. Arctic operation involves an increased risk level all year around compared to operation in other open waters. The remoteness of the area and low temperatures can cause severe consequences if an accident would occur due to the possibilities for long waiting time for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. For the cruise tourism industry the diminishing ice levels entail that more areas become accessible for exploration. The popular cruise tourism areas, around Svalbard, Franz Josef Land and the coast of Greenland are exposed to high concentration of icebergs and succeeding bergy bits and growlers. These smaller ice pieces pose large threats to <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> operating in <b>the</b> area as they are difficult to detect and can induce large forces on the ship hull in case of impact. In order {{to ensure the safety}} of passengers and crew, it is necessary to evaluate measures for improved damage stability. In case of damage of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> resulting in water ingress, it is vital that measures have been taken to increase <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> capability to remain afloat. By increasing the survivability of <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> emergency evacuation can be avoided as <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> function as it s own lifeboat. Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) has been performed to assess the risk of cruise ship operation in Arctic, where probabilistic damage stability (PDS) and cost benefit assessment (CBA) is used to evaluate changes in the arrangement for risk reduction. Two risk control options (RCOs) have been developed on the basis of the general arrangement to MS Fram. Risk control option I considers implementation of longitudinal bulkheads in the forward area of <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> between <b>the</b> shell and crew cabins located between 1 st and 2 nd deck. A part of this area is located beneath the waterline, and is therefore exposed for damages caused by impact with drifting ice. Risk control option II considers changes in the arrangement for symmetrical flooding. The tanks located below tank top and below 1 st deck are changed from heading in the longitudinal direction to the transverse direction. In case of damages to this area, implementation of RCO II ensures symmetrical flooding to improve <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> capability to remain afloat. The two RCOs have been implemented in the software DELFTShip, and compared with the initial arrangement on the basis of the probabilistic damage stability calculations. The increase in the attained index, as a result of the implemented RCOs, is considered as improved capability to remain afloat. The results from the PDS calculations show a slight increase in the attained index for both risk control options. This slight increased index improves <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> survivability by increasing the amount of damages where the time to capsize is longer than 30 minutes. The results from the cost benefit assessment show that both RCOs are cost effective and can thus be recommended for implementation. The analyses are done based on numerous assumptions causing uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the results. However, the results are considered to give an indication on the effect of implementing the measures. Based on the results of the analyses, it is demonstrated that the measures for risk reduction can improve the damage stability of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> for cruise ship operation in Arcti...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a Real Options (RO) {{approach}} to valuing flexibility in ship design. The overall {{object is to}} find the value of owning a Multipurpose Offshore Construction Vessel (MOCV) by applying the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The MOCV holds the option of switching into an Offshore Subsea Construction Vessel (OSCV), a Well Intervention Vessel or a Pipe Laying <b>Vessel.</b> <b>The</b> thesis aims to discuss the owner s economic benefit of owning an MOCV instead of three separate single purpose vessels. Dimensions, equipment types and capacities on the MOCV are based on <b>the</b> reference <b>vessel,</b> <b>The</b> Island Performer. To solve this task, the problem has been limited by the following boundaries: at the time T= 0, <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> will be completed as an OSCV with options for further evolvement. At the end of each contract the owner has the option to switch to a different market by switching vessel type. Each of the three markets have different contract lengths and the analysis only considers the first four contracts of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> service time. In the RO Analysis, the time to maturity of the option is considered equal to the remaining time of the current contract. The stock prices and the stock price volatility are estimated based on <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> daily hire rates under long-term contracts in the North Sea. The strike price is equal to the cost of switching vessel types and each switching option has a different strike price. Lastly, ten-year government bonds underlie the risk- free rate. The main results from this analysis confirm that a vessel that can work as a working platform for different vessel types is a good investment in an uncertain market. From the results {{it can be seen that}} the value of owning a MOCV is strictly positive in all three cases. The values even exceed the initial investment. It has also been demonstrated that the maximum amount one can save by storing the deck equipment for future periods is 25 mUSD.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation of}} the factors controlling the stress rupture life of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) continues. Kevlar (DuPont) fiber overwrapped tanks are of particular concern due to their long usage and the poorly understood stress rupture process in Kevlar filaments. Existing long term data show that the rupture process {{is a function of}} stress, temperature and time. However due to the presence of a load sharing liner, the manufacturing induced residual stresses and the complex mechanical response, the state of actual fiber stress in flight hardware and test articles is not clearly known. This paper is a companion to a previously reported experimental investigation and develops a theoretical framework necessary to design full-scale pathfinder experiments and accurately interpret the experimentally observed deformation and failure mechanisms leading up to static burst in COPVs. The fundamental mechanical response of COPVs is described using linear elasticity and thin shell theory and discussed in comparison to existing experimental observations. These comparisons reveal discrepancies between physical data and the current analytical results and suggest that <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> residual stress state and the spatial stress distribution as a function of pressure may be completely different from predictions based upon existing linear elastic analyses. The 3 D elasticity of transversely isotropic spherical shells demonstrates that an overly compliant transverse stiffness relative to membrane stiffness can account for some of this by shifting a thin shell problem well into the realm of thick shell response. The use of calibration procedures are demonstrated as calibrated thin shell model results and finite element results are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The successes reported here have lead to continuing work with full scale testing of larger NASA COPV hardware...|$|R
40|$|International {{shipping}} has lower direct CO 2 emissions {{per unit}} of mass transported than any other transportation mode. However, the sector s absolute direct emissions in 2012 totalled 815 million tonnes CO 2 -equivalents, accounting for 2. 1 % of all greenhouse gas emissions, and with a continuation of currents trends, are expected to increase between 50 and 250 % by 2050. Containerships contribute about one fourth of these emissions, {{more than any other}} ship type. (Smith et al., 2014) Life cycle assessments model a product or service from raw material extraction through to waste handling, capturing both direct and indirect environmental impacts occurring throughout their lifetime. Here, a bottom-up life cycle analysis of the global containership fleet is performed, as well as predictions for the composition and attributes of the containership fleet from 2016 until 2050. Thus emerges a more complete picture of the environmental footprint of the containership fleet, and the outcomes of different scenario developments can be examined. The results show that the propulsion of the ship is the most important contributor to impacts where fuel combustion plays a central role: Ship propulsion accounts for about 80 % of the climate change impact of the containership fleet. However, in other impact categories, e. g. toxicity potential, other stages of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> life cycle, such as ship construction and the fuel value chain, plays a greater role. Looking at the development of the global warming potential of the fleet towards 2050 reveals that with the assumed improvements in ship emission efficiency and higher proportion of very large ships, above 8500 TEU, the emissions from the fleet do not exceed the 2016 -level in any of the five business-as-usual scenarios...|$|R

Connect LNG has developed The Universal Buoyancy System (UBS), a cost-effective and simple concept for offloading LNG for small-scale ships. The system consists of a flexible cryogenic pipeline, a reel on land and a floating semisubmersible platform. The platform is designed to support the external forces acting on the floating cryogenic pipeline and hence protect <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> manifold. <b>The</b> platform is attached to the ship side by vacuum technology, and the LNG hose may then safely be connected to the ship s manifold. This thesis investigates the behaviour of the platform in three different configurations by using two different methods; simulations in MARINTEK s finite element programme SIMA, and model tests performed in the Marine Cybernetics laboratory at MARINTEK, Trondheim. The platform was exposed to one extreme sea state for three hours, under different configurations and wave headings. The platform was tested alone, connected to the ship side, and connected to both the ship side and the pipeline. As far as possible, the same conditions are used in both model test and in SIMA. In addition, parameters used in the SIMA simulations such as computed transfer functions added mass and damping will be validated in the model test. The results from the model test to some extent validated the input parameters in SIMA, but were not accurate enough to confirm them. The extreme sea states and setups tested showed that the complete system, with platform, pipeline and ship side was the most vulnerable configuration. The computer simulations and the model test results disagree on whether it is the 315 degree or 90 degree wave heading that is the most severe for the complete system, but the differences between the different wave headings are small in both methods, so this might be due to the modelling differences as well as statistical randomness...|$|R

30|$|During the {{measurements}} of the pressure drops, {{the contribution of the}} static heat load to the cryogenic transfer lines is invariably present; the mass flow rate induced by the static heat load of the LHe supply line is thus essential for the corresponding computation. The pressure drops related to the 220 -m LHe and CGHe transfer lines are directly measurable with pressure transducers available in VB # 1 and VB # 2, indicated with diamond symbols in Fig.  1. The Venturi-type flow meters (Forster and Graber 1996) are located at the CGHe return line upstream of both VB # 1 and VB # 2, as shown in Fig.  1. The pressure transducers and Venturi-type flow meters on VB # 1 and VB # 2 and the electric power of a heater inside <b>the</b> LHe <b>vessel</b> of <b>S</b> 0 were well calibrated before measurement. On maintaining constant both the level and pressure of <b>the</b> LHe <b>vessel</b> of <b>S</b> 0 and varying the electric power of a heater inside <b>the</b> LHe <b>vessel,</b> both <b>the</b> total mass flow rate and the accumulated static heat load of the LHe supply line from MD # 1 to S 0, with static heat load of S 0 included, can be deduced from the differential pressure of the CGHe flow read from the Venturi-type flow meter with the technique developed; refer to Lin et al. (2013). The range of the applied heater power is limited by several operating parameters, such as the pressure of MD # 1, the pressure of S 0, the openings of the LHe valves at VB # 1 and of the CGHe valves at VB # 1, the speed of turbines in CB # 1 etc. The LHe supply valve directly after MD # 1, the valves inside the SVB, and the cold return valve of the CB # 1 are fixed openings. For every setting of a new heater power for S 0, the corresponding total mass flow rate and pressure drops of the 220 -m flexible cryogenic transfer lines are measured from the average readout of the Venturi-type flow meter at VB # 2 and of the pressure transducers at VB # 1 and VB # 2 after the system attains a new thermal equilibrium. The duration to achieve another equilibrium state is much greater than what is taken for the measurement.|$|R

30|$|Next, we {{analyzed}} vascularization of muscle tissue engineered with ETV 2 -iEC in vivo. Blocks of hind leg muscle of nude mice were surgically removed {{and replaced with}} our engineered tissue in the same position. Fifteen days after engineered muscle tissue implantation, they were removed and analyzed histologically (Fig.  2 C). H&E staining revealed that tissue generated by co-injection of HSkMCs and ETV 2 -iEC survived in PLLA/PLGA and had formed many vessels (Fig.  2 D). Immunohistochemistry results revealed positive ETV 2 expression abundantly around <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> supporting an inductive role of ETV 2 in forming new vessels (Fig.  2 E). ETV 2 -GFP lentivirus were used to produce GFP-tagged ETV 2 -induced endothelial cells for engineered muscle tissue. This confirmed that our ETV 2 -iEC had contributed to functional vessels formation which enclosed circulating red blood cells (Fig.  2 F). Immunohistochemistry staining using human specific anti-CDH 5 antibody indicated that these human CDH 5 positive cells were further incorporated into functional vessels in nude mice with red blood cells inside, indicating successful blood circulation (Fig.  2 G). Similar results were obtained from tissue grown in decellularized scaffolds (Fig. S 6 E and S 6 F). It seems that the types of scaffold materials did not significantly affect angiogenesis induced by ETV 2 -iEC. Anti-human nuclei antibody staining confirmed that human cells contributed to <b>the</b> blood <b>vessels</b> (Fig. <b>S</b> 8). Muscle tissue with ETV 2 -iEC also contained some human PECAM 1 positive cells in <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> area, indicate <b>the</b> maturation of these endothelial-like cells (Figs.  2 H and S 6 G). Thus, we proved that ETV 2 -iEC contributed to functional blood vessels formation in engineered muscle. This finding suggests possibility of engineering isogenic vascularized muscle tissue using a single source of patient-specific skeletal muscle cells.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic hypoxia {{influences}} {{gene expression}} in the lung resulting in pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodelling. For specific investigation of the vascular compartment, laser-microdissection of intrapulmonary arteries was combined with array profiling. Methods and Results Analysis was performed on mice subjected to 1, 7 and 21 days of hypoxia (FiO 2 = 0. 1) using nylon filters (1176 spots). Changes in the expression of 29, 38, and 42 genes were observed at day 1, 7, and 21, respectively. Genes were grouped into 5 different classes based on their time course of response. Gene regulation obtained by array analysis was confirmed by real-time PCR. Additionally, {{the expression of the}} growth mediators PDGF-B, TGF-β, TSP- 1, SRF, FGF- 2, TIE- 2 receptor, and VEGF-R 1 were determined by real-time PCR. At day 1, transcription modulators and ion-related proteins were predominantly regulated. However, at day 7 and 21 differential expression of matrix producing and degrading genes was observed, indicating ongoing structural alterations. Among the 21 genes upregulated at day 1, 15 genes were identified carrying potential hypoxia response elements (HREs) for hypoxia-induced transcription factors. Three differentially expressed genes (S 100 A 4, CD 36 and FKBP 1 a) were examined by immunohistochemistry confirming the regulation on protein level. While FKBP 1 a was restricted to <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> adventitia, <b>S</b> 100 A 4 and CD 36 were localised in the vascular tunica media. Conclusion Laser-microdissection and array profiling has revealed several new genes involved in lung vascular remodelling in response to hypoxia. Immunohistochemistry confirmed regulation of three proteins and specified their localisation in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts indicating involvement of different cells types in the remodelling process. The approach allows deeper insight into hypoxic regulatory pathways specifically in the vascular compartment of this complex organ. </p...|$|R

40|$|Focusing on {{the work}} of Thomas Campion, Samuel Daniel, Ben Jonson, and John Dryden, this {{dissertation}} argues that the modern critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> was constructed in seventeenth-century England. It supplements contemporary scholarly accounts of the origin of modern criticism by looking at the topic from a fresh perspective. Many contemporary studies assume that the modern critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> cultural <b>identity</b> was formed prior to or simultaneously with the concepts of literature, the author, and the canon. While the critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> was constructed during the same period as these concepts, why it emerged has not yet been fully explored. This dissertation treats the origin, construction, and development of this identity. ^ Beginning at least as early as {{the last decade of the}} sixteenth century, significant debates about vernacular “criticism” took the form of battles between ancients and moderns. By tracing these battles, scholars can observe the construction of the modern critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity.</b> Such an analysis amends traditional chronologies of criticism 2 ̆ 7 s development, for it suggests that some of the cultural forces that scholarship associates with the formation of criticism in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were already in evidence by the last decade of the sixteenth. At this time, the critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> was being constructed to perform a dual function: to address the effects of nascent print-capitalism and to aid in the formation of England 2 ̆ 7 s national literary tradition. The critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> was then continually reconstructed throughout the seventeenth century in response to these same cultural forces. Most notably, critics, responding to the changing conditions of textual production, dissemination, and consumption, attempted to form and regulate the tastes of readers so that the “best” texts would survive in the expanding print marketplace. Thus, modern criticism emerges earlier than has previously been argued. This dissertation concludes that John Dryden does not usher in modern criticism, but is the heir of Renaissance humanist concerns about the effects of print-capitalism, and that Alexander Pope 2 ̆ 7 s An Essay on Criticism is thoroughly anticipated by Ben Jonson 2 ̆ 7 s commonplace book, Discoveries. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{assessment}} {{has been carried}} out to discover whether reliability centred maintenance (RCM) is an applicable method to construct a maintenance program for a specific system on board a vessel within Wilhelmsen Ship Management s (WSM) fleet. Constructing efficient and appropriate maintenance programs for technical equipment on ships has become a key concern in the maritime industry. This is a result of a growing concern towards environmental and safety aspects, as well as an increased usage of capital intensive vessels, giving large downtime costs if normal operation is interrupted (Rasmussen, 2003). Maintenance programs connected to technical ship systems are commonly defined by recommendations from manufacturers and classification societies (Mokashi et al., 2002). Yet, it is not necessarily given that the recommended practices are outlined in an optimal manner considering the equipment in its operating context (Linton, 2011, Wang et al., 2010). Henceforth, the issue addressed within the present study is how the RCM practice can be employed as an alternative approach, which is of relevance to create a maintenance program more on the premises of the equipment. This has been achieved by analysing an engine and its auxiliary systems installed on a vessel operated by WSM. These included the engine s sea- and freshwater cooling system, lubrication oil system and fuel system. The purpose has been to evaluate the RCM applicability in a maritime context and discuss if the resulting maintenance program could obtain an improved effect for a <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> operation compared to following the common trend in traditional maritime maintenance. The development of the analysis is based on the RCM perspective of Moubray (1997) and criteria outlined in SAE International (1999). The technique provides advantages in handling various equipment and focuses on maintaining the function of a system in a cost effective manner (Selvik and Aven, 2011). The analysis was performed for the equipment through four stages. This involved establishing function descriptions, functional failures, failure modes, effects and criticality (FMECA) worksheets and proper maintenance tasks, focusing on each listed failure mode. System explanations were also included to describe the equipment being analysed. Criticality and risk evaluations were carried out in accordance with WSM s outlined consequence parameters and risk matrix. The majority of the data input was set during an RCM workshop at WSM s office. The first three stages founded the necessary basis to determine the final maintenance program. Applying the RCM process on the engine determined that the most critical failure modes potentially leading to engine stop were failure of its auxiliary systems, disregarding any engine component failure. The FMECA pointed out that the majority of failure modes at the lowest causation level were considered to have low criticality. Failure modes obtaining the highest risk indexes were: 	Closing valve failure and blackout of switchboards in the seawater cooling system 	Lack of chemical dosing in the freshwater cooling system 	Contaminated oil, filter failure and old oil in the lubrication oil system 	Wear/fatigue and assembly error for the purifier in the fuel oil system The information gathered in the FMECA enabled tailoring the maintenance to handle each evaluated failure mode, resulting in a program of both corrective and preventive actions. Further, the results were structured to provide a framework for continuous improvement and update of the maintenance program. The results provided a thorough arrangement of equipment data applicable for legitimating the choice of tasks in the maintenance program. Most of the evaluated failure modes received low risk indexes, resulting in more corrective means than expected. This indicated that it could be relevant for WSM to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> spare part program. The diversity of tasks in the maintenance program corresponded well to the perception of RCM prioritising actions that improve system reliability. Due to limited time during the RCM workshop, the volume of equipment included in the analysis had to be reduced from the initial plan. However, this illustrated one of the known drawbacks of RCM, which is its extensive need for time and resources. From the analysis, it is clear that RCM may very well suit a maritime context. Constructing a maintenance program by employing this practice would provide beneficial results for a shipping company. Yet, the method is mainly considered applicable to fit equipment that by function failure would be critical towards safety and/or operation...|$|R
