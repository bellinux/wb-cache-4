5|$|Gary states <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> she was {{attracted}} to the film {{was the idea of}} an on-screen romance with Oscar winner Michael Caine. Caine had previously starred in another Peter Benchley-adapted flop, The Island.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> {{the episode}} {{worked so well}} was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location. VanDerWerff agreed, and added that with each episode the writers got bolder {{in the sense that}} they added new scenes not included in the book to round out the source material.|$|E

5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the incumbent president were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed {{that led to the}} third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed {{for at least two years}} into the future. An interim government is tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter pundit John Granger {{additionally}} noted <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> the Harry Potter {{books were}} so popular is {{their use of}} literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism. In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ. While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.|$|E

He later said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> he did not run in the general {{election}} as a third-party candidate, after losing the primaries, was that, as a concession to gain ballot access in certain states, he had signed legally binding agreements to not run a third-party campaign if he lost the primary. Some of the $4 million remaining campaign contributions was invested into the new political action and advocacy group called Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty.|$|E

5|$|The band {{encountered}} several setbacks {{through the}} second half of 2014. The August concert in Tel Aviv was canceled due to an armed conflict between Israel and Gaza. Megadeth was scheduled to appear on Motörhead's Motörboat cruise in late September, but withdrew because of Mustaine's complications following his cervical spine surgery. In late November, Drover quit the band after ten years, wanting to pursue his own musical interests. This was quickly followed by the departure of Broderick, due to artistic and musical differences. Ellefson denied rumors that Megadeth would disband, and said he and Mustaine would continue working on new music. Mustaine said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for Broderick's and Drover's departure was the frustration caused by Megadeth's fan base demanding a reunion with Friedman and Menza. Tragically, former Megadeth drummer Nick Menza died from a heart attack on May 21, 2016 while performing with OHM at a jazz club in Los Angeles. Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Kiko Loureiro of Angra were brought in to perform on Megadeth's fifteenth studio album.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, Carleton S.

25|$|Civilians were {{reportedly}} celebrating in Tripoli's streets as rebel forces entered {{the city with}} little resistance. A senior rebel official, Fathi al-Baja, told the Associated Press <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for his group's rapid advance was that Mohammed Eshkal, the head of Mohammed Megrayef Brigade which was assigned to defend the city, was sympathetic to the rebels since the regime had killed his cousin years earlier, such that when rebels reached the gates of Tripoli, the battalion promptly surrendered, allowing the rebels to sweep into the capital with relative ease, facing little resistance.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{following}} the successful American moon landings, premier Leonid Brezhnev decided {{to cancel the}} troubled Soviet program to send a man to the Moon. He consolidated the Soviet space program, moving Vasily Mishin's OKB-1 (Korolev's former design bureau), {{as well as other}} bureaus, into a single bureau headed by Glushko, later named NPO Energia. Glushko's first act, after firing Mishin altogether, was to cancel the N-1 rocket, a program he had long criticized, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for its difficulties was his own refusal to design the high power engines Korolev needed because of friction between the two men and ostensibly a disagreement over the use of cryogenic or hypergolic fuel.|$|E

25|$|Sega was {{supportive}} of the team's rewriting of the plot, sending over quality assurance and cohesion strike teams {{to make sure there}} were no issues with the in-game reactivity or plot holes, but they didn't have much involvement in regards to the narrative itself, with the publisher mainly focusing on the game and combat design. However, Urquhart said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the game's development problems was due to indecision on Sega's part, particularly in regards to budgeting; he gave an example of one long segment of the game that cost around US$500,000 to produce, which was eventually cut because Sega thought it wasn't a good fit for the game.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2002, Li {{left the}} {{national}} tennis team to study part-time at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), where she completed her bachelor's degree in journalism in 2009. The Chinese media cited various reasons for this. Some reported {{that the relationship between}} her and her teammate and future husband, Jiang Shan (姜山), was opposed by the national team's management, some reported that her coach, Yu Liqiao (余丽桥), was too strict and demanding, while other reports claimed that her request for a personal coach did not go through. However, some regarded that it was just the health problem leading to the retirement. The New York Times reported <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> was that a team leader wanted her to play through by taking hormone medicine as Li struggled with her performance due to hormone imbalance.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the militants}} active in Kashmir {{were trained in}} the same Madrasahs as Taliban and al-Qaeda.

In a 'Letter to American People' written by bin Laden in 2002 he stated <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> he was fighting America is because of its support to India on the Kashmir issue. In November 2001, Kathmandu airport went on high alert after threats that bin Laden planned to hijack a plane from there and crash it into a target in New Delhi. In 2002, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, {{on a trip to}} Delhi, suggested that al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir though he did not have any hard evidence. He proposed hi tech ground sensors along the line of control to prevent militants from infiltrating into Indian administered Kashmir.|$|E
