5|$|On 11 July, the Indian troops {{commenced}} their attack. These strikes {{continued for}} another four days. But reports regarding the situation {{suggested that the}} Pakistanis were still in command of a strategically important position and the Indian commanders decided that these had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> before the advance could continue. Apart from this position, another position was also <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> by the Indians. The task of capturing these two positions {{was assigned to the}} 6th Rajputana Rifles. Two companies were assigned to the operation, with the battalion's 'C' Company securing the second position after the first was captured by 'D' Company.|$|E

Their orders are to cut out Snow's heart {{and bring it to}} the Queen. Charming attacks the henchmen with his sword, killing two. One henchman gets away with Snow, and Charming quickly dispatches him with an arrow. Now that he has saved Snow, she decides to trust him, and agrees to lead him to the place where she sold the items.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1643, most of the {{south-west}} {{was under}} Royalist control; only Plymouth, Poole and Lyme Regis held out against them. The Parliamentarians controlled the navy, and Lyme Regis was strategically important, due to its location between Bristol and the English Channel. In early 1644, Charles I ordered Lyme Regis <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured,</b> and sent a large force {{under the command of}} his nephew, Prince Maurice.|$|E
5|$|During her regency in Hungary, Elizabeth faced several rebellions led by John Horvat and John of Palisna, who {{attempted}} {{to take advantage of}} Mary's insecure reign. In 1385, they invited King CharlesIII of Naples to depose Mary and assume the crown. Elizabeth responded by having Charles murdered two months after his coronation, in 1386. She had the crown restored to her daughter and established herself as regent once more, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured,</b> imprisoned and ultimately strangled by her enemies.|$|E
5|$|For their part, the 1st Airborne Division was {{to conduct}} three brigade-size {{airborne}} operations; the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> by 1st Airlanding Brigade (Operation Ladbroke), {{the port of}} Augusta was to be seized by 2nd Parachute Brigade (Operation Glutton), and finally the Primasole Bridge over the River Simeto was to be taken by 1st Parachute Brigade (Operation Fustian).|$|E

5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured.</b> Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 the German {{physicist}} Albert Betz {{showed that}} for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the wind <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured.</b> This Betz limit can be approached in modern turbine designs, which may reach 70 to 80% of the theoretical Betz limit.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, actor James Garner claimed {{responsibility}} for the wording of the slogan during an interview with Playboy magazine. Garner, who narrated the original commercial, stated that his first action ever <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> on film was to misread the line that had been provided to him. However, as noted above, the advertisements first appeared in print before their debut on television, which cast doubt on Garner's claim.|$|E

5|$|On July 18, 1862, {{during the}} Newburgh Raid, Confederate officer Adam Johnson briefly {{captured}} Newburgh, Indiana, {{making it the}} first town in a Northern state <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> during the American Civil War. Johnson and his men succeeded after convincing the town's Union garrison that they had cannon on the surrounding hills (they were merely camouflaged stovepipes). The raid convinced the federal government {{of the need to}} supply Indiana with a permanent force of regular Union Army soldiers to counter future raids.|$|E
5|$|Pike and his men, {{knowing they}} risk being double-crossed by Mapache, devise {{a way of}} {{bringing}} him the stolen weapons without him double-crossing them.

Surrounded by Mapache's army, Angel desperately tries to escape, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> and tortured. Mapache lets Engstrom go, and he rejoins Pike's gang and tells them what happened.|$|E
5|$|The {{recruitment}} of Rookwood, Tresham and Digby {{coincided with a}} series of meetings in various taverns across London, during which the last remaining details were worked out.

5|$|Throughout the morning, the Germans mopped up British {{survivors}} and stragglers in hiding around Arnhem bridge. It took several hours {{to clear the}} bridge of debris allowing German armour to cross and reinforce Nijmegen. Crucially, the British had held the bridge long enough to allow Nijmegen bridge <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> by the 82nd Airborne and Guards' Armoured Division working together. With the resistance at the bridge crushed, the Germans had more troops available to commit to the Oosterbeek engagement, although this changed suddenly in the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|With its {{increasing}} {{prosperity and}} population, Wagga Wagga {{and the surrounding}} district became a place of interest to several infamous bushrangers. The Wagga police magistrate Henry Baylis was bailed up by Mad Dog Morgan in 1863. Captain Moonlite and his band arrived in the district on 15 November 1879 and held up 39 people at Wantabadgery Station. Moonlite and his gang escaped a police pursuit only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> at another nearby property when police from the neighbouring townships of Gundagai and Adelong arrived.|$|E
5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and {{are thought to have}} formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E

30|$|Also worth {{discussing}} is {{the importance}} of the duration of the migration spell. Although not always statistically different from zero, the length of the migration spell is generally inversely related to work injury and fatality rates. As noted by Orrenius and Zavodny (2009), this coefficient could <b>be</b> <b>capturing</b> both assimilation and cohort effects. Nonetheless, given that we are focusing on one decade, we <b>are</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capturing</b> the former. Additionally, immigrants for whom Spanish is their native tongue appear less likely to work in risky jobs and, in particular, less risky industries.|$|R

5|$|After {{consulting}} with Deep Throat, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) travels to Townsend and takes {{photos of the}} crash site, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured.</b> After being interrogated by Henderson, Mulder is detained alongside an eccentric NICAP member named Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), who was also captured in the woods. The next morning, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives to retrieve Mulder, telling him that FBI Section Chief Joseph McGrath is threatening {{to shut down the}} X-Files because of his behavior. She also claims that the wreckage has been identified as a downed Libyan fighter jet; Mulder dismisses this explanation. Meanwhile, the invisible occupant of the UFO passes through an electronic fence set up around the crash site, escaping into the outside world.|$|E
5|$|At {{several points}} {{in the history of}} the Isles, the realm endured periods of {{fragmentation}} between rival factions. Whether the references to Lǫgmaðr in the north are evidence of a similarly partitioned kingdom is unknown. The Norwegian subjugation of the Isles, and subsequent capture of Lǫgmaðr, are recounted by several sources. For instance, Orkneyinga saga states as much; whilst Morkinskinna further specifies that Lǫgmaðr fled southwards and out to sea, as Magnús' fleet advanced, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> and kept in the Norwegian king's company for some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Claus and Lavie are {{initially}} {{treated as}} intruders but eventually befriend {{the crew of}} the Silvana. They learn that the Guild intends to capture Alvis for reasons unknown to them.
