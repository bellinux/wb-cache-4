5|$|On 21 July 1933, {{more than}} 600 Assyrians, led by Malik Yaqu, {{crossed the border}} into Syria in hope of {{receiving}} asylum from the French Mandate of Syria. They were, however, disarmed and refused asylum, and were subsequently given light arms and sent back to Iraq on 4 August. They then decided to surrender themselves to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army. While crossing the Tigris in the Assyrian village of Dirabun, a clash erupted between the Assyrians and an Iraqi Army brigade. Despite the advantage of heavy artillery, the Iraqis were driven back to their military base in Dirabun. The Assyrians, convinced that the army had targeted them deliberately, attacked an army barracks with little success. They were driven back to Syria upon the arrival of Iraqi aeroplanes. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army lost 33 soldiers during the fighting while the Assyrian irregulars took fewer casualties. Historians do not agree on who started the clashes at the border. The British Administrative Inspector for Mosul, Lieutenant Colonel R. R. Stafford, wrote that the Assyrians {{had no intention of}} clashing with the Iraqis, while <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> historian Khaldun Husry (son of the prominent Arab nationalist Sati' al-Husri) claims that it was Yaqu's men who provoked the army at Dirabun. Husry supported the propaganda rumours, which circulated in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> nationalist newspapers, of the Assyrians mutilating the bodies of the killed Iraqi soldiers. This further enraged <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> public against the Assyrians.|$|E

50|$|The battle {{began with}} Iraqi air raids against key points and {{mechanised}} divisions advancing {{on the city}} in a crescent-like formation.

The Iranians flooded the marsh areas around the city, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> to traverse through narrow strips of land. Iraqi tanks launched attacks with no infantry support, and many tanks were lost to Iranian anti-tank teams. However, by 30 September, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> had managed to clear the Iranians from {{the outskirts of the}} city. The next day, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> launched infantry and armoured attacks into the city. After heavy house-to-house fighting, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> were repelled.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> {{offensive}} {{began on}} the night of 29 January, when approximately 2,000 soldiers in several hundred armored fighting vehicles moved south. The Gulf War's first ground engagement was near observation post 4, built on the Al-Zabr police building. Elements of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> 6th Armored Brigade, ordered to take the heights above Al-Zabr, engaged Coalition units at Al-Zabr. At 20:00 hours, U.S. Marines at the observation post, who had noticed large groups of armored vehicles through their night vision devices, attempted to talk to battalion headquarters but received no response. Contact was not established until 20:30 hours, which prompted Task Force Shepard to respond to the threat. Coalition soldiers at observation post 4 opened fire on <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> column, but this largely ineffective fire drew a heavy Iraqi response which forced the company to retire south, by order of its commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|To {{cover the}} withdrawal, the company's platoon of LAV-25s and LAV-ATs ({{anti-tank}} variants) moved to engage <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> force.

The column was engaged by Coalition A-10s and Harrier jump jets. This was then followed by another column with an estimated 29 tanks. One of the column's T-62 tanks was engaged by an anti-tank missile and destroyed. Coalition air support, provided by A-10s and F-16s, engaged <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> drive through observation post 1 and ultimately repulsed the attack back over the Kuwaiti border. Aircraft continued to engage the columns throughout the night, until the next morning. Another column of Iraqi tanks, approaching observation post 2, were engaged by aircraft and also repulsed that night.|$|E
