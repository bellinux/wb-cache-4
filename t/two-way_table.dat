40|$|A {{small area}} {{procedure}} for a <b>two-way</b> <b>table</b> of proportions is developed, where the estimated proportions {{are from a}} complex survey. Estimation is difficult because the observed proportions do not have multinomial distri-butions, the observed proportions are correlated with estimated variances, benchmarking is required, and mean models are nonlinear. A predictor based on a nonlinear mixed model is specified for the proportions. No transformation of the observations is involved, and the estimation proce-dure gives predictions {{that are in the}} parameter space. A bootstrap estima-tor of the mean squared error of a benchmarked predictor is suggested and performed well in simulations. The procedure is applied to the proportions in the <b>two-way</b> <b>table</b> defined by occupations crossed with Canadian prov-inces. The direct estimators are from the Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS), and the corresponding <b>two-way</b> <b>table</b> from the previous Canadian Census of Population provides auxiliary information. The application of the prediction procedure to the LFS data leads to gains in estimated mean squared errors relative to the direct estimators between approximately 30 percent and 80 percent.

Dean exhibited three sculptural/site-specific pieces and a video at “Les Merveilles du Monde”, an international group exhibition at the Musee des Beaux Arts, Dunkirk. All works explored relationships between violation, repair and decoration. The sculptures were site-specific in that each involved a table/work surface that informed the piece in different ways, from a 2. 8 m long reproduction Edwardian dining table with French polished mahogany veneer on chipboard (<b>Two-Way</b> <b>Table)</b> to a 4 m long, melamine-topped, three-part shop counter (Counter). Each also involved extensive drilling, filling, colouring in, varnishing, sanding, not necessarily in this order. Each table was maintained as a table, however much of it Dean removed or replaced. Each work originated in a different context, which also informed its development: for example, <b>Two-Way</b> <b>Table</b> was made in a wood-panelled ex-ballroom during “The Greatest Show on Earth” (2003), a group exhibition including Tacita Dean and Douglas Gordon.

40|$|Genotype by {{environment}} interaction (GEI) is {{an important}} phenomenon in plant breeding. This paper presents a series of models for describing, exploring, understanding and predicting GEI. All models depart from a <b>two-way</b> <b>table</b> of genotype by environment means. First, a series of descriptive and explorative models/ approaches are presented: Finlay-Wilkinson model, AMMI model, GGE biplot. All of these approaches have in common that they merely try to group genotypes and environments and do not use other information than the <b>two-way</b> <b>table</b> of means. Next, factorial regression is introduced as an approach to explicitly introduce genotypic and environmental covariates for describing and explaining GEI. Finally, QTL modeling {{is presented as a}} natural extension of factorial regression, where marker information is translated into genetic predictors. Tests for regression coefficients corresponding to these genetic predictors are tests for main effect QTL expression and QTL by environment interaction (QEI). QTL models for which QEI depends on environmental covariables form an interesting model class for predicting GEI for new genotypes and new environments. For realistic modeling of genotypic differences across multiple environments, sophisticated mixed models are necessary to allow for heterogeneity of genetic variances and correlations across environments. The use and interpretation of all models is illustrated by an example data set from the CIMMYT maize breeding program, containing environments differing in drought and nitrogen stress. To help readers to carry out the statistical analyses, GenStat&# 174; programs, 15 th Edition and Discovery&# 174; version, are presented as supplementary material...|$|E
