40|$|Abstract—Cognitive radios allow {{unlicensed}} wireless {{users to}} access channels {{that are in}} the licensed spectrum bands. However, in a wireless network with cognitive radios, when a licensed user becomes active on a channel in a certain area, nodes and links that were using that channel must release it, which will cause <b>traffic</b> <b>failures.</b> Simple and effective recovery schemes are needed to re-allocate available resources for the failed traffic. In this paper, we study the failure recovery in wireless mesh networks with cognitive radios. We formally formulate the corresponding problems as integer linear programming problems. By solving them, we can obtain optimal solutions. Moreover, an efficient distributed heuristic algorithm is presented for fast recovery. Simulation results show that the performance given by our distributed algorithm is close to that of the optimal solutions.

40|$|In optical WDM networks, {{since each}} lightpath {{can carry a}} huge mount of <b>traffic,</b> <b>failures</b> may seriously damage the end user applications. Hence fault {{tolerance}} becomes an important issue on these networks. The light path which carries traffic during normal operation is called as primary path. The traffic is rerouted on a backup path {{in case of a}} failure. In this paper we propose to design a reliable and fault tolerant routing algorithm for establishing primary and backup paths. In order to establish the primary path, this algorithm uses load balancing in which link cost metrics are estimated based on the current load of the links. In backup path setup, the source calculates the blocking probability through the received feedback from the destination by sending a small fraction of probe packets along the existing paths. It then selects the optimal light path with the lowest blocking probability. Based on the simulation results, we show that the reliable and fault tolerant routing algorithm reduces the blocking probability and latency while increasing the throughput and channel utilization.

40|$|Railway traffic has {{increased}} {{over the last decade}} due to its fuel efficiency and the need to reduce emissions. The railway infrastructure performance needs to be measured to allow assets to be managed effectively against set objectives. Various systems are used to collect and store data on <b>traffic,</b> <b>failures,</b> inspections, track quality, etc. However, these systems are often used in an ad hoc manner, partly because of the weaknesses of traditional performance measurement systems. This paper proposes a link and effect model which is focused on the areas of continuous improvement, the key elements of strategic planning and on the underlying factors responsible for the railway performance. The model provides information on the performance of railway systems and components, and how they are linked {{to each other and to}} the overall objectives, thereby facilitating proactive decision-making. The model is applied in a case study on the Iron Ore Line, Sweden. The performance of a section of the line is studied in terms of failures, train delays and repair times, and ranked through a risk matrix and composite indicator.

40|$|Today’s {{networks}} typically handle {{traffic engineering}} (e. g., tuning the routing-protocol parameters {{to optimize the}} flow of <b>traffic)</b> and <b>failure</b> recovery (e. g., pre-installed backup paths) independently. In this paper, we propose a unified way to balance load efficiently under {{a wide range of}} failure scenarios. Our architecture supports flexible splitting of traffic over multiple precomputed paths, with efficient pathlevel failure detection and automatic load balancing over the remaining paths. We propose two candidate solutions that differ in how the routers rebalance the load after a failure, leading to a trade-off between router complexity and load-balancing performance. We present and solve the optimization problems that compute the configuration state for each router. Our experiments with traffic measurements and topology data (including shared risks in the underlying transport network) from a large ISP identify a “sweet spot” that achieves near-optimal load balancing under a variety of failure scenarios, with a relatively small amount of state in the routers. We believe that our solution for joint <b>traffic</b> engineering and <b>failure</b> recovery will appeal to Internet Service Providers as well as the operators of data-center networks...|$|R

30|$|According to [7], when (A-D) fails, {{the only}} {{available}} rerouting path is A-B-H-G-F-E-C-D {{because if we}} choose path H-G-K, {{there would be a}} conflict at node G. When (C-D) fails, the traffic that comes from failure (A-D) will be rerouted by C. To reroute the <b>traffic</b> of <b>failure</b> (C-D), node C must transfer the traffic back to G; then, there are two possibilities: use G-H-B-A-D as the rerouting path, or transfer the traffic through link (G-K). We cannot use G-H-B-A because the traffic would be transferred indefinitely between A and C. Therefore, we must use F-G-K as the rerouting path in this situation.|$|R

40|$|During {{mechanised}} forest harvesting, extraction routes may be armoured with a dense {{carpet of}} logging residues (slash roads) to reduce soil disturbance associated with heavy machinery. However, guidelines regarding {{the design of}} slash roads remain largely qualitative, and their efficacy {{as a means of}} ground protection uncertain. Trials were undertaken in north-east England and south-west Scotland to identify the main causes of slash road <b>failure</b> during repeated <b>trafficking.</b> <b>Failure</b> of the slash roads was defined as (a) deflection of logging residues and exposure of the ground surface to harvesting machinery or (b) mixing of logging residues with surface soils. The frequency of slash road failure was directly linked to terrain factors (soil water content, the presence of rocks, tree stumps, furrows and drain channels, or slope). In addition, failure was linked to the design of the slash roads where large diameter logging residues were readily deflected, or at junctions and turning points where 'shearing' of the slash road took place. A simple means of assessing the potential for slash road failure is presented based on terrain characteristics. These guidelines allow harvesting staff to locate extraction routes in order to maximise the structural longevity of the slash road, whilst reducing down-time associated with their repair. In addition, and where standard yield tables apply, a means of predicting the volume of logging residues available at any site is demonstrated, and the implications of this for effective slash road construction are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Multimedia distribution, {{especially}} broadcast TV distribution over an IP network requires {{high bandwidth}} combined with tight latency and loss constraints, even under failure conditions. Due to high bandwidth requirements of broadcast TV distribution, use of IP-based multicast to distribute TV content {{is needed for}} capacity efficiency. The protection and restoration mechanisms currently adopted in IP backbones use either IGP re-convergence or some form of Fast Reroute. The IGP re-convergence mechanism is too slow for real-time multimedia distribution while a drawback of fast reroute is that since they re-route traffic on a link-basis (instead of end-to-end) they can suffer <b>traffic</b> overlap during <b>failures.</b> Here <b>traffic</b> overlap {{is defined as the}} same traffic passing through the same link along the same direction more than once, which requires more link capacity. We propose a method that interacts with Fast Reroute and multicast to minimize <b>traffic</b> overlap during <b>failures.</b> We also present an algorithm for linkweight setting that avoids traffic overlap for any single link failure. Performance analysis shows that the proposed method improves network service availability and significantly reduces the impact of failure events...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{quantify}} scalability of network resilience upon failures. We characterize resilience as {{the percentage of}} lost <b>traffic</b> upon <b>failures</b> [5] and define scalability as the growth rate of the percentage of lost traffic with respect to network size, link <b>failure</b> probability and <b>traffic</b> for given <b>failure</b> protection schemes. We apply probabilistic graphical models to characterize statistical spatial dependence between physical-layer failures and logical network topologies for traffic flows. We then derive the scalability for large networks of different topologies. We first focus on the scalability of resilience for regular topologies under uniform traffic with independent and dependent link failures, with and without protection. For large networks with small probabilities of failures and without protection, we show that the scalability of network resilience grows linearly with the average route length and with the effective link failure probability. For large networks with 1 + 1 protection, we obtain lower and upper bound of the percentage of lost traffic. We derive approximations of the scalability for arbitrary topologies, and attain close-form analytical results for ring, star, and mesh-torus topologies. We then study network resilience under random traffic with Poisson arrivals. We find that when the network is under light load (small traffic arrival rate), the network resilience is reduced to that under uniform deterministic traffic. Our scalability analysis shows explicitly how network resilience varies with different factors and provides insights for resilient network design...|$|R
