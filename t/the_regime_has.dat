25|$|According to US {{think tank}} Freedom House, since the 1990s the Islamic Republic of Iran has {{sometimes}} used death squads against converts, including major Protestant leaders.

25|$|There {{is another}} {{powerful}} factor which works against {{the chance of}} any kind of peaceful reconstruction and which is equally negative for all levels of society: this is the extreme isolation in which <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>has</b> placed both society and itself. This isolation has not only separated the regime from society, and all sectors of society from each other, but also put the country in extreme isolation {{from the rest of the}} world. This isolation has created for all—from the bureaucratic elite to the lowest social levels—an almost surrealistic picture of the world and of their place in it. Yet the longer this state of affairs helps to perpetuate the status quo, the more rapid and decisive will be its collapse when confrontation with reality becomes inevitable.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{scholarship}} in Iran {{has a long}} tradition of debate and critique. This tradition has come to pose a challenge to the constitutional order of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as a number of seminary-trained scholars have applied their critical methods to basic issues of state legitimacy, in particular the state’s right to insist on interpretive closure. For example, Dr. Mehdi Ha’iri Yazdi, the son of the late Shaykh Abdolkarim Haeri, the founding member of the Qom Theology School, has written a book about criticism of velayat-e faqıh. <b>The</b> <b>regime</b> <b>has</b> responded with force, convening special clergy courts to silence and imprison scholars, in violation of seminary norms of scholarly debate. These conspicuous acts of discipline seem to have backfired, as each escalating punishment has generated new critics within.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} ignorance, by Lionel Robbins, {{focuses on the}} market failure as causes for lack of {{economic}} development. It describes the purpose of governments as the distribution of resources. As resources are scarce, <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>has</b> to allocate those resources wisely to encourage economic growth. Therefore, lack of economic growth {{is caused by the}} inability to carry out correct decisions in allocating economic resources. For example, the previous president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, focused his policies only on developing the country's industries, {{which turned out to be}} disastrous to the economy. His successor, Kofi Abrefa Busia, knowing the mistakes of Nkrumah, still carried out the same expansionary economic policy, not because he did not know what policy was good or bad—because of ignorance—but because the institutional design in Ghana pushed him to do so. This example demonstrates that ignorance oversimplifies the situations and cannot offer a satisfactory explanation for why nations fail. First, this theory assumes that rulers are benevolent, and ignore the possibility that rulers intentionally carry out bad economic decisions for personal interests. Second, if a leader's ignorance is the cause, then by having a better and less ignorant leader, the country will witness greater economic growth. Yet, this isn't always the case.|$|E

He is intercepted by the Justice League, with it turning into a brawl between the Justice League and the Atlanteans. Superman, having undergone {{the death of his}} wife and unborn child and the destruction of Metropolis, threatens Aquaman to stop his efforts. While warned over a communication link with Batman not to test him, Aquaman does by summoning a kraken. In response Superman, Green Lantern, Shazam, and Wonder Woman lift the entire city of Atlantis off the sea floor and carry it to dry deserts, putting its inhabitants in harm to bully Aquaman. He relents {{and as a result of}} this largely abstains from the conflict between the Regime (led by Superman) and the Insurgency (led by Batman). In Year Four, he gets involved when Batman informs him that the Greek gods have attempted to force their own rule over the world, so Aquaman and Mera take on Poseidon. He wins the conflict as his wife stalls a massive tidal wave from crashing on Themiscyra. Superman comes to Atlantis in Year Five to ensure <b>the</b> <b>Regime</b> <b>has</b> Aquaman's support, despite Aquaman having frequently made it clear he is not choosing sides. He agrees purely to get him to leave.|$|E
500|$|The Scottish {{legal system}} was {{effectively}} suspended after the English occupation. All courts that derived from [...] "Charles Stuart", including Sheriff's Courts were suspended. Kirk sessions, however, continued to meet largely unhindered, neither sanctioned nor recognised by the Commonwealth. The legal {{functions of the}} Privy Council and Court of Session were taken over by seven commissioners, four Englishmen and three Scots. These proved more impartial than previous judges, probably {{because they were not}} tied to the major families and political factions by patronage and kinship. Local barony courts and heritable jurisdictions, in abeyance from 1651, were officially abolished in 1657. Sheriff's courts were re-established and Justices of the Peace returned in 1656. The result was a small flood of witchcraft cases, with 102 between 1657–59, which compares with over 600 after the Scottish courts were fully re-established after 1660. Generally <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>has</b> been seen as successful in enforcing law and order, suppressing the banditry of moss-troopers.
