5|$|At times, Beecher's has {{encountered}} challenges in maintaining this uniform standard. For example, when flooding affected one farm, the cows there produced enzymes in their milk that helped their calves {{to fight off}} bacteria, but changed <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> milk.|$|E
5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose {{function}} is to add to <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cake changing, and a painting {{given to him by}} Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
50|$|Fruit vinegars {{are made}} from fruit wines, usually without any {{additional}} <b>flavoring.</b> Common <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> fruit vinegar include apple, blackcurrant, raspberry, quince, and tomato. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original fruits remain in the final product.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine {{varies with}} the terroir. In the west, where the soil is more sandy, the wines are lighter; in the south, where the soil is more gravelly, <b>the</b> {{proportion}} <b>of</b> Merlot is lower, and the wines tend more towards <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Médoc.|$|R

25|$|Appert's {{preservation}} by boiling involved {{heating the}} food to an unnecessarily high temperature, and for an unnecessarily long time, which could destroy some of <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preserved food.|$|E
25|$|TrueType fonts use {{composite}} Bézier curves {{composed of}} quadratic Bézier curves. Modern imaging systems like PostScript, Asymptote, Metafont, and SVG use composite Béziers composed of cubic Bézier curves for drawing curved shapes. OpenType fonts can use either kind, depending on <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> font.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{ripening}} process {{was developed to}} imitate aged raw pu'er, many arguments surround the idea of whether aging ripened pu'er is desirable. Mostly, the issue rests on whether aging ripened pu'er will, better or worse, alter <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tea.|$|E
50|$|A {{successful}} braise intermingles <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foods being {{cooked with}} those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooking liquid. This cooking method dissolves the meat's collagen into gelatin, which can greatly enrich and thicken the liquid. Braising is economical (as it allows <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> tough and inexpensive cuts), and efficient (as it often enables an entire meal {{to be prepared}} in a single pot or pan).|$|R
50|$|Coriander {{contains}} {{a lot of}} volatile oil. This oil can get rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meat.The <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> coriander can promote gastrointestinal peristalsis.|$|R
25|$|Within Pakistan, cuisine varies {{greatly from}} region to region, {{reflecting}} the country's {{ethnic and cultural}} diversity. Food from <b>the</b> eastern provinces <b>of</b> Punjab and Sindh can be highly seasoned and spicy, which is characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Asian region. Food {{in other parts of}} Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas also hold distinct tastes based on various regional influences.|$|R
25|$|The past went that-a-way. When {{faced with}} a totally new {{situation}} we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most recent past. We look at the present through a rear-view mirror. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in Bonanza-land.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{city has}} been defined by its people. Throughout its history, first-generation {{immigrants}} have been dominant, introducing their languages, religions, and cultures. The influx of peoples is illustrated by its institutions, built by French, French Canadian, German, Swedish, Irish, Czech, Austro-Hungarian, Polish, Italian, Mexican, Somali and Hmong people.|$|E
25|$|Humidity : The {{higher the}} humidity, {{the faster the}} tea will age. Liquid water accumulating on tea may {{accelerate}} the aging process but can also cause the growth of mold or make <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tea less desirable. 60–85% humidity is recommended. It is argued whether tea quality is adversely affected if it is subjected to highly fluctuating humidity levels.|$|E
25|$|Slow-simmered stews {{with various}} {{ingredients}} are another common food staple in Ivory Coast. Kedjenou is a dish consisting of chicken and vegetables that are slow-cooked {{in a sealed}} pot {{with little or no}} added liquid, which concentrates <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chicken and vegetables and tenderizes the chicken. It is usually cooked in a pottery jar called a canary, over a slight fire, or cooked in an oven. Bangui is a local palm wine.|$|R
50|$|Flambéing {{is often}} {{associated}} with tableside presentation of certain liqueur-drenched dishes, such as Bananas Foster or Cherries Jubilee, when the alcohol is ignited and results in a flare of blue-tinged flame. However, flambéing is also a step in making coq au vin, and other dishes and sauces, using spirits, before they are brought to the table. By partially burning off the volatile alcohol, flambéing reduces <b>the</b> alcoholic content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dish while keeping <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquor.|$|R
2500|$|Stir frying (...) is a Chinese cooking {{technique}} in which ingredients are fried {{in a small}} amount of very hot oil while being stirred in a wok. The technique originated in China and in recent centuries has spread into other parts <b>of</b> Asia and <b>the</b> West. Even though this has been disproved by research, many still claim that this quick, hot cooking seals in <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foods, as well as preserving their color and texture.|$|R
25|$|Unlike more {{aromatic}} {{red wine}} varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Pinot noir, Tempranillo has a relatively neutral profile {{so it is}} often blended with other varieties, such as Grenache and Carignan (known in Rioja as Mazuelo), or aged for extended periods in oak where the wine easily takes on <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrel. Varietal examples of Tempranillo usually exhibit flavors of plum and strawberries.|$|E
25|$|His {{focus on}} the {{business}} extended to <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beer itself. Carl Conrad held the trademark for the name Budweiser and had Anheuser-Busch manufacture it for him. Conrad was an importer of wines and champagnes. Busch studied the pilsner process in Europe, which was used for brewing Budweiser. Adolphus bought the rights to Budweiser from Conrad in October 1882 when Conrad went bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|While {{normally}} and traditionally made of yeasted wheat, in {{the late}} 20th century variations on the bagel flourished. Non-traditional versions that change the dough recipe include pumpernickel, rye, sourdough, bran, whole wheat, and multigrain. Other variations change <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dough, often using blueberry, salt, onion, garlic, egg, cinnamon, raisin, chocolate chip, cheese, {{or some combination of}} the above. Green bagels are sometimes created for St. Patrick's Day.|$|E
50|$|American {{influence}} on Filipino food is how some authentic meal {{was turned into}} a frozen, defrost, cook it however one pleases, and enjoy. This technique was used on Filipino dishes when Marigold Commodities Corporation teamed up with Ditta Meat Food Service Company to create these frozen Filipino meals. They started in Austin, Texas, and released only a few dishes that would present incorporate <b>the</b> meat <b>of</b> America with <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippines to create Filipino American food.|$|R

50|$|Although his beak {{originally}} had two pink stripes, during the 1970s {{it became a}} tradition that each stripe on his beak represented one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pieces in the cereal: (red = cherry, yellow = lemon, orange = orange). <b>The</b> additions <b>of</b> new colors have made this color scheme no longer accurate. There are now eight colors <b>of</b> this cereal. <b>The</b> first new color was green, which was introduced in 1991, then purple in 1994, blue in 1996, pink in 2002, and gold in 2006.|$|R
25|$|Carbohydrate-containing plant {{materials}} {{are allowed to}} ferment, producing a dilute solution of ethanol in the process. Spirits such as whiskey and rum are prepared by distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol, including water, esters, and other alcohols, are collected in the condensate, which account for <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beverage. Some of these beverages are then stored in barrels or other containers to acquire more flavor compounds and characteristic flavors.|$|E
25|$|Metal pots {{are made}} from a narrow range of metals because pots and pans need to conduct heat well, but {{also need to be}} {{chemically}} unreactive so that they do not alter <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> food. Most materials that are conductive enough to heat evenly are too reactive to use in food preparation. In some cases (copper pots, for example), a pot may be made out of a more reactive metal, and then tinned or clad with another.|$|E
25|$|The mash {{is allowed}} to ferment, the {{resulting}} liquid collected and distilled in either clay or copper pots which will further modify <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final product. The distilled product is then bottled and sold. Unaged mezcal {{is referred to as}} joven, or young. Some of the distilled product is left to age in barrels between one month and four years, but some can be aged for as long as 12 years. Mezcal can reach an alcohol content of 55%. Like tequila, mezcal is distilled twice. The first distillation is known as punta, and comes out at around 75 proof (37.5% alcohol by volume). The liquid must then be distilled a second time to raise the alcohol percentage.|$|E
50|$|A {{large part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unique <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aggieville scene stems from <b>the</b> {{multitude}} <b>of</b> locally {{owned and operated}} bars, eateries and shops located in the district, with over one hundred total businesses.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dish, which is standard {{in both the}} Ashkenazi and Sephardi kitchens. <b>The</b> basic ingredients <b>of</b> cholent are meat, potatoes, beans and barley. Sephardi-style hamin uses rice instead of beans and barley, and chicken instead of beef. A traditional Sephardi addition is whole eggs in the shell (huevos haminados), which turn brown overnight. [...] Ashkenazi cholent often contains kishke (a sausage casing) or helzel (a chicken neck skin stuffed with a flour-based mixture). Slow overnight cooking allows <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various ingredients to permeate and produces <b>the</b> characteristic taste <b>of</b> cholent.|$|R
50|$|Deep Fried Peanuts are a snack food {{created by}} deep frying peanuts in an oil. The {{resulting}} product is a snack food {{that can be}} eaten in its entirety, both shell and nut. The deep-frying process does not change <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> or texture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nutmeats, but changes <b>the</b> texture and <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shells -- especially if seasonings are used -- {{to make them more}} palatable.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, {{barbecue}} restaurants {{may offer}} dishes that are slow-smoked or barbecued over a grill. Fare includes barbecue sandwiches, brisket, barbecue chicken, pulled pork, pork shoulder, pork ribs, beef ribs, beefsteak and other foods. Various side dishes are typically available, such as baked beans, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and {{corn on the}} cob, among others. A variety of barbecue sauces may be available, and some barbecue restaurants bottle their own sauces for customer purchase. Some barbecue restaurants prepare their foods without any sauces, and may not offer any as condiments. This may occur per a preference for <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meats to stand on their own, rather than being accentuated with flavors from sauces. Some barbecue restaurants use a dry spice rub to flavor meats.|$|E
25|$|The above {{principles}} can be {{used for}} pairing wines with Asian cuisine. Pair for <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dish - whatever the 'main ingredient' may be - it is not the meat, seafood, or vegetables that stand out as the predominant flavor. Rather the true flavor of the dish is determined by the cooking method (for example, the toasty flavors of a stir fry), the sauce (from curries to sweet-and-sour), the use of seasonings (such as ginger and coriander leaves to mask fishy tastes), or the blending of ingredients to for new flavors (as in sukiyaki or satay). Indeed, it may result from a combination of any of these elements. Also, note {{that in the case of}} an Asian meal, several dishes are served at the same time and are shared by everyone present. The wine chosen for such a meal has to be versatile.|$|E
25|$|The cacao tree is {{native to}} the Americas. It {{originated}} in Central America and parts of Mexico. More than 5,000 years ago, it was consumed by pre-Columbian cultures along the Yucatán, including the Mayans, and {{as far back as}} Olmeca civilization in spiritual ceremonies. It also grows {{in the foothills of the}} Andes in the Amazon and Orinoco basins of South America, in Colombia and Venezuela. Wild cacao still grows there. Its range may have been larger in the past; evidence of its wild range may be obscured by cultivation of the tree in these areas since long before the Spanish arrived. New chemical analysis of residue extracted from pottery excavated at an archaeological site at Puerto Escondido, in Honduras, indicates that cocoa products were first consumed there sometime between 1500 and 1400 BC. Evidence also indicates that, long before <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cacao seed (or bean) became popular, the sweet pulp of the chocolate fruit, used in making a fermented (5% alcohol) beverage, first drew attention to the plant in the Americas. The cocoa bean was a common currency throughout Mesoamerica before the Spanish conquest.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, Cantonese cooks prefer their {{dishes to}} have {{well-balanced}} flavor {{and not be}} greasy.
