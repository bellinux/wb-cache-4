25|$|Outside of academia, the {{controversy}} surrounding market timing is primarily focused on day trading conducted by individual investors and the mutual fund trading scandals perpetrated by institutional investors in 2003. Media coverage of these issues has been so prevalent that many investors now dismiss market timing as a credible investment strategy. Unexposed insider trading, accounting fraud, embezzlement and pump and dump strategies are factors <b>that</b> <b>hamper</b> an efficient, rational, fair and transparent investing, because they may create fictitious company's financial statements and data, leading to inconsistent stock prices.|$|E

However, women are disadvantaged due to social, cultural, political and economic factors that directly influence their health and impede their access to health-related information and care. In the 2008 World Health Report, the World Health Organization stressed that strategies to improve women’s health must take full account of the underlying determinants of health, particularly gender inequality. Additionally, specific socioeconomic and cultural barriers <b>that</b> <b>hamper</b> women in protecting and improving their health must also be addressed.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Cooper's Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer and John Osborne's [...] "Larkin, Ideology and Critical Violence" [...] {{suggest the}} {{changing}} temper of Larkin studies, the latter attacking eminent critics such as James Booth and Anthony Thwaite for their readiness to reduce to poems to works of biography, and stressing instead {{the genius of}} Larkin's universality and deconstructionism. Cooper argues that [...] "The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class, gender, authority and sexual relations". Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer, and perceives in the letters a [...] "plea for alternative constructs of masculinity, femininity and social and political organisation". Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin's works, {{as well as on}} unpublished correspondence, to counter the image of Larkin as merely a racist, misogynist reactionary. Instead he identifies in Larkin what he calls a [...] "subversive imagination". He highlights in particular [...] "Larkin's objections to the hypocrisies of conventional sexual politics <b>that</b> <b>hamper</b> the lives of both sexes in equal measure".|$|E

60|$|The same {{obstructions}} <b>that</b> <b>hamper</b> {{the free}} movement of a traveller, hamper the movement of foodstuffs {{and all sorts of}} merchandise in a much greater degree. Everywhere in Europe trade is being throttled by tariffs and crippled by the St. Vitus' dance of the exchanges. Each of these European sovereign states turns out paper money at its own sweet will. Last summer I went to Prague and exchanged pounds for kroners. They ought to have been 25 to the pound. On Monday they were 180 to the pound: on Friday 169. They jump about between 220 and 150, and everybody is inconvenienced except the bankers and money changers. And this uncertain exchange diverts considerable amounts of money that should be stimulating business enterprise into a barren and mischievous gambling with the circulation.|$|E
