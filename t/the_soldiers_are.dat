5|$|The sullen {{determination}} of the strikers in the recent struggle is shown most forcibly {{by the fact that}} despite the powerful protection now here for those who desire to pursue their peaceful avocations, none of the miners have returned to work, and the mine pumps are still worked by the bosses and clerks in the employ of the companies... They will be peaceable while <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>are</b> here, but when they go away, they will have many a grievance to redress from their standpoint.|$|E
5|$|Vincent DiStephano (Raymond Cruz), a United Systems Military soldier sent {{to capture}} {{the crew of the}} Betty, is {{captured}} by the mercenaries when the rest of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>are</b> killed by the Aliens. He agrees to cooperate with the survivors to escape from the Auriga. When Call's identity as an Auton is revealed, DiStephano summarizes their history as second-generation synthetics created by other synthetics as sleeper agents. After DiStephano and the group board the Betty, the ship's cargo hatch is stuck open; when Call tries to fix it, she is confronted by the stowaway Newborn. DiStephano checks on her and is caught by the Newborn, which crushes his skull.|$|E
5|$|Denise Mina had {{not written}} for comics {{when she took}} over the title in 2006, but had three {{acclaimed}} crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, {{the first of which}} won the CWA award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, and, overwhelmed by the grief and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly listen to a World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>are</b> Scottish, so England's loss is celebrated, saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like Schadenfreude.|$|E

In Llancarfan, Leitrim asks Connacht to teach the men how to defeat the Myrkridia, and Connacht agrees, much {{to the consternation of}} Leitrim's advisor, the archmage Mjarin, who takes an instant dislike to him. The {{training}} is conducted under the watch of Myrdred, a young Avatara. After several months, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>are</b> tasked with finding and killing a Myrkridian Pack-Mage.

However, the book also notes the location of his camp, and Connacht launches a preemptive strike. However, the army walk into a trap; Moagim has enlisted the aid of Bahl'al, who unleashes an army of undead, and the Trow, ancient giants nearly unstoppable in combat, who also bring with them their Oghre slaves.|$|E

500|$|Banded sugar ants {{appear in}} {{different}} forms, varying from [...] in length, making them a large species. Banded sugar ants are polymorphic, and colonies have {{two types of}} workers: minor workers and major workers that have different size ranges. The two castes can be identified easily, due to the workers being smaller and more slender, while <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>are</b> larger and more robust. Both castes carry a set of powerful mandibles. Queen ants are the largest ants in the colony. Banded sugar ants {{come in a variety}} of colours, possibly due to ecological rather than genetic influences. For example, humidity, insolation and temperature may all affect the colour of an individual.|$|E
500|$|Goya's {{series of}} {{aquatint}} etchings The Disasters of War (...) was not completed until 1820, {{although most of}} the prints were made in the period 18101814. [...] The album of proofs given by Goya to a friend, however, now in the British Museum, provides many indications of the order in which both the preliminary drawings and the prints themselves were composed. The groups identified as the earliest clearly seem to predate the commission for the two paintings, and include two prints with obviously related compositions (illustrated), as well as I saw this, which is presumably a scene witnessed during Goya's trip to Saragossa. [...] (One cannot look at this) is clearly related compositionally and thematically; the female central figure has her arms outstretched, but pointing down, while another figure has his hands clasped in prayer, and several others shield or hide their faces.

500|$|Two {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{are also}} depicted. The [...] "Arachnids" [...] or [...] "Bugs" [...] are shown as communal beings originating {{from the planet}} of Klendathu.

The events of the novel take place during an interstellar war between the Terran Federation and the Arachnids. At the beginning of the story, Earth is not at war, but war has been declared by the time Rico has completed his training. The Skinnies are initially allies of the Arachnids, but switch to being allies of the humans midway through the novel.
