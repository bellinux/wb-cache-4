5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{government}} systems in European politics: in a presidential system, the president {{is the head of}} state and the head of government; in a semi-presidential system, the president and the prime minister share a number of competences; finally, in a parliamentary republic, the president is a ceremonial figurehead who has few political competences. As with the definition of constitutional monarchies, sometimes <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> have non-ceremonial competences, but does not use them by constitutional convention; this is the case in Austria, for instance.|$|E
25|$|The law {{requires}} <b>the</b> post-transition <b>president</b> and ministers {{to disclose their}} assets. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> so following his December inauguration.|$|R
5000|$|He asserts about Bush {{administration}} {{reports of}} weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, [...] "Powell was not duped or misled by anybody, nor did he lie about Saddam's suspected WMD stockpiles. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not lie. <b>The</b> Vice <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not lie... <b>the</b> far less dramatic truth is that we were wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Apparently it {{is going}} to be a matter of who can wield the most {{influence}} with <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>Do</b> you know Mr. Bliss personally?' ...|$|R
5|$|The Council {{is made up}} of its Chairman (as of 6 November 2012 the Chief Justice of Singapore, Sundaresh Menon), up to ten {{permanent}} members who are appointed for life, and up to ten ordinary members who are appointed for a period of three years and may be re-appointed. Appointments are made by the President on the advice of the Cabinet. If <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not concur with Cabinet's advice, he may veto appointments. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), and if the CPA does not concur with his view, Parliament may override his decision with a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority vote. The President has no power to remove current PCMR members.|$|E
25|$|In {{case the}} President is {{temporarily}} absent, {{one of the}} Vice-Presidents designated by him/her stands in for him/her. If <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not designate any of the Vice-Presidents to stand in for him/her, the oldest Vice-President shall stand in for him/her.|$|E
25|$|Non-partisan, no {{more than}} three Commissioners may belong to the same {{political}} party. The President also designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, the SEC's top executive. However, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not possess the power to fire the appointed Commissioners, a provision that was made to ensure the independence of the SEC. This issue arose during the 2008 presidential election in connection with the ensuing financial crises.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're an optimist, but {{one likes}} optimists," [...] Grace remarked {{with a gentle}} smile. [...] "However, what had <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>done</b> to deserve <b>the</b> {{sacrifice}} your uncle made?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not reply. He was anxiously {{watching}} the Record and scribbling {{notes on a}} paper beside him. His face was pale and his lips tightly compressed.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Big Dumpster": Barry {{mentions}} {{that he wrote}} two ideas; one with superhuman chickens, and one with political themes, including <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> Hokey Pokey, titled Chickens!, and Head of State.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} of President is an honorary one. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> {{not take a}} salary and is chosen from supporters of the club. Past holders of the seat have included former Prime Minister Sir John Major {{and a number of}} former players, an example of which is the 2011 President and 1960s Surrey slow left-arm bowler Roger Harman, who held the post for a single year, as has been customary in recent years. He was the 48th President.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, since {{official}} treaties {{are specifically}} created under and by constitutional U.S. law and are entered into by both {{government and the}} people as a whole, {{in his capacity as}} head of state and as the single individual representative of the United States and its citizens, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> have Coauthority and Constitutional duty to unilaterally withdraw the United States from treaties if he determines the best interests and well being of the U.S. and its citizens are benefited by doing so.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding his {{executive}} power, the President cannot make treaties or appointments without {{the advice and}} consent of the Senate. Likewise, the President's pardon power is limited to offenses against the United States (federal crimes) and does not extend to impeachments or violations of state law. As treaties are by U.S. law official agreements with foreign governments recognized as such only after Senate ratification, the President obviously cannot make treaties unilaterally. However, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> determine and decide U.S. foreign policy and can enter into non-binding discussions and give conditional approval to agreements reached with foreign governments subject to Senate ratification at a future date.|$|E
60|$|Second Cable from England. The Two New Cases. Claim both ships torpedoed. Offer proofs. Situation very grave. Feeling in Washington very tense. Roosevelt {{out with}} a signed statement, What will <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>Do?</b> Surely he knows what I will do.|$|R
50|$|The {{background}} {{color of the}} flag, as on all historical versions, is white. <b>The</b> Vice <b>President's</b> coat of arms {{does not have a}} ring of stars around the eagle like <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> <b>does,</b> but on <b>the</b> flag, four blue stars are added, one in the each corner.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum has}} {{one third of}} its floor space {{dedicated}} to <b>the</b> current <b>President</b> of Turkmenistan. In this section are images of <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>doing</b> {{a wide variety of}} things, including harvesting crops with his citizens, racing autos, reading with children, playing sports, and meeting world leaders.|$|R
25|$|Regardless of the {{inability}} to declare war, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> {{have the power to}} unilaterally order military action in defense of the United States when he determines that a foreign political entity poses a clear and present danger to the safety and security of the United States. By U.S. law, the only limitation on that power is a requirement to notify specific members of Congress within 48 hours after the beginning of military operations. Once proper legal notification is given to the required members of Congress, military action can continue and remain secret so long as the President judges it necessary to national security.|$|E
25|$|Although the European Council is, {{under the}} terms of the Lisbon treaty, a {{separate}} institution of the EU, it does not have its own administration. The administrative support for both the European Council and its President is provided by the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> have, however, his own private office (cabinet) of close advisers. Van Rompuy chose as his first chief of staff (chef de cabinet) Baron Frans van Daele, formerly Belgian ambassador to, variously, the USA, the UN, the EU and NATO and chief of staff of several Belgian foreign ministers. Upon his retirement in the autumn of 2012, Didier Seeuws, former Deputy Perm Rep of Belgium to the EU and former Spokesman for Belgian PM Verhofstadt, replaced him. Also in his team were the former UK Labour MEP Richard Corbett and Van Rompuy's long standing press officer Dirk De Backer.|$|E
500|$|The Presidential Palace ( [...] , also {{referred}} to by the metonym Pantovčak) in Zagreb is the official workplace of the president. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not actually live in the building, as it is used as the Office of the President of Croatia {{rather than as a}} residence. The structure covers [...] It had been used as the official residence since then-president Franjo Tuđman moved there following the October 1991 bombing of Banski dvori. In addition to the original building, there is also an [...] annex built in 1993, an ancillary structure housing office security services and a bomb shelter predating the 1990s. The building, formerly known as Villa Zagorje or Tito's Villa, was designed by architects Vjenceslav Richter and Kazimir Ostrogović and completed in 1964 for the former Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
5000|$|<b>President</b> Clinton {{discussed}} <b>the</b> economy, {{the federal}} budget, taxes {{and focused on}} the budget surplus, then at $70 billion. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> also discussed <b>the</b> future of Social Security, education, foreign relations and [...] "solving the so-called Y2K computer problem". <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not mention <b>the</b> then-occurring impeachment trial in the Senate.|$|R
50|$|If {{the bill}} was not {{returned}} to the Majlis by <b>the</b> <b>president</b> or even if <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not ratify <b>the</b> bill within the thirty-day period, the bill is deemed to become law. If the bill is {{sent back to the}} Majlis, the members can decide to pass the bill as it was before or they can consider <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> observations.|$|R
50|$|General S F Rodrigues, former COAS, and Admirals L Ramdas, Arun Prakash and Sureesh Mehta, former Chiefs of Naval Staff, {{wrote an}} open letter to President Pranab Mukherjee, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The letter was ignored, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not respond to the letter.|$|R
2500|$|Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary at the time, {{spoke for}} President Obama {{on the matter}} by saying <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not support, but {{actually}} opposes, some {{of the kind of}} words and lyrics that have been written by Common and others. Even though <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not support the lyrics in question, he believed that some reports were distorting what Mr. Lynn stands for more broadly. Common gave a single line response to the entire controversy: [...] "I guess Sarah Palin and Fox News doesn't like me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{arguments}} that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not possess soft power stem from a strict interpretation of the Constitution and what are regarded as the traditional roles of the President. First, unless the Constitution states otherwise, the default position is that when exercising his functions the President has to act according to {{the advice of the}} Cabinet. In the context of the Constitution, the word advice does not carry its typical meaning of mere opinion or suggestion. The President is obliged to follow the Cabinet's advice. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not have any liberty to exercise soft power. Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} since the President is elected to exercise the powers defined in the Constitution, the concept of [...] "political legitimacy" [...] posited by proponents would appear to be undermined by soft power, which has an unspecified and ambiguous scope.|$|E
2500|$|... "Guidance Patrols" [...] (gasht-e ershâd) — often {{referred}} to as [...] "religious police" [...] in Western media – enforce Islamic moral values and dress codes. Reformist politicians have criticized the unpopular patrols but the patrols ‘interminable’ according to Iranian judicial authorities who have pointed out that in the Islamic Republic <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not have control over the enforcement of dress codes.|$|E
50|$|In August 2014, President Benigno Aquino III was {{urged by}} LPGMA Partylist Representative Arnel Ty to observe DST from November 2014 to January 2015 and March to June 2015 {{to prepare for}} the power crisis in the country but <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not {{implement}} <b>the</b> DST.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, {{seeking to}} amend Article 25 of the Constitution {{to make the}} rules of the dual office holding between a {{parliamentary}} office and functions of government. The project was approved by both chambers but <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not pursue <b>the</b> matter further.|$|R
50|$|Political {{controversy}} {{followed him}} by his non-decision on naming new attorney general that had been elected by Slovak parliament as <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not respect <b>the</b> vote and declined to name the attorney general into the function and caused on-going (July 2013) political crisis in Slovakia.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{parliamentary}} democracies, the President {{is not even}} the nominal chief executive. Rather, executive authority is expressly vested in the Government (cabinet). [...] The Government is obliged, however, to keep the President generally informed on matters of domestic and foreign policy. Most of {{the functions of the}} President may be carried out only in accordance with the strict instructions of the Constitution, or the binding 'advice' of the Government. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>does,</b> however, possess certain personal powers that may be exercised at his or her discretion.|$|E
2500|$|Mohsen Sazegara, {{who was a}} {{high-ranking}} Tehran official before turning against the government, has argued that Ahmadinejad does not control the Guards outside of Iran. [...] "Not only the foreign ministry of Iran; even <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> {{not know what the}} Revolutionary Guards does outside of Iran. They directly report to the leader", he said, referring to Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Although Ali Khamenei is the ultimate person in charge of the Quds Force, George Bush did not mention him. According to Richard Clarke, [...] "Quds force reports directly to the Supreme Ayatollah, through the commander-in-chief of the revolutionary guards." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the final}} {{recording}} begins, Frost ambushes Nixon with damning transcripts {{of a conversation}} between Nixon and Charles Colson that Reston dug up in Washington. As his own team watches in horror from an adjoining room, Nixon admits that he did unethical things, adding, [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> it, that means it's not illegal." [...] A stunned Frost {{is on the verge}} of inducing a confession when Brennan bursts in and stops the recording. After Nixon and Brennan confer, the interview resumes, Frost aggressively pursues his original line of questioning, and Nixon admits that he participated in a cover-up and that he [...] "let the American people down." ...|$|E

50|$|Example 4: If the U.S. Congress {{passes a}} bill, <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> {{signature}} of <b>the</b> bill {{is sufficient to}} make it law.

50|$|In January 2009, Senator Sekibo voiced the {{strained}} {{relations between}} <b>the</b> senate and <b>president</b> Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, raising {{a point of}} order when <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not formally inform the senate that he was proceeding on a two-week vacation, and on that basis questioning whether the senate should recognize Vice President Goodluck Jonathan as <b>the</b> acting <b>president.</b>|$|R
