5|$|In La Paz, the Municipal Direction of Civil defense {{informed}} that the first of 13temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they should <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> leave their homes unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel Márquez de León International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500–8,500 tourists. Henriette also forced the ports in Los Cabos to close completely, and the port in La Paz to close to small craft.|$|E

25|$|Table olive {{varieties}} {{are more difficult}} to harvest, as workers must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> damage the fruit; baskets that hang around the worker's neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production.|$|E
25|$|The Seward Highway {{follows a}} portion of the {{southern}} edge of the Chugach State Park along Turnagain Arm. Turnagain Arm boasts the second highest tides in North America after the Bay of Fundy. These tides, which can reach 40 feet (12 meters), come in so quickly that they produce a wave known as a bore tide. Adventurous kayakers and surfers have taken to riding the tide as an extreme sport. Hikers should <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get stuck in the quicksand-like mudflats that otherwise make up the beaches along Turnagain Arm.|$|E
25|$|At the {{breaking}} of camp, Aaron and his sons were to take down the Ark, the table of display, the lampstand, and the service vessels, and cover them all with cloths and skins. Only when Aaron and his sons had finished covering the sacred objects would the Kohathites come and lift them. Aaron's son Eleazar had responsibility for the lighting oil, the aromatic incense, the regular meal offering, the anointing oil, and all the consecrated things in the Tabernacle. God charged Moses and Aaron to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let the Kohathites die because they went inside and witnessed {{the dismantling of the}} sanctuary.|$|E

25|$|Shoes {{are then}} {{measured}} {{to the foot}} and bent to the correct shape using a hammer and anvil, and other modifications, such as taps for shoe studs, are added. Farriers may either cold shoe, in which he bends the metal shoe without heating it, or hot shoe, in which he places the metal in a forge before bending it. Hot shoeing can be more time-consuming, and requires the farrier {{to have access to}} a forge; however, it usually provides a better fit, as the mark made on the hoof from the hot shoe can show how even it lies. It also allows the farrier to make more modifications to the shoe, such as drawing toe- and quarter-clips. The farrier must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hold the hot shoe against the hoof too long, as the heat can damage the hoof.|$|E
25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> screw the yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|E
500|$|Another {{consideration}} is loss of sensation, [...] which puts {{people at risk}} for wounds such as pressure sores and injuries that could become worse before being noticed. Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin, so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas {{that could have been}} hurt, particularly the buttocks and genital area. People who already have pressure sores must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make the wounds worse. Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections, which get worse if they go unnoticed. Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available personal lubricant to decrease friction.|$|E

500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1889, Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik had proclaimed early Zionist {{initiatives}} as {{resembling the}} 17th-century false messianic sect headed by Sabbatai Zevi.

2500|$|As the {{turbocharged}} aircraft climbs, {{however, the}} pilot (or automated system) can close the wastegate, forcing more exhaust gas through the turbocharger turbine, thereby maintaining manifold pressure during the climb, {{at least until}} the critical pressure altitude is reached (when the wastegate is fully closed), after which manifold pressure falls. With such systems, modern high-performance piston engine aircraft can cruise at altitudes up to 25,000 feet (above which, RVSM certification would be required), where low air density results in lower drag and higher true airspeeds. This allows flying [...] "above the weather". In manually controlled wastegate systems, the pilot must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> overboost the engine, which causes detonation, leading to engine damage.|$|E

2500|$|In fact, the [...] {{net worth}} of each liturgist, and the {{percentage}} of his wealth committed to the liturgy, [...] varied greatly, as the [...] "liturgical class" [...] itself varied greatly.

Therefore, because of changes in wealth (whether related to economic happenstance or the division of inherited wealth) individuals of this [...] "liturgical class" [...] cannot be considered a closed group: it was constantly being renewed, although marginally, by the addition of the [...] "new rich" [...] and the decline of certain families who had previously been wealthy enough to participate.|$|E
2500|$|Although these {{negotiations}} held in Aix-les-Bains {{played an important}} role in the march towards the independence of Morocco, the fact remains that France had previously taken care to largely prepare for this transition. Indeed, the French State was convinced of the need to allow independence to this North African territory. However, with many economic interests at stake and many business relationships, notably the pashas and qaids, pushed France to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> rush this transition and initiate this change, smoothly. The destiny of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco was drawn during this conference at Aix-les-Bains. Officially, negotiations made it possible to reach an agreement to give birth to an independent state. Morocco was finally proclaimed independent during the declaration of La Celle-Saint-Cloud on 6 November 1955. In 2005, there was the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the negotiation of the agreements of the independence of Morocco. For this occasion, a fountain with a pool was made in Moroccan zellige. [...] came specially from their spiritual home to complete this work in the parc de verdure of Aix-les-Bains.

2500|$|Although {{neglected}} in France {{for much of}} the 19th century, the music of Berlioz has often been cited as extremely influential {{in the development of the}} symphonic form, instrumentation, and the depiction in music of programmatic and literary ideas, features central to musical Romanticism. He was considered extremely progressive for his day, and he, Wagner, and Liszt have been called the [...] "Great Trinity of Progress" [...] of 19th-century Romanticism. Richard Pohl, the German critic in Schumann's musical journal, the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, called Berlioz [...] "the true pathbreaker". Liszt was an enthusiastic performer and supporter, and Wagner himself, after first expressing great reservations about Berlioz, wrote to Liszt saying: [...] "we, Liszt, Berlioz and Wagner, are three equals, but we must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say so to him." [...] As Wagner here implies, Berlioz himself was indifferent to the idea of what was called [...] "la musique du passé" [...] (music of the past), and clearly influenced both Liszt and Wagner (and other forward-looking composers) although he increasingly began to dislike many of their works. In the case of Liszt, he walked out on him when being asked his opinion of some new music. His opinion of Wagner's music is contained in an essay in his [...] "The Art of Music." [...] Berlioz not only influenced Wagner through his orchestration and breaking of conventional forms, but also in his use of the idée fixe in the Symphonie fantastique which foreshadows the leitmotif. Liszt came to see Berlioz not only as a composer to support, but also to learn from, considering Berlioz an ally in his aim for [...] "A renewal of music through its closer union with poetry".|$|E
