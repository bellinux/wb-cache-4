The relatively brief seven-month run of that show didn't discourage Lerner and Loewe from collaborating again, this <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Fair Lady (1956), an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion starring Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews, which at 2,717 performances held the long-run record for many years. Popular Hollywood films were made of all of these musicals. This surpassed the run of two hits by British creators: The Boy Friend (1954), which ran for 2,078 performances in London and marked Andrews' American debut, was very briefly the third longest-running musical in West End or Broadway history (after Chu Chin Chow and Oklahoma!), until Salad Days (1954) surpassed its run and became the new long-run record holder, with 2,283 performances.|$|E

[...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E
