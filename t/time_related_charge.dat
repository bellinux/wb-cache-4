40|$|The spectroelectrochemical {{behavior}} of Cu in 1 M sodium acetate solution, pH 5. 8, alone {{and in the}} presence of ben-zotriazole (BTA) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Impedance spectra are characterized by two <b>time</b> constants <b>relating</b> to <b>charge</b> transfer and transport of copper ions through the sur-face film, the latter being the rate-determining factor. The finite diffusion impedance is analyzed using a diffusion factor(B), which {{is a function of the}} diffusion layer thickness (d) and the diffusion coefficient (D 6) for Cu species. The analysis suggests that changes in the film thickness can be monitored in situ by impedance spectroscopy. The values of D 6 and con-centration of Cu species (c 9) in the film formed {{in the presence of}} 1 M BTA were estimated to be of the order 10 - 14 cm 2 s and 106 mol cm 3, respectively. The results indicate that the film formed at higher inhibitor concentration and longer im-mersion time behaves almost like an ideal capacitor. Its thickness (up to 20 nm) and protection against corrosion increase by increasing the BTA concentration and immersion time. The results obtained by Raman spectroscopy confirm the model for the complex Cu(I) BTA in which overlap of Cu sp-hybrid atomic orbitals with the N-hybridized lone-pair atomic orbital occurs.
