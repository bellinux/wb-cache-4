5000|$|The first {{electric-powered}} <b>torque</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{was invented}} in 1925 by Henry W. Nieman of the Bethlehem Steel Company of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. [...] It was intended to allow manual control of heavy equipment; e.g., industrial cranes, artillery, etc.Vannevar Bush used Nieman's <b>torque</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{as part of his}} differential analyzer project at M.I.T in the early 1930s. Lord Kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators as early as the 1880s, but had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators. These integrators used a ball bearing pressed between the surface of a rotating shaft and a disk, transmitting the rotational force of the shaft to the disk. By moving the ball along the shaft, the speed of the disk could be smoothly varied. The torque on the output shaft was limited by the friction between the bearing and the disk, and as these were generally made out of friction-limiting metals such as bronze to allow smooth motion, the output torque was quite low. Some calculating devices could use the output directly, and Kelvin and others built several systems. But {{in the case of a}} differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The <b>torque</b> <b>amplifier</b> was the advance that allowed these machines to work.|$|E

The addition of the <b>torque</b> <b>amplifier</b> by Vannevar Bush led to the differential analysers of the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E

40|$|Control moment gyros (CMGs) are {{spacecraft}} {{attitude control}} actuators which act as <b>torque</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> They are thus suitable for attitude hold and reorientation of large spacecraft or for slew maneuvering. They {{provide the necessary}} torques via gimballing a spinning flywheel. A major problem encountered {{with the use of}} CMGs in practice is the possibility of singularities for certain combinations of gimbal angles. In such singular gimbal angle configurations the CMG cluster cannot generate torques along a certain direction. Several singularity avoidance and escape steering logics {{have been reported in the}} literature to solve the CMG singularity problem. In this paper, we experimentally compare three of the most common CMG steering logics using a realistic spacecraft simulator. We compare the relative merits of these steering laws with respect to their singularity avoidance capabilities and their efficiency in generating the commanded control torques.

Therefore, VSCMGs have extra degrees of freedom {{that can be used to}} achieve additional objectives, such as singularity avoidance and/or power tracking, as well as attitude control. The singularity problem of a VSCMGs cluster is studied in detail for the cases of attitude tracking, with and without a power tracking requirement. A null motion method to avoid singularities is presented, and a criterion is developed to determine the momentum region over which this method will successfully avoid singularities.

50|$|A <b>torque</b> <b>amplifier</b> is a {{mechanical}} device that amplifies the torque of a rotating shaft without affecting its rotational speed. It is mechanically {{related to the}} capstan seen on ships. Its most widely known use is in the power steering on automobiles. Another use is on the differential analyzer, where {{it was used to}} increase the output torque of the otherwise limited ball-and-disk integrator. The term is also applied to some gearboxes used on tractors, although this is unrelated. It differs from a torque converter, in which the rotational speed of the output shaft decreases as the torque increases.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>torque</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{consists}} of two capstans positioned end-to-end along a common line of rotation, typically horizontal. A single source of torque is supplied, typically from an electric motor, which is geared to power the two drums to spin in opposite directions. A single rope (or band) is wrapped around the two drums. If tension is applied to {{one end of the}} rope, its capstan pulls on it, which in turn tensions the output. Like the single capstan, the motion starts and stops as soon as the tension is applied or released, but generally the motion is smooth with varying degrees of torque being applied to the input.|$|E

The Super M featured a larger engine displacement than the standard M, at [...] Variations of the Super M, the Super MD (a diesel version of the Super M) and the Super MTA (with a <b>torque</b> <b>amplifier),</b> were produced. In all, IH produced 44,551 Super M tractors, 5,199 Super MD tractors and 26,924 Super MTA tractors. High-clearance variants for farming vegetables and other high crops were also produced, including the Farmall MV and the MDV (diesel).|$|E

40|$|AbstractA renewed {{interest}} on Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) arose from their great capacity for integration within urban areas and for applications of distributed generation. In {{order to be}} able to highly improve their performance, making them competitive with respect to the more consolidated Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs), it is fundamental to have a deeper comprehension of their fluid dynamic behavior. In order to reach this goal, a two-bucket Savonius rotor has been designed, built from a PVC pipe with a nominal diameter of 200 mm, and tested in the wind tunnel of the Department of Mechanics, Mathematics and Managment (DMMM) of the Politecnico di Bari. The Savonius rotor is connected to an AC brushless servo motor, able to control either the braking torque or the rotational speed. This paper describes the experimental evaluation of the unsteady flow field downstream the rotor by means of a Constant Temperature hot wire Anemometer (CTA).

40|$|In {{phase of}} vehicle braking system designing, besides of {{mechanical}} characteristics, {{it is also}} necessary to take under consideration the system’s thermal features. This is {{because it is not}} enough just to achieve proper braking power, for the brake system to be effective but equally important thing is the dissipation of heat to the environment. Heat developed in the friction surfaces dissipate into the environment over the disk in one hand and through the brake linings and caliper, in the other. The striving is to make that greatest amount of heat to dissipate not threw the brake pads but threw disc.

5000|$|The <b>Torque</b> <b>Amplifier</b> (TA) {{was first}} {{introduced}} on the [...] "improved" [...] Super M of 1954, called the Super M-TA. An auxiliary planetary gearset provided a double-reduction (low) gear ratio for each transmission gear (comparable in function to the two-speed rear axle on a commercial truck) that allowed for a quick downshift via hand lever, without using the clutch, to gain torque at the drive wheels. The popular TA attachment was seen upon {{most of the new}} 300 and 400 Farmalls that first appeared in 1955, and on the 350 and 450 produced 1956-1958, and on later models thru the 1960s.

50|$|A <b>torque</b> <b>amplifier</b> is {{essentially}} two capstans connected together. A capstan {{consists of a}} drum that is connected to a powerful rotary source, typically the steam engine of the ship, or an electric motor in modern examples. To use the device, a rope is wound around the drum, with one end attached to a load, and the other hand-held by the user. Initially the rope has little tension and slips easily as the drum turns. However, if the user pulls on their end of the rope, the tension increases, gripping the drum. Now the entire torque of the driver {{is applied to the}} other end of the rope, pulling the load. If the user does nothing, the capstan will pull the load toward them, loosening the rope and stopping further motion. If the user instead takes up the slack, the tension is maintained and the load continues to be pulled. In this way, the user can easily control the motion of a very large load.|$|E
5000|$|In 1955, the {{numbered}} or so-called Hundred series tractors appeared. The Hundred series models used numbers {{instead of}} letters to identify the model. The new models were given slightly different looks and a few new features, but were still essentially the famed Letter series tractors. The Farmall Cub continued unchanged, but in 1955 a new 'low-boy' version was added, featuring a shortened 62.5-inch wheelbase and a frame eight inches lower than the regular Cub tractor, which improved the machine's center of gravity. 1956 saw {{the introduction of the}} IH Model 350, which offered engines using a variety of commonly available fuels: gasoline, diesel, or LP-gas. The diesel engine version had a direct-start feature, and could be started and run using only diesel fuel. [...] In 1957, IH again gave the tractor lineup an overhaul. Although the basic design was still not changed to any significant degree, new white paint was added to the front grille and sides, new engines were introduced, and new number designations were added. Along with these additions, the <b>Torque</b> <b>Amplifier</b> was added to the Model 300 and all larger models. This provided on-the-go shifting to suit varied needs; the operator was offered ten forward gears and two reverse, instead of the usual five and one. Another addition to these tractors was the independent ("live") power take-off (PTO), which meant that the farmer could run the PTO even when the clutch was disengaged (clutch pedal pushed down). Although the new tractors did improve sales, IH's innate conservatism and reluctance to update their tractor line in response to changing times was becoming apparent.|$|E

It has been possible to note that the range time of the transitory period decreases when the damping values increase. Besides it is resulted that, if we wish to limit at the minimum the range time of the transitory period, without to change the inertia moment J, we have to change the viscous damping values, F.

40|$|Current source {{inverter}} (CSI) fed drives {{are employed}} in high power applications. The conventional CSI drives suffer from drawbacks such as harmonic resonance, unstable operation at low speed ranges, and torque pulsation. CSI fed drives with Direct Torque Control (DTC) has drawn {{the attention of the}} motor drives designers because its implementation requires no position sensor. Crucial to the success of this scheme is the estimation of electromagnetic torque and stator flux linkages using the measured stator voltages and currents. The estimation is dependent only on one machine parameter, stator resistance. The variation of the stator resistance, deteriorates the performance of the drive by introducing errors in the estimated flux linkage’s magnitude and its position and hence in the electromagnetic torque. Resistance change also skews the torque linearity thus making the motor drive a less than ideal <b>torque</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Parameter compensation using stator current phasor error has been proposed in literature. To obtain the stator current phasor error, the stator current reference is required which is not usually available in direct torque control schemes. An analytical derivation of the stator current phasor reference is derived systematically from the reference electromagnetic torque and flux linkages. The error between the stator current phasor reference and its measured value {{is a measure of the}} stator resistance variation from its set value. For the first time, it is demonstrated in this paper that DTC motor drive system can become unstable when the set value of the stator resistance in the controller is higher than the stator resistance in the machine.
