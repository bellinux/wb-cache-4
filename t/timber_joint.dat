30|$|The {{test results}} above {{show that the}} {{characteristic}} dynamic responses of nailed plywood-timber joints under composite waves of multiple frequency components are reasonably related to the dynamic responses of them under harmonic waves of single frequencies. Generally speaking, a harmonic wave of a single frequency affects a joint stronger than a composite wave, if {{the frequency of the}} harmonic wave is close to the stationary resonant frequency of the joint. However, it cannot simply be applied to understand the dynamic responses of nailed timber joints. When a nailed <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> is shaken under a harmonic wave, it never resonates long with it, because the cyclic stiffness degradation decreases gradually the resonant frequency of the joint [1]. When a nailed <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> is shaken under a composite wave that covers the full range of transitional resonant frequencies of it from the initial phase to the final phase of its load-slip curve (see Fig.  3), on the other hand, it must resonates with one of the frequency components one after another decreasing its transitional resonant frequency every cycle.|$|E

Research on <b>timber</b> <b>joints</b> has attracted more attention recently in Taiwan.

The results of this paper show that stepped dovetail connections have better performance than did go-dou connections in both ultimate moment capacity and stiffness degradation. In addition, for joints with a deep beam, the rotational stiffness of stepped dovetail connections was higher than that of go-dou connections...|$|R

40|$|Embedment is a {{key feature}} of timber joints envisioned as the {{ultimate}} solution in avoiding the devastating full collapse of timber structures in seismic countries. The Japanese traditional timber post-and-beam structural system utilizes moment-resisting joints based on embedment. Despite the joint's advantages having the ductile and energy-absorptive behavior continuously to the post-elastic phases, a primary shortcoming {{needs to be resolved}} - specifically of having the low and unreliable initial stiffness due to the gap formation between the contacting members. Further, large-dimensioned timber most suitable for the embedment-type joint is scarce and the lower quality of available timbers is making the modern applications difficult. A new <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> capable of sustaining future seismic impacts is being pursued using various approaches. As a result of the optimization to satisfy the manifold studies, two traditional elements, namely Kusabi wedge and side-penetrating Nageshi beam, are combined and tightened by the penetrating steel bolt. Its tightening system eliminates the gap formation in the joint, and heightens its performance over the traditional embedment-type joints. Additional features, such as the damage-inducing and fast seismic-retrofitting ability, are also integrated. This new proposal for the Kusabi-Nageshi (K-N) <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> system aims to provide a new alternative to the joints used in seismic countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{safety and}} behaviour of traditional timber structures depends significantly {{on the performance}} of their connections. The behaviour of a traditional mortise and tenon <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> is addressed using physical testing of full-scale specimens. New chestnut wood and old chestnut wood obtained from structural elements belonging to ancient buildings is used. In addition, the performance of different semi and non-destructive techniques for assessing global strength is also evaluated. For this purpose, ultrasonic testing, micro-drilling and surface penetration are considered, and the possibility of their application is discussed based on the application of simple linear regression models. Finally, nonlinear finite element analysis is used to better understand the behaviour observed in the full-scale experiments, in terms of failure mode and ultimate load. The results show that the ultrasonic pulse velocity through the joint provides a reasonable estimate for the effective- ness of the assembly between the rafter and brace and novel linear regressions are proposed. The failure mechanism and load–displacement diagrams observed in the experiments are well captured by the proposed non-linear finite element analysis, and the parameters that affect mostly the ultimate load of the <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> are the compressive strength of wood perpendicular to the grain and the normal stiffness of the interface elements representing the contact between rafter and brace...|$|E

The K–N joint is composed of a triangular-sectioned beam and wedges in combination with bolts. Its resistive mechanism utilises the embedment strength of timber and the pre-stress in association with friction. In addition, elastic energy deposited in the bolt as storage fills the gap as it is deformed during the embedment. With the aim of optimising both mechanically and physically, several alterations were tested in terms of shape (taper angle) and of combining densified veneer wood (DVW) with the joint members. A cyclic loading test of the cross joints was made to examine their structural behaviour. The use of less tapered wedges showed higher stiffness and strength, but the beam beneath was undesirably embedded. Different combinations of reinforcement with densified veneer wood showed that the use of the wedges alone provided high optimisation, and an increase in bolt axial force. The successful test results observed in the alteration using the densified veneer wood are expressed using the ‘analytical K–N joint diagram', an analytical method modified from a conventional joint diagram used in mechanical engineering, which showed itself to be an applicable method to predict the trend of the altered K–N joint. The use of the new tapered angle and densified veneer wood for optimisation, and the performance predictions using the analytical K–N joint diagram, will need further precise investigations but their great benefits are potentially promising...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} {{focuses on}} the development of a novel <b>timber</b> <b>joint.</b> Traditional timber joints with mechanical fasteners, particular dowel type fasteners, such as bolts exhibit a low strength and an unreliable stiffness and ductility caused by the presence of hole clearance and the unpredictable splitting of timber. The novel joint tackles all of these shortcomings. Local reinforcement glued to the timber members in the jointed area prevents unexpected splitting and results in the enhancement of the strength. By choosing a steel (gas) tube instead of a solid fastener, that fit in an over-sized hole, and by expanding the diameter after assembly of the joint, easy assembly and no hole clearance is insured. Due to the ductile behaviour of the reinforcement and the plastic deformation capacity of the tube the ductility of the joint is guaranteed. To assess the performance of this joints a comprehensive study was performed and reported in this article. Summarising the experimental results, it can be stated that densified veneer (ply) wood is an excellent mate. rial to reinforce the <b>timber</b> <b>joint.</b> It possesses a high embedding strength and stiffness compared to softwood and is able to sustain the high concentrated loads imposed by the tubes. It is demonstrated that the new joint possess a reliable and high strength and stiffness capacity in monotonic loading. When certain requirements are fulfilled the joint shows a superior behaviour in cyclic loading. Design examples show that when used in portal frames a considerable amount of timber can be saved, up to about 40 %, compared to joints with traditional dowel type fasteners, without a loss of safety.

30|$|The shear {{strength}} of a bolted <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> is governed by {{the combination of the}} joint configuration, wood species, type of bolt, and joint geometry, which includes the thickness of the members and the end and edge distances. The embedding strength of the wood, yield moment of the bolt, and thickness of the members {{have an effect on the}} yield and ultimate strengths of bolted joints, and the end and edge distances often affect the ultimate strength and ductility. The {{shear strength}} of a bolted <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> must be appropriately calculated during the design. At present, the yield theory developed by Johansen [57] is widely used for calculating the yield strengths of bolted joints in some design codes [2]. This theory is based on the assumption that the embedding of wood and bending of bolts have stiff-plastic behaviors. Some studies have been performed to compare the yield strengths of bolted joints calculated by the yield theory with experimental results, and its compatibility has been confirmed [2, 16, 26, 58 – 61]. Johansen proposed formulae for the shear strengths of single and double shear joints with wood side members. In addition, formulae corresponding to single and double shear joints with steel plates are adopted in some design codes. However, dowel-type joints that are not described in the codes are often adopted for actual timber joints. In recent years, formulae to estimate the shear strengths of dowel-type joints with an interlayer [62] and dowel-type joints with multiple slotted-in steel plates [39, 63] have been derived from Johansen’s yield theory. In addition, an alternate method to calculate the shear strengths of bolted joints without using the yield theory was proposed. This calculation was based on a beam on an elastic foundation, and the initial stiffness, load at the proportional limit, yield load, and ultimate load were estimated by considering the yield conditions of the wood and bolt and the rope effect [64].|$|E

40|$|The {{level of}} {{technology}} {{used in the}} building industry is best described as ancient {{when compared to the}} likes of the boat building and aviation industries. Competitive demands in these industries have lead to the development of lighter stronger materials and also construction methods. One such material is fibre reinforced plastic (FRP).

It is possible to manufacture strong fibre reinforced timber joints cost effectively.

The glue-laminated timber moment-resisting frame featuring this joint shows great potential for timber frame structures especially for multi-storey buildings. Robust performance-based design criteria are a necessity for a s uccessful market implementation of the proposed system. A simplified analytical model was developed in order to predict the structural performance of the post-tensioned timber connection and facilitate preliminary performance-based design. This model was implemented in 2 penSees using a bi-linear rotational spring approach. The model was verified against an analytical model and validated against tests on a post-tensioned timber joints under gravity loading and under horizontal loading.

The preliminary design model was used to design fictitious moment-resisting post-tensioned glue-laminated timber frame structures using the loads prescribed in the Swiss code. The design process showed that neither the gravity loads nor the seismic load controlled the design. The design was governed by the lateral deformations due to wind.

40|$|This {{research}} project is {{an investigation into}} the aesthetics and craft of traditional timber jointing techniques. It is an endeavour to grasp the essence of the <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> and the craft by which it is produced and to develop it architecturally {{in the form of a}} pavilion for the general public in a national park. Traditional timber jointing techniques were productions of culture; wrote learned, copied, and gradually refined over time. They have been widely used both structurally and decoratively and predominantly carry a high sense of craftsmanship and romanticism. Due to the need for highly skilled craftsmen and a rather time consuming production method this process has become largely attenuated through time. Nowadays, buildings with finely detailed timber joints are very rare because of the high cost involved in terms of time and labour; there are much quicker production methods that are generally more favoured. This thesis will explore the joint and discuss the merits of the discourse with craft in the wider context and considers the relevance of this, not just as a way of tradition. This will be outworked through the synthesise of this methodology with a design for a timber pavilion that translates some of the concepts of jointing that Mies van der Rohe used in the Farnsworth House with steel. An investigation of different joints through physically crafting them is a fundamental aspect of this process. The performance of the outcome can be marked by a successful integration of craft into the architectural design, which conveys the attitude of thoughtful correspondence between craft and design. Moreover, it completes the narrative of architecture as an edificatory process. SITE: Torrent Bay, Abel Tasman National Park, South Island, New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|According to the American Wood Association, {{a tension}} {{perpendicular}} to the grain failure is the evil of all wood connections. However there are very limited studies conducted to address this issue. This project aims to investigate the behaviour of timber joints using Gang-Nail Plates. A failure of a joint in a prefabricated timber roof truss as a result of tension {{perpendicular to the}} grain {{has the potential to be}} a catastrophic accident. The current method of analysing timber joints subject to a tensile force {{perpendicular to the grain}} is based on a professional engineers’ theoretical analysis without the physical test data. AS 1720. 1 Section 4 suggests a procedure to calculate the design capacity of timber joints using screws, bolts and nails but not for gang-nail plates. Through physical testing, the strength of timber joints with gang-nail plates was determined and the results were analysed to propose a new method of design. By this, destructive testing in accordance with AS 1649 - 2001 has been conducted to find the failure mechanism and ultimate failure force. This was then analysed to find the relationship between the force, timber properties and plate geometry. It was found that the failure load of the <b>timber</b> <b>joint</b> increases with increasing bite depth. Similarly the joints with a 125 mm plate exhibited a higher failure load compared to 75 mm and plates at 45 degrees for a similar bite depth. Failure in tension perpendicular to the grain occurred just below the bottom row of teeth. All failures of the tested samples were observed to be along the grain in a similar location. From the analysis, it was found that the relationship between the bite per mm depth and the bite (or plate) width produced the equation for the design force of: () This equation produced more consistent results when compared to the current MiTek method, however, as only one species and grade of timber was used during this investigation, the equation is only a fit for this material. Further investigation will now be required to confirm this equation’s fit with other materials by conducting a similar testing regime with other species, grades and engineered wood products. ...|$|E

These joints partially still face scepticism with regard to manufacturing defects that may impact the structural performance of the bonded joint. A major concern is the possible lack of adhesion resulting from inadequate preparation of the joint on site. Previous studies {{on the effect of}} bonding defects on the capacity of bonded joints [2] pointed out a nuanced relationship between defects and joint capacity that depends on the brittleness or ductility of the adhesive. This paper presents experimental evidence followed by numerical investigations to shed light on the relationship between defects and capacity of glued <b>timber</b> <b>joints.</b> For this purpose, <b>timber</b> <b>joints</b> with glued-in steel rods were manufactured with different types of defects likely to be encountered during their manufacturing on-site: i) rods placed at an angle to the drill hole instead of being in the joint axis, and ii) rod placed {{at the edge of the}} drill hole instead of fully centred. The effect of these defects on joint capacity was investigated with three different adhesives in combination with three different rod anchorage lengths: firstly, on the stresses caused by uniaxial tension loading using numerical modelling, secondly on the joint capacities using experiments. The experimental investigating of the influence of manufacturing defects on the capacity of <b>timber</b> <b>joints</b> with glued-in steel rods, completed by numerical calculations, demonstrated that joints with sufficient rod anchorage (herein 10 times the rod diameter) do not exhibit a statistically significant loss of capacity, if compared to defect free joints...|$|R
