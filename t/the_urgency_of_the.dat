Although a full-track chassis was preferred, the situation required the use of whatever vehicles were immediately available. The M3 Half-track was selected to carry a 105mm M2A1 howitzer. Although this design had originally been suggested in September 1941, {{it had not been}} taken up. However, <b>the</b> <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirement resulted in the approval by the Adjutant General and the construction of a prototype was authorized by OCM 17391, dated 31 October 1941; the new vehicle designated as the 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T19.|$|E

5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. <b>The</b> <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E
5|$|The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general {{election}} {{and led by}} Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress (led by Mahatma Gandhi) and the Muslim League (led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to {{how it should be}} implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than June 30, 1948. When <b>the</b> <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.|$|E

25|$|From {{as early}} as 1535 there were efforts to stop polluting the River Thames in London. Beginning with an Act passed that year that was to {{prohibit}} the dumping of excrement into the river. Leading up to the Industrial Revolution the River Thames was identified as being thick and black due to sewage, and it was even said that the river “smells like death.” As Britain was the first country to industrialize, {{it was also the}} first to experience the disastrous consequences of major urbanisation and was the first to construct a modern sewerage system to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions. During the early 19th century, the River Thames was effectively an open sewer, leading to frequent outbreaks of cholera epidemics. Proposals to modernise the sewerage system had been made during 1856, but were neglected due to lack of funds. However, after the Great Stink of 1858, Parliament realised <b>the</b> <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem and resolved to create a modern sewerage system.|$|E
25|$|In January 1809, the Spanish {{commander}} in the region, General Francisco Castaños y Aragón, ordered the garrison of the Lines to strip them of all stores and ammunition, to be shipped to Barcelona and Valencia to support the defence of those cities against the French.

He did not exercise this power at the time, as the French threat to the far south seemed to be receding, but a renewed threat {{later in the year}} led to Campbell writing to the British Secretary of War, the Earl of Liverpool, to advise him of the need to proceed with razing the Lines. Liverpool advised caution but in January 1810 a 60,000-strong French force was sent to Andalusia to crush Spanish resistance in the region. <b>The</b> <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation prompted Campbell to obtain fresh permission from the Supreme Junta via General Castaños.
