2500|$|Some {{believe the}} police covered up what happened. On January 1, Liston's wife called Johnny Tocco {{and said she}} hadn't heard from her husband in three days and was worried. A few years before Tocco died, he {{allegedly}} told his good friend, Tony Davi, {{that he went to}} Liston's house and found the door locked and his car in the driveway. Tocco called the police, and they broke into the house. Tocco said that the living room furniture was in disarray, but the house did not yet smell of death. He said they found Sonny lying on his bed with a needle sticking out of his arm. Johnny left the house before the police did. [...] "Johnny wasn't a braggart," [...] Davi told Liston biographer Paul Gallender. [...] "He told me in <b>the</b> <b>strictest</b> <b>confidence,</b> but it was like he wanted to get it off his chest." [...] Gallender claims, [...] "A lot of officers knew Sonny was dead before Geraldine returned home on January 5, but they chose to let him rot." ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 60 - 61) Confidence intervals are a {{very useful}} tool for making inferences on the expectation, ??, of a Poisson random variable. When making inferences about ?? using a confidence interval, one would hope the process used to create the interval has the level of confidence it promises and also produces confidence intervals that are as short as possible so as to hone in on the true value of ??. Many confidence procedures have been developed {{in an attempt to}} achieve these two goals; that is, to be <b>the</b> "shortest" <b>strict</b> <b>confidence</b> procedure. I discuss several of these methods through the perspective of coverage probability functions. I also introduce three new methods which are optimal according to Kabaila and Byrne's Inability to be Shortened property. One method is derived by first creating a specialized coverage probability function through an exhaustive graphical examination of all Poisson probability functions for a set of consecutive values. Subsequently, confidence intervals for ?? with any desired confidence level can then be formed for all possible values of the observed Poisson random variable. The process for creating the coverage probability function of a Poisson confidence procedure and the resulting confidence intervals will be described in detail. Then from the insight gained from deriving this method two other high-performance methods are produced. Finally, the collection of intervals derived from these three methods will be compared with those derived from existing methods with respect to coverage and several different measures of length...|$|R
