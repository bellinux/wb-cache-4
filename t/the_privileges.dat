40|$|This {{paper was}} first {{presented}} at the Temple Law Review Symposium on Executive Power. In Reynolds v. United States, the Supreme Court shaped <b>the</b> state secrets <b>privilege</b> (<b>the</b> <b>Privilege)</b> as one akin to that against self-incrimination. In recent litigation, the government has asserted <b>the</b> <b>Privilege</b> in motions for pre-discovery dismissal, thus transforming <b>the</b> <b>Privilege</b> into a form of executive immunity. This Paper argues that courts must step in to return <b>the</b> <b>Privilege</b> to a scope more in keeping with {{its status as a}} form of evidentiary <b>privilege.</b> After reviewing <b>the</b> doctrinal origins of <b>the</b> <b>Privilege,</b> <b>the</b> Paper explores three types of issues implicated by the government 2 ̆ 7 s invocation of <b>the</b> <b>Privilege.</b> <b>The</b> government, in calling for judicial deference to executive assertions of <b>the</b> <b>Privilege,</b> often realies on (1) separation of powers arguments or on (2) arguments sounding in institutional competence. Courts are often swayed by such arguments and thus give relatively little consideration to the (3) conflict of interest inherent in the government 2 ̆ 7 s assertion of <b>the</b> <b>Privilege</b> and <b>the</b> impact of the successful invocation of <b>the</b> <b>Privilege</b> on <b>the</b> rights of individual litigants. The Paper then proceeds to address arguments that Congress can provide a check on executive abuse of <b>the</b> <b>Privilege.</b> <b>The</b> Paper argues that, assuming that Congress has constitutional authority, it lacks the will or the institutional competence to provide a proper solution to the problems raised by <b>the</b> <b>Privilege.</b> Instead, <b>the</b> Paper contends that, since courts created <b>the</b> <b>Privilege,</b> courts are best positioned to rein it in. The final section of the Paper provides examples drawn from case law illustrating mechanisms whereby courts can protect state secrets while also giving litigants adverse to the government their day in court...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{courts have}} seen an {{explosion}} of claims that communications need not be disclosed because they enjoy the protection of something {{often referred to as}} the “common interest doctrine. ” These claims—claims of attorney–client privilege—occur in two situations: the joint client setting and the allied lawyer setting. In a joint client situation, an attorney represents two or more clients on a matter with all parties working together on the joint endeavor. In an allied lawyer situation, several entities or individuals work together on a matter of common interest but the parties have separate lawyers. This Article argues, uncontroversially, that <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> should continue to apply to communications in the joint client situation. In contrast, this Article argues, quite controversially, that communications in the allied lawyer setting should not enjoy the protection of <b>the</b> <b>privilege.</b> Applying <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> to <b>the</b> joint client setting is simply applying <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> to communications between an attorney and that attorney’s clients—clients who have engaged the attorney to represent them jointly. Applying <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> furthers <b>the</b> rationale of <b>the</b> <b>privilege.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> is applied in the allied lawyer setting, however, <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> protects communications that are not between an attorney and that attorney’s client. The application does not further <b>the</b> <b>privilege’s</b> rationale. In addition, the confusion surrounding the application of <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> in this setting has eviscerated the certainty necessary for <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> to accomplish any goal. Any possible benefit to the application is outweighed by the damage done to the truth-finding mission of the justice system. Applying <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> in <b>the</b> allied lawyer setting is a practice based on a flawed precedent from 1871 and followed by courts only in recent decades.

40|$|An {{innocent}} debtor, who {{is either}} ignorant of her {{constitutional right to}} <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> against self-incrimination or ineffectual in asserting it, may find herself wrongfully convicted and imprisoned in a criminal matter, due to unwitting complicity {{in the delivery of}} testimony or documents in her bankruptcy case. This lack of understanding poses a serious risk to debtors, and especially affects the increasing number of pro se debtors in bankruptcy. <b>The</b> <b>privilege</b> extends to debtors in bankruptcy proceedings. However, a debtor who fails to properly invoke <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> waives her rights. This possibility is made more probable because there is no requirement that she be told about <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> prior to filing or interrogation. Without any requirement of notice, there is no application of the exclusionary rule in civil proceedings. In short, <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> must be invoked through an unambiguous assertion in bankruptcy, or it is lost. For this reason, the Court, under its rulemaking authority, should adopt a revised Official Form B 201 A for use in consumer bankruptcy cases, to ensure the just determination of every case and protect <b>the</b> debtor’s <b>privilege.</b> <b>The</b> revised form would provide pre-filing notice, in writing, of <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> against self-incrimination. To accomplish this, the Judicial Conference of the United States should promulgate the proposed form pursuant to its rulemaking authority. This form would serve to make the debtor aware of <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> prior to filing and the consequences of invocation and waiver, so that <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> would not be lost through ignorance, inadvertence, or lack of competent counsel. This article has four parts. Part I analyzes the scope and application of <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> and distinguishes <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> in bankruptcy from its counterpart in the custodial setting. Part II examines the increased risk to the pro se debtor and the value of <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> both to <b>the</b> truly innocent who are seemingly guilty and the presumptively innocent regardless of guilt. Part III explores the plight of the debtor under current law and explains the risk of nondisclosure of <b>the</b> <b>privilege.</b> Finally, Part IV proposes a change in the language of Official Form B 201 A to alleviate the problems caused by nondisclosure. In short, the author’s thesis is that only through the pre-filing delivery of notice will the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s right to <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> be meaningful...|$|R
