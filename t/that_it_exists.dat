However, {{the existence of}} many 4-hydroxycoumadin anticoagulants (for example phenprocoumon) that possess no ketone group in the 3-substituent to form such a structure, suggests that the hemiketal must tautomerise to the 4-hydroxy form in order for warfarin to be active.|$|E

25|$|LaHaye {{believed}} that the Illuminati is secretly engineering world affairs. In Rapture Under Attack he wrote:I myself have been a forty-five year student of the satanically-inspired, centuries-old conspiracy to use government, education, and media to destroy every vestige of Christianity within our society and establish a new world order. Having read at least fifty books on the Illuminati, I am convinced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> and can be blamed for many of man's inhumane actions against his fellow man {{during the past two}} hundred years.|$|E
25|$|Hermeticists {{believe in}} a prisca theologia, the {{doctrine}} that a single, true theology exists, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> in all religions, {{and that it was}} given by God to man in antiquity. In order to demonstrate the truth of the prisca theologia doctrine, Christians appropriated the Hermetic teachings for their own purposes. By this account, Hermes Trismegistus was (according to the fathers of the Christian church) either a contemporary of Moses or the third in a line of men named Hermes—Enoch, Noah, and the Egyptian priest-king who is known to us as Hermes Trismegistus.|$|E
25|$|However it {{cannot be}} stated affirmatively where {{the mind of}} an arahant exists or <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> at all, because {{describing}} an arahant's mind in terms of existence would limit it to the confines of time and space, which Nirvana occurs outside of. It would be equally incorrect {{to say that the}} mind of an arahant does not exist — the Buddha said that the idea of existence or non-existence “does not apply” to the behavior of an arahant's mind. Ajaan Mun argued all of this by describing a unique class of “objectless” or “themeless” consciousness specific to Nirvana, which differs from the consciousness aggregate.|$|E

25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Massey and Denton {{propose that}} the {{fundamental}} cause of poverty among African Americans is segregation. This segregation has created the inner city black urban ghettos that create poverty traps and keep blacks {{from being able to}} escape the underclass. It is sometimes claimed that these neighborhoods have institutionalized an inner city black culture that is negatively stigmatized and purports the economic situation of the black community. Sociolinguist, William Labov argues that persistent segregation supports the use of African American English (AAE) while endangering its speakers. Although AAE is stigmatized, sociolinguists who study it note that it is a legitimate dialect of English as systematic as any other. Arthur Spears argues that there is no inherent educational disadvantage in speaking AAE and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> in vernacular and more standard forms.|$|E

500|$|Admitting {{that the}} {{existence}} of qualia seems obvious, Dennett nevertheless states that [...] "qualia" [...] is a theoretical term from an outdated metaphysics stemming from Cartesian intuitions. He argues that a precise analysis shows that the term is in the long run empty and full of contradictions. The eliminativist's claim with respect to qualia {{is that there is no}} unbiased evidence for such experiences when regarded as something more than propositional attitudes. In other words, they do not deny that pain exists, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> independently of its effect on behavior. Influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, Dennett and Rey have defended eliminativism about qualia, even when other portions of the mental are accepted.|$|E
500|$|Evidential issues also exist. Because secret trusts are by {{definition}} secret, they {{are difficult to}} prove in court. The parol evidence rule states that where there is written evidence, oral testimony cannot be introduced to the court if it contradicts that evidence. Since secret trusts are oral and normally exist outside of the will (a written document) this causes problems. In Re Keen, the issue came up, and the Court of Appeal decided that the parol evidence rule extended to secret trusts, and such trusts could not be enforced if they contradicted written documents. More generally, the problem is proving that the testator intended to create a trust. As in McCormic v Grogan, the standard is high; the person trying to enforce the trust must show [...] "most clearly and distinctly" [...] <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>exists.</b>|$|E
500|$|The 1850s and 1860s also {{mark the}} line between what some {{scholars}} see as the idealistic, Hegelian young Marx from the more scientifically minded mature Marx writings of the later period. This distinction is usually associated with the structural Marxism school and not all scholars agree <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>exists.</b> The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels. They both became sure that their economic view of {{the course of history}} was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained. For some time after 1848, Marx and Engels wondered if the entire revolutionary upsurge had completely played out. As time passed, they began to think that a new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn. The question of whether a recession would be necessary to create a new revolutionary situation in society became a point of contention between Marx and certain other revolutionaries. Marx accused these other revolutionaries of being [...] "adventurists" [...] because of their belief that a revolutionary situation could be created out of thin air by the sheer [...] "will power" [...] of the revolutionaries without regard to the economic realities of the current situation.|$|E

Farley applauded the show's gall to seemingly kill {{one of the}} leads in the teaser and appreciated the entry's mix of humor—during the scenes with Mulder and his water bed—and its alternative scenarios in the bank. Natalie Prado from Just Press Play gave the episode an A– and wrote, [...] "The episode is well-written and tense. As an audience, we become increasingly frustrated that the two people that we know can solve the problem are unaware <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>exists,</b> which makes the payoff when they finally {{find a way out}} much more satisfying. There are a few leaps in logic, especially towards the end, but overall it’s solid and enjoyable." [...] Jamie Jeffords, writing for the Dallas Morning News, awarded the episode four out of five stars and praised Hamilton's performance, saying, [...] "What makes 'Monday’ is the performance of Hamilton [...] When she is killed in the end, she almost possesses a quiet glee when she realizes her death never happened before, so maybe it is over now. Her performance is haunting. Very powerful." [...] Michigan Daily writer Melissa Runstrom, in a review of the sixth season, said [...] "Monday" [...] was [...] "well made and entertaining." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris called the episode [...] "ingenious and heart-wrenching," [...] and noted that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson's acting was the best of the season. Furthermore, she praised Kim Manners' directing style, calling the same scenes shot in different ways [...] "new".
