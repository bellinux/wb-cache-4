5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, who <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings {{that it was too}} dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though in}} his 1955 book Egypt's Destiny, Naguib wrote that his brigade's {{successful}} stand was a glorious victory with few consequences, estimating 450 Israeli dead (out of a perceived 4,000 attackers), a logbook captured by Israel {{during the war}} revealed that he was extremely worried about the future fate of his forces. He requested immediate assistance, including air support to determine {{the location of the}} Israeli cannons, a medevac unit, reinforcements, munitions and communication wires. It is also likely that he believed that the 53rd Battalion's force blocking the road from Majdal was still in place, and therefore <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> surrounded.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the first 20 years of Ecgberht's reign, but it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to {{maintain}} the independence of Wessex against the kingdom of Mercia, which at that time dominated the other southern English kingdoms. In 825 Ecgberht defeated Beornwulf of Mercia, ended Mercia's supremacy at the Battle of Ellandun, and proceeded {{to take control of}} the Mercian dependencies in southeastern England. In 829 he defeated Wiglaf of Mercia and drove him out of his kingdom, temporarily ruling Mercia directly. Later that year Ecgberht received the submission of the Northumbrian king at Dore. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle subsequently described Ecgberht as a bretwalda or 'wide-ruler' of Anglo-Saxon lands.|$|E
50|$|The Assyrian king list {{does not}} include his name. It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to be placed somewhere before Puzur-Ashur I, and {{possibly}} following Akkiya.|$|R

5|$|When Emperor Anastasius died in 518, Justin was {{proclaimed the}} new emperor, with {{significant}} help from Justinian. During Justin's reign (518–527), Justinian was the emperor's close confidant. Justinian showed much ambition, {{and it has}} been <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> functioning as virtual regent long before Justin made him associate emperor on 1 April 527, although there is no conclusive evidence for this. As Justin became senile {{near the end of his}} reign, Justinian became the de facto ruler. Justinian was appointed consul in 521 and later commander of the army of the east. Upon Justin's death on 1 August 527, Justinian became the sole sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Roundabout {{moved into}} Deeves Hall, a rented old {{farmhouse}} {{near the village}} of South Mimms, Hertfordshire in late February 1968. There, while waiting for the arrival of new musical instruments and equipment, they continued the search for a singer through an advertisement in the British music paper Melody Maker. Rod Stewart was among the dozens of aspiring vocalists that were considered for the auditions, but was not up to the standards the band required. They chose Rod Evans instead, who was already the singer of the club band The Maze. Evans brought along after the audition his 19-year-old bandmate Ian Paice, a drummer whom Blackmore recognised from his days in Hamburg. They quickly improvised an audition for Paice and he was chosen on the spot to replace Woodman behind the drum kit. Woodman was unhappy with the direction the band was heading and the other members <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not suited for their sound.|$|E
5|$|Sir Jonah Barrington {{was born}} in 1760 near Abbeyleix in the Queen's County (Co. Laois). He was first elected to Parliament as a member for Tuam in 1790. He lost this seat in 1798 and was elected as a member for Banagher in 1799. He voted against the Act of Union in 1801 {{and as a result}} he was {{deprived}} of his £1,000 a year sinecure in the Customs House and this also stopped his further advancement. In 1809 he published, in five parts, the first volume of the Historic Memoirs of Ireland. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> induced to delay the second volume – the English government shrinking from the exposure of their conduct in carrying the Act of Union, and it was understood that to purchase his silence he was permitted to reside in France from about 1815.|$|E

50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{identical}} to the Sinilis who tutored Columbanus, according to Jonas of Bobbio. If so, he would have taught Columbanus in the years prior to his departure to France about 585.|$|R
5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E
5|$|While details {{regarding}} Richard Cantillon's {{life are}} scarce, it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born {{sometime during the}} 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue. Sometime {{in the middle of}} the first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, thanks in large part to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.|$|E
50|$|Renowned sportswriter Frank Butler heralded Daly 'the best young {{prospect}} we ever had'. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{probably the}} youngest boxer ever to make The Ring magazine's top-ten world ratings, and it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> also the youngest-ever professional boxer.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 {{while wearing}} a pair of bootcut denim jeans he cycled from Glasgow to Gourock then onto Largs before finally cycling around Millport. It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the only man ever to have {{attempted}} this route by bike.|$|R

25|$|Many {{observers}} in Johnson City thought that Spurrier's best sport {{in high school}} was basketball, and his father <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> best as baseball. While Spurrier agreed that basketball and baseball came more naturally, he preferred playing football, and he worked hard to improve as a quarterback.|$|E
25|$|Schmeling's {{study of}} Louis' style {{led him to}} openly say, in days before the fight, {{that he had found}} the key to victory; fans <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just trying to raise {{interest}} in the fight. Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion.|$|E
25|$|Back in Edinburgh, Aengus Gibson has {{committed}} suicide. When Rebus reads Aengus's journal, {{it becomes clear}} that he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to be arrested for the murder of Tam Robertson. The journal also reveals that it was Cafferty who forced the gun into his hand, getting Aengus's fingerprints on it. After the shooting, Aengus went berserk, starting the fire to hide the evidence.|$|E

25|$|Some historians {{believe that}} the term Barghawata is a phonetic {{deformation}} of the term Barbati, a nickname which Tarif carried. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born {{in the area of}} Barbate, near Cádiz in Spain. However, Jérôme Carcopino and other historians think the name is much older and the tribe is the same as that which the Romans called Baquates, who up until the 7th century lived near Volubilis.|$|E
25|$|Servetus {{also had}} very unorthodox {{views on the}} end times. He {{believed}} {{that he was the}} Michael referenced in both Daniel and Revelation who would fight the Antichrist. Furthermore, he believed that all this would take place in his lifetime. This possibly explains his decision to visit Calvin in Geneva. Servetus could have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> somehow bringing about the beginnings of the end times by facing those who argued and fought against him.|$|E
25|$|The {{conductor}} {{driver was}} {{not qualified to}} drive diesel locomotives, but he had done so occasionally before. It was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> used to driving without a speedometer and so had misjudged his speed on the approach to Lincoln, entering a 15 mph curve at around 55 mph. The driver had also evidently been inattentive because the home signal near the curve was not cleared until the train was almost at it, yet it passed the signal at around 60 mph.|$|E

25|$|Dumbledore wore {{half-moon}} spectacles and a colourful {{array of}} robes, ranging from purple to bright orange. He once {{claimed to have}} a scar above his left knee in the precise shape of {{a map of the}} London Underground, but whether or not he actually does is unknown. His demeanour is often – if not always – serene and ethereal, and he usually spoke in a calm, pleasant voice even when Harry <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> actually furious.|$|E
25|$|According to one account, Luther nailed his Ninety-five Theses to {{the door}} of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg on 31 October 1517. Scholars Walter Krämer, Götz Trenkler, Gerhard Ritter, and Gerhard Prause contend that the story of the posting on the door, even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history, has little {{foundation}} in truth. The story is based on comments made by Philipp Melanchthon, though it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not in Wittenberg at the time.|$|E
25|$|Lt. Colonel A. Peter Dewey, son of U.S. {{presidential nominee}} Thomas E.

Dewey was in Saigon to arrange for the repatriation of American prisoners of war captured by the Japanese. Dewey had complained about abuses of power by British and French soldiers in Saigon and had been prohibited by British commander Douglas Gracey from flying a U.S. flag on his vehicle.
