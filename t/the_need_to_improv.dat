40|$|Planning of {{radiotherapy}} {{services has}} typically {{focused on the}} need for centralised services to optimise the utility of expensive equipment and achieve a critical mass of staff. 1 These services have traditionally been co-located within hospitals that provide a full range of higher level diagnostic and cancer treatment services in order to facilitate continuity of care, ensure high standards of maintenance 2 and offer patients and staff access to clinical trials. Supporting this perception was a report on the American Patterns of Care studies of the 1970 s and 1980 s, showing poorer outcomes and higher complication rates for patients receiving treatment at small, primarily privately operated centres with single megavoltage radiotherapy units. 3 Balanced against this has been <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>improv...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nutrition {{and diet}} are {{significantly}} interrelated with oral health and disease. The control of diet and nutrient intake and good oral hygiene are important ele-ments {{in the prevention}} and treatment of dental caries and periodontal disease. Prevention of dental disease is the major focus of dentistry today, and dietary coun-seling {{is considered to be}} a component of a comprehensive preventive dentistry service. Dental hygienists are primarily responsible for the delivery of preventive dental health care, and thus may assume the role of dietary counselor in the dental practice. The role of the dental hygienist in dietary counseling was examined in this study. The purposes of the study were: (1) to identify the extent and quality of di-etary counseling provided by the dental hygienist in dental practices, (2) to analyze factors that may influence the extent of dietary counseling by the dental hygienist, (i. e. practice constraints, attitude toward the role of nutrition in dental health, per-sonal dietary practices), (3) to assess nutrition knowledge and confidence in dietary counseling skills of the dental hygienist, and (4) to determine <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>improv...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Understanding the {{relationship}} between women’s political participation and health has eluded researchers and cannot be adequately studied using traditional epidemiological or social scientific methodologies. We employed a health capability framework to understand dimensions of health agency to illuminate how local political economies affect health. Exploiting a cluster-randomized controlled trial of a community-based behavior change management intervention in northern India, we conducted a qualitative study with semistructured, in-depth focus groups in both intervention and nonintervention villages. We presented scenarios to each group regarding the limita-tions and motivations involved in women’s political participation and health. Thematic analysis focused on four domains of health agency—participation, autonomy, self-efficacy, and health systems—relevant for understanding {{the relationship}} between political participation and health. Elder women demonstrated the greatest sense of self-efficacy and as a group cited {{the largest number of}} successful health advocacy efforts. Participation in an associated community-based neonatal intervention had varying effects, showing some differences in self-efficacy, but only rare improvements in par-ticipation, autonomy, or health system functioning. Better understanding of cultural norms surrounding autonomy, the local infrastructure and health system, and male and female perceptions of political participation and self-efficacy are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>improv...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} basic {{information that is}} <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> build marketing strategies related to consumer brand-switching, through the investigation of consumer motivations for brand-switching, {{as determined by the}} types of fashion products. The study was implemented by a descriptive survey method using a questionnaire. The survey was conducted during the period of May 11 th through July 5 th 2008. A total of 184 completed responses were analyzed. All respondents were from the Seoul area and between the ages of 20 and 31. Factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha coefficients, one-way ANOVA and Duncan test were employed for the analysis of data. Significant differences were found in brand-switching motives according to the types of fashion products. For clothing, shift behavior occurred more often in conjunction with the attributes of the products itself, such as design, color, price, size, and fiber content. In general, clothes more than shoes, were likely subject to brand-switching most often on the basis of situational factors. On the other hand, for shoes, more brand-switching activities occurred because of non-product attributes, such as discounts, coupons, desire for a change, and wearing of friends. In light of the results, there is a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> differentiate brand related marketing strategies with respect to clothing and shoes. For clothing, efforts focusing on the improvement of the product attributes will be more effective in minimizing brand-switching. There is also a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>improv...</b>|$|R
40|$|Housing is {{undoubtedly}} {{an essential element}} of life for most human beings. The modern concept of housing does not limit the idea of housing merely to the provision of shelter. Housing constitutes a physical matrix in which human interaction occurs. The house that people live in, touch upon every facet of their lives and the society as a whole. The Main focus of this study is the Spatiotemporal Analysis of Residential Houses and housing problem of the Tibetan Community in Srinagar City. This analysis can serve as a helpful resource in policy advocacy, with the aim of influencing changes to positively affect the current housing situation in J&K state, in a way which will ultimately lead to a better socio-economic development of society. This endemic problem has been growing persistently {{with the passage of time}} and consequently it has become a chronic, complex and a knotty problem. This study is based on both primary as well as secondary data sources and a primary household survey was conducted consisting of all 251 respondent Tibetan households from Hawal and Eidgah localities of Srinagar City. The study concluded that the Tibetan community of Srinagar city faces housing problems and there is <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>improv...</b>|$|R
