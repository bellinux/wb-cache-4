They also allowed him <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Hitler that he was pursuing an aggressive approach, even as the front moved steadily to the west.|$|E

Liz tells Kenneth to insult Jenna if he wants her to eat more, and writes down {{a list of things}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Jenna to hurt her.

5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|Whether {{from the}} {{impression}} that even thus the comic element needed strengthening, or from the very natural desire to provide a good part for Mr. Denny, the author has introduced, in the M'Crankie, a figure which, though wholly unnecessary {{to the development of}} the plot, and in his surprising mixture of Scottish characteristics scarcely credible in any period, will probably have as much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the success of the new piece as any of the characters.

25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> every one of you: be happy.

25|$|Now, imagine {{starting}} at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ=T=0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so <b>to</b> <b>say),</b> <b>to</b> {{the state of the}} universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).|$|E

25|$|Though not {{appearing}} in Tekken 7s original arcade release, Nina returns in its updated title, Tekken 7: Fated Retribution. In the story mode, {{she was forced}} to work for the returning Heihachi in the first-half, until she began to concern about Lars' good reason on keeping Jin safe with him, deeming it very interesting to watch and resign from Zaibatsu, faking her death while setting her private assassination job for hire. She is later tasked with infiltrating a mafia wedding... posing as the bride. During the ceremony, a firefight broke out where Nina took out all her targets. However, the commotion had attracted the Tekken Force, who had been dispatched to suppress the violence, and they gave chase. With the Tekken Force in hot pursuit, Nina made her escape. That's when she bumped into a man she found vaguely familiar, who happens to be her son, Steve Fox. Steve wouldn't leave her alone. He seemed to have something he wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her... Nina decided that a confrontation was her best chance of escape.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the ambassador.
