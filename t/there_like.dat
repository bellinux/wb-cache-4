Between August and October 1918, he joined an unofficial congressional delegation that toured Europe, surveying the tactical situation and meeting with leaders <b>there.</b> <b>Like</b> Wilson, he supported U.S. ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and participation in the League of Nations, but both measures failed after {{the election of a}} more conservative Congress in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} {{only from the}} cave of Andrahomana. Its past {{presence}} <b>there,</b> <b>like</b> that of the extinct rodent Hypogeomys australis, suggests formerly more mesic (wet) conditions around the cave, which is currently in a dry area. In addition to M.macpheei, three other tenrecs have been described from subfossil material, but none are currently recognized as valid species; thus, M.macpheei is at present the only known Recently extinct tenrec species. However, there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana, where a population of M.macpheei may survive. Although no radiocarbon dating {{has been carried out}} on M.macpheei remains, bones of the rodent Macrotarsomys petteri from layers in the same cave deposit bracketing those where M.macpheei was found yield dates of around 2480 and 1760 Before Present.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of those}} killed at Treblinka were Jews, but about 2,000 Romani people also died <b>there.</b> <b>Like</b> the Jews, the Romani were first rounded up {{and sent to the}} ghettos; at a conference on 30 January 1940 it was decided that all 30,000 Romani living in Germany proper were to be {{deported}} to former Polish territory. Most of these were sent to Jewish ghettos in the General Government, such as those in Warsaw and Łódź. As with the Jews, most Romani who went to Treblinka died in the gas chambers, although some were shot. The majority of the Jews living in ghettos were sent to Bełżec, Sobibór, or Treblinka to be executed; most of the Romani living in the ghettos were shot on the spot. There were no known Romani escapees or survivors from Treblinka.|$|E

5|$|This {{situation}} was {{transformed by the}} founding of St John's College, St Andrews in 1418. Henry Wardlaw, bishop of St. Andrews, petitioned the anti-Pope Benedict XIII during the later stages of the Great Western Schism, when Scotland {{was one of his}} few remaining supporters. Wardlaw argued that Scottish scholars in other universities were being persecuted for their loyalty to the anti-Pope. St Salvator's College was added to St. Andrews in 1450. The other great bishoprics followed, with the University of Glasgow being founded in 1451 and the King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. Both were also papal foundations, by Nicholas V and Alexander VI respectively. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. St. Andrews was deliberately modelled on Paris, and although Glasgow adopted the statues of the University of Bologna, <b>there,</b> <b>like</b> Aberdeen, there was an increasing Parisian influence, partly because all its early regents had been educated in Paris. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law. They provided only basic degrees. Those wanting to study for the more advanced degrees that were common amongst European scholars still needed to go to universities in other countries. As a result, Scottish scholars continued to visit the Continent and returned to English universities after they reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century.|$|E

Richter met Maria in Padua and married her <b>there.</b> <b>Like</b> his father-in-law, Richter served on the staff and became a general officer.

25|$|The {{line from}} Sandvika to Oslo was {{substantially}} upgraded between 1917 and 1922. The freight handling was moved from OsloV to Filipstad and on 26 January 1916 a separate railway line opened from Skarpsno to <b>there.</b> <b>Like</b> {{many of the}} stations on the section, Skarpsno was rebuilt as an elevated railway. The tracks were raised, allowing the level crossings to be removed and the roads to run through underpasses. This involved the station being rebuilt so it received an island platform. Eivind Gleditsch at NSB Arktitektkontor designed a new station building, which opened in 1917.|$|E

25|$|Gilbert's twelve-year episcopate left a few notices of his activity.

He was also activie in England, particular in the Bishopric of Durham during vacancies in that bishopric, when Gilbert could perform episcopal functions <b>there</b> <b>like</b> granting indulgences and dedicating altars.
