5|$|A seminal work by Adam Hardy (1995) {{examined}} the Karnataka temple-building tradition {{over a period}} of 700years, from the 7th century to the 13th century, and reviewed more than 200temples built by four dynasties; Badami Chalukya, Rashtrakuta, Western Chalukya and Hoysala.

5|$|Isotope {{analysis}} of the remains revealed that while the bones had δ13C values that were typical of those found at many other southern British Neolithic sites, they had significantly higher values of δ15N, which grew over time.

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served.

5|$|Nuthatches {{are very}} vocal, using an {{assortment}} of whistles, trills and calls. Their breeding songs tend to be simple and often identical to their contact calls but longer in duration. The red-breasted nuthatch, which coexists with the black-capped chickadee throughout much of its range, is {{able to understand the}} latter species' calls. The chickadee has subtle call variations that communicate information about the size and risk of potential predators. Many birds recognise the simple alarm calls produced by other species, but the red-breasted nuthatch is able <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> chickadees' detailed variations and to respond appropriately.|$|E

5|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf {{believed}} Carnivàles religious aspects {{stemmed from}} the epic {{of good and evil}} as a major fabric of the 1930s, while executive producer Ronald D. Moore regarded religion as a way to express the struggle of good versus evil, faith, and the nature of humanity. Neither the audience nor the actors were given advice on how <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> show's biblical imagery. Clancy Brown, the actor who portrayed Brother Justin, did not know whether his character was the Creature of Light or Darkness during the first season. He however thought that the visions made Brother Justin believe to be on a righteous mission of God until late in the first season. Compared to Brother Justin, Brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E

5|$|These {{findings}} were contested {{a few years}} later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed Triceratops material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, although the distinctive skull of T. ("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed enough to warrant a separate genus. She found that T. horridus and several other species belonged together, and T. prorsus and T. brevicornus stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species. It is still possible <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{mechanisms}} {{have been proposed}} <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> origin of volcanism in the NCVP. This includes slab windows, mantle plumes, crustal extension and deglaciation. The most common and best mechanism used to explain NCVP volcanic activity is incipient rifting of the North American Plate caused by crustal extension. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Mafic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava flows, although more viscous felsic magma also makes {{its way to the}} surface and can produce explosive eruptions. Two major structural features, the Tintina and Denali-Coast fault systems, run parallel with the NCVP. Both structures have had strike-slip motions since the Cretaceous period and has resulted in several hundred kilometres of crustal displacement.|$|E
5|$|After each {{election}} to the Scottish Parliament, {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer, the equivalent of the speaker in other legislatures, and two MSPs to serve as deputies. The Presiding Officer (currently Ken Macintosh) and deputies (currently Linda Fabiani and Christine Grahame) are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.|$|E
