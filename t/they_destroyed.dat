Swaths of crops were inundated by the floodwaters, and 44people were killed. Extensive flooding occurred in Taiwan and China, and seven deaths occurred in the former.

5|$|Throughout {{the night}} of October 21/22, the large {{artillery}} forces the Egyptians had concentrated began harassing the Israelis. The Egyptians had identified command posts and tank concentration areas for attack, especially at Serabaeum and Ain Ghasin, as well likely routes of attack, and continued to provide a withering fire support during the Israeli attack. At morning, Israeli aircraft attacked Egyptian positions, concentrating on Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa, Nefisha, and al-Galaa' base, and at noon <b>they</b> <b>destroyed</b> the Abu Gamoos Bridge at Ismailia. At this time, company-sized units of armor and infantry advanced against the Upper Bridge and the bridges at Nefisha but were repelled by Sagger missiles.|$|E
5|$|Union forces hastily {{attempted}} {{to destroy the}} vital salt works. <b>They</b> <b>destroyed</b> about {{one third of the}} boiling kettles and most evaporating sheds. They also damaged portions of the Virginia & Tennessee railroad. But they failed to destroy or damage the actual salt wells. General Stoneman claimed a victory and retreated out of Virginia before Confederate forces could completely surround him. Carpenter's role is strangely missing from letters and other documents that simply note that he was there. Within three months, the saltworks were back in full production. Carpenter later wrote a long letter home about this battle and how his men responded.|$|E
5|$|Albert of Habsburg (who was Sigismund of Luxembourg's {{son-in-law}} and successor) wrote {{a letter}} to Vlad, ordering him to protect Transylvania. Ignoring the king's command, Vlad joined Murad II who came to Wallachia at the head of his army in summer 1438, serving the sultan as his guide. The Ottoman and Wallachian troops broke into Hungary at Orșova. They routed the army of a local Vlach kenez, Cândea, near Hațeg. They marched along the river Mureș, capturing Câlnic and Sebeș. At Sebeș, Vlad convinced the leaders of the town to give in without resistance, promising to protect their property if they accompanied him to Wallachia. The Ottomans and Wallachians laid siege to Sibiu, but the siege lasted only for 8 days. <b>They</b> <b>destroyed</b> the outskirts of Brașov, before they left Hungary loaded with plunder and taking more than 30,000 captives.|$|E

On the morning of 8 November, Furiouss Seafires strafed the Vichy French airfield at Tafraoui, destroying three aircraft {{on the ground and}} shooting down one Dewoitine D.520 fighter, the first air-to-air kill by a Seafire. Eight Albacores, escorted by Sea Hurricanes from two escort carriers, attacked the field at La Senia. They were attacked by D.520s as they began their attack dive, but <b>they</b> <b>destroyed</b> 47 aircraft on the ground despite the loss of an Albacore from anti-aircraft fire and the loss of three and damage to two more against the French fighters.

5|$|Bolton {{struggled}} {{in the following}} two seasons, but survived in the Premiership. The 2001–02 season began with a shock as <b>they</b> <b>destroyed</b> Leicester 5–0 at Filbert Street to go top of the table. Despite a 2–1 win away at Manchester United, becoming the first team since {{the formation of the}} Premiership to come from behind and win a league game at Old Trafford, they went into a deep slump {{during the middle of the}} season and needed a Fredi Bobic hat-trick against Ipswich Town to survive. Despite losing the final three games, 16th place was secured. The 2002–03 season began with a poor start and, despite another win away at Manchester United, they were bottom until a 4–2 win against Leeds United at Elland Road. Despite suffering from a lack of consistency, Bolton achieved the results needed and secured survival in a final day 2–1 victory over Middlesbrough.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{strength}} of Malvern Hill, as demonstrated in the battle, McClellan felt he needed to continue with his planned withdrawal to Harrison's Landing, to Fitz John Porter's chagrin. Porter felt that the Army of the Potomac should remain atop the hill or perhaps even continue their advance to Richmond. McClellan however insisted that Confederate troops greatly outnumbered his own, felt he could not protect Harrison's Landing from his current position at Malvern Hill, and feared being cut off from his supply depot. McClellan's mentality prevailed. The Union batteries and McClellan's engineers began moving to Harrison's Landing soon {{after the end of}} the Battle of Malvern Hill. Starting at about 11p.m. unit after unit began to follow. Within hours, nearly all of McClellan's Army of the Potomac was marching towards Harrison's Landing. Once the last of these men had crossed the Turkey Island Bridge, <b>they</b> <b>destroyed</b> the bridge and felled trees over it to stymie any pursuit, leaving the James River between the Union and Confederate armies.|$|E

5|$|During the Peninsular War (1809–1814) in Spain, the Vistula Legion gained fame at the Battle of Zaragoza. In the Battle of Fuengirola, a small Polish force {{managed to}} defeat an Anglo-Spanish expeditionary force outnumbering them 10-1, {{capturing}} their {{commander in the}} process. Other troops served in Napoleon's Imperial Guard and the Polish Chevau-léger regiment distinguished itself at the Battle of Somosierra in 1808. Another Polish cavalry regiment– the Vistula uhlans– also fought in Spain. They distinguished themselves many times there, including at the Battle of Albuhera in 1811, where <b>they</b> <b>destroyed</b> a British infantry brigade. Their valour in that conflict inspired the British {{to create their own}} lancer units equipped with Polish-style uniforms and weapons.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{neutralization}} of Ottoman {{naval forces}} in the region, Aretusa {{and the rest of}} the Italian ships then commenced a bombardment campaign against the Turkish ports in the Red Sea before declaring a blockade of the city of Al Hudaydah on 26 January. On 27 July and 12 August, Aretusa, her sister ship Caprera, and Piemonte conducted two bombardments of Al Hudaydah. During the second attack, <b>they</b> <b>destroyed</b> an Ottoman ammunition dump. With the threat of an Ottoman attack greatly reduced, the High Command thereafter began to withdraw forces from the Red Sea Squadron. By the end of August, the unit was reduced to three protected cruisers, Aretusa, Caprera and two auxiliaries. On 14 October, the Ottoman government agreed to sign a peace treaty, ending the war. Aretusas career ended shortly thereafter; the Regia Marina discarded the ship in December and she was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
