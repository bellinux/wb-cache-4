5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that the media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> {{played out}} {{across a wide}} {{spectrum}} of media, including newspapers, magazines, web blogs, and congressional research arms like the Government Accountability Office. Each side has presented different arguments on the best approach to the problem, but most of the participants favor the continuation of the DD(X) program or the reinstatement of the Iowa-class battleships to the Naval Vessel Register. The s, the s, and s have entered the debate as options put forward for naval gunfire support, while others advocate the use of specifically designed close air support planes and newer missile systems that can loiter in an area as a replacement for naval gunfire.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1970s, {{the issues}} {{regarding}} {{the race of}} the ancient Egyptians have been taboo subject for mainstream United States scientists. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> thus been led by the public, focusing on specific issues.|$|E

25|$|A longstanding {{controversy}} surrounding PCS concerns {{the nature of}} its etiology– that is, the cause behind it– {{and the degree to which}} psychological factors and organic factors involving brain dysfunction are responsible. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> been referred to as 'psychogenesis versus physiogenesis' (psychogenesis referring to a psychological origin for the condition, physiogenesis to a physical one).|$|E
25|$|Having {{discussed}} Plato's philosophy, linguistics, perception, {{and some}} cognitive structures, various implications {{that arise from}} the research and theorizing can be touched on.

In contemporary psychology, the debate is between biology (nature) and environment (nurture).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> been rekindled by the release, in 2012, of the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy {{written by}} E. L. James. The phenomenal success of her erotica for every woman, dubbed 'mommyporn', {{has given rise}} to satires like Fifty Shames of Earl Grey by 'Fanny Merkin' (real name Andrew Shaffer), a book of essays called Fifty Writers on Fifty Shades (ed. Lori Perkins), a parody called Fifty Sheds of Grey and editors of erotic {{imprints}} re-evaluating the content and presentation of the genre.|$|E

25|$|For many people, {{abortion}} {{is essentially a}} moral issue, concerning the commencement of human personhood, {{the rights of the}} fetus, and a woman's rights over her own body. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> become a political and legal issue in some countries with anti-abortion campaigners seeking to enact, maintain and expand anti-abortion laws, while abortion rights campaigners seeking the repeal or easing of such laws while expanding access to abortion. Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. Availability of safe abortion also varies across the world.|$|E
25|$|During 1996, {{the debate}} over the {{practice}} of shechita (Jewish religious slaughter of animals) in Finland continued. Although a motion to pass a law prohibiting shechita (on animal rights grounds) was defeated in December 1995, thereby allowing the practice to continue in Finland (on the condition that the slaughtering takes place simultaneously with a stunning blow), parties opposed to shehitah were not satisfied. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> spanned several years, became an election issue during the 1995 general election and often took on an unpleasant tone, as the proponents of the ban (some of whom were politicians) equated shehitah with female circumcision and mutilation.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> {{involved}} certain {{insurance industry}} {{practices such as}} the placing of caps on coverage, {{the high level of}} co-pays even for essential services such as preventative procedures, the refusal of many insurers to cover pre-existing conditions or adding premium loading for these conditions, and practices which some people regard as egregious such as the additional loading of premiums for women, the regarding of having previously been assaulted by a partner as having a pre-existing condition, and even the cancellation of insurance policies on very flimsy grounds when a claimant who had paid in many premiums presents with a potentially expensive medical condition.|$|E

25|$|There are not {{too many}} {{instances}} of limiting primary picketing. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> been over whether secondary picketing can be restricted; this practice of picketing businesses not directly involved in a labour dispute {{has in the past}} been banned under the common law. The most significant decision on limiting primary picketing is BCGEU v. BC (1988) where employees at the British Columbia Supreme Court, who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.|$|E
25|$|Ontario, Canada's {{most populous}} province, generates some 9,600 MW annually, {{over half of}} that coming from one dozen nuclear reactors. Ontario also has natural gas, and hydro facilities. However, Ontario faces a {{challenge}} as it must replace 80% of its generating capacity in the next twenty years—the old stations have time-expired and the nuclear reactors are overstressed. A debate continues over whether to go largely nuclear or go with renewables. Since the Green Energy Act 2009, <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> become even more heated. As one of the outcomes of the Act, electricity prices have exponentially - by 95% for homeowners and by 115% for small businesses {{in the province of}} Ontario.|$|E
25|$|In {{his work}} Nuijasota, sen syyt ja tapaukset (1857–1859) (English: Club War, its reasons and causes), {{historian}} and fennoman Yrjö Koskinen (né Forsman) saw the peasants as fighting {{for freedom and}} justice. Fredrika Runeberg's Sigrid Liljeholm (1862), {{one of the first}} historical novels in Finland, depicts women's fates during the war. Albert Edelfelt's painting Poltettu kylä (1879) depicts a woman, a child, and an old man hiding behind a rock as a village burns in the background. The poet Kaarlo Kramsu praised the insurgents and lamented their defeat in patriotic poems such as Ilkka, Hannu Krankka, and Santavuoren tappelu, published in Runoelmia (1887). After the Finnish Civil War, <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> centered on an interpretation that emphasizes Duke Charles's role in inciting the revolt, as found in Pentti Renvall's Kuninkaanmiehiä ja kapinoitsijoita Vaasa-kauden Suomessa (1949); and an explanation that stresses the roots of the rebellion in social injustice and class conflict, as argued by Heikki Ylikangas in Nuijasota (1977). A historical reenactment of the Cudgel War is conducted yearly in the Kavalahti scout camp. Jaakko Ilkka took the 75th place in the Great Finns TV show. A commemorative silver coin was also minted to mark the occasion.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{interesting}} and radical themes of <b>the</b> <b>debating</b> societies was <b>the</b> continued and varied debate on men and women and their interactions. The presence of women in the societies meant that <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>had</b> a chance of accurately representing contemporary women's own viewpoints on their role in society, not simply those of men, making <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> a significant marker of popular thought and opinion.|$|R
500|$|The {{date of the}} gate's {{construction}} is uncertain, with scholars divided between Theodosius I and Theodosius II.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> {{been often}} {{cited in the}} history of {{nanotechnology}} due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of nanotechnology. It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone, with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work, and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science, causing commentators to {{go so far as to}} characterize the tone of the debate as similar to [...] "a pissing match" [...] and [...] "reminiscent of [...] Saturday Night Live sketch".|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> {{received}} technical {{criticism as}} well. Steven A. Edwards in The Nanotech Pioneers {{noted that the}} ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes {{an evaluation of the}} argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that [...] "nowhere in it does Nanosystems contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler... We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together." [...] He concludes that [...] "the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> {{been widely}} criticized for its {{adversarial}} tone. David Berube in Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz characterized it as [...] "two people talking over each other... {{not conducive to}} reasonable rebuttal," [...] and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard Lovy as saying [...] "the tenor of the debate is about personal pride, reputation, and {{a place in the}} pantheon." [...] Zyvex founder James von Ehr remarked that [...] "Eric [...] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a pissing match with a Nobel-prize winner." [...] An article in The New York Times called the debate [...] "reminiscent of that old Saturday Night Live sketch...

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> {{inspired}} {{at least}} two satirical Internet urban legends. In 2001, The Onion, an American satirical newspaper, published an article entitled [...] "Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism Among Children," [...] which said that the [...] "High Priest of Satanism" [...] had described Harry Potter as [...] "an absolute godsend to our cause." [...] This article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as [...] "proof" [...] of their views. The following year the Canadian daily the National Post released a similar spoof article in its satirical column Post Morten, saying that [...] "Rowling—or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan—said that as she sat {{in a coffee shop}} one grey day, wondering what to do with her empty, aimless life, it hit her, 'I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!'" [...] This article was also copied into a chain letter and released as [...] "truth" [...] onto the web.|$|E
500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Las Meninas relate to earlier works by Velázquez {{in which he}} plays with {{conventions}} of representation. In the Rokeby Venus—his only surviving nude—the face of the subject is visible, blurred beyond any realism, in a mirror. The angle of the mirror is such that although [...] "often described as looking at herself, [...] is more disconcertingly looking at us". In the early Christ in the House of Martha and Mary of 1618, Christ and his companions are seen only through a serving hatch to a room behind, according to the National Gallery (London), who are {{clear that this is}} the intention, although before restoration many art historians regarded this scene as either a painting hanging on the wall in the main scene, or a reflection in a mirror, and <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> continued. The dress worn in the two scenes also differs: the main scene is in contemporary dress, while the scene with Christ uses conventional iconographic biblical dress. This is also a feature of Los Borrachos of 1629, where contemporary peasants consort with the god Bacchus and his companions, who have the conventional undress of mythology. In this, as in some of his early bodegones, the figures look directly at the viewer as if seeking a reaction.|$|E
