A well-collimated, submillimeter wave beam to offer small scattering volume and relatively large scattering angle is suitable for improving the spatial and wave number resolutions. Application of high frequency gyrotron is effective in improving the S/N raito of the measurement because of its capacity to deliver high powers.

A quasi-optical antenna is a suitable element for the conversion system under consideration since it is applicable to several TE 0 n and TE 1 n modes. In order to apply the gyrotron to plasma scattering measurement, we have stabilized the output (P= 110 W, f= 354 GHz) of gyrotron up to the level (DP/P< 1 %, Df< 10 kHz). The gyrotron output can be stabilized by decreasing the fluctuation of the cathode potential. Comment: 12 th International Congress on Plasma Physics, 25 - 29 October 2004, Nice (France...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of plasma scattering measurement (S/N ratio, the spatial and wave number resolutions) depends on intensity, wavelength range {{and quality of}} a probe beam. Because spatial and wave number resolutions are improved by focusing the beam and increasing the scattering angle, a submillimeter wavelength beam is most suitable for the measurement. Up to now, molecular vapor lasers and backward-wave oscillators {{have been used as}} the principal power sources. However, their output powers are lower than 0. 5 W and 10 mW, respectively Application of high frequency gyrotron is effective in improving the C/N ratio of the measurement because of its capacity to deliver high powers.

The {{propagation}} of electromagnetic waves {{in a circular}} tunnel being studied, {{as far as his}} walls are made of concrete, its conductivity coefficient would be in the range 10 − 1 − 10 − 2 mho/m. The cutoff frequency was also calculated and three different types of frequency range were characterized. Each of the frequency range is characterized, in turn, by certain propagation modes which differ in the cases of transverse electric <b>modes</b> (<b>TEmn</b> – <b>modes)</b> and transverse magnetic modes (TMmn –modes), (m,n = 0, 1). Besides, the attenuation constant was calculated at values larger and smaller than that of the cutoff frequency for both the transverse electric waves and transverse magnetic waves. Numerical results and graphes are also given for different values of m and n(m,n = 0 or 1) and a range of selected frequencies between 20 – 300 MHz. 1...|$|R

40|$|High {{frequency}} gyrotrons offer clear {{advantages in}} the millimeter to the submillimeter wavelemgth range {{due to their}} high output powers from several hundred watts up to several kW. In addition, gyrotrons {{have the advantage of}} tuning the output frequency by selecting the operating mode. However, a gyrotron produces a <b>TEmn</b> waveguide <b>mode</b> whose radiation pattern does not correspond to usual requirements. In order to widen the use of the high frequency gyrotron. We need a quasi-optical system to handle gyrotron output as a structure of a Gaussian beam (TEM 00 mode) which is suitable for transmission and application because of a linearly-polarization, simple intensity profile and wave front. Development of the system to convert the gyrotron output into the Gaussian beam is now in progress. If the Gaussian beam is obtained from gyrotron output using this system, the versatile transmission system for a Gaussian beam will be realized. In this system, confocal mirror systems are formed among the second floor, the third floor and the forth floor of the building of Research Center for Development of Far-Infrared Region. The Gaussian beam can be transmitted among three floors with keeping the waist size of output beam equal to that of input beam by rotating and moving the flat mirror located at the third floor...|$|R

However, a gyrotron produces a spreading radiation with a spatial structure of the <b>TEmn</b> circular waveguide <b>mode.</b> Because the polarization, the phase {{and the intensity of}} the radiation have complicated profiles, such radiation is not suitable for the application have complicated profiles, such radiation is not suitable for the applications. In this respect, a Gaussian beam with a linear-polarization, simple profiles of the intensity and the phase is more suitable for effective irradiation of the sample and transmission using mirror system and waveguide system.

40|$|High {{frequency}} gyrotrons {{are characterized}} by their capacity to generate powerful radiation in millimeter to submillimeter wavelength range. However, a gyrotron produces a spreading radiation with a spatial structure of the <b>TEmn</b> circular waveguide <b>mode.</b> Functional quasi-optical systems to transmit and to tune the waist size of Gaussian beam converted form gyrotron output are necessary to the application of grotron as a radiation source. Such systems enable us to ensure the effective coupling of beam to sample and waveguide. When a Gaussian beam is incident on a focusing mirror, the waist size of the beam reflected depends on {{the distance between the}} waist of the incident beam and the mirror. Because the distance between the mirror and the waist of output beam is also changed, the position of the waist also moves in two dimensions. From a {{point of view of the}} applications, adjustment of the waist size should be realized without changing the positions of the waists of the incident and the output beams. The mirror system consisting of four flat mirrors enables us to change optical path while keeping the input position and the output position constant. We are now designing the quasi-optical system consisting of a focusing mirror and two sets of flat mirrors to adjust the optical path appropriately...|$|R
