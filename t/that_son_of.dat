5|$|After {{another major}} {{incident}} occurred in 2009, {{it was announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> Beast would be closed indefinitely. References to Son of Beast {{were removed from the}} park's website and map in early 2010. All signage, including the box at the entrance, was also removed.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 2012, {{following}} a thorough {{evaluation of the}} roller coaster, Kings Island announced <b>that</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> Beast will {{be removed from the}} park to make room for future expansion. Demolition began in mid-September 2012. On November 20, one of the last remaining parts of the structure, the lift hill, was demolished. A new roller coaster called Banshee was completed in April 2014 and is now in the same location previously occupied by Son of Beast.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, 2015 and 2017, {{two or more}} wooden roller {{coasters}} with inversions opened. As opposed to the vertical loop <b>that</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> Beast had, Outlaw Run and Hades 360, Mine Blower and Twisted Colossus have more complex inversions. Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City has a double barrel roll and a 153° over-banked turn, and Hades 360 has a single corkscrew. Other elements which partially invert riders, such as the overbanked turn which occasionally turn riders beyond 90 degrees, are not typically considered inversions.|$|E
50|$|For centuries, the Christological {{perspective}} on <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> {{man has been}} seen as a possible counterpart to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> God and just as <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> God affirms the divinity of Jesus, in a number <b>of</b> cases <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> man affirms his humanity.|$|R
5000|$|For centuries, the Christological {{perspective}} on <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> {{man has been}} a natural counterpart to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> God {{and in many cases}} affirms the humanity of Jesus just as <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> God affirms his divinity. In the 5th century, Saint Augustine viewed the duality <b>of</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> God and <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> man in terms of the dual nature of Christ in hypostatic union, in <b>that</b> the <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> God became the <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> man through the act of Incarnation and wrote: [...] "Since he is the only <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> God by nature, he became also the <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> Man <b>that</b> he might be full of grace as well." ...|$|R

25|$|I {{have been}} a Catholic and an infidel; I {{have been a}} Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl. I am that Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look upon my like again.' I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E
2500|$|Early in his run, Backlund and Peter Maivia {{formed a}} {{successful}} tag team and challenged for the WWWF World Tag Team Championship, then held by The Yukon Lumberjacks. During a television taping in October 1978, Maivia turned on and attacked him and Skaaland. In the immediate aftermath, fans {{for the first}} time got to see another side of Backlund's personality: that of a raving, ranting maniac when angered or pushed hard enough; in the post-match interview, Backlund screamed to interviewer Vince McMahon {{that he was going to}} [...] "kill <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> a bitch!" [...] Backlund eventually won a series of matches against Maivia, including a steel cage match in January 1979 at Madison Square Garden.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, Rich {{released}} Pictures and Paintings, a jazzy {{album that}} {{was produced by}} journalist Peter Guralnick. This album was released via Sire Records. Pictures and Paintings received positive critical reviews and restored Rich's reputation as a musician, {{but it was his}} last album. In 2016, a tribute album entitled Feel Like Going Home: The Songs of Charlie Rich was released by Memphis International Records. [...] Tom Waits, who was an opening act for Rich in the 1970s, mentions him in the song [...] "Putnam County" [...] from his album Nighthawks at the Diner with the lyric: [...] "The radio's spitting out Charlie Rich... He sure can sing, <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> a bitch." ...|$|E

Female show similar results, but to a lesser degree.|$|R

40|$|The perfect tense-form verb ἀναβέβηκεν in John 3. 13 {{is usually}} {{interpreted}} {{in light of}} traditional verb theory, as a ‘past action with present results’. This interpretation introduces an apparent problematic chronology in <b>that</b> the <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> Man ascends before descending; however, recent developments in Greek grammar, particularly verbal aspect theory, provide a viable solution to this grammatical ‘problem’ and indicate <b>that</b> the <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> Man's descent precedes his ascent...|$|R
2500|$|On April 26, 1956, with 100 invited dignitaries on hand, {{one of the}} {{converted}} tankers, the SS Ideal-X (informally dubbed the [...] "SS Maxton" [...] after McLean's hometown in North Carolina), was loaded and sailed from [...] the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, New Jersey, for the Port of Houston, Texas, carrying fifty-eight [...] Trailer Vans [...] called later as containers, along with a regular load of liquid tank cargo. [...] As the Ideal-X left the Port of Newark, Freddy Fields, a top official of the International Longshoremen's Association, was asked {{what he thought of}} the newly fitted container ship. [...] Fields replied, [...] "I'd like to sink <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> a bitch." [...] McLean flew to Houston to be on hand when the ship safely docked.|$|E
2500|$|The early Heinlein biographer {{and critic}} Alexei Panshin, in his 1968 {{biography}} Heinlein in Dimension, {{took note of}} a controversial theme: [...] "The romantic situation in this story is a very interesting, very odd one: it {{is nothing less than}} a mutual sexual interest between an engineer of thirty and a girl of twelve ('adorable' is Heinlein's word for her), that culminates in marriage after some hop-scotching around in time to adjust their ages a bit." [...] The novel [...] "worried and bothered" [...] John W. Campbell, who said [...] "Bob can write a better story, with one hand tied behind him, than most people in the field can do with both hands. But Jesus, I wish <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> a gun would take that other hand out of his pocket." ...|$|E
2500|$|Audie Murphy, Hollywood actor. Murphy {{became the}} most {{decorated}} United States combat soldier in United States military history. He received the Medal of Honor, the U.S. military's highest award for valor, along with 32 additional U.S. medals. He served with CompanyB, 1stBattalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. Major General John P. Lucas {{is reported to have}} once visited the set of one of Murphy's films and, while he greeted actors and crew, was forced to salute Murphy – Murphy had the Medal of Honor and Lucas did not – and then had his handshake refused by Murphy, who instead returned the salute and then simply walked away. [...] Murphy later commented that [...] "...too damn many good men died at Anzio and Nettuno because of <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> a bitch. I'm damned if I'll shake hands with him." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{election}} of Marxist candidate Salvador Allende as President of Chile in September 1970 led Nixon to order that Allende {{not be allowed}} to take office. Edward Korry, US Ambassador to Chile, told Nixon that he saw no alternative to Allende. According to the ambassador, Nixon said, [...] "That son of a bitch, that son a bitch...Not you, Mr. Ambassador. It's <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> a bitch Allende. We're going to smash him." [...] Nixon pursued a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende, intended to first prevent Allende from taking office, called Track I, and then when that failed, to provide a [...] "military solution", called Track II. As part of Track II, CIA operatives approached senior Chilean military leaders, using false flag operatives, and encouraged a coup d'état, providing both finances ($50,000) and weapons (submachine guns). With US encouragement, coup plotters first assassinated Army leader, General René Schneider, as he opposed military interference in the political process.|$|E
2500|$|During the Myitkyina siege, {{which took}} place {{during the height of the}} monsoon season, Marauders' second-in-command, Col. Hunter, as well as the unit's regimental and {{battalion}} level surgeons, had urgently recommended that the entire 5307th be relieved of duty and returned to rear areas for rest and recovery. By this time, most of the men had fevers and continual dysentery, forcing the men to cut the seats out of their uniform trousers in order to fire their weapons and relieve themselves simultaneously. Stilwell rejected the evacuation recommendation, though he did make a frontline inspection of the Myitkyina lines. Afterwards, he ordered all medical staff to stop returning combat troops suffering from disease or illness, and instead return them to combat status, using medications to keep down fevers. The feelings of many Marauders towards General Stilwell at that time were summed up by one soldier, who stated, [...] "I had him [...] in my sights. I coulda' squeezed one off and no one woulda' known it wasn't a Jap who got <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> a bitch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pierpont {{writes that}} John Garfield was first {{choice for the}} role, but [...] "made {{impossible}} demands." [...] It was Kazan's decision {{to fall back on}} the far less experienced (and technically too young for the role) Brando. In a letter dated August 29, 1947, Williams confided to his agent Audrey Wood: [...] "It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part. It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man... A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard." [...] Brando based his portrayal of Kowalski on the boxer Rocky Graziano, whom he had studied at a local gymnasium. Graziano did not know who Brando was, but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man. He said, [...] "The curtain went up and on the stage is <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> a bitch from the gym, and he's playing me." ...|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{as to whether}} childhood gender stereotypes are inborn or are influenced by environmental factors. The presence of homosexual or heterosexual relationships in families influences play patterns in children: children of same-sex couples are raised differently, resulting in gender roles {{different from those of}} opposite-sex parents, according to the gender binary. A study by Goldberg, Kashy and Smith shows <b>that</b> <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> lesbian mothers play in a less-masculine way than <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> homosexual fathers or of heterosexual parents.|$|R
