5|$|Fast and active, <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> shark may be {{encountered}} alone, in pairs, or in loosely organized schools containing up {{to hundreds}} of individuals. Some aggregations seem to form for reproductive purposes, while others form in response to concentrations of food. This species may fall prey to larger sharks and killer whales. Known parasites of <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> shark include the tapeworms Cathetocephalus australis, Dasyrhynchus pacificus and D. talismani, Floriceps minacanthus, Phoreiobothrium robertsoni, and Pseudogrillotia spratti, the leech Stibarobdella macrothela, and the fluke Otodistomum veliporum.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s and 1780s the {{discovery}} of copper at Parys Mountain in Anglesey which could be cheaply extracted by opencast mining led to a crash in <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> price, and expensive deep mining began to become unviable. As <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> boom came to an end, the mines began to close. In 1788 mining ceased at Dolcoath itself, although some bal maidens continued to be employed picking through the large quantities of ore which had already {{been brought to the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|One {{problem with}} {{counting}} attacks on humans is that <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> shark is so {{similar to other}} requiem sharks. Victims and witnesses are unlikely to correctly identify which type of genus Carcharhinus shark {{is responsible for the}} attack. Experts trying to confirm shark attacks by species warn that their statistics undercount the number of attacks by requiem sharks like <b>the</b> <b>copper.</b>|$|E

50|$|Proponents of <b>the</b> {{particulate}} <b>copper</b> systems make <b>the</b> {{case that}} <b>the</b> particulate <b>copper</b> system {{perform as well}} or better than <b>the</b> dissolved <b>copper</b> systems as a wood preservative, but other industry researchers disagree. None of <b>the</b> particulate <b>copper</b> systems have been submitted to the American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) for evaluation, thus the particulate systems {{should not be used}} in applications where AWPA standards are required. However, all of <b>the</b> particulate <b>copper</b> systems have been tested and approved for building code requirements by the International Code Council (ICC). <b>The</b> particulate <b>copper</b> systems provide a lighter color than dissolved copper systems such as ACQ or copper azole.|$|R
5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7â€“d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity. The {{reason for this is}} still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E
5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. <b>The</b> <b>copper</b> coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E
5|$|Dwarka is {{mentioned}} in <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> inscription dated 574AD of Simhaditya, the Maitraka dynasty minister of Vallabhi. He {{was the son}} of Varahdas, the king of Dwarka. The nearby Bet Dwarka island is a religious pilgrimage site and an important archaeological site of the Late Harappan period, with one thermoluminescence date of 1570BC.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, when Henry Tureman Allen was {{exploring}} <b>the</b> <b>Copper</b> River {{in the new}} U.S. {{territory of}} Alaska, he named a discovered peak after Tillman, his academy professor, but the discovery proved to be one major error in the survey, Allen mistaking either Mount Wrangell or Mount Sanford for the non-existent Mount Tillman.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> shark is rare and little fishery {{information}} is available, {{leading to an}} assessment of Data Deficient. However, catch declines across all shark and ray species have been documented in the heavily-fished Gulf of California. Off East Asia, <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> shark has been assessed as Vulnerable; though species-specific data is unavailable, shark populations overall have been decimated in the region. The number of large adults have been too low to sustain targeted fisheries since the 1970s, {{and most of the}} current shark catch consists of small juveniles. Additional threats to this species include the degradation and destruction of its coastal nurseries from development, pollution, and aquaculture, mortality from shark nets used to protect beaches in South Africa and Australia, and persecution by fish farmers in southern Australia.|$|E
5|$|People who are {{asymptomatic}} (for instance, those diagnosed through {{family screening}} or {{only as a}} result of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. It is unclear whether these people are best treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate.|$|E

5|$|Physiotherapy and {{occupational}} therapy are beneficial {{for patients with}} the neurologic form of the disease. <b>The</b> <b>copper</b> chelating treatment may take {{up to six months}} to start working, and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors, as well as preventing the development of contractures that can result from dystonia.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War refocused {{discussions about}} the road. There were fears that Great Britain would enter {{on the side of}} the Confederacy during the early days of the war. British troops were as close to Michigan as Ontario, and more than half of <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> used in the US came from mines along the {{proposed}} roadway. Control of the area could have been established by seizing the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, severing communication lines through the Great Lakes. If the locks fell to an enemy force, no troops or supplies could be moved to <b>the</b> <b>Copper</b> Country except by land. The road was also needed during the five or six months of the year that transportation on the Great Lakes was barred by ice or stormy weather.|$|E
5|$|The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, {{formed in}} 1967 by Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, {{operated}} in <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> market as OPEC does in oil, though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, {{was never a}} member; it was dissolved in 1988.|$|E
40|$|The surface micro-deformations of {{a cavity}} copper mirror, an annular channel copper mirror, a {{multi-layer}} copper mirror and a sandwich copper mirror are tested when the mirrors are irradiated by {{high power laser}} and cooled by water.

5|$|The {{cultural}} role {{of copper}} has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> itself was valued, but gradually {{the shape and}} look of <b>the</b> <b>copper</b> became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until {{the time of the}} Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|The first chiral Lewis acid {{promoted}} asymmetric Nazarov cyclization {{was reported}} by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper (II) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98% ee.
