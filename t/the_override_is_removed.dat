40|$|Two {{fundamentally}} different orogenic systems have existed on Earth throughout the Phanerozoic. Circum-Pacific accretionary orogens are the external orogenic system formed around the Pacific rim, where oceanic lithosphere semicontinuously subducts beneath continental lithosphere. In contrast, the internal orogenic system {{is found in}} Europe and Asia as the collage of collisional mountain belts, formed during the collision between continental crustal fragments. External orogenic systems form at the boundary of large underlying mantle convection cells, whereas internal orogens form within one supercell. Here we present a compilation of hafnium isotope data from zircon minerals collected from orogens worldwide. We find that the range of hafnium isotope signatures for the external orogenic system narrows and trends towards more radiogenic compositions since 550 [*]Myr ago. By contrast, the range of signatures from the internal orogenic system broadens since 550 [*]Myr ago. We suggest that for the external system, the lower crust and lithospheric mantle beneath <b>the</b> <b>overriding</b> continent <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> during subduction and replaced by newly formed crust, which generates the radiogenic hafnium signature when remelted. For the internal orogenic system, the lower crust and lithospheric mantle is instead eventually replaced by more continental lithosphere from a collided continental fragment. Our suggested model provides a simple basis for unravelling the global geodynamic evolution of the ancient Earth...|$|R

40|$|Background Experts {{suggest that}} {{formulary}} alerts {{at the time}} of medication order entry are the most effective form of clinical decision support to automate formulary management. Objective Our objectives were to quantify the frequency of inappropriate nonformulary medication (NFM) alert <b>overrides</b> in <b>the</b> inpatient setting and provide insight on how the design of formulary alerts could be improved. Methods Alert <b>overrides</b> of <b>the</b> top 11 (n[*]=[*] 206) most-utilized and highest-costing NFMs, from January 1 to December 31, 2012, were randomly selected for appropriateness evaluation. Using an empirically developed appropriateness algorithm, appropriateness of NFM alert <b>overrides</b> <b>was</b> assessed by 2 pharmacists via chart review. Appropriateness agreement of <b>overrides</b> <b>was</b> assessed with a Cohen’s kappa. We also assessed which types of NFMs were most likely to <b>be</b> inappropriately <b>overridden,</b> <b>the</b> <b>override</b> reasons that <b>were</b> disproportionately provided in <b>the</b> inappropriate <b>overrides,</b> and <b>the</b> specific reasons <b>the</b> <b>overrides</b> <b>were</b> considered inappropriate.

50|$|The initial {{setting of}} the {{simulated}} subduction zone model is confined by two pistons. The piston connected to <b>the</b> <b>overriding</b> plate <b>is</b> locked, while the piston linking to subducting plate is subjected to a constant rate of compression. More importantly, there is a relatively thin magmatic arc and pre-existing fault dipping towards the subducting plate at <b>the</b> <b>overriding</b> plate. <b>The</b> detachment of the pre-existing fault occurs when buoyant continental margin is in contact with <b>the</b> <b>overriding</b> plate. It <b>is</b> because the buoyant margin resists subduction and significantly increases the frictional force in the contact region. The subduction then stops. Subsequently, the new subducting slab develops at an <b>overriding</b> plate with <b>the</b> continuous compression. The new developing slab eventually penetrates and breaks the old slab. A new subduction zone is formed with an opposite polarity to the previous one.|$|R

40|$|A new {{analytic}} model is presented for the thermal structure of subduction zones. It {{applies to the}} deeper regions of a subduction zone, where <b>the</b> <b>overriding</b> mantle <b>is</b> no longer rigid but flows parallel to the slab surface. The model captures the development of one thermal boundary layer out into the mantle wedge, and another into the subducting slab. By combining this model with the {{analytic model}} of Royden (1993 a,b), which applies to regions in which <b>the</b> <b>overriding</b> plate <b>is</b> rigid, a nearly complete analytic model for the thermal structure of a steady-state subduction zone can be achieved. A good agreement is demonstrated between {{the output of the}} combined analytic model and a numerical finite element calculation. The advantages of this analytic approach include (1) efficiency (only limited computing resources are needed); (2) flexibility (non-linear slab shape, and processes such as erosion, and shear heating are easily incorporated); and (3) transparency (the effect of changes in input variables can be seen directly) ...|$|R

METHODS: All DAI alerts, with a reaction of 'anaphylaxis', were analysed for inpatients and outpatients within our health system between January 2009 and December 2011.

30|$|Yet the evident cruelties {{discussed}} above have been framed as an acceptable act within the West through dominant discourses of animal welfarism. Animal welfare is a hegemonic stance toward animals in liberal democracies and {{it focuses on}} the importance of humane treatment of animals. Accordingly, the moral theory of animal welfare holds that animals may be killed to serve human interests {{as long as it is}} done humanely. In addition, this theory asserts that “there is no animal interest that cannot <b>be</b> <b>overridden</b> if <b>the</b> consequences of <b>the</b> <b>overriding</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently “beneficial” to human beings” (Francione, 1995, p. 6).
