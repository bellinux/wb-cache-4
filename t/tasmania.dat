5|$|A {{grant of}} $50,000 from the Tasmanian Community Fund in 2005 helped the Launceston City Council and AFL <b>Tasmania</b> {{construct}} a permanent Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame at York Park. The ground {{was chosen as}} the site because it is regarded as the home of Australian rules football in <b>Tasmania.</b> AFL <b>Tasmania</b> initiated the Hall of Fame nomination process, and since 2005 various clubs, players and grounds have been inducted. The Hall of Fame opened to the public on 21 February 2009. As of May 2009, $23.6million had been spent re-developing the stadium.|$|E

After one more match for Tamar, in which he took 5/41, Nash was chosen in the Northern <b>Tasmania</b> side in the annual match against Southern <b>Tasmania,</b> where he took match figures of 7/40 and top scored in both innings.|$|E
5|$|It occurs along {{almost the}} entire eastern coast of Australia, from Geelong, Victoria to Proserpine, Queensland. There was an {{isolated}} population on Long Island, <b>Tasmania</b> in 1999, and an 1876 record allegedly from King Island, {{although there has been}} speculation that that specimen was actually collected in the Furneaux Group. The species no longer occurs at any of these <b>Tasmania</b> locations, and has been declared extinct in <b>Tasmania</b> under that state's Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The range of latitude is thus about 20 to 38°S.|$|E

5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or in {{clusters}} {{on the underside}} of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from <b>Tasmania,</b> Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in <b>Tasmania</b> and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in <b>Tasmania</b> showed that it is {{much more likely to be}} found in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.|$|E
5|$|An {{aggressive}} 113 for Fitzroy against Melbourne Cricket Club in 1946–47 saw Harvey {{selected for}} the Victorian team {{at the age of}} 18.

He said that his effort was inspired by elder brother Merv, who gained Test selection in the same year.|$|E

5|$|Before they sailed for England, Australia played three warm-up matches. The {{first two}} were two-day games against <b>Tasmania</b> in Hobart {{and at the}} Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground, Launceston; the third was a three-day match against Western Australia in Perth. In Hobart, Australia scored 538/5 {{declared}} with centuries by Barnes, Hassett and Harvey in reply to 122. Using a mixture of pace and spin, they reduced <b>Tasmania</b> to 186/7 when time ran out. In Launceston, Australia won by an innings and 49 runs. Toshack took 5/24 as <b>Tasmania</b> fell for 123. Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as <b>Tasmania</b> fell for just 116, Barnes taking 3/1. Four days later, on Saturday 13 March, the Australians were at the WACA Ground where they found a tougher test from Western Australia. Western Australia scored 348 as Wally Langdon made 112, while five bowlers took two wickets each. Australia replied with 442/7 declared, including 115 apiece by Morris and Bradman. Western Australia only had time to reach 62/3 and the game was drawn. The match attracted a total crowd of 30,500.|$|E

5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus {{lived on a}} number of {{offshore}} islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and <b>Tasmania</b> (D.n.diemenensis), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to a small island situated in the Bass Strait between <b>Tasmania</b> and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected <b>Tasmania</b> and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism.|$|E
