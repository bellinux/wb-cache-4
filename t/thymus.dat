5|$|Some self {{reactive}} T cells {{escape the}} <b>thymus</b> {{for a number}} of reasons, mainly {{due to the lack of}} expression of some self antigens in the <b>thymus.</b> Another type of T cell T regulatory cells can down regulate self reactive T cells in the periphery. When immunological tolerance fails, autoimmune diseases can follow.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} {{the length of the}} thyroid ima artery is shorter, the artery ends by {{supplying}} the <b>thymus</b> gland and is known as thymica accessoria.|$|E
5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a <b>thymus,</b> spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the <b>thymus.</b> In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{may also}} be {{associated}} with autoimmune diseases, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or diabetes mellitus type 1. Myasthenia gravis, too, may happen {{in the presence of}} tumors (thymoma, a tumor of the <b>thymus</b> in the chest); people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA1 synthesis, but SFTPA1 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, pancreas, <b>thymus,</b> colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. Using specific monoclonal antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein can be detected in lung alveolar type II pneumocytes, club cells, and alveolar macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{variable in}} number: {{three or more}} small glands, and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the <b>thymus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) {{have a more}} {{advanced}} immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to Chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig's organ {{within the walls of}} their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable <b>thymus</b> and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.|$|E
5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the <b>thymus,</b> whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the <b>thymus</b> migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg of iodine {{is concentrated in}} thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal <b>thymus,</b> cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action of iodine in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at least) partially unknown.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations. The small white butterfly (Pieris rapae) for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of Brassicas and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations. The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on <b>Thymus</b> species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E
5|$|The {{headland}} {{is primarily}} covered with grass, {{as well as}} heather (Calluna vulgaris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), thyme (<b>Thymus</b> polytrichus) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover (Trifolium occidentale) were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north-, seaward-side of the headland. The parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta epithymum) is found growing on gorse. There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sea campion (Silene uniflora), and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA2 synthesis, but SFTPA2 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, pancreas, <b>thymus,</b> colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. While {{the majority of these}} tissues express both SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 transcripts, only SFTPA2 expression was found in the trachea and prostate. Using specific monoclonal antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein can be detected in lung alveolar type II pneumocytes, Clara cells, and alveolar macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar <b>thymus</b> epithelial cells is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the <b>thymus</b> at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in <b>thymus</b> and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (<b>Thymus</b> vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E
5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, <b>thymus</b> atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf <b>thymus</b> extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{classical}} αβ T cells (their {{development of}} which is outlined above), {{a number of other}} T lineages develop in the <b>thymus,</b> including γδ T cells and Natural Killer T (NKT)cells. Additionally, other non-T hematopoietic lineages can develop in the <b>thymus,</b> including B lymphocytes (B cells), Natural Killer lymphocytes (NK cells).), myeloid cells, and dendritic cells. However, the <b>thymus</b> is not a source of B, NK, or myeloid development. The development of these cells in the <b>thymus</b> reflects the multipotent nature of hematopoitic prognitors that seed the <b>thymus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>thymus</b> gland cells {{form part}} of the body's immune system. In those with {{myasthenia}} gravis, the <b>thymus</b> gland is large and abnormal. It sometimes contains clusters of immune cells which indicate lymphoid hyperplasia, and the <b>thymus</b> gland may give wrong instructions to immune cells.|$|E
25|$|The arteries {{supplying}} the <b>thymus</b> are {{branches of the}} internal thoracic, and inferior thyroid arteries, with branches from the superior thyroid artery sometimes seen. The branches reach the <b>thymus</b> and travel with the septa of the capsule into the area between the cortex and medulla, where they enter the <b>thymus</b> itself.|$|E
25|$|The nerves {{supplying}} the <b>thymus</b> {{arise from the}} vagus nerve and the cervical sympathetic chain. Branches from the phrenic nerves reach the investing capsule, but do not enter into the <b>thymus</b> itself. Although present, the exact role of the nerve supply of the <b>thymus</b> is little understood.|$|E
25|$|The <b>thymus</b> is {{a primary}} lymphoid organ and the site of {{maturation}} for T cells, the lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system. The <b>thymus</b> increases in size from birth in response to postnatal antigen stimulation, then to puberty and regresses thereafter. The loss or lack of the <b>thymus</b> results in severe immunodeficiency and subsequent high susceptibility to infection. In most species, the <b>thymus</b> consists of lobules divided by septa which {{are made up of}} epithelium and is therefore an epithelial organ. T cells mature from thymocytes, proliferate and undergo selection process in the thymic cortex before entering the medulla to interact with epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thymus</b> {{transplantation}} {{results in}} that T cells {{are taught to}} avoid reacting with donor antigens instead, and may still react with many self-antigens in the body. Autoimmune disease is a frequent complication after <b>thymus</b> transplantation, found in 42% of subjects over 1 year post-transplantation. However, this is partially explained by that the indication itself, that is, complete DiGeorge syndrome (absence of <b>thymus),</b> {{increases the risk of}} autoimmune disease.|$|E
25|$|Cervical <b>thymus</b> {{is a rare}} malformation. Thymic tissue {{containing}} cysts {{is rarely}} described in the literature, ectopic glandular tissue included in the wall of cystic formation can trigger a series of problems {{similar to those of}} <b>thymus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>thymus</b> is {{largest and}} most active during the {{neonatal}} and pre-adolescent periods. By the early teens, the <b>thymus</b> begins to atrophy and thymic stroma is mostly replaced by adipose tissue. Nevertheless, residual T lymphopoiesis continues throughout adult life.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>thymus</b> entry, {{progenitors}} proliferate {{to generate}} the ETP population. This step is following by the generation of DN2 thymocytes which migrate from the cortico-medullary junction toward the <b>thymus</b> capsule. DN3 thymocytes are generated at the subcapsular zone.|$|E
25|$|Two primary {{forms of}} tumours {{originate}} in the <b>thymus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thymocytes are hematopoietic {{progenitor}} cells {{present in}} the <b>thymus.</b> Thymopoiesis is the process in the <b>thymus</b> by which thymocytes differentiate into mature T lymphocytes. The primary function of thymocytes is the generation of T lymphocytes (T cells). The <b>thymus</b> provides an inductive environment, which allows for the development and selection of physiologically useful T cells. The processes of beta-selection, positive selection, and negative selection shape the population of thymocytes into a peripheral pool of T cells {{that are able to}} respond to foreign pathogens and are immunologically tolerant towards self antigens.|$|E
25|$|In the {{endocrine}} system, Anahata {{is associated}} with the <b>thymus</b> gland, located in the chest. This gland produces T-cells, that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the <b>thymus</b> is greatest before puberty and is impaired by the appearance of sex hormones in the blood stream from puberty onwards.|$|E
25|$|The thyomocytes and the {{epithelium}} of the <b>thymus</b> {{have different}} developmental origins. The epithelium of the <b>thymus</b> develops first, appearing as two flask-shape endodermal diverticula, which arise one on either side, {{from the third}} pharyngeal pouch, and extend outward and backward into the surrounding mesoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme {{in front of the}} ventral aorta.|$|E
25|$|About 98% of thymocytes die {{during the}} {{development}} processes in the <b>thymus</b> by failing either positive selection or negative selection, whereas the other 2% survive and leave the <b>thymus</b> to become mature immunocompetent T cells. Increasing evidence indicates microRNAs, which are small noncoding regulatory RNAs, could impact the clonal selection process during thymic development. For example, miR-181a was found {{to play a role}} in the positive selection of T lymphocytes.|$|E
25|$|A <b>thymus</b> may be transplanted, however, this {{approach}} is problematic due to donor requirements and matching tissue with the patient.|$|E
25|$|The <b>thymus</b> also secretes {{hormones and}} cytokines that {{regulate}} the maturation of T cells, including thymulin, thymopoietin, and thymosins.|$|E
25|$|Like the <b>thymus,</b> the spleen {{has only}} efferent lymphatic vessels. Both the short gastric arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic vessels travel only {{away from}} the <b>thymus,</b> {{accompanying}} the arteries and veins. These drain into the brachiocephalic, tracheobronchial and parasternal llymph nodes.|$|E
