5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>to</b> outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Mashbir {{returned}} to Japan after an 11-year absence {{in a second}} attempt to launch the M-Plan {{on behalf of the}} Office of Naval Intelligence and his friend, naval attaché Zacharias. At that time, there was still hope that war between Japan and America might still be prevented. This mission aroused suspicions among ill-informed military attachés in Tokyo and an investigation was started into Mashbir. In a misunderstanding that would come close to damaging his career irreparably once more, Mashbir was investigated in Hawaii and, influenced by the military attaché suspicions, a prejudicial report based upon erroneous assumptions was delivered on 24 June 1937. Colonel Mashbir was advised on 25 February 1939 that he was disenrolled from the Military Intelligence Division G2 Reserves for failure to report on the specified day for physical examination. However, it appeared that the actual cause of the disenrollment was due to suspicions aroused by failure <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>to</b> uninformed individuals the nature and the extent of the work on which he was actually engaged. Mashbir's dismissal and the failure to implement an intelligence network such as that suggested in Mashbir's M-Plan {{has been described as a}} key factor in the United States' failure to have more information on Japan before the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.|$|E

40|$|Managing {{communications}} and information within an organization {{is a challenge}} for any owner who wants his company to thrive, to become bigger, more powerful and more efficient. Engaging communication managers is essential for a company. Establishing a proper flow of communication to exchange information with internal and external public is the main problem of every professional communications manager. How <b>to</b> <b>communicate?</b> When <b>to</b> <b>communicate?</b> What <b>to</b> <b>communicate?</b> Whom <b>to</b> <b>communicate?</b> These are the main issues that are challenging for communications management. The literature abounds with examples for managing {{communications and}} information, but in this paper the emphasis will {{be placed on the}} model of communication and information in daily journalism. This model can serve as an example to many communication managers. Key words: communication; communications management; exchanging information...|$|R

25|$|A {{major concern}} of the new republican {{government}} was recognition by other nations. In 1910, {{the vast majority of}} European states were monarchies. Only France, Switzerland and San Marino were republics. For this reason, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Government, Bernardino Machado, directed his agenda exercising extreme prudence, leading him, on 9 October 1910, <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>to</b> diplomatic representatives in Portugal that the Provisional Government would honour all the international commitments assumed by the previous regime.|$|E

For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop a prior suit accusing Thompson of contempt of court concerning the game Bully, which he attempted to have banned in 2005.|$|E
25|$|According to Marzanna Paplawska, the {{historically}} popular Wayang kulit typically {{is based on}} the Hindu epics the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. In 1960s, the Christian missionary effort adopted the art form to create Wayang wahyu. The Javanese Jesuit Brother Timotheus L. Wignyosubroto used the show <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>to</b> the Javanese and other Indonesians the teachings of the Bible and of the Catholic Church in a manner accessible to the audience.

25|$|It {{is noted}} in the {{literature}} that occupational therapists should use specific occupational therapy vocabulary along with the ICF {{in order to ensure}} correct communication about specific concepts. The ICF might lack certain categories to describe what occupational therapists need <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>to</b> clients and colleagues. It also may not be possible to exactly match the connotations of the ICF categories to occupational therapy terms. The ICF is not an assessment and specialized occupational therapy terminology should not be replaced with ICF terminology. The ICF is an overarching framework for current therapy practices.|$|E
25|$|Human {{beings have}} often sought to give {{concrete}} form to our powerful collective longing for peace. After World War I, that longing {{led to the}} League of Nations and numerous rules and taboos designed to govern warfare itself. Of these, the most important was the proscription against attacking and killing civilian non-combatants even in times of war. However, {{the second half of}} the twentieth century has seen most of those taboos broken. Guernica was the point of departure, and Hiroshima is the ultimate symbol.

Regardless of such, b-boys and b-girls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport, form of entertainment and as well through capitalism. Battle Rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by old-school/ golden-era legends such as Herc, Kid Capri and KRS-One.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the only}} means for race {{officials}} <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>to</b> drivers was through the usage of flags. With the advent of two-way or full-duplex radios, {{this is not necessarily}} the case. Most drivers racing on paved short track oval courses do not rely on flags; rather, they are informed of track conditions by their crew chiefs and spotters or by yellow / red flashing lights found on most oval tracks. Occasionally, though, some drivers must rely on the use of flags for information when they experience radio malfunctions. Flags are still used to tell the crowd of spectators what is happening. Dirt track and lower level racers are less likely to have radios than their paved track counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Building {{awareness}} {{to the new}} Metro Red Line required a massive public relations and advertising campaign. Several agencies were awarded contracts to supply information, create signage and billboards, and produce radio, newspaper and television advertising. Coronado Communications, in alliance with sub-contractor Pangea Corporation, worked out a creative strategy <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>to</b> the Latino, Korean and Chinese communities. Under the direction of Coronado Communications' Fernando Oaxaca and Pangea's Cheryl Ann Wong, the campaign reached the target audience months before the Metro opened by utilizing traditional media and hosting special minority community events. As the Metro Red Line extended to the West Side of Los Angeles, another campaign was enacted by UltraSystems Environmental and Hintz and Balvin Communications, who put together a team to handle all the collateral and public relations.|$|E
25|$|Arnett {{worked for}} CNN for 18 years ending in 1999. During the Gulf War, {{he became a}} {{household}} name worldwide when he became the only reporter with live coverage directly from Baghdad. His dramatic reports often had air raid sirens blaring {{and the sound of}} US bombs exploding in the background. Together with two other CNN journalists, Bernard Shaw and John Holliman, Arnett brought continuous coverage from Baghdad for the 16 initial intense hours of the war (17 January 1991). Although 40 foreign journalists were present at the Al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad at the time, only CNN possessed the means — a private phone line connected to neighboring Amman, Jordan — <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>to</b> the outside world. CNN broadcast Arnett's extended call live for several hours, with a picture of Arnett as video. Soon the other journalists left Iraq, including the two CNN colleagues, which left Arnett as the sole remaining reporter.|$|E
