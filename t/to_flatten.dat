5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the illusion of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{decided to}} use the medium roller <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> out the surface, but further showers breathed more life into the pitch, forcing a rain break {{immediately}} after the start of England's run chase. The rain immediately stopped after the players returned to the pavilion, but upon promptly returning to the middle, the rain started again. The players returned after 15 minutes and played for approximately half an hour, before Washbrook and Hutton unsuccessfully appealed against the light. Rain then came again for another 40 minutes, which included the tea break. The weather cleared in time for the normal resumption of play at 4:30 after the scheduled adjournment.|$|E
50|$|The convex <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> cap {{is up to}} 7 cm in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Individual nodes {{of popcorn}} can assume {{a variety of}} shapes from round <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> ear or button like shapes.|$|R
50|$|This turtle has an elongated, {{and rather}} narrow {{carapace}} up to 16.7 cm, which is slightly domed <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> with a low, disrupted medial keel.|$|R
5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the table to the placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by the side of the hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System formed 4.568 {{billion years}} ago from the {{gravitational}} collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200AU and a hot, dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim is to}} land on, or ideally surpass, a line marked {{across the}} hill called the 'K-point', 'critical point', or 'calculation line'. In order to attain the most points from the style judges, athletes strive for a 'Telemark' landing: instead of landing with simply both feet together (a 'two-footed' landing), one foot is planted clearly {{in front of the}} other (without sliding the skis), both feet held no more than four ski widths' apart, and the body held stable with a straight back and arms outstretched. This pose must be maintained until the 'outrun' – a line at the very end of the hill, where the slope has fully flattened out – is reached. The exact placement of landing is measured between the athlete's front and back feet. Failing to make a Telemark landing results in a loss of style points. Considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before the outrun line, such as falling over or touching the ground with any part of the body except the feet. However, when the hill begins <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> out, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a Telemark landing.|$|E
50|$|The flowers {{give way}} <b>to</b> <b>flattened,</b> rounded <b>to</b> oval-shaped disclike fruits {{up to about}} half a {{centimeter}} long. Each green to pink shiny fruit is divided down the center into two chambers containing seeds.|$|R
25|$|The {{preservation}} of plants varies from perfect three-dimensional cellular permineralisation <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> charcoal films. On occasion, plants may have their vertical axes preserved in growth position, with rhizoids {{still attached to}} rhizomes; even the plant litter is preserved.|$|R
50|$|Seed: Seed {{morphology}} is diverse, from globular <b>to</b> <b>flattened,</b> {{and occasionally}} aril. The seed coat usually contains phytomelan (phytomelanin), {{one of the}} defining characteristics of the order, a black pigment present in the seed coat, creating a dark crust.|$|R
25|$|Language letter {{frequencies}} {{may offer}} little help for some extended historical encryption {{techniques such as}} homophonic cipher that tend <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide an attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{process for}} both hemming and seaming are the same, {{except that the}} tonnage {{requirement}} is greater for seaming. The process starts by bending the edge to an acute angle. A flattening die is then used <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> the hem.|$|E
25|$|There is {{historical}} evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or {{any hint of}} a bosom. Early English Puritans used a tight bodice <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> breasts completely, while 17th century Spaniards put lead plates across the chests of young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing.|$|E
5000|$|Nested {{traits are}} {{equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> traits; the composition hierarchy {{does not affect}} the traits behaviour. For example, given trait S = A + X, where X = B + C, then trait T = A + B + C is the same as S.|$|R
50|$|Mapping {{large areas}} causes {{noticeable}} distortions due <b>to</b> <b>flattening</b> the significantly curved {{surface of the}} earth. How distortion gets distributed depends on the map projection. Scale varies across the map, and the stated map scale will only be an approximation. This is discussed in detail below.|$|R
50|$|The name is {{from the}} Latin patera ("a saucer"), and refers to the highly depressed, saucer-like shape of the shells of these snails. In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> shells, {{members of the group}} have an imperforate umbilicus and a single tooth on the parietal wall of the aperture.|$|R
25|$|This {{process takes}} the oat groats through several roll stands <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> and {{separate}} the bran from the flour (endosperm). The two separate products (flour and bran) get sifted through a gyrating sifter screen to further separate them. The final products are oat bran and debranned oat flour.|$|E
25|$|Diamante's Army {{is led by}} , whose ability {{allows him}} <b>to</b> <b>flatten,</b> reform, and fold {{anything}} while still retaining its original characteristics. It {{is made up of}} , an old skilled martial artist; , a strong man who can change his weight; , a man who can swim on the ground or through walls; and , a boy who possesses both human and Fighter Fish men genes and fights with kicks.|$|E
25|$|As an object's {{speed or}} {{momentum}} increases, arcs tend <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> out in moving ahead and broaden in turns. In baseball, a fastball {{would tend to}} move in a straighter line than other pitches; while a figure skater moving at top speed {{would be unable to}} turn as sharply as a slower skater, and would need to cover more ground to complete the turn.|$|E
50|$|A coined {{solder ball}} is a solder ball subject <b>to</b> coining, i.e., <b>flattening</b> <b>to</b> a shape {{resembling}} {{that of a}} coin, to increase contact reliability.|$|R
50|$|The {{breakdown}} {{of her first}} marriage caused her to reject abstraction for a period, returning to representational painting. However, works from the mid-1950s moved away from direct representation, simplifying still life and landscapes <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> areas of pure colour. By the 1970s work was almost totally abstract and focused on geometric shape and colour.|$|R
25|$|Apophysomyces variabilis {{resembles the}} other {{three members of the}} genus Apophysomyces but is {{characterized}} by the variable appearance of its sporangiospores and sporangiophores which range from club-shaped <b>to</b> trapezoidal <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> spheres. The sporangiophore can measure up to 400μm in length and has a funnel-shaped apophysis or swelling below the columella. Hyphae are smooth-walled, aseptate, and branched.|$|R
25|$|Generally all {{planes are}} used <b>to</b> <b>flatten,</b> reduce the {{thickness}} of, and impart a smooth surface to a rough piece of lumber or timber. Planing {{is also used}} to produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually too large for shaping, where the integrity of the whole requires the same smooth surface. Special types of planes are designed to cut joints or decorative mouldings.|$|E
25|$|While driving, {{the player}} {{collects}} power-ups from item boxes placed in various {{points on the}} track. These power-ups allow the player to attack opponents, causing them to slow down or spin out of control; defend against such attacks; or gain boosts in speed. These include the series staple items, such as the Mushroom, Koopa shell projectiles, the Starman, and banana peels. There are also new items such as the Mega Mushroom, which temporally grows the player to an enormous size and allows them <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> opposing karts.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of this design above the parabolic trough design is the higher temperature. Thermal energy at higher temperatures {{can be converted to}} electricity more efficiently and can be more cheaply stored for later use. Furthermore, there is less need <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> the ground area. In principle a power tower can be built {{on the side of a}} hill. Mirrors can be flat and plumbing is concentrated in the tower. The disadvantage is that each mirror must have its own dual-axis control, while in the parabolic trough design single axis tracking can be shared for a large array of mirrors.|$|E
50|$|Armillaria nabsnona is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Physalacriaceae. The species {{is found in the}} west coast of North America, Hawaii, and Japan, where it grows on {{decaying}} hardwoods, particularly species of alder. Its fruit bodies have convex <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> orange-brown caps up to 7 cm in diameter, brown stipes, and whitish to pinkish-tan gills.|$|R
50|$|Shells {{of these}} nektonic {{carnivores}} are variable in form, depending on species; ranges from evolute to involute, compressed lenticular to globose with rounded <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> venter and flanks. The suture generally has shallow ventral and lateral lobes. The {{location of the}} siphuncle is variable, but never at an extreme ventral or dorsal position (Kümmel 1964, K449).|$|R
50|$|Seeds: Achenes oval <b>to</b> elliptical, <b>flattened,</b> densely hairy and {{enveloped in}} wooly bracts.|$|R
25|$|The immobility of {{the trench}} warfare characterizing the First World War {{led to a}} need for a powerfully armed {{military}} engine that would be at the same time protected from enemy fire and could move on the extremely irregular terrain of battlefields. Barbed wire especially posed a considerable threat as it was cheap and easy to install, extremely effective at slowing or stopping an offensive by troops against protected fire, and very difficult to eliminate, even with artillery. Special machines were considered to attempt to eliminate this problem: armoured, armed vehicles, with a capacity <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> or otherwise eliminate barbed-wire lines.|$|E
25|$|Cunninghams, which {{tighten the}} luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling {{downward}} on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. The idea is <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> the main sail in heavier weather or when sailing to windward. In its simplest form {{a stainless steel}} hook that goes through the cringle. From the hook a cordage tail passes through a turnblock on the deck {{at the base of}} the mast and back to a cleat on the deck. Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.|$|E
25|$|A {{method of}} {{external}} (noninvasive) fetal monitoring (EFM) during childbirth is cardiotocography, using a cardiotocograph {{that consists of}} two sensors: The heart (cardio) sensor is an ultrasonic sensor, similar to a Doppler fetal monitor, that continuously emits ultrasound and detects motion of the fetal heart by the characteristic of the reflected sound. The pressure-sensitive contraction transducer, called a tocodynamometer (toco) has a flat area that is fixated to the skin by a band around the belly. The pressure required <b>to</b> <b>flatten</b> {{a section of the}} wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of contraction.|$|E
50|$|Private Godfrey's Cherry Tree Cottage is set <b>to</b> be <b>flattened</b> <b>to</b> {{make way}} for a new aerodrome. Frazer, however, champions his cause. He knows the {{minister}} responsible for the plan, and he knows his father, and he knows about an incident in the draper's shop...|$|R
50|$|Like all echinoderms, sea {{cucumbers}} have an endoskeleton {{just below the}} skin, calcified structures that are usually reduced to isolated microscopic ossicles (or sclerietes) joined by connective tissue. In some species these can sometimes be enlarged <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> plates, forming an armour. In pelagic species such as Pelagothuria natatrix (Order Elasipodida, family Pelagothuriidae), the skeleton is absent {{and there is no}} calcareous ring.|$|R
50|$|Juvavionautilus, has {{a widely}} umbilicate, slowly expanding, evolute, {{perforate}} shell {{in which the}} flanks converge on a rounded <b>to</b> <b>flattened</b> venter so that the maximum width is just central of the umbilical shoulders. The suture includes a ventral saddle and broad lateral lobes. In some, there is a secondary ventral lobe. The siphuncle is subcentral. Juvavionautilus comes from Europe and Timur.|$|R
