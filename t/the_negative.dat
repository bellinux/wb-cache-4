50|$|After Hartmann {{concluded}} {{his investigation}} he returned <b>the</b> <b>negatives</b> to UPI, which then informed the Trents about them. In 1970 the Trents asked Philip Bladine, {{the editor of}} the News-Register (the successor of the Telephone-Register), for the negatives; the Trents noted that they had never been paid for <b>the</b> <b>negatives</b> and thus wanted them back. Bladine asked UPI to return <b>the</b> <b>negatives,</b> which it did. However, for some reason Bladine never told the Trents that <b>the</b> <b>negatives</b> had been returned. In 1975 <b>the</b> <b>negatives</b> were found in the files of the News-Register by Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist for the U.S. Navy and a ufologist. After completing his own study of the photos, Maccabee ensured that the photos were returned to the Trents.|$|R

Instead of emphasizing Charles's achievements in the reunification of the country, the friar described in detail <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> episodes of Charles's reign.

The Franciscan friar attributed Charles's defeat by Basarab of Wallachia as a punishment from God for the king's revenge.|$|E

The headline read: [...] "At Long Last—Authentic Photographs Of Flying Saucer?" [...] The story and photos were subsequently picked up by the International News Service (INS) and sent to other newspapers around the nation, thus giving them wide publicity. Life magazine published cropped versions of the photos on June 26, 1950, along with a photo of Trent and his camera. The Trents had been promised that <b>the</b> <b>negatives</b> would be returned to them; however, they were not returned—Life magazine told the Trents that it had misplaced <b>the</b> <b>negatives.</b>|$|R
