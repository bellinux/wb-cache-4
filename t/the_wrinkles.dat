40|$|AbstractFor a {{membrane}} structure, wrinkles have {{an important}} effect on its mechanical behaviors. <b>Wrinkling</b> level characterizes <b>the</b> development of <b>wrinkles</b> and reflects <b>the</b> performance of a membrane in its service, and it plays a very significant role in <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> analysis. <b>The</b> shell elements combined with the stability theory would be an ideal solution to <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> problem. However, this approach requires a dense mesh and the computation is very time consuming. Also <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> parameters {{are very sensitive to}} the size of shell elements. Existing wrinkling models based on membrane elements are derived from the Tension Field Theory which are incapable of describing fully <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> behaviors. A new <b>wrinkling</b> model adopting <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> strain as a measure of <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> level is proposed in this paper to address these issues. According to the analogy between <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> strain and <b>the</b> elasto-plastic strain, a wrinkling potential surface is assumed to exist and its normal direction defines the direction of <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> strain tensor by virtue of the flow rule. Based on the consistent condition of <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> potential surface, a modified constitutive tensor is obtained. To avoid the switching of <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> state in <b>the</b> numerical solution, a new wrinkling criterion is proposed, in which the predominant influence of the previous state is included. Besides, a new approach to determine <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> orientation is given to improve the efficiency of convergence in the slack region. The objectivity of <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> coordinate frame is also demonstrated as an accompanying set of results. Finally, two benchmark problems are analyzed with <b>the</b> proposed <b>wrinkling</b> model, and their results are compared with those in the literatures. Results indicate that <b>the</b> proposed <b>wrinkling</b> model is valid and accurate to characterize <b>the</b> <b>wrinkling</b> level of a membrane and it exhibits efficient convergence even in the slack region...|$|R

Adjacent to these passages, at the temple, around the furrows of the right eye and the wing of the nostril, are interstices of green-gray underpainting. The right eyeball is painted with a series of transparent glazes, atop which is placed a drop of white lead pigment for the highlight. This eye is surrounded by a complex variety of brushwork: the brow is formed by an uneven series of strokes; a single stroke designates the fold above the upper lid; the skin above the cheek is molded with a rounded brush; <b>the</b> <b>wrinkles</b> at the corner of the eye are denoted by a stroke of wet paint dragged over a dry underpainting. A blunt object, likely a brush handle, was used to accent a wrinkle beneath the eye, and to score into the wet paint of the hair, creating sharp curls against which the broader passages of hair recede.|$|E

40|$|In {{the deep}} drawing, the low blank holder force (BHF) will cause <b>the</b> <b>wrinkle,</b> while <b>the</b> high BHF {{will result in}} the tearing. Therefore it is {{important}} to determine the appropriate BHF in the forming. In this paper, the variable blank holder force (VBHF) approach for the deep drawing is employed. The simple closed-type algorithm is developed to obtain the VBHF trajectory. The proposed algorithm is roughly divided into two phases. The objective of first phase is to check <b>the</b> <b>wrinkle</b> and <b>the</b> tearing. In this phase, the low BHF, which causes <b>the</b> <b>wrinkle,</b> is used as the initial BHF.

The distance between the die and the blank holder is used to measure <b>the</b> <b>wrinkle.</b> Then, <b>the</b> second phase is considered. The main objective of second phase is to examine the thickness deviations. It is expected that the BHF will be decreased by considering the thickness deviation. <b>The</b> <b>wrinkle</b> is also checked in the second phase. By iterating above two phases, the VBHF trajectory can be obtained. One of the advantages by the VBHF is to reduce the forming energy.

Not only does it reduce the incidence of relentless pizzle rot in sheep, but it decreases the amount of urine staining on the belly of the sheep. This procedure can greatly reduce the occurrence of flystrike on the belly area. Mulesing is an animal husbandry procedure that has currently faced much opposition throughout its practice.

It flattens out <b>the</b> <b>wrinkles</b> around the breech of the sheep, reducing the places where moisture collects affecting the skin of the sheep resulting in liquid protein exudate which is attractive to Lucilia cuprina. Mulesing also increases the amount of bare skin around the vulva during the healing process, reducing urine staining and amount of flystrike. This procedure does cause pain, but since it is considered the most effective method to prevent breech strike, it is seemingly justifiable. Mulesing is as effective as breeding sheep for less wrinkle (score 2) which are resistant to flystrike. Mulesing is a good prevention until breeding can remove the need for the operation in flystrike prevention ...|$|E
