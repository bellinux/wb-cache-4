5|$|A {{consequence}} of his perfectionism {{is that some}} artists who initially sign deals with Dr.Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> The Wash, featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman, Joell Ortiz, Raekwon and Rakim.|$|E
5|$|Aristo {{was born}} in Jakarta in 1976. As a child, he became {{interested}} in film {{when he and his}} family went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> theatre together; in an interview with Tabloid Nova, he recalled that one of the first films he saw was a comedy starring Warkop. After beginning junior high school in 1988, he began to go to the theatres to watch films on his own. Despite his enjoyment of film, he was initially active in an indie band.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, by {{the method}} of Experimental Phonetics, we {{analyzed}} an ambiguous Chinese sentence (Tamen xingqitian dou qu kan dianying). This sentence has two meanings. One meaning is “They all go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> Sunday”. Another meaning is “They go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> every Sunday”. Through analysis, {{we found that the}} semantic distinction of the two meanings is reflected in the change of fundamental frequency and duration. When the fundamental frequency of "dou" rises, and its duration is prolonged, this sentence is understood as “They all go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> Sunday”. In reverse, when the fundamental frequency of "dou" falls, and its duration is shortened, this sentence is understood as “They go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> every Sunday”...|$|R

During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> premiere.|$|E

5|$|Seeking a {{customer}} for Photophone, in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then {{general manager of}} RCA, approached Joseph P. Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of {{a plan for the}} company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live vaudeville, was attempting a transition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, PDC. This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.|$|E

5|$|This {{version of}} the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album Chunga's Revenge (1970), which was {{followed}} by the double-album soundtrack <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> 200 Motels (1971), featuring the Mothers, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Ringo Starr, Theodore Bikel, and Keith Moon. Co-directed by Zappa and Tony Palmer, it was filmed in a week at Pinewood Studios outside London. Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting. The film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician. It was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to 35mm film, a process that allowed for novel visual effects. It was released to mixed reviews. The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the Royal Albert Hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.|$|E
