5|$|The Vrba–Wetzler {{report was}} not {{distributed}} widely until weeks after Vrba's escape in April 1944. Between 15 May and 7 July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews (12,000 a day) were deported to Auschwitz. Vrba believed {{they would have}} run or fought had they been <b>told</b> <b>they</b> were being sent to their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Carl and Ellie grow up, {{get married}} {{and live in the}} {{restored}} house. Carl sells toy balloons at the zoo where Ellie works. After she suffers a miscarriage and they are <b>told</b> <b>they</b> cannot have a child, the two decide to realize their dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They save for the trip, but repeatedly have to spend the money on more pressing needs. Finally, the now elderly Carl arranges for the trip, but Ellie falls ill and dies.|$|E
5|$|Carless {{makes an}} {{impressive}} speech in Persian {{to convince the}} drivers to continue into Nuristan. They climb an extremely indistinct track to the pass. They descend into Nuristan: it grows hot. Men run to meet them: they are <b>told</b> <b>they</b> are the first Europeans ever to cross the pass (Newby doesn't believe this). They are given ice-cold milk to drink.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} debut for the Shrimpers {{a day after}} signing, coming on as a 60th-minute {{substitute}} in a 2–1 defeat to Cheltenham Town at Roots Hall. Comminges made seven appearances during his time at Southend, all of which in the league. In May 2011, {{he was one of}} five players <b>told</b> <b>they</b> were to be released by the club.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Burns learns of the school's oil and {{immediately}} decides {{that he must}} have it, even as Smithers voices his disapproval. After failing to convince Principal Skinner to give him the oil, Mr. Burns establishes a slant drilling operation and beats the school to tapping the oil well. The school is <b>told</b> <b>they</b> have no legal recourse, and Willie and Puente are laid off to cover the school's losses.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis began {{shipping}} {{large numbers}} of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz {{in the middle of}} 1942. Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. The victims were <b>told</b> <b>they</b> were to undergo delousing and a shower. They were stripped of their belongings and herded into the gas chamber.|$|E

5|$|With {{the plans}} for I-70 extended, a transcontinental route would again be {{attempted}} across the San Rafael Swell. The area west of Green River was so remote that survey crews followed wild horses with jeeps to survey parts of the route. According to a story told at the highway's dedication, by an engineer who surveyed the highway, his group was approached by a sheep rancher and asked what they were doing. The rancher fell over laughing when he was <b>told</b> <b>they</b> were building a freeway.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert, {{producers}} Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, production designer Ken Adam {{and director}} of photography Freddie Young then went to Japan, spending three weeks searching for locations. SPECTRE's shore fortress headquarters was changed to an extinct volcano after the team learned that the Japanese do not build castles by the sea. The group was due {{to return to the}} UK on a BOAC Boeing 707 flight (BOAC Flight 911) on 5 March 1966, but cancelled after being <b>told</b> <b>they</b> had a chance to watch a ninja demonstration. That flight crashed 25 minutes after takeoff, killing all on board. In Tokyo, the crew also found Hunt, who decided to go on holiday after having his request to direct declined. Hunt was invited to direct the second unit for You Only Live Twice and accepted the job.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, then-Emir (now King) Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa began {{a reform}} process and in 2001 exiles were <b>told</b> <b>they</b> could come back. Rejecting {{an offer to}} become a cabinet {{minister}} and leaving his leading position in the opposition, al-Jamri returned from the United Kingdom in December 2001, eight months after his father had obtained a consent from the Emir to establish two newspapers. Initially, he was sceptical about the king's reform plan, but al-Jamri received a personal invitation by the king and was given a large margin of freedom of expression. Al-Jamri, backed by 39 other private investors (US$5.3 million capital) had initially planned to establish two independent newspapers, Al-Wasat in Arabic and Gulf Observer in English.|$|E

5|$|On March 20, Parker sent a {{chartered}} Greyhound bus {{to transport}} Presley {{and his entourage}} from Memphis, Tennessee to Nashville. The session personnel consisted of guitarist Scotty Moore, drummer D.J. Fontana, pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Hank Garland, bassist Bobby Moore, percussionist Buddy Harman and the backing group The Jordanaires. Presley's original bassist Bill Black declined to join the sessions as he was enjoying success with the Bill Black Combo. To prevent possible disruption by fans, the musicians were initially <b>told</b> <b>they</b> were going to play on a Jim Reeves session. RCA executives Sholes and Bill Bullock were joined in the control booth by Parker, his assistant Tom Diskin, A head Chet Atkins, engineer Bill Porter and Hill and Range's Bienstock.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{returns to}} Huntington, {{along the way}} besting outlaws such as Adam Bell and Will Scarlet at a contest of archery. He {{encounters}} his father and several other prominent noblemen, and is <b>told</b> <b>they</b> wish for him to marry Joanna to mislead Prince John about their intentions to thwart his grabs for power. Robert refuses. Meanwhile, Marian barely avoids being forced to marry DeLacey, and only escapes {{with the help of}} the kind Friar Tuck and the Sheriff's seneschal Guy de Gisbourne, who is infatuated with her. She flees to Huntington Castle; the Earl is displeased with his son's disobedience and their liaison, causing Marian and Robert to travel to the small village of Locksley, his namesake and holding.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles arrived {{very early}} in the morning of 17 August 1960, but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so infamous. Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a {{neighbouring}} club found someone to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves. The group played at the club on the same night, but were <b>told</b> <b>they</b> could sleep in a small cinema's storeroom, which was cold and in very poor condition, the Bambi Kino (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse).|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} multiplayer-only game, where players could meet and solve new puzzles that would be added monthly. At the request of publisher Ubisoft, Cyan eventually developed a single-player portion as well. Cyan announced players would be {{invited to participate in}} a multiplayer beta test, which drew 10,000 to 40,000 participants. Uru was released in November 2003, while the multiplayer portion was delayed. Small groups of players were allowed to come online to test the multiplayer part of the game, and journalists were <b>told</b> <b>they</b> would be invited to play soon after, but Uru Live was canceled before being released. Cyan stated that there were not enough projected subscribers to support the service.|$|E
5|$|After {{discussions with}} Whiting during the Friday night drivers' briefing, {{the height of}} the apex at turn sixteen was {{increased}} and the wall around that area was moved back. A new apex kerb at turn eighteen was built to stop dirt and stones from accumulating on the circuit, and the track was extensively cleaned. Drivers were <b>told</b> <b>they</b> could drive into the pit lane from the racing line without incurring a penalty. Bridgestone had reported heavy tyre graining during the Friday practice sessions; their Motorsport Tyre Development director Hirohide Hamashima said drivers would face a challenge of looking after their tyres if track conditions had not changed before the race. Kubica was quickest in the final practice session; his late lap of 1:37.354 was 0.048 seconds quicker than Hamilton's in second. Alonso was third-quickest and Webber was fourth. Rosberg, who was fifth, slowed at turn fifteen during the session's closing stages; he narrowly avoided a collision with Alonso. The incident was subject to a stewards' investigation; the stewards decided not to penalise Rosberg. Massa, Button, Hülkenberg, Schumacher and Sutil completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Vettel was sixteenth; the result of running onto the grass.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, the Ojibwe {{attracted}} attention, gaining {{publicity and}} {{money for their}} cause. In Washington, however, they were turned away by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and <b>told</b> <b>they</b> should never have come in the first place. Luckily, they drew {{the attention of the}} Whig Congressman Briggs from New York, who was scheduled a meeting with President Millard Fillmore the next day. He invited the Ojibwa to come with him to see the president. At the meeting, Buffalo rose first. He performed the pipe ceremony with a pipe made especially for the occasion. He had the younger chief Oshaga speak {{for more than an hour}} about the broken treaty promises and the disastrous attempt at removal. Fillmore agreed to consider the issues. The next day, he announced that the removal order would be canceled, the payment of annuities would be returned to La Pointe, and another treaty would set up permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin.|$|E
6000|$|These men {{asked the}} Pilgrims whence they came; and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> them. <b>They</b> also asked {{them where they}} had lodged, what {{difficulties}} and dangers, what comforts and pleasures they had met in the way; and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> them. Then said the men that met them, You have but two difficulties more to meet with, and then {{you are in the}} city.[312] ...|$|R
60|$|I met {{the ladies}} {{afterwards}} in Lausanne. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> me <b>they</b> had been condemned {{to a fine}} of forty francs apiece. They also {{explained to me that}} they had not the slightest intention of paying it.|$|R
5000|$|St. Francis {{also raised}} his pet lamb, Martinello, {{from the dead}} after it had been eaten by workmen. [...] "Being in need of food, the workmen caught and {{slaughtered}} Francis’ pet lamb, Martinello, roasting it in their lime kiln. They were eating when the Saint approached them, looking for his lamb. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> him <b>they</b> had eaten it, having no other food. He asked {{what they had done}} with the fleece and the bones. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> him <b>they</b> had thrown them into the furnace. Francis walked over to the furnace, looked into the fire and called ‘Martinello, come out!’ The lamb jumped out, completely untouched, bleating happily on seeing his master." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming twentieth anniversary of his reign on November 20, 303, Diocletian declared a general amnesty in a third edict. Any imprisoned clergyman could now be freed, {{so long as he}} agreed to make a sacrifice to the gods. Diocletian may have been searching for some good publicity with this legislation. He may also have sought to fracture the Christian community by publicizing the fact that its clergy had apostatized. The demand to sacrifice was unacceptable to many of the imprisoned, but wardens often managed to obtain at least nominal compliance. Some of the clergy sacrificed willingly; others did so on pain of torture. Wardens were eager to be rid of the clergy in their midst. Eusebius, in his Martyrs of Palestine, records the case of a clergy who, after being brought to an altar, had his hands seized and made to complete a sacrificial offering. The clergyman was told that his act of sacrifice had been recognized and was summarily dismissed. Others were <b>told</b> <b>they</b> had sacrificed even when they had done nothing.|$|E
5|$|In early August as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the Eighth United States Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee, {{the head}} of its G-3 Operations Miscellaneous Division, to seek volunteers for a new {{experimental}} Army Ranger unit. McGee was given only seven weeks to organize and train the unit before it was sent into combat, as commanders felt the need for Rangers was dire, and that existing soldiers could be trained as Rangers {{in a relatively short}} period of time. Because of this limitation, volunteers were solicited only from existing Eighth Army combat units in Korea, though subsequent Ranger companies were able to recruit Ranger veterans from World War II. From the Eighth Army replacement pool, McGee recruited Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett, newly commissioned from West Point and with no combat experience, to serve as the company commander. Second Lieutenants Charles Bunn and Barnard Cummings, Jr., became Puckett's two platoon leaders. Several hundred enlisted men volunteered from the Eighth Army, though few had combat experience. Through a quick and informal selection process, Puckett picked the men to fill out the company based on weapons qualifications, athleticism, and duty performance. There was no time to administer physical fitness tests for the applicants, and unmarried men younger than 26 were preferred. Recruits were <b>told</b> <b>they</b> would receive no hazard pay.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his father}} and {{brothers}} before him, Ted attended Harvard College. In his spring semester, {{he was assigned to}} the athlete-oriented Winthrop House, where his brothers had also lived. He was an offensive and defensive end on the freshman football team, with his play being characterized by his large size and fearless style. In his first semester, Kennedy and his classmates arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a science class. At the end of his second semester in May 1951, Kennedy was anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year, and he had a classmate take his place at a Spanish language examination. The ruse was immediately discovered and both students were expelled for cheating. In a standard Harvard treatment for serious disciplinary cases, they were <b>told</b> <b>they</b> could apply for readmission within a year or two if they demonstrated good behavior during that time.|$|E
