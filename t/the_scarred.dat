5|$|Scully is told by <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> {{man that}} William is part alien {{and that she}} {{is being used to}} raise the child. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses to believe it. While the three are talking, <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> man quietly slips into William's room with a syringe. Though William's crying alerts the agents, <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> man manages to sneak out of the room before they reach William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the {{hospital}} and Doggett discovers the man's syringe. The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> man about his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half-brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that the syringe contained magnetite meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but now they have lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group.|$|E
5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway.|$|E

500|$|Fortune {{completed}} seven novels {{during her}} lifetime. Four were occult and fantasy themed: The Demon Lover, The Winged Bull, The Goat-Foot God, and The Sea Priestess. The literary scholar Susan Johnson Graf categorises these alongside {{the work of}} H. Rider Haggard, Algernon Blackwood, Charles Williams, and Arthur Machen. The other three were romantic thrillers published under the pseudonym of [...] "V. M. Steele": <b>The</b> <b>Scarred</b> Wrists, Hunters of Humans, and Beloved of Ishmael. Writing thrillers was one of few activities Fortune took part in unconnected to her magical work, and was something she did not publicise. Knight believed these three novels testified {{to the idea that}} [...] "she must really have loved writing for writing's sake". An eighth novel, Moon Magic, was left unfinished but completed by her protégé and published posthumously.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{antagonist}} of {{the novel}} is Kobus Breed, a mercenary with a disfigured face and a permanently weeping eye who had previously served with the Rhodesian Light Infantry in Matabeleland; Olen Steinhauer, writing in The New York Times thinks <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> villain to be [...] "an obligatory nod toward the requirements of the Bond formula". Some writers were unimpressed with Breed; Robert Crampton of The Sunday Times thought that the character [...] "feels more like a henchman than a proper power-crazed villain. He has menace, but no ambition. You wait for the evil genius to turn up—but he never does", while David Sexton in the London Evening Standard wrote that the character [...] "lacks charisma", and David Connett in the Sunday Express considered him [...] "a colourless character in comparison with factual and fictional counterparts". The journalist Geoffrey Wansell in the Daily Mail disagreed, writing that Breed, along with a second villain, millionaire Hulbert Linck, were as strong as some of Fleming's villains; Steinhauer also thought that the novel's villains were realistic, [...] "motivated by simple greed yet clever enough to be legitimately dangerous". There are two main female characters in Solo— horror film actress Bryce Fitzjohn and the local MI6 contact Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant; like many of Fleming's female characters, both are [...] "determined females who are not to be patronised by Bond".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{epilogue}} to Burnt Offerings, Anita {{states that}} Asher intended to explore whether modern cosmetic surgery could help his scars. [...] However, when {{this issue is}} mentioned in Cerulean Sins it only refers to Asher's ability in bed, which had been limited until a surgeon had removed the restricting scarred foreskin. [...] No other cosmetic surgery or options is talked about and Anita says that touching the scars is like touching {{any other part of}} Asher. [...] During a few different intimate times, she's made a point to kiss or caress <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> side first, then the non-touched side.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scarring</b> {{is highly}} compartmentalized. The pericytes form {{the core of}} <b>the</b> <b>scar,</b> while ependymal cells form a second layer around the core, {{followed}} by another layer of astrocytes that originated through self-duplication.|$|R

Through automatic methods, <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> is extracted from the image data and quantifies the size, location and transmurality. The transmurality shows a local measurement between the heart wall und the width of <b>the</b> <b>scar.</b> <b>The</b> developed methods help the cardiologist to analyse the measurement, the reason and the degree of the heart failure in a short time period. He can further control the results by several visual presentations. The deformation of <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> tissue over <b>the</b> heart cycle is implemented in another scientific work. A visual improvement of the deformation result which extracts <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> out of <b>the</b> data is aspired. The avital tissue is shown in a more comfortable way by eliminating the unnecessary image information and therefore improves the visual analysis of the pumping heart. Both methods show a detailed analysis of <b>the</b> <b>scar</b> tissue. This supports the clinic practical throughout the manual analysis...|$|R
50|$|After {{an injury}} in the central nervous system, {{scarring}} occurs to preserve the integrity of surrounding cells. Usually, astrocytes are associated with <b>the</b> <b>scarring</b> and are called glial scars. However, there is a stromal or nonglial component of <b>the</b> <b>scarring,</b> and lineage-tracking studies of pericytes following stroke revealed that they form {{the main component of}} <b>the</b> glial <b>scar.</b> Following traumatic brain injury, pericytes migrate out from the vasculature to the site of injury, differentiate into myofibroblasts and deposit extracellular matrix that forms the fibrotic component of <b>the</b> <b>scar.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Subcision is {{a process}} used to treat deep rolling scars left behind by acne or other skin diseases. It {{is also used to}} lessen the {{appearance}} of severe glabella lines, though its effectiveness in this application is debatable. Essentially the process involves separating the skin tissue in the affected area from the deeper scar tissue. This allows the blood to pool under the affected area, eventually causing the deep rolling scar to level off {{with the rest of the}} skin area. Once the skin has leveled, treatments such as laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion or chemical peels can be used to smooth out <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> tissue.|$|E

2500|$|Capone {{initially}} {{became involved}} with small-time gangs that included the Junior Forty Thieves and the Bowery Boys. He then joined the Brooklyn Rippers, and then the powerful Five Points Gang based in Lower Manhattan. During this time, he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer Frankie Yale, a bartender in a Coney Island dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. Capone inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door at a Brooklyn night club and was slashed by her brother Frank Gallucio. The wounds led to the nickname [...] "Scarface" [...] which Capone loathed. Yale insisted that Capone apologize to Gallucio, and Capone later hired him as his bodyguard. When he was photographed, he hid <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> {{left side of his}} face, saying that the injuries were war wounds.

2500|$|More than 400 {{million years}} ago, in the Devonian Period, the plate {{tectonics}} {{movement of the}} Earth's crust allowed molten material to bubble up from the Earth's interior. [...] This formed the rocks we see today and {{are part of the}} Great Nova Scotia batholith. [...] The unique landscape of Peggy's Cove and surrounding areas was subsequently carved [...] by the migration of glaciers and the ocean tides. [...] About 20,000 years ago, an ice ridge moved south from Canada's Arctic region covering much of North America. [...] Along with {{the ebb and flow of}} the glaciers, the ice ridge eventually melted and shifted and in the process scooped away and scoured large sections of rock, vegetation, and topsoil. As melted land glaciers flowed back to the oceans the changing tidal flows and rising sea levels filled <b>the</b> <b>scarred</b> areas with water, forming coves and inlets. [...] Large boulders composed of 415-million-year-old Devonian granite, called glacial erratics, were lifted by the ice and carried for long distances before being deposited upon the landscape as the ice receded, leaving rugged barrens.
