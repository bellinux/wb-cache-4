Scientists from the Namibian Dolphin Project {{confirmed}} the whale's identity and thus provides the only sighting {{of this species}} in the Southern Hemisphere.

25|$|Later, {{he played}} three {{first-class}} matches for Lancashire, a County Championship match against Gloucestershire, a match against Australia in 1921, and a match against Cambridge University in 1922. Cricket Archive records him as having played for Denbighshire in Minor Counties cricket in the 1930s, though some {{research suggests that}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> RA Lloyd, as the RA Lloyd who played for Denbighshire apparently looked nothing like a rugby player and did not sound Irish.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the {{practice}} of autoerotic asphyxiation has been documented since the early 17th century. It was first used {{as a treatment for}} erectile dysfunction. The idea for this most likely came from subjects who were executed by hanging. Observers at public hangings noted that male victims developed an erection, sometimes remaining after death (a death erection), and occasionally ejaculated when being hanged. However, post-mortem ejaculation occurs in hanging victims after death because of disseminated muscle relaxation; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mechanism from that sought by autoerotic asphyxiation practitioners.|$|E
25|$|Note that on 1 May 1896 Nasser-al-Din Shah {{was indeed}} assassinated and some did blame a Babí but most {{information}} {{points to an}} anarchist who had been given privileged access to {{the person of the}} Shah because of the Shah’s sympathies for his suffering. Most Baha’is have some information of an acknowledged assassination plot by some Babis in 1852 for which Bahá’u’lláh was encarcerated in the Siyah-Chal and eventually found innocent albeit much property had been confiscated or lost to mobs as a result of simply being accused. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> incident.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroos have single-chambered stomachs quite {{unlike those}} of cattle and sheep. They {{sometimes}} regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different,</b> and more strenuous, activity {{than it is}} in ruminants, and does not take place as frequently. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the end of}} the story, {{the group}} that set out to bury Kazangap has nearly reached the Ana-Beiit cemetery. However, they are {{hindered}} in their journey by a barbed wire fence erected {{in the middle of their}} route. Resolved to go around it, they travel along it toward another road only to reach a check-point manned by a young soldier. To their dismay, they are told that access beyond the fence is prohibited, but the soldier calls his superior to see if an exception can be made. It is then that Yedigei learns that the superior is named Tansykbaev but discovers that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> man from the one previously known. However, the new Tansykbaev is also encrusted in a patina of hierarchical obedience and interpersonal tyranny; unmoved by the procession's request, he denies them entry and also informs them that the Ana-Beiit cemetery is to be leveled in the future.|$|E
25|$|The nares of some {{birds are}} covered by an {{operculum}} (plural opercula), a membraneous, horny or cartilaginous flap. In diving birds, the operculum keeps {{water out of the}} nasal cavity; when the birds dive, the impact force of the water closes the operculum. Some species which feed on flowers have opercula to help to keep pollen from clogging their nasal passages, while the opercula of the two species of Attagis seedsnipe help to keep dust out. The nares of nestling tawny frogmouths are covered with large dome-shaped opercula, which help to reduce the rapid evaporation of water vapor, and may also help to increase condensation within the nostrils themselves—both critical functions, since the nestlings get fluids only from the food their parents bring them. These opercula shrink as the birds age, disappearing completely by the time they reach adulthood. In pigeons, the operculum has evolved into a soft swollen mass that sits {{at the base of the}} bill, above the nares; though it is sometimes referred to as the cere, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> structure. Tapaculos are the only birds able to move their opercula.|$|E

Said Lundin, [...] "Having been accustomed to handling the big Greco-Roman wrestlers with ease, the Jap thought he could do likewise with me, but in the first encounter I got the better of him, after which my confidence returned. I had no trouble then in winning the match. It was a surprise to the crowd and a set-back for Koma. He had been the hero all week, but {{as soon as he was}} beaten the fans, true to form, called him a bum." ...|$|E

500|$|Murphy {{has said}} that he has never seen a High School Musical film, to which Glee has been compared, and that his {{interest}} lay in creating a [...] "postmodern musical", rather than [...] "doing a show where people burst into song", drawing more heavily on the format of Chicago. Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism. [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why Idol worked. It's pure escapism," [...] he said. Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads, and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Milan players {{who had played}} in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous. Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result: [...] "What {{happened}} then was strange, just six minutes when we played not so good and we paid for that." [...] Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his teammates sentiments: [...] "The defeat two years ago will stay me for a lifetime, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story. It's our turn to celebrate now." [...] Striker Filippo Inzaghi, who missed the final in 2005, was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan: [...] "I've scored quite {{a few times in}} Europe, but scoring in the Champions League final is something special." [...] Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success, adding that [...] "the fortune we lacked in Istanbul we had with us tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan created Glee. Murphy drew {{inspiration}} from his own childhood, which saw him play the lead role {{in all of his}} high school's musicals. Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools' glee clubs. Brennan originally wrote a script for a Glee movie, but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series. Fox picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script, which Murphy attributes in part {{to the success of the}} network's American Idol, commenting: [...] "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein". Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism, explaining: [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why 'Idol' worked. It's pure escapism." [...] With regards to Glee audience, Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads. Glee is set in Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself originates from Indiana, and recalls childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park. Although set in Lima, the show is actually filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.|$|E
