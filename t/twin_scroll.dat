40|$|Positive {{displacement}} machines (e. g. <b>scroll,</b> <b>twin</b> screw, reciprocating, etc.) {{are proven}} to be suitable as expanders for organic Rankine cycle (ORC) applications, especially in the medium to low power range. However, {{in order to increase}} their performance, detailed simulation models are required to optimize the design and reduce the internal losses. In recent years, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied for the design and analysis of positive displacement machines (both compressors and expanders) with numerous challenges due to the dynamics of the expansion (or compression) process and deforming working chambers. The majority of the studies reported in literature focused on <b>scroll,</b> <b>twin</b> screw and reciprocating machines. Furthermore, the limitation of such methodologies to be applied directly to complex multi-rotor machines has been highlighted in literature. In this paper, a single screw expander (SSE) is used as benchmark to evaluate the applicability of different grid generation methodologies (dynamic remeshing and Chimera strategy overlapping grid), in terms of computational resources required, accuracy of the results and limitations. Although, the low-order models have been applied to single screw machines, there is still a lack of CFD analyses due to the particular complexity of the machine geometry and of its working principle. The calculations have been performed with air to reduce the complexity of the problem. to the main results are two folds: (i) the assessment of a numerical strategy with respect to the most critical parameters of a dynamic mesh-based simulation and (ii) the comparison of the pressure field and internal flow features obtained by using different numerical approaches...|$|R

5000|$|The Lancer {{platform}} {{was completely}} changed in 1996, {{and along with}} it, the Evolution, which had become extremely popular throughout the world. The engine and transaxle was rotated 180° to better balance the weight and eliminate torque steer. There were two versions available, The RS and GSR. The RS version was produced as a competition car with a limited-slip front differential and a friction type LSD at the rear. It also came with GLX seats and a choice of either 16" [...] or 17" [...] OZ light weight racing wheels. The RS also had wind up windows, optional air conditioning in some models, and a few extra brace bars to strengthen the chassis, one behind the front grill and the other across the boot floor. The GSR and the RS shared a new <b>twin</b> <b>scroll</b> turbocharger which helped to improve response and increase power to [...] at 6,500 rpm and [...] torque at 4,000 rpm. Mitsubishi's new Active Yaw Control appeared as a factory option on the GSR model, which used steering, throttle input sensors and g sensors to computer-hydraulically control torque split individually to the rear wheels {{and as a result}} the 10000 Evolution IVs produced all sold quickly. The Evolution IV can be distinguished by its two large fog lights in the front bumper (option on RS version), and the newly designed tail lights on the rear, which became a standard design to Evolution V, which would become yet another trademark of the Evolution series. This new generation was slightly heavier than previous Evos—the GSR in particular due to the added technology systems—but to counter this the car produced even more power—the weight of the RS being 1260 kg and the GSR being 1345 kg. Much of the technical improvements for this generation were also used in the second generation Mitsubishi RVR sold only in Japan.|$|E
50|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with {{rack and pinion steering}} replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 G's or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.The Turbo 2 uses a turbo charger with a <b>twin</b> <b>scroll</b> design.

40|$|This thesis report {{elucidates}} {{the experimental}} and analytical methods {{of determining the}} axial thrust loads of a <b>twin</b> <b>scroll</b> turbocharger mounted on a 6 -cylinder diesel engine, tested at Scania CV AB, Sodertalje. Literature survey revealed several methods to experimentally determine the thrust loads but the concept of using strain gauges was nally selected. The key objectives of this thesis are to determine an experimental method to measure axial thrust loads, develop an analytical model to predict axial loads and to perform a root cause analysis. It was noted that axial load peaks are of immense interest here than the average values of the axial loads. The method adopted to measure axial loads consists of a weakened bearing that was capable of withstanding an estimated axial load {{and at the same}} time undergo strains that could be sensed by strain gauges. The test operating points consisted of a series of engine speeds and loads. Root cause analysis results suggested that there was a minimal drift of 0. 25 N force per 10 degree rise in temperature on the bearings. Also, the main reason for the drift in strain gauge measurements was the plastic deformation of the axial bearing that experienced higher axial loads due to transient testing. A 1 D model based on the Control Volume approach including both the pressure and impulse contributions predicting the thrust loads was modelled. The factored axial force measurements during most of the operating conditions were negative (forces acting from the turbine towards the compressor) with the highest value recorded as - 90 N at 1400 rpm and 80 % engine load. The highest factored axial force (negative) predicted by the model during the same operating point was - 100 N. The di erence between the predicted and measured max load varied between 10 % to 15 % among all the operating conditions considered for correlation. It could be concluded that the experimental method established could be used to measure axial loads. Further, future work in terms of non-invasive measurements, CFD methods and usage of fast pressure sensors on compressor side to predict transient conditions would improve the current method.
