5|$|After the Ashton Canal {{closed in}} the 1960s, {{it was decided to}} turn the Portland Basin {{warehouse}} into a museum. In 1985, {{the first part of the}} Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} switch of coaches, Thorpe {{indicated}} that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. During this period, his times in the 400m and 200m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, particularly during the build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe said that his results justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young swimmer under Frost.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{property}} in the village is older than the early 17th century, its layout reflects its development in medieval <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> planned village. Eight toft compartments are discernible {{to the west of}} Main Street, and the outline of the four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls. The fields were largely arable, providing the village with most of its food requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
5|$|Creatively, {{the focus}} of Watchmen is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout {{throughout}} the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, {{which one of the}} characters reads. Structured, at <b>times,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence and repeated imagery.|$|E

Trial by Jury was eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E

5|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that pre-Columbian Mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen, but more likely they used substances secreted by the Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius).

Typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked. Illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an urban myth.|$|E
