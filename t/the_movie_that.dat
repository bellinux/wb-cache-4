She stated, [...] "I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of the things in <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> are horrifying are funny to me." [...] Feeling that [...] "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" [...] due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, [...] "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience.

500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after I finished <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> I felt pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E

500|$|The heroine {{role of a}} [...] "devoted Iyengar Brahmin girl" [...] was {{originally}} offered to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who {{was too busy to}} accommodate production dates.

[...] She considered being a part of a Shankar film, especially during the early stages of her career, as a [...] "god's gift" [...] and a [...] "once-in-a-lifetime experience".

500|$|It was screenwriter Joss Whedon's idea to {{incorporate}} Barbie {{as a character}} who would rescue Woody and Buzz in the film's final act. The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy. Producer Ralph Guggenheim claimed that Mattel did not allow {{the use of the}} toy as [...] "They [...] philosophically felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto the doll. If you give the doll a voice and animate it, you're creating a persona for it that might not be every little girl's dream and desire." [...] Hasbro likewise refused to license [...] (mainly because Sid was going to blow one up), but they did license Mr. Potato Head.

500|$|Blaxploitation was {{the first}} {{exploitation}} genre in which the major studios were central. Indeed, the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, {{is seen as the}} first significant film of the type. But <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent: Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (1971) is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form: wildly experimental, borderline pornographic, and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby. Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries, then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian Mondo Cane [...] "shockumentaries" [...] and the Swedish skin flick Fanny Hill, as well as for its one in-house production, The Man from O.R.G.Y. (1970). These sorts of films played in the [...] "grindhouses" [...] of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema. The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.|$|E
