25|$|Changes in the imidoylthiourea {{complexes}} led to {{the synthesis}} of {{a new class of}} compounds, diaryltriazine (DATA). In these compounds, the thiourea part of the ITU compounds was replaced by a <b>triazine</b> ring. The DATA compounds were more potent than the ITU compounds against common NNRTI resistant mutant strains. R106168, a prototype DATA compound, was rather easy to synthesize. Multiple substitutions were made at different positions on all of the three rings and on the linkers connecting the rings. In the pocket, most of the DATA derivatives conformed a horseshoe conformation. The two wings in R106168 (2,6-dichlorobenzyl and 4-cyanoanilino) occupied positions in the pocket {{similar to that of the}} two wings of the derivatives of ITU. The central part of the DATA compounds, in which the <b>triazine</b> ring replaced the thiourea group of ITU derivatives, is positioned between the side chains of L100 and V179. This removed a number of torstional degrees of freedom in the central part while keeping the flexibility between the <b>triazine</b> ring and the wings.|$|E

2500|$|Chemical {{substitution}} or modification in the three-aromatic-ring {{backbone of}} the DATA compounds had substantial effect on the activity. R120393, a DATA analog, was designed with a chloroindole part in wing I to expand interactions with the side chain of conserved W229 of the polymerase primer grip loop. R120393 had similar effect as R106168 against most of the NNRTI-resistant mutants. [...] The cloroindole part interacted with the hydrophobic core of the pocket and influenced the binding mode of the R120393 so it went deeper into the pocket compared to the wing I position of other DATA analogs. Crystal structures showed that the DATA compounds could bind the NNIBP in different conformations. The capability to bind in multible modes made the NNRTIs stronger against drug-resistance mutations. Variability between the inhibitors could be seen when the chemical composition, size of wing I and the two linker groups connecting the rings were altered. The potency of the NNRTIs changed when the <b>triazine</b> nitrogen atoms were substituted with carbons.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers used multi-disciplinary {{approach}} to design NNRTIs with better resistance profile {{and an increased}} genetic barrier {{to the development of}} resistance. [...] A new class of compounds, diarylpyrimide (DAPY), were discovered with the replacement of the central <b>triazine</b> ring from the DATA compounds, with a pyrimidine. This new class was more effective against drug resistant HIV-1 strains than the corresponding DATA analogs. The replacement enabled substitutions to the CH-group at the 5-position of the central aromatic ring. One of the first DAPY compounds, dapivirine (with R1= 2,4,6-trimethylanilino, R2 = R3 = H and Y = NH) was found to be effective against drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. Systematic chemical substitutions were made at the R1, R2, R3 and Y positions to find new DAPY derivatives. This led to the discovery of etravirine which has a bromine substitution at the 5-position (R3) of the pyrimidine ring (with R1 = 2,6-dimethyl-4-cyanoanilino, R2 = NH2 and Y = O) (figure 5). Etravirine was discovered by researchers at the Jansen Research Foundation and Tibotec and approved in 2008 by the FDA. It is used in treatment-expirenced adult patients with HIV infection that is multidrug resistant in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.|$|E

A selective extraction method based on the combination of microporous membrane liquid-liquid extraction (MMLLE) and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) was developed and applied to the extraction of 17 β-estradiol and selected <b>triazines</b> herbicides in complex aqueous samples. These pollutants were extracted from aqueous complex samples through the hydrophobic porous membrane that was impregnated with toluene, which also formed part of the acceptor phase.

40|$|Direct, {{selective}} solid-phase {{extraction of}} <b>triazines</b> from aqueous samples is presented using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) made with terbutylazine as template molecule. After optimization {{of the steps}} of the procedure, 14 <b>triazines</b> including degradation products were studied and satisfactory extraction recoveries were obtained except for thiotriazines. By comparing results obtained with the terbutylazine MIP and a similar non-imprinted polymer, it was determined that retention was achieved via specific interactions except for hydroxyterbutylazine. Selectivity of the extraction procedure was also verified by applying the MIP for the extraction of phenylureas that were not retained on it. The effects of the charge distribution and of molecular volume of the <b>triazines</b> (obtained by molecular modeling) on the selectivity of interactions between the analytes and the MIP were studied. However, when the optimized procedure was applied to real samples, low extraction recoveries were obtained due to strong matrix effects: ion-exchange occurs between the carboxylate groups of the MIP and the ionic species of the sample, that prevents subsequent specific interactions. By introducing an acid wash step, the procedure was successfully applied for the class-selective extraction of <b>triazines</b> from industrial effluent and surface water samples.

The measured D(OW) values were independent of the chemical concentration and sample pH (pH 3 - 10) and negligibly affected by the sample salinity (0 - 500 mM), suggesting that environmentally relevant pH and salinity have no significant effects on the availability of <b>triazines.</b> Although a slight (<= 31 %) increase of C free was observed, one-way analysis of variance indicated the C free of <b>triazines</b> were not significantly affected by the presence of Aldrich humic acid, Acros humic acid, and bovine albumin V (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], 0 - 100 mg/L).
