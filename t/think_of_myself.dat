I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as being Jewish and Irish, {{despite the fact that}} I'm English." [...] He has stated: [...] "We were Christmas tree Jews", and that he is [...] "very proud of being Jewish".|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Alvarez said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{as having}} had two {{separate}} careers, one {{in science and}} one in aviation. I've found the two almost equally rewarding." [...] An important contributor to this was his enjoyment of flying. He learned to fly in 1933, later earning instrument and multi-engine ratings. Over the next 50 years he accumulated over 1000 hours of flight time, most of it as pilot in command. He said, [...] "I found few activities as satisfying as being pilot in command with responsibility for my passengers' lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Wintour herself, {{when asked}} about it, dismisses the notion that she has all the power {{attributed}} to her. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a powerful person," [...] she told Forbes in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world's hundred most powerful women. [...] "You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But {{it is a wonderful}} opportunity {{to be able to help}} others, and for that I'm extremely grateful." ...|$|E

500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E
500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, I was thinking about how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which is hard for me since I grew up as a tomboy and don't really <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> that way. But I think this album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring... When I wrote the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I felt much freer expressing myself." ...|$|E

[...] "I <b>think</b> not <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and perhaps I often spare that counsel which is but little heeded. But I {{have a duty}} to my men--to Connecticut.

2500|$|His {{influences}} include Brian Wilson and Phil Spector. Buckingham {{has also}} worked extensively {{as a producer}} both for Fleetwood Mac and for his solo work.“I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a stylist, {{and the process of}} writing a song is part and parcel with putting it together in the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawn {{has studied}} meditation. In a 2012 interview, she stated, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a Buddhist. I was born Jewish, and I {{consider}} that my religion." [...] She also stated, [...] "It's not {{the idea of}} a particular religion that's important; it's the development of a spiritual life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richards has {{frequently}} {{stated that he}} feels less like a creator than a conduit when writing songs: [...] "I don't have that god aspect about it. I prefer to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as an antenna. There's only one song, and Adam and Eve wrote it; the rest is a variation on a theme." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richard Berengarten's {{perspectives}} {{as a poet}} combine British, French, Mediterranean, Jewish, Slavic, American and Oriental influences. On his {{own work}} Berengarten says: [...] "I would rather <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a European poet who writes in English than as an 'English' poet."There is no civilisation without poetry. A poet’s responsibilities are social as well as subjective, communal as well as individual. Poetry, {{if it is not}} to caricature or betray itself, needs to involve critical commitment to both the past and future history of ‘all humanity’, and all nature. Berengarten is a popular reader of his own poetry, and a dynamic teacher.|$|E
2500|$|According to Greenwood, {{he began}} playing bass out of necessity, {{teaching}} himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. He said: [...] "We {{were people who}} picked up their respective instruments {{because we wanted to}} play music together, rather than just because we wanted to play that particular instrument. So {{it was more of a}} collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a bass player anyway. I’m just in a band with other people." [...] Among his musical influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield.|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{wrote her}} {{consumer}} books over a 40-year career, revising {{some in the}} 1970s. She saw herself as an [...] "interpreter," [...] not merely a researcher. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a newspaper reporter, who goes out to libraries and gathers information from hundreds of journals, which most people can't understand, and I write it {{so that people can}} understand." [...] She reviews scientific literature in the biochemical libraries at U.C.L.A., for instance. Her references for Let's Get Well totaled almost 2,500, many from cases during her nutrition practice, and she was upset when the publisher of Let's Have Healthy Children eliminated the 2,000 references from the 1972 revision, says author Daniel Yergin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} see him," [...] he said once again; [...] "if I did, I should not scruple {{to hit him}} on the head with my stick; but I should <b>think</b> ill <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> to go after him with such an object." ...|$|R
60|$|Willems said nothing. He {{stood before}} her {{looking down on}} the ground and repeating to himself: I must get that {{revolver}} away from her, at once, at once. I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> trusting <b>myself</b> with those men without firearms. I must have it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> <b>MYSELF</b> than that," [...] said Jeff, with {{a certain}} wild, half-hysterical laugh, [...] "and that is why I want to go. Don't be alarmed, Bill," [...] he added; [...] "I have {{strength}} enough to save myself, and I shall! But it isn't worth the struggle HERE." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{his return}} to Lancashire from Leicestershire, manager Mike Watkinson was {{impressed}} by Smith's performances with the bat and ball. Smith's contract with the club was renewed, along with nine other young players who were expected to {{form the basis of}} Lancashire's squad in the future. Smith stated his intent to cement his place in the Lancashire side as an all-rounder, saying that [...] "My batting has come on in leaps and I would like to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as more of an allrounder. I batted in the top six at Leicestershire in the limited-over games and at seven in the four-dayers, and I got 50-plus {{a couple of times and}} had a run average of about 40. After the responsibility there I know I can do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his having}} {{personally}} described {{his work as}} [...] "Gonzo", it fell to later observers to articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting himself as {{a participant in the}} events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in Playboy addressed the issue himself, saying [...] "Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a reporter." [...] Tom Wolfe would later describe Thompson's style as [...] "...part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric." [...] Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, [...] "While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amongst {{the works}} of {{spin-off}} prose fiction, in the Fourth Doctor comic [...] "The Time Witch", after the Doctor and Sharon cross through the split in time which ages them four years, the Doctor says [...] "I shall still <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as 743 ... or was it 730, I never can remember...". [...] The Sixth Doctor celebrated his 991st birthday in the short story [...] "Brief Encounter: A Wee Deoch an..?", written by Colin Baker, in Doctor Who Magazine Winter Special 1991: UNIT Exposed. [...] The Seventh Doctor celebrated his 1,000th birthday in Set Piece by Kate Orman, and the Eighth Doctor declared his age to be 1,012 in Vampire Science by Orman and Jonathan Blum. The Eighth Doctor spent nearly a century on Earth during a story arc spread over several novels, and around 100 years asleep in The Sleep of Reason by Martin Day. In the Big Finish Productions audio play Orbis, the Eighth Doctor {{says that he has}} spent 600 years living on the planet Orbis since the previous play. He states that he lost count of his true age long ago, and rounds it down, taking into account the varying lengths of a [...] "year" [...] in different locations.|$|E
