Editor Bill Allen asked that {{all members of the}} project keep the fossil secret, so that the magazine would have a scoop on the story.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Database, the National Register of Electors {{is used to}} create preliminary voters lists for each electoral district in Canada for each election, byelection, and referendum. Each candidate from each electoral district is given a voters list for that district, which is {{a subset of the}} data in the National Register of Electors whose addresses are within the boundaries of the district as defined in <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Database. That data may only be used for election purposes; any other use of that data subjects the user to penalties including fines, imprisonment, or both. The voter lists are updated by returning officers based on information received during an election campaign, ultimately resulting in final voters lists being distributed by election day.|$|E

5|$|Hewett {{suspended}} {{his research}} during Judd's 1924–27 excavation of Pueblo Bonito, financed by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Society, but returned to Chetro Ketl in 1929 with graduate students from his newly founded Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of New Mexico. He studied the canyon until 1935, and several Chaco scholars worked for or with him during this period, including Gordon Vivian (father of R. Gwinn Vivian), Edwin Ferdon, Paul Reiter, and Florence M. Hawley. Hewett's {{methods have been}} widely criticized, and his work judged to have been substandard, particularly {{in comparison to the}} work done by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Project. He spent several years excavating Chetro Ketl, but never published a detailed account of his research there. Despite this, much is known about his studies from the theses and dissertations written by students who worked with him.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Sea Grant Program {{organized}} a three-day dive {{to survey the}} Fitzgerald in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses {{in order to produce}} 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV Grayling as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of Fitzgeralds sinking.|$|E

In this way, small details about Andean costume and material culture were accurately copied. Part of the ceremonial costume worn by the Incan priest was based upon a colour painting of Mexican Aztecs produced by Else Bostelmann for <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Society which Hergé had a copy of in his files. He ensured that his depiction of the Peruvian trains was accurate by basing them upon examples found in a two-volume picture encyclopedia of railways published by Librarie Hachette in 1927.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, further {{research}} on the fossils was continued by two American scientists sponsored by the American Institute of Indian Studies, New Delhi and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Society, U.S.A. The Americans, Paul Sereno and Jeff Wilson, started {{the reconstruction of the}} collection of dinosaur bones gathered in 1983 and 1984. The team of scientists, after a detailed study of the maps prepared earlier by Srivastava, were able to reconstruct the partial skull, left and right hip bones, and a sacrum. They interpreted the part of a skull and a horn as resembling those of dinosaurs found in Madagascar. Fossils of Rajasaurus were also found near Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. In all, the collected fossils include a partial skull, limb bones, hip bones, and vertebrae.|$|E
