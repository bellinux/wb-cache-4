The full transportation bill, including the amendment, passed the Senate by a 74–22 vote, but the U.S. House of Representatives refused to vote on the Senate bill, instead passing a three-month extension to the current transportation bill that did not contain a county payments extension.

2500|$|Broadly speaking, {{holding a}} {{floating}} charge gives <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> creditor two key remedies {{in the event}} of non-payment of <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> debt by <b>the</b> company. [...] Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> creditor can crystallise the charge, and then sell off any assets that the charge then attaches to as if the charge was a fixed charge. [...] Secondly (and more frequently the case, to preserve the company as a going concern), if the floating charge encompasses substantially all of the assets and undertaking of <b>the</b> company, <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> creditor can appoint an administrative receiver to take over the management and control of the business with a view to discharging the debt out of income or selling off the entire business as a going concern.|$|R
40|$|The Dutch {{mortgage}} (hypotheek) is {{a limited}} real right which gives the creditor a very high rank in the debtor's insolvency and which gives its holder a quick and very practical means of organising a forced sale of the burdened property. The mortgage is in principle accessory to, that is, linked to <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> claim. To give two examples, when <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> claim lapses {{as a result of}} payment the mortgage lapses also and when <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> claim is assigned, the mortgage automatically passes to the assignee. This is called the principle of accessoriness. This principle primarily aims at protecting the mortgagor. In order to enhance the mortgagor's protection the assignee of <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> claim cannot rely on the public land register for the existence or amount of <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> claim. If <b>the</b> <b>secured</b> claim had already been repaid before the assignment, but the claim and mortgage are still registered in the land register, the assignee receives neither a claim nor a mortgage. This Dutch system is contrasted with German law which takes a totally different approach. German law favours the bona fide assignee over the debtor by enabling the assignee to rely on the public land register. This applies equally to the accessory German Hypothek and the non-accessory German Grundschuld. ...|$|R

5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw <b>the</b> <b>secure</b> base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of <b>the</b> <b>secure</b> pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E
