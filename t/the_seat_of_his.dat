He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king. However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate.|$|E
5|$|Described in the chronicles as a rash and temperamental man, Carrouges {{was also}} a fierce and brave warrior whose death in battle came after a forty-year {{military}} career in which he served in Normandy, Scotland and Hungary with distinction and success. He was also heavily involved in court politics, initially at <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overlord Count Pierre of Alençon at Argentan, but later {{in the politics of}} the Royal household at Paris, to which he was attached as a chevalier d'honneur and Royal bodyguard in the years following the judicial duel. During his life he conducted a long trail of legal and financial dealings which infuriated his contemporaries and may have invited violence against himself and his family. The truth of the events which led him into public mortal combat in the Paris suburbs may never be known, but the legend is still debated and discussed 600 years later.|$|E
5|$|Leofric {{replaced}} the monks with canons. The new community {{was given the}} Rule of Chrodegang by Leofric, which rule he had probably learned in Lotharingia before his return to England. Leofric moved <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> see because Crediton was too poor and rural, and Exeter was a city with protective walls and an abandoned church {{that could be used}} as the new cathedral. Leofric claimed that he found his diocese lacking in episcopal vestments and the other items required for church services, and his surviving list of gifts to the church noted that he gave vestments, crosses, chalices, censers, altar coverings, and other furnishings to the cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Roupen III of Armenian Cilicia laid siege to Lampron, <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rival, Hethum III of Lampron. Hethum sent envoys to Bohemond, seeking his assistance. Bohemond invited Roupen to {{a banquet}} to Antioch {{where he had}} Roupen {{captured}} and imprisoned in 1185. Bohemond invaded Cilicia, {{but he could not}} prevent Roupen's brother, Leo, from seizing Lampron. An Armenian nobleman, Pagouran of Barbaron, medieted a peace treaty. Roupen agreed to pay a ransom and to renounce Sarventikar, Tall Hamdun, Mamistra, and Adana. He also acknowledged Bohemond's suzerainty. After the ransom was paid in 1186, Bohemond released Roupen, who soon reconquered the fortresses and towns that he had ceded to Antioch.|$|E
5|$|Since Duke Mislav of the Duchy of Croatia made Klis Fortress <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> throne in {{the middle}} of the 9th century, the {{fortress}} served as the seat of many Croatia's rulers. The reign of his successor, Duke Trpimir I, the founder of the Croatian royal House of Trpimirović, is significant for spreading Christianity in the Duchy of Croatia. He largely expanded the Klis Fortress, and in Rižinice, in the valley under the fortress, he built a church and the first Benedictine monastery in Croatia. During the reign of the first Croatian king, Tomislav, Klis and Biograd na Moru were his chief residences.|$|E
5|$|In 1197, Savaric FitzGeldewin, Bishop of Bath and Wells, traded {{the city}} of Bath to the king {{in return for the}} monastery of Glastonbury. Savaric secured the support of Pope Celestine III for the {{takeover}} the abbey as <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bishopric, replacing Bath. The plan was that Savaric would be bishop of Bath as well as abbot of Glastonbury. In his support, Savaric obtained letters from various ecclesiastics, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter, that claimed that this arrangement would settle longstanding disputes between the abbey and the bishops. The monks of Glastonbury objected to Savaric's plan, and sent an appeal to Rome, which was dismissed in 1196. But King Richard, no longer imprisoned in Germany, sided with the monks, and allowed them to elect an abbot, William Pica, in place of Savaric, who responded by excommunicating the new abbot. With the succession of John as king in place of his brother Richard in 1199, Savaric managed to force his way into the monastery and set up his episcopal see within the abbey. The monks appealed to Innocent III, the new pope.|$|E

25|$|Alauddin is {{the best}} known of the Khalji dynasty because he {{extended}} his dominion to Southern India and established the second city of Delhi, Siri. He created Siri between 1297 and 1307 to defend against Mongol invasions of India and Delhi. In response he built Siri Fort, mimicked massive Turkish ones. The Fort served as <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power during his campaigns to enlarge his territory. Due to frequent Mongol invasions of West Asia, the Saljuqs took asylum in Delhi. The craftsmen of Seljuq dynasty are credited with this era's architectural monuments in Delhi.|$|E
25|$|After the Lombard castle at Melfi, {{which was}} conquered by the Normans early and {{augmented}} with a surviving, rectangular donjon {{late in the}} 11th century, Calabria was the first province affected by Norman encastellation. In 1046 William Iron Arm began construction of Stridula (a large castle near Squillace), and by 1055 Robert Guiscard built three castles: at Rossano, {{on the site of}} a Byzantine fortress; at Scribla, <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fief guarding the pass of the Val di Crati, and at San Marco Argentano (donjon built in 1051) near Cosenza.

25|$|Another major {{purchase}} {{was within}} the family. His cousin, Sir Thomas Gerard of Bryn, was a Catholic and father of the famous Jesuit priest John Gerard. He acquired considerable estates in Derbyshire and Staffordshire, including Etwall through marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of John Port (the younger). He was implicated in a plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots, from Tutbury Castle, close to Etwall. Imprisonment and fines forced him to dispose of some property and he sold to Gilbert Gerard lands around Ashley, Staffordshire. Gilbert built there a very large house, Gerrard's Bromley, which became <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> branch of the Gerards.|$|E

25|$|As {{the founder}} of a new royal dynasty, Charles I needed to build a royal {{residence}} that could function as <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> government. He commissioned architect Pietro de Caulis to design the Castel Nuovo (1279–87), which was {{to serve as the}} residence of the kings and queens of Naples. Charles I provided funding for the rebuilding of the Franciscan church of San Lorenzo Maggiore, an early example of the Neapolitan adaptation of the French Gothic style. While the tracery designs at San Lorenzo Maggiore were inspired by the French Gothic church of Saint Denis, its “cavernous nave and its unarticulated walls” show the influence of Italian Franciscan churches.|$|E
25|$|Strickland {{returned}} to Yorkshire in 1542, {{and with the}} proceeds of his voyages bought estates at Wintringham and at Boynton, both in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He seems to have lived {{the remainder of his}} life at Place Newton, his house at Wintringham where he is buried, but he had the Norman manor house at Boynton rebuilt as Boynton Hall, and this became <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> descendants. The church at Boynton is liberally decorated with the family's turkey crest, most notably {{in the form of a}} probably-unique lectern (a 20th-century creation) carved in the form of a turkey rather than the conventional eagle, the bible supported by its outspread tail feathers.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} chapter {{gives an}} account of the episcopate of Bishop Ecgred, how he succeeds after Cuthbert's death, moves <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bishopric to Norham, transporting the bodies of King Ceolwulf and St Cuthbert, and how he gives the bishopric Norham itself along with the vills of Jedburgh and Old Jedburgh and their dependent lands. Ecgred is said to have built a church at Gainford, likewise granting it to St Cuthbert, as well as making gifts of Cliffe, Wycliffe and Billingham The tables turn somewhat in chapter ten, which relates how King Osberht confiscated Warkworth and Tillmouth, and how King Ælle confiscated Cliffe, Wycliffe, and Billingham; but it proceeds to explain that God and Cuthbert got revenge by sending Ubba, duke of the Frisians (dux Fresciorum), to attack Northumbria. Before proceedings into this narrative, the Historia in chapter eleven notes the grant of King Ceolwulf and Bishop Esdred of the vills of Wudacestre, Whittingham, Edlingham and Eglingham.|$|E

25|$|Due to his {{criticism}} of the government during both the Weimar and Nazi eras, Doehring had been passed over three times for the position of head chaplain of the cathedral. In the post-war era of divided Berlin, this changed. He won and held this position in Berlin's eastern sector from 1945 {{until his retirement in}} 1960, and resumed his position as a university professor at Humboldt University from 1946 to 1953. The title of head chaplain no longer had any formal meaning at this point, as Dibelius had given himself the title of Bishop of Berlin-Brandenburg and made St. Mary's Church <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> diocese. Doehring's seat was no longer the center of Protestant worship in Germany, nor was it as prestigious a venue for events. The occupying Allied forces, and later the government of the GDR, discouraged worship, and multiple threats to the cathedral's continued existence were posed by the GDR's city planning. The cathedral, still damaged by the war, was not repaired. Doehring preached tirelessly every Sunday in his underground vault, in which he had installed a Schuke Organ in 1946, consistently drawing an audience of a thousand worshipers. He kept his reputation as the comforter of Berlin, which he had acquired during the bombing of the city, until his retirement in 1960. Four months after his death, the construction of the Berlin Wall split the Cathedral Parish, and in 1975, the demolition of his vault in the catacombs followed.|$|E
500|$|Ealdred became {{involved}} with the see of Ramsbury after its bishop Herman got into a dispute with King Edward over the movement of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bishopric to Malmesbury Abbey. Herman wished to move <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> see, but Edward refused permission for the move. Ealdred was a close associate of Herman's, and the historian H. R. Loyn called Herman [...] "something of an alter ego" [...] to Ealdred. According to the medieval chronicler John of Worcester, Ealdred was given the see of Ramsbury to administer while Herman remained outside England. Herman returned in 1058, and resumed his bishopric. There is no contemporary documentary evidence of Ealdred's administration of Ramsbury.|$|E
500|$|A single {{sentence}} in the Hypatian Chronicle mentions Mindaugas defending himself in Voruta against his nephews and Duke Vykintas; two other sources mention [...] "his castle".

At least fourteen different locations have been proposed, including Kernavė and Vilnius. The ongoing formal archeological digs at Kernavė began in 1979 after a portion of the site named [...] "Mindaugas Throne hill-fort" [...] collapsed. The town now hosts a major celebration on Statehood Day.|$|E
