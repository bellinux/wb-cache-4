2500|$|I {{looked across}} the great square, and could not believe my eyes. It was {{surrounded}} by manicured lawns, covered by flower beds on which bloomed bright red flowers. A wide street, {{which led to a}} large open area, was flanked by two rows of wooden barracks, on both sides stood rows of young trees and along the roadside ran straight flower beds as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> The square and the streets seemed freshly raked. To the left towards the watchtower, I saw a white wooden barrack and beside it a large cage, the size of a birdhouse the like you see at a zoo. Within it paraded peacocks (stolzierten) and on a climbing tree dangled monkeys and a parrot which always screamed the same word, [...] "Mama". I wondered, [...] "this is [...] a concentration camp"? ...|$|E
2500|$|In July, {{continuing}} {{south in}} clear weather, Barkley found {{the entrance to}} the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He did not explore it, but gave it its present name honouring Juan de Fuca. Juan de Fuca claimed to have discovered and sailed up a large strait at this location in 1592. Barkley thought the strait he found matched the description Juan de Fuca had given and that it was in fact Juan de Fuca's strait. The veracity of Juan de Fuca's claim had long been scoffed at by geographers and is doubted by most historians to the present day. Captain Barkley was probably the first non-indigenous person to find the strait. He was surprised to find it at all because Captain James Cook had previously explored the area and not seen it. Cook had emphatically stated that Juan de Fuca's strait did not exist. Frances Barkley wrote about the discovery in her diary: [...] "In the afternoon, to our great astonishment, we arrived off a large opening extending to the eastward, the entrance of which appeared to be about four leagues wide, and remained about that width as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> with a clear easterly horizon, which my husband immediately recognized as the long lost strait of Juan de Fuca, and to which he gave the name of the original discoverer, my husband placing it on his chart." [...] Barkley perhaps thought Tatoosh Island was the pinnacle reported by Juan de Fuca as located at {{the entrance to the}} strait. Fellow fur-trader Charles Duncan, who learned about the strait from Barkley, assumed the island was Juan de Fuca's pillar.|$|E

50|$|In 1952, Peter was {{diagnosed}} with cataracts in both eyes. Complicated by an ongoing bout with alcoholism, Peter struggled {{for the next six}} years, trying to paint everything he <b>could</b> while <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> still <b>see.</b> After a second cataract operation, Peter continued to produce large canvases of the Stoney peoples, many of which ended up in the Luxton Museum established by Norman Luxton. In 1958, Peter and Catharine formed a foundation (originally named Wa-Che-Yo-Cha-Pa) to ensure the survival of their collection. This decision led to the amazing collection that would {{become one of the most}} important in North America.|$|R
60|$|A long, grey-looking {{line was}} slowly {{unwinding}} {{itself into the}} level road. It came into sight like a serpent. It reached as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> From somewhere behind, they {{heard the sound of}} music.|$|E

60|$|As we have said, {{as far as}} <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in any direction, the {{frowning}} cliffs rose perpendicularly out of deep water. There was {{not even}} a strip of sand or a bay into which they could run in case of the wind increasing.|$|E
60|$|With {{that they}} emerged upon the harvest-field. Machines and engines dotted the golden slope, and {{wherever}} they were located stood towering straw-stacks.

60|$|During {{the last}} hour of his walk the sun had been {{obscured}} by clouds, but, just {{as he approached the}} cliffs, the clouds separated, and a golden flood rushed over the broad Atlantic, which now lay spread out before him in all its wide majesty as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
40|$|Fifty {{per cent}} terrific! fifty per cent non-existent’: Aldous Huxley and {{medicine}} Huxley (b. 1894) as a schoolboy was educated at Eton. In 1910, {{at the age}} of 16 years, he was studying biology with a view to going on to medical studies and for a career thereafter, possibly in medical research rather than in medical practice with its doctor-patient relationship problems [1]. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> infection that had a crucial effect upon his career was keratitis punctata with corneal scarring, hyperopia and astigmatism.

60|$|She was {{standing}} by the fire-place, with her elbow on the chimney-piece, and her head, resting on her hand. I stopped just inside the door, waiting to hear what she had to say. In this position her side-face only was presented to me. It was a ghastly face. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> that I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> turned wickedly on me when I came in--then turned away again. Otherwise, she never moved. I confess I trembled, but I did my best to disguise it.|$|R
60|$|Upon the {{following}} morning they started for the scene of action. An exclamation of surprise broke from them simultaneously when, on ascending a sandhill, they saw before them a plain a mile wide extending at their feet. It was covered with rushes and other aquatic plants, and extended south as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
60|$|The plain was broad, {{and as far}} as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> {{there seemed}} to be a level stretch of country between them and the mountain, but toward evening they came upon a hollow, in which stood a tiny blue Munchkin {{dwelling}} with a garden around it and fields of grain filling in all the rest of the hollow.|$|E
60|$|A large {{sheet of}} gray-green grass, bordered {{by the forest}} wall, as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> and dotted with low bushes, weltered in mirage; while {{stretching}} out into it, some half a mile off, a gray promontory into a green sea, was an object which filled me with more awe and admiration than anything which I {{had seen in the}} island.|$|E
30|$|Curiosity {{and desire}} to see {{microscopic}} world have leaded {{the invention of the}} optical microscope. Thanks to the optical microscope, the small structures that had been invisible to <b>the</b> naked <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> be <b>seen.</b> Modern biology and medical science where large portions are based on the observation of micro-objects such as cells and bacteria have been developed with the advance in the optical microscope. With fluorescent materials, optical microscopes became more useful and essential for the decades, but there is still a fundamental question how to achieve the spatial resolution below diffraction limit.|$|R
60|$|An hour {{of steady}} descent passed by before we {{caught sight of}} any burned forest land. Then as we descended into the big canyon we turned a curve and saw, far ahead to the left, a black, smoky, hideous slope. We kept {{to the right side}} of the brook and sheered off just as we reached a point opposite, where the burned line began. Fire had run up that side till checked by bare {{weathered}} slopes and cliffs. As far down <b>the</b> brook as <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through <b>the</b> smoky haze there stretched that black line of charred, spear-pointed pines, some glowing, some blazing, all smoking.|$|R
5000|$|Luminosity is an {{intrinsic}} measurable property {{of a star}} independent of distance. The concept of magnitude, on the other hand, incorporates distance. First conceived by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus {{in the second century}} BC, the original concept of magnitude grouped stars into six discrete categories depending on how bright they appeared. The brightest first magnitude stars were twice as bright as the next brightest stars, which were second magnitude; second was twice as bright as third, third twice as bright as fourth and so on down to the faintest stars, which Hipparchus categorized as sixth magnitude. The system was but a simple delineation of stellar brightness into six distinct groups and made no allowance for the variations in brightness within a group. With the invention of the telescope {{at the beginning of the}} seventeenth century, researchers soon realized that there were subtle variations among stars and millions fainter than the sixth magnitude—hence the need for a more sophisticated system to describe a continuous range of values beyond what <b>the</b> naked <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was {{a glorious}} view. On the one hand, the wood-clad hills sloped {{to the foot}} of the plain, covered with plantations, dotted here and there with the villages of the slaves, and the white houses of the overseers. At a {{distance}} could be faintly seen the towers of a city; while beyond, the sea stretched like a blue wall, far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
60|$|A week {{of travel}} brought them on June 9 to the Great Slave Lake. It was still {{early in the}} season. The rigour of winter was not yet relaxed. As far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{the surface of the}} lake {{presented}} an unbroken sheet of ice. Only along the shore had narrow lanes of open water appeared. The weather was bitterly cold, and there was no immediate prospect of the break-up of the ice.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know how}} long we were going, and to this hour I know as little where we went. Perhaps it was near Guildford. Perhaps some Arabian-night magician, opened up the place for the day, and shut it up for ever when we came away. It was a green spot, on a hill, carpeted with soft turf. There were shady trees, and heather, and, as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> a rich landscape.|$|E
60|$|Far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach were <b>seen</b> {{scattered}} {{herds of}} horses. These were tended by little {{boys who were}} totally destitute of clothing, and who seemed to enjoy with infinite zest the pastime of shooting-practice with little bows and arrows. No wonder that these Indians become expert bowmen. There were urchins there, scarce two feet high, with round bullets of bodies and short spindle-shanks, who could knock blackbirds off the trees at every shot, and cut {{the heads of the}} taller flowers with perfect certainty! There was much need, too, for the utmost proficiency they could attain, for the very existence of the Indian tribes of the prairies depends on their success in hunting the buffalo.|$|R
6000|$|The {{momentary}} excitement brought Mr. Oakhurst back to {{the fire}} with his usual calm. He did not waken the sleepers. The Innocent slumbered peacefully, {{with a smile on}} his good-humored, freckled face; the virgin Piney slept beside her frailer sisters as sweetly as though attended by celestial guardians; and Mr. Oakhurst, drawing his blanket over his shoulders, stroked his mustaches and waited for the dawn. It came slowly in a whirling mist of snowflakes that dazzled and confused <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> What <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> of the landscape appeared magically changed. He looked over the valley, and summed up the present and future in two words--"snowed in!" ...|$|R
60|$|Still, {{the servant}} remembered {{his promise to}} his {{travelling}} comrade, and said never a word or asked never a question, though all that day he walked {{on the other side}} of the road, and would have nothing to say or to do with the other. But never a whit did his comrade seem to think of or to care for that. On they jogged, and, by the time evening was at hand, they had come to a neat cottage with apple and pear trees around it, all as pleasant as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> desire to <b>see.</b> In this cottage lived a widow and her only son, and they also made the travellers welcome, and set before them a good supper and showed them to a clean bed.|$|R
