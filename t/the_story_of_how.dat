5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Zoroastrians gained {{permission to}} step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
