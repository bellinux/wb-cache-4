40|$|This paper {{examines}} the noncooperative interactions between two exporting countries and one im-porting country {{when all of}} them are seeking the optimal policies to improve their welfare. Whereas the importing country has the incentive to impose tariffs on the goods coming fi-om the two exporting countries, the export policies chosen by the exporting countries depend on the <b>tariff</b> <b>regime,</b> whether uniform or discriminatory tariffs are used. It is argued that export taxes are chosen by both exporting countries in some cases, and that whereas the importing country prefers a uniform <b>tariff</b> <b>regime,</b> the exporting countries find a discriminatory <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> preferable.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dependency}} of the adjustment of prices, exchange rates, and production {{on the nature}} of the trade regime. We contrast the adjustment between a quota and a <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> for a 'semi-small' economy characterized by monopolistic competitive market structure and short-run nominal contracts under a floating exchange rate regime. Among other issues we focus on the factors determining the behavior of the quota rent and the 'pass- through' of exchange rate adjustment to the domestic prices of importable goods. We demonstrate that the 'pass-through ratio' (measuring the elasticity of the domestic price of importable goods with respect to the exchange rate) is determined by both the commercial policy and by the market power of the various producers. It tends to be higher in a <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> because the endogenous adjustment of the quota rent mitigates the 'pass-through'. We also show that the adjustment of the exchange rate tends to be larger in the quota regime than in the <b>tariff</b> <b>regime.</b> In the <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> we observe a larger switch of domestic demand relative to the quota regime, and a corresponding smaller exchange rate adjustment. In the quota regime we observe adjustment of the quota rent such as to keep the net domestic demand for foreign goods intact. As a result, the relative price (of the domestic good to the foreign good) facing the foreign consumer adjusts more in the quota regime than in the <b>tariff</b> <b>regime.</b> At the same time the relative price facing domestic consumers in the quota regime adjusts by less than in the <b>tariff</b> <b>regime.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} non-cooperative {{interaction}} between two exporting countries producing differentiated products and one importing country when governments use optimal policies to maximize welfare. The analysis includes product differentiation, asymmetric costs, and Bertrand competition. For identical exporting countries we {{demonstrate that the}} importing country always prefers a uniform <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> while both exporting countries prefer a discriminatory <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> for any degree of product differentiation. If countries are asymmetric in terms of production cost then the higher-cost exporter always prefers the discriminatory regime but the lower-cost exporter prefers the uniform regime {{if there is a}} significant cost differential. With cost asymmetry the announcement of a uniform <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> by the importer is not a credible strategy since there is an incentive to deviate to discrimination. This implies an international body can play a role in ensuring that tariff agreements are respected. Nigar Hashimzade, Hassan Khodavaisi, and Gareth D. Myle...|$|R

Once ratified, tariffs on imported wine {{are scheduled to be}} eliminated in eight years. New competition from large scale overseas wine producers, particularly from the United States, Australia and New Zealand will be balanced with a staged reduction in taxes levied on locally produced wines. Differing <b>tariff</b> <b>regimes</b> levied against the import of grapes for table consumption and wine production have often led Japanese farmers to focus on high margin table grapes at the expense of domestic wine production.|$|E

It is shown that under Bertrand price competition, the ranking of technology under tariff protection and quota protection is ambiguous, as {{it depends on the}} relative strength of the strategic vs output effects. The equivalent quota regime can generate a higher-technology (implying a lower production cost) choice than the <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> if the strategic effect dominates the output effect.

40|$|Climate {{effects of}} {{unilateral}} carbon policies are undermined by carbon leakage. To counteract leakage and increase global cost-effectiveness carbon tariffs can {{be imposed on}} the emissions embodied in imports from non-regulating regions. We present a theoretical analysis on the economic incentives for emission abatement of producers subjected to carbon tariffs. We quantify the impacts of different carbon tariff designs by an empirically based multi-sector, multi-region CGE model of the global economy. We find that firm-targeted tariffs can deliver much stronger leakage reduction and higher efficiency gains than tariff designs operated at the industry level. In particular, because the exporters are able to reduce their carbon tariffs by adjusting emissions, their competitiveness and the overall welfare of their economies will be less randomly and less adversely affected than in previously studied carbon <b>tariff</b> <b>regimes.</b> This beneficial distributional impact could facilitate {{a higher degree of}} legitimacy and legality of carbon tariffs...|$|E
40|$|In April 2000, India {{eliminated}} the quantitative import restriction of apples and instituted a trade barrier {{in the form}} of lower ad valorem tariffs. This study examines the impacts of Indian trade policies on the apple market by reviewing the government policies, discussing mathematical and graphical analyses of trade policies, presenting estimated equations of demand, supply, and excess supply, and providing solutions of prices, quantities, and welfare impacts under autarky, free trade, and <b>tariff</b> <b>regimes.</b> Given the total population of more than one billion and a vast middle income population, and economic reforms and resulting income growth, India has a considerable potential to increase its apple consumption. Our study shows that under free trade, India will consume 3008 thousand metric tonnes (TMT) of apples of which 2237 TMT will be imported. Also, free trade will increase the total welfare by Rs 29 512 million. These large gains suggest that India should liberalize apple import barriers and move toward free trade. ...|$|E

The paper computes theoretically consistent protection indexes using a comparative static applied general equilibrium model (Global Trade Analysis Project – GTAP) featuring imperfect competition.

40|$|According to the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA), all {{agricultural}} non-tariff {{trade barriers}} should {{be converted into}} equivalent tariffs and further, reduced over time. However each member country {{has the authority to}} choose the tariff types when it converts NTBs to tariffs such as ad valorem tariff and specific tariff. The paper tries to find the reason for the choice of a certain type of tariff in the process of tariffication after the UR negotiation on agriculture. To achieve this goal, the paper analyses the effects of tariffication of a fixed quota into tariffs on price, trade and welfare in a number of scenarios related to the sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we examine the nonequivalence of specific tariff and ad valorem tariff, which are general type of tariffs used in the most of countries. The paper has shown that the two types of tariffs selected by tariffication of import quota are not generally equivalent in both their effects on price and trade stability and welfare with the trade model under uncertainty. The main conclusion {{of this study is that}} there is no general presumption that one <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> is superior to the other <b>tariff</b> <b>regime</b> under conditions of uncertainty. The precise source of uncertainty and the properties of the relevant demand and supply functions might affect the determination of tariff type selected after tariffication of non-tariff barriers...|$|R

Following {{a review of the}} recent literature, the paper develops two main types of analysis. First, a detailed statistical analysis is undertaken drawing on the trade preferences database developed by the Secretariat and covering the Quad countries and Australia. This includes a presentation of the structure of <b>tariff</b> <b>regimes</b> in these key developed countries and identification of countries and sectors that are most reliant on tariff preferences. The second analytical approach uses the standard model and database of the Global Trade Analysis Project to simulate trade liberalisation scenarios that would entail preference erosion. While highlighting a number of cases of preference reliance, the paper underscores the advantages of multilateral liberalisation. Globally and for a majority of developing regions, liberalisation by preference-granting countries will result in positive welfare gains, notwithstanding the effects of preference erosion. In a comparatively small number of cases, however, the analysis points to a risk of net welfare losses under the scenarios modelled here. nonreciprocal preferences, preference erosion, CGE simulation, developing countries, multilateral trade negotiations, tariff reductions...|$|E
