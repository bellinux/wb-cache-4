40|$|The {{unsteady}} flow of a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>ramjet</b> inlet is studied numerically by solving the Navier-Stokes equation with a two-equation turbulence model. Unsteadiness is introduced by prescribing the pressure disturbance at the inlet exit plane. The {{case with a}} sinusoidal exit plane pressure fluctuation of 20 percent of the steady exit pressure is considered. The resulting flow field exhibits a complicated interaction between the terminal shock, separation pockets and core flow. The exit plane properties feature a non-linear response to the imposed sinusoidal pressure variation...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of different boundary-layer bleed systems of a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>ramjet</b> inlet {{has been investigated}} experimentally. The main objective of the study has been to identify the boundary-layer bleed geometry that increases the inletâ€™s performance and to stabilize the subcritical condition (i. e., later buzzing). Experiments have therefore been carried out with varied boundary-layer bleed geometries at an angle of attack of 0 deg and at Mach numbers ranging from 2. 5 to 3. 5. The {{results show that the}} effectiveness of a boundary-layer bleed system depends on shock, boundary-layer interaction, unsteadiness of the flow, and flow separation...|$|E
