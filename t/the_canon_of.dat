5000|$|Whilst {{not being}} Augustinians or {{a branch of}} the Augustinian family, <b>the</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular <b>of</b> St. Augustine, who have been known in English as the [...] "Black Canons," [...] {{constitute}} {{one of the oldest and}} most prestigious Latin Rite orders. This ancient order is made up of nine independent congregations confederated internationally in 1959, and <b>the</b> Confederation <b>of</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular <b>of</b> St Augustine elects an Abbot Primate. They have houses in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Dominican Republic, England, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, and Uruguay. The different congregation include: <b>The</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular <b>of</b> St. John Lateran, <b>the</b> Austrian Congregation <b>of</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular, based in the ancient abbeys of Herzogenburg, Klosterneuburg, Neustift, Reichersberg, Sankt Florian, Vorau and Neustift that look after over 100 parishes in Austria and South Tyrol (Italy), <b>the</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Immaculate Conception, <b>The</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular <b>of</b> St. Victor, <b>The</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular <b>of</b> Great St. Bernard, <b>The</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular <b>of</b> St. Maurice, <b>the</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular <b>of</b> Windesheim, <b>The</b> Brothers of the Common Life, <b>The</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular <b>of</b> Our Lady, Mother of the Redeemer.|$|R
5|$|In 1370 Despenser, then <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Salisbury, was {{appointed}} as Bishop of Norwich by a papal bull dated 3 April 1370.

5|$|Bloom {{says that}} some of the {{characters}} have not stood the test of time, writing that modern readers are uncomfortable with the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Wizards of the Coast {{released}} two adventures {{bearing the}} Tomb of Horrors name. One is a hardcover super-adventure written by Ari Marmell and Scott Fitzgerald Gray, which builds on and expands {{the legend of}} the original Tomb using <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Return to the Tomb of Horrors as a starting point. The second Tomb of Horrors is a conversion and update of the original module for 4th Edition rules, written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray and released to members of the RPGA as part of the DM Rewards program.|$|E
50|$|Other Orders {{sprang up}} which {{followed}} the Rule of St. Augustine and the canonical life. As canons regular became separated into different congregations {{they took their}} names from the locality in which they lived, or from the distinctive habit they wore, or from the one who {{led the way in}} remodelling their lives. Hence we have <b>the</b> White <b>Canons</b> <b>of</b> Prémontré; <b>the</b> White <b>Canons</b> <b>of</b> St. John Lateran; <b>the</b> Black <b>Canons</b> <b>of</b> St. Augustine; <b>the</b> <b>Canons</b> <b>of</b> St. Victor at Paris and also at Marseilles.|$|R
2500|$|From the Eastern Church Northern Africa {{received}} only the decrees of Nicæa (325), which it owed to Cæcilianus of Carthage, {{one of the}} Nicene Fathers. The African Church created its domestic code of discipline in its own councils. It was customary to read and confirm in each council <b>the</b> <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> preceding councils, in which way there grew up collections of conciliar decrees, but purely local in authority. Their moral authority, however, was great, and from the Latin collections they eventually {{made their way into}} the Greek collections. The best-known are: (a) <b>the</b> <b>Canons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council of Carthage (August, 397) which confirmed the [...] "Breviarium" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> Hippo (393), one of the chief sources of African ecclesiastical discipline; (b) <b>the</b> <b>Canons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council of Carthage (419), at which were present 217 bishops and among whose decrees were inserted 105 <b>canons</b> <b>of</b> previous councils.|$|R

5|$|Robert Turner {{bought the}} house and lived there from 1758; his son sold it in 1787 to <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Wells Cathedral, William Blencowe. John Humphrey Babb leased the house from the early 19th century, {{purchasing}} it outright from the Blencowe family in 1813. Upon his death in 1825, his successor as Deliverer of the Vote in the House of Commons, James Mitchell, moved to the house, living there until his own death in 1833. His widow subsequently sold Highgrove at auction.|$|E
5|$|Sappho was a {{prolific}} poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines. Her poetry was well-known and greatly admired {{through much of}} antiquity, and she was among <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> nine lyric poets most highly esteemed by scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. Today, most of Sappho's poetry is lost, {{but it is still}} considered extraordinary, and her works have continued to influence other writers up until the modern day.

5|$|The canon {{itself is}} a mix of {{previous}} Daoist traditions, combining features from the Shangqing School and the Celestial Masters, along with other ancient texts and even some Buddhist ideas. The two most important texts of the canon besides the Wufujing are the Red Book of Five Writings (Chi shu wupian) and the Scripture of Upper Chapters on Limitless Salvation (Wuliang Duren Shangpin). According to Lu Xiujing, who edited the Lingbao Canon, there were a total of 34 texts in <b>the</b> <b>canon,</b> <b>of</b> which three have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Anne Frank is {{included}} {{as one of}} the topics in <b>the</b> <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Dutch History, which was prepared by a committee headed by Frits van Oostrom and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Maria van der Hoeven, in 2006; the Canon is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and {{the first two years of}} secondary school in the Netherlands. A revised version, which still includes her {{as one of the}} topics, was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007.|$|E
5|$|Following the Walpole sale many artists, {{including}} James Barry and John Flaxman, {{had made}} renewed {{calls for the}} establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre, some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings. One of the Institution's founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.|$|E

5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the Loggia palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end of his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E
5|$|The 400-year {{period from}} the 9th to 13th centuries AD was the Islamic Renaissance, {{a time when}} Islamic culture and science thrived. Greco-Roman texts were preserved, copied and {{extended}} although new texts always emphasised the medicinal aspects of plants. Kurdish biologist Ābu Ḥanīfah Āḥmad ibn Dawūd Dīnawarī (828–896 AD) {{is known as the}} founder of Arabic botany; his Kitâb al-nabât (‘Book of Plants’) describes 637 species, discussing plant development from germination to senescence and including details of flowers and fruits. The Mutazilite philosopher and physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (c. 980–1037 AD) was another influential figure, his <b>The</b> <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Medicine being a landmark in the history of medicine treasured until the Enlightenment.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of Ceremonies (Taichang 太常) {{also known}} as Grand Master of Ceremonies, was the chief {{official}} in charge of religious rites, rituals, prayers, {{and the maintenance of}} ancestral temples and altars. The role's title was changed to Upholder of Ceremonies (Fengchang 奉常) from 195 to 144 BC before reverting to the original title. Although his main concern was to link the emperor with the supernatural world and Heaven, he was also given the task of setting educational standards for the Imperial University (est. 124 BC) and the academic chairs (boshi 博士) who specialized in the Five Classics, <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> Confucianism.|$|E

5|$|Utopia, Limited (1893), their {{penultimate}} opera, was a {{very modest}} success, and their last, The Grand Duke (1896), was an outright failure. Neither work entered <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, His Excellency (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal, and His Excellency was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr. Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{compounds}} {{were probably}} used by early humans, in processed and unprocessed forms, as a paint or medicinal ointment, but their composition is uncertain. The use of pushpanjan, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds, is {{mentioned in the}} Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before. Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD.) Avicenna mentions zinc oxide in <b>The</b> <b>Canon</b> <b>of</b> Medicine (1025 AD), which mentioned it as a preferred treatment {{for a variety of}} skin conditions, including skin cancer. Though it is no longer used for treating skin cancer, it is still widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions, in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments.|$|E
5|$|Columbia University's Jesup Lectures {{were the}} {{starting}} point for many of the most important works of the modern evolutionary synthesis. The presenters introduced the connection between two important discoveriesthe units of evolution (genes) with selection as the primary mechanism of evolution. In 1941, Edgar Anderson (whose work on hybridization in the genus Iris had interested Stebbins since they met in 1930) and Ernst Mayr co-presented the lecture series and Mayr later published his lectures as Systematics and the Origin of Species. In 1946, Stebbins was invited on Dobzhansky's recommendation to present the prestigious lectures. Stebbins' lectures drew together the otherwise disparate fields of genetics, ecology, systematics, cytology, and paleontology. In 1950, these lectures were published as Variation and Evolution in Plants, which proved {{to be one of the}} most important books in 20th-century botany. The book brought botanical science into the new synthesis of evolutionary theory, and became part of <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> <b>of</b> biological works written between 1936 and 1950 that formed the modern synthesis of evolution.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Canons</b> <b>of</b> Fegionaia {{were formed}} in 1402. In 1408 Gregory XII erected a chapter for three {{independent}} houses.
