5000|$|The {{team was}} started in 1960 when {{industrialist}} Samuel F. Dupont donated one of his hydroplanes to the town in 1961 to be run in the American Power Boat Association races. The town's boat is registered as [...] "U-6" [...] (for APBA Unlimited class, #6) in high-points unlimited hydroplane racing since 1961, which makes them the longest-running team in the sport, although the team will change <b>numbers</b> <b>if</b> <b>required</b> by H1 Unlimited regulations that state the defending national champion use the U-1 designation. Through 2008 the U-6 team has used only 7 different hulls, although number 6 was used for only one race in 1988 when the new 5th Miss Madison hull crashed at San Diego in 1988. The Miss Madison team leased the U-3 Risley's hull from owners Ed Cooper, Sr., and Ed Cooper, Jr., for the final race {{of the year in}} Las Vegas. The U-3 was officially the U-6 Miss Madison at this one event. The 2nd-to-last hull was built in 1988 by Ron Jones Marine in Seattle, Washington. The hull was first used as a piston-engined boat powered by a V-12 Allison aircraft engine. It was later redesigned for a Lycoming turbine engine, the same type of engine used in the Chinook helicopters. The current U-1 Miss HomeStreet sponsored racing hull was built in 2007 for the H1 Unlimited hydroplane series.|$|R
5000|$|The {{abbreviation}} BCE, {{just as with}} BC, always {{follows the}} year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year <b>number</b> (<b>if</b> context <b>requires</b> that it be written at all). Thus, the current year is written as [...] in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as [...] CE, or as AD [...] ), and the year that Socrates died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with periods (e.g., [...] "B.C.E." [...] or [...] "C.E."). Style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer BCE/CE to BC/AD.|$|R

BREL dropped traditional locomotive construction methods in favour of an entirely new approach - an innovative modular design. This offered savings on construction and maintenance compared to previous locomotive builds. The load-bearing underframe was fitted with exchangeable modules - number 1 cab, radiator, power unit, turbocharger, electrical equipment and <b>number</b> 2 cab. <b>If</b> <b>required,</b> each module could be easily removed from the underframe and replaced.|$|R
