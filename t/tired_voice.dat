6000|$|I never {{realised}} how old France was till {{we went to}} Arles. In our crowded train poilus were packed, {{standing in}} the corridors. One very weary, invited by a high and kindly colonel into our carriage, chatted in his <b>tired</b> <b>voice</b> of how wonderfully the women kept the work going on the farms. [...] "When we get a fortnight's leave," [...] he said, [...] "all goes well, {{we can do the}} heavy things the women cannot, and the land is made clean. It wants that fortnight now and then, mon colonel; there is work on farms that women cannot do." [...] And the colonel vehemently nodded his thin face. We alighted in the dark among southern forms and voices, and the little hotel omnibus became enmeshed at once in old, high, very narrow, Italian-seeming streets. It was Sunday next day; sunny, with a clear blue sky. In the square before our hotel a simple crowd round the statue of Mistral chattered or listened to a girl singing excruciating songs; a crowd as old-looking as in Italy or Spain, aged as things only are in the South. We walked up to the Arena. Quite a recent development in the life of Arles, they say, that marvellous Roman building, here cut down, there built up, by Saracen hands. For a thousand years or more before the Romans came Arles flourished and was civilised. What had we mushroom islanders before the Romans came? What had barbaric Prussia? Not even the Romans to look forward to! The age-long life of the South stands for much in modern France, correcting the cruder blood which has poured in these last fifteen hundred years. As one blends wine of very old stock with newer brands, so has France been blended and mellowed. A strange cosmic feeling one had, {{on the top of the}} great building in that town older than Rome itself, of the continuity of human life and the futility of human conceit. The provincial vanity of modern States looked pitiful in the clear air above that vast stony proof of age.|$|E

50|$|Early in 117, Trajan grew ill {{and set out}} to sail back to Italy. His health {{declined}} {{throughout the}} spring and summer of 117, something publicly acknowledged by the fact that a bronze bust displayed at the time in the public baths of Ancyra showed him clearly aged and emaciated. After reaching Selinus (modern Gazipasa) in Cilicia, which was afterwards called Trajanopolis, he suddenly died from edema on August 8. Some say that Trajan had adopted Hadrian as his successor, but others that it was his wife Pompeia Plotina who assured the succession to Hadrian by keeping his death secret and afterwards hiring someone to impersonate Trajan by speaking with a <b>tired</b> <b>voice</b> behind a curtain, well after Trajan had died. Dio, who tells this narrative, offers his fatherthe then governor of Cilicia Apronianusas a source, and therefore his narrative is possibly grounded on contemporary rumor. It may also originate in Roman displeasure at an empress meddling in political affairs. He had reigned for 19 years, longer than anyone since Tiberius, which would be broken by Hadrian.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, a fan-made {{video for}} the song [...] "Dead By Dawn", {{featured}} on YouTube, was seen by the band and posted on their own site. In turn, this video was misinterpreted by some as an actual Showbread music video which brought attention to the subject matter and lyrics of [...] "Dead By Dawn". Certain Christian groups retaliated on web forums calling the band [...] "satanic" [...] and insisting that [...] "the only reason these degenerates should be allowed in a church is {{if it is to}} get them saved". The album, No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical, was even briefly pulled from some Christian music retailers {{in the wake of the}} backlash. However, upon further investigation of the accusations and those that made them, the album was restocked and the controversy dismissed. After a period of silence, on September 7, 2006 the band reposted (after their website crashed) a statement on their site discussing the debate between Christian morality and secular media in defense of their music and the beliefs they stand for. From the statement, Josh Porter concluded with:"Showbread is a Christian band. As I tell you from the stage in dark musty concert venues each night, dressed in silly outfits, covered in sweat and in a <b>tired</b> <b>voice.</b> This means that we as a band believe in Jesus Christ, we believe the Bible to be the living word of God, we believe in love." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, Hemanta's {{contribution}} in Hindi films was nominal. He scored music {{for a handful}} of his home productions, but none of these movies were successful nor their music. In Bengal, however, he remained the foremost exponent of Rabindra Sangeet, film and non-film songs. His output continued to be popular for most of the decade. Some of them are [...] Jodi jante chao tumi... (1972), [...] Ek gochha rajanigandha , [...] Aamay prasno kore nil dhrubatara..., Sedin tomay dekhechilam... (1974), Khirki theke singho duar... (Stree, 1971), Ke jane ko ghonta... Sonar Khancha, 1974), [...] Jeona daraon bandhu... Phuleswari, 1975 [...] ) and popularised Rabindra sangeet using them beautifully in films as per situations. A very popular and classic example is the song Chorono dhorite diyogo amare.. in Dadar Kirti(1980). In 1971, Hemanta debuted as a film director in for his self-produced Bengali movie Anindita. It didn't fare exceedingly well at the box office. However, his rendition Diner seshe ghumer deshe.. was one of his best and popular Rabindra Sangeet renditions [...] In the same year Hemanta went to Hollywood by responding to famous film director Conrad Rooks and score the music of Conrad's Siddhartha and played back O Nadire... in that film. He was the first Indian singer to play back in Hollywood. The US government honoured Hemanta by conferring him with the citizenship of Baltimore, Maryland; the first ever singer of India to get USA citizenship. In the early to mid-1970s, two major music composers in Bengal, Nachiketa Ghosh and Robin Chatterjee, who had worked closely with Hemanta, since the early 1950s, died. Simultaneously, music composed by Hemanta for Bengali films like Phuleswari, Raag Anurag, [...] " [...] Ganadebata [...] " [...] and Dadar Kirti established him as the major film music composer in the Bengal movie scene. In 1979, Hemanta re-recorded some of his earlier works with composer Salil Chowdhury from the 1940s and 1950s. This album, titled Legend of Glory, vol. 2 was a major commercial success, despite Hemanta's aged and slightly <b>tired</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Special {{consideration}} {{has recently}} been given to cepstral analysis with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the applicability of MFCCs in acoustic analysis for diagnosing occupational dysphonia in comparison to subjective and objective parameters of voice evaluation. Materials and Methods: The study comprised 2 groups, one of 55 female teachers (mean age: 45 years) with occupational dysphonia confirmed by videostroboscopy and 40 female controls with normal voice (mean age: 43 years). The acoustic samples involving sustained vowels "a" and four standardized sentences were analyzed by computed analysis of MFCCs. The results were compared to acoustic parameters of jitter and shimmer groups, noise to harmonic ratio, Yanagihara index evaluating the grade of hoarseness, the aerodynamic parameter: maximum phonation time and also subjective parameters: GRBAS perceptual scale and Voice Handicap Index (VHI). Results: The compared results revealed differences between the study and control groups, significant for MFCC 2, MFCC 3, MFCC 5, MFCC 6, MFCC 8, MFCC 10, particularly for MFCC 6 (p < 0. 001) and MFCC 8 (p < 0. 009), which may suggest their clinical applicability. In the study group, MFCC 4, MFCC 8 and MFCC 10 correlated significantly with the major objective parameters of voice assessment. Moreover, MFCC 8 coefficient, which in the female teachers correlated with all eight objective parameters, also showed the significant relation with perceptual voice feature A (asthenity) of subjective scale GRBAS, characteristic of weak <b>tired</b> <b>voice.</b> Conclusions: The cepstral analysis with mel frequency cepstral coefficients is a promising tool for evaluating occupational voice disorders, capable of reflecting the perceptual voice features better than other methods of acoustic analysis.

50|$|Another active {{research}} {{topic in}} medical voice analysis is vocal loading evaluation.

40|$|Effective {{communication}} {{is a fundamental}} requisite for teachers and other professionals in the education field. Teachers are considered professional voice users, as voice quality is central to their speech and communicative profile. In the last decades, teachers {{have been shown to}} be a risk group concerning voice disorders. Several studies have already identified specific risk factors within this population, and proposed voice health promotion measures, including prevention actions, and labour policy changes. The intervention of teachers as active advocates of their own interests is crucial to ensure improvements in their working conditions and in their labour rights. This study is the first conducted in Portugal by the initiative of a teachers’ syndicate and was included in a Voice Prevention Program implemented in northern Portugal. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine a) the prevalence of voice disorders self-reported by teachers of this region, b) the most frequent voice symptoms, and c) the risk and protection factors associated with voice disorders in this group. An observational analytic case-control study was conducted for epidemiologic and correlation analysis purposes. The population of teachers in northern Portugal is estimated to be more than 60. 000 professionals. Our sample was composed by 405 teachers which participated in a voice health promotion initiative. A self-directed questionnaire, previously developed and validated in other similar Portuguese studies, was used. This instrument included questions exploring demographic information, teaching experience and specialty, individual and environmental factors, health information, voice problems, and vocal symptoms, among others. The discrete variables were compared with chi-square test and a logistic regression model was used in order to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and their confidence intervals at 95 %. Significance level was determined at the 5 % level. The prevalence of self-reported voice disorders in the last year was 57 %. Most relevant symptoms were: loss of voice control, dry throat, <b>tired</b> and weak <b>voice,</b> roughness, tightness or pressure, and voice breaks in speech. Several risk factors were identified, namely: being a female teacher, teaching in the 1 st cycle, teaching non-specific disciplines, working in stuffy classrooms, having difficult access to water, and anxious personal profile, suffering of depressive disorder, sinusitis and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and yelling. Protection factors were: teaching in secondary level (high school), teaching physicochemical sciences, and working in a classroom with natural ventilation. Voice disorders’ prevalence was high, although in line with other regions and countries previously described. Considering existing literature, symptoms were also similar, but some risk factors where different. As this was a pilot study, future work will expand the number and geographical distribution of the sample, reinforcing its statistical relevance, in order to contribute to better labour policies in Portugal. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
