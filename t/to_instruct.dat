40|$|This {{quantitative}} {{study focused on}} the perceptions of faculty currently instructing online. The sample consisted of a random selection of instructors teaching at least one online class in the Fall of 2008. Of the 300 people surveyed, 111 responded, constituting a 37 % response rate. Although researchers tout the importance of training prior to teaching online, this study found that {{a large percentage of}} instructors are not receiving any training in pedagogy or technology prior <b>to</b> <b>instructing</b> their first online course. Findings also indicate that current online instructors desire ongoing training opportunities in technology and pedagogy, believe {{that it is difficult to}} convert a course from face-to-face to totally online, and think training should be required prior <b>to</b> <b>instructing</b> online for the first time. Additionally, a significant difference was found in the perceived preparation of instructors in both technology and pedagogy as a result of training prior <b>to</b> <b>instructing</b> online...|$|R
