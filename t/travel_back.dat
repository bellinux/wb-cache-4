Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E

While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for the father and the family dog to <b>travel</b> <b>back,</b> it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E
