40|$|This audit {{assessed}} the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 2 ̆ 7 s {{administration of the}} <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> System. Audit objective and criteria The objective of the audit {{was to assess the}} Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 2 ̆ 7 s administration of the <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> System. To form a conclusion against the objective, the audit adopted the following high-level criteria: 	an appropriate governance framework to support the effective operation of the system was established; 	a consistent, accountable and transparent assessment process for TCO applications has been implemented; 	processes and systems for the ongoing management, review and eventual revocation of TCOs are effective; and 	the approach to managing compliance with TCO requirements was sound. Overall conclusion Imposing duty on certain imported goods is designed to influence the flow of trade by regulating their value to protect Australia’s local economy and industry. In 2013 – 14, goods to the value of 338  billion were imported into Australia, with 9. 3  billion in customs duty collected. There are, however, a number of ways that importers can obtain duty-free entry of imported goods to Australia, including through accessing duty concession schemes, such as the <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> System (TCS). To receive a duty concession under the TCS, an imported good must be covered by a current <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> Order (TCO) made by Customs. A TCO consists of a tariff classification and text describing the good. As at October 2014, there were over 15   000 current TCOs available for use by importers. Under the TCS, around 1. 8  billion in revenue to the Commonwealth was forgone in 2013 – 14. Customs is responsible for administering the TCS, including assessing TCO applications, objections and revocations. In 2013 – 14, Customs received 941 applications for, and 133 objections to, TCO applications, made 770 TCOs, refused 79 TCOs and revoked 327 TCOs. Customs is also responsible for managing compliance with TCS requirements and providing assurance that importers applying a TCO to reduce customs duty are eligible to do so. The TCS is supported by mature administrative arrangements that provide a generally sound basis for the assessment and management of TCOs, including the processing of TCO applications, objections, revocations, as well as the management of TCOs that are in use. There are, however, aspects of Customs’ administrative arrangements that could be further improved, including by: 	developing a communications strategy for the TCS to maximise the effectiveness of communications and awareness raising activities, with a particular focus on local manufacturer engagement; and 	more clearly documenting TCO application assessment activities, in particular the basis on which applications are assessed as meeting legislative requirements, to provide greater assurance regarding the integrity of the assessment and decision-making process. Within the context of Customs’ broader compliance responsibilities, the limited resources assigned to TCS compliance are allocated on a risk basis and, overall, the small number of targeted compliance activities undertaken has identified TCO misuse. Nevertheless, Customs is not well placed to determine whether its activities directed at managing TCS compliance, including education and awareness activities through to enforcement action, are effectively addressing the risks arising from TCO misuse. This is primarily due to the: manner in which Customs collects and stores its compliance data, which makes it difficult to verify the number, scope and outcome of compliance activities; and absence of an appropriate set of performance measures against which an assessment of the effectiveness of compliance activities can be undertaken. To further improve Customs’ administration of the TCS and strengthen compliance monitoring arrangements, the ANAO has made three recommendations designed to: enhance engagement with key stakeholders; provide greater assurance regarding the assessment and decision-making process; and improve the monitoring and reporting of compliance activities...|$|R

Although China is an original member of GATT, the new government of the PRC has not participated in GATT activities for thirty years. By seeking GATT membership, China hopes to eliminate various kinds of discriminatory quantitative restrictions, to enjoy the MFN treatment of GATT to play a major role in world trade, to learn how to do business in multilateral trade system and to protect its interest through GATT systems.

40|$|While {{there are}} many studies {{focusing}} on the impacts of various trade policy agreements across {{the world in the}} recent years, there is not much focus in the literature {{on the extent to which}} these agreements are implemented later, in terms of the aspects agreed upon therein. In this paper, we firstly identify the past achievements of the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) in East Asian regions in terms of tariff removals and suggest future rooms for further economic benefits from trade liberalization in the region. Secondly, we provide the <b>tariff</b> <b>concession</b> dataset in the GTAP Data Base, which distinguishes the tariff removals agreed in these EPAs in East Asia but not implemented yet, from the existing overall tariffs in the benchmark year. As the standard GTAP Data Base only incorporates enforced tariff reductions through the base year applied tariffs, to analyse future trade integration, it might be worth it to integer commitments that are not yet implemented. We do that at the HS 6 levels for East Asian EPAs that allows us to compare the economic impacts of partial versus complete implementation of the trade liberalization agreed in East Asian EPAs. Our results suggest that taking those commitments into account economically matters and that such satellite dataset might be taken as actual baseline for future policy simulations.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{estimation}} of trade creation and trade diversion resulting from a trade agreement, {{as a means of}} determining the net gains from bilateral trading agreements. In particular this study {{looks at the}} actual and potential influence of the New Zealand Australia Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on New Zealand imports in terms of trade creation and trade diversion effects. A separate study was made and a set of estimates derived for ten different import commodity groups. A partial equilibrium approach was used which involved deriving a New Zealand excess demand function for each of ten broad import commodity groups. From this trade creation and trade diversion resulting from tariff induced price changes was calculated. Estimates of trade creation and trade diversion were found for: tariff changes over the 1950 - 1972 period and the 1966 - 1972 period, for a 25 percent cut in the 1950 - 1972 average tariff, and a complete movement to free trade with Australia. A movement to free trade was found to be necessary before values for trade creation became significant. However trade diversion was found to remain negligible even on a move to free trade. Welfare gains in general outweighed the welfare losses. This was particularly apparent for those commodity groups of most importance in New Zealand's import trade with Australia. It would seem New Zealand has nothing to lose from granting an across the board <b>tariff</b> <b>concession</b> to Australia and may expect the benefits of reciprocal action by Australia towards New Zealand's exports...|$|R
