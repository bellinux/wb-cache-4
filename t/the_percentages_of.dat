40|$|Summary. Alkaline {{and acid}} {{phosphatase}} levels, {{and various other}} semen characteristics, have been examined in 149 semen samples from twelve Holstein-Friesian bulls.

Alkaline phosphatase activity of spermatozoa was significantly correlated with <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> motile spermatozoa, and <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> live spermatozoa.
