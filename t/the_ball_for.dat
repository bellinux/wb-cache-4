Miami held <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>for</b> only 19:42, and totaled only 158yards of offense. The Giants' offense set the tone by holding <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>for</b> 10:25 on the opening drive, leading to a field goal by Raul Allegre. Holding Dan Marino to 119 total yards, and 3.6yards per passing attempt, the Giants prevailed by a score of 20–3.

5|$|The Falcons {{controlled}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>for</b> 41 of 60 minutes. An {{inability to}} complete long passes, combined with fumbles, prevented the Buccaneers from taking {{what could have}} been a large early lead. Isaac Hagins' fumble to Atlanta's Tom Pridemore set up a 31-yard field goal. The Buccaneers maintained a halftime lead, despite having held <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>for</b> only six minutes and 18 seconds in the first half. Falcon blitzing disrupted Doug Williams' passing, and Ricky Bell and Jerry Eckwood were held to 72 yards rushing. Eckwood's fumble led to Atlanta's go-ahead touchdown with 11:10 remaining. Bubba Bean's 60-yard run with 1:22 remaining clinched the game for the Falcons.

5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>for</b> the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut fumbled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>for</b> {{the sixth}} {{time on the}} next possession; this time Donald Brown was {{responsible}} for dropping the ball.

Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E

Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down. Tech kicker Shayne Graham was sent into the game, seemingly to attempt a 51-yard field goal. Instead of kicking the ball, Graham {{attempted to}} run <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>for</b> a first down.

5|$|Maryland had {{previously}} shown {{an ability to}} strike quickly on offense and did so again in the game. In the 2008 season, the team scored 18out of 28touchdowns in drives consisting of six or fewer plays or {{less than two minutes}} of game time. This led to the team often trailing opponents in time of possession.

5|$|Meredith had to {{deal with}} {{extremely}} physical defences, and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>for</b> him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank.

5|$|Over {{two-thirds of}} Kansas' offense {{came through the}} air as the Jayhawks racked up 249net passing yards. The Hokies, meanwhile, earned almost half their offense on the ground. The end result of the varying {{offensive}} strategies was much the same, however.
