40|$|Abstract. A 10 -year record (1985 - 1994) {{of output}} {{statistics}} from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model shows that profound seasonal changes in surface pressure take place over the Antarctic continent. The most pronounced changes occur during the periods straddling the brief Antarctic summer, from September to December and again from January to April. Surface pressures atop the high Antarctic plateau often display changes in excess of 20 hPa during these periods. Temperatures in the lower troposphere also exhibit marked changes during these <b>transitional</b> periods; <b>surface</b> temperature changes during these 3 -month periods reach a maximum near 40 K over the high interior of Antarctica. Hydrostatic considerations uggest hat the thermal adjustment in the lowest levels of the atmosphere alters the vertical distribution of pressure with height and hence {{is consistent with the}} dramatic seasonal surface pressure changes over the elevated Antarctic ice sheets. A strong interplay exists between the thermal forcing and the katabatic wind circulation over the continent. The large seasonal changes in solar insolation reaching the Antarctic ice surface modulate the intensity of the katabatic wind regime and thus the resulting mean meridional circulation between the continent and the subpolar latitudes. It is proposed that the diabatic adjustment in the lower levels of the atmosphere over Antarctica disrupts the mean meridional circulation creating a seasonal mass imbalance and hence surface pressure changes. It is through the meridional transports that the mass and wind fields reach a quasi-equilibrium adjusted state. The seasonal mass movement over Antarctica requires large-scale mass compensation over much of the southern hemisphere and shows that the diabatic influences at the Antarctic surface have far-field impacts. 1...|$|R

Plateau honing is a finishing process which attempts to impart a transitional topography which may be considered partially 2 ̆ 2 run in 2 ̆ 2 and hence provides a condition which is part way towards the fully run-in state. In this paper the methods of producing engine bores are considered, the surface profiles obtained by these methods are examined and attempts to characterize their surface topography are made.

S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) –approved DES implanted coronary arteries suggest that complications of late stent thrombosis are associated with incomplete endothelial coverage of struts. MethodsRabbits received sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES), zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES), and everolimus-eluting stents (EES) for 14 or 28 days along with MULTI-LINK (ML) Vision control stents. Endothelial coverage above and between struts was measured by morphometric analysis of images acquired through en face scanning electron microscopy. Dual fluorescent immunolabeling was performed for platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) - 1 and thrombomodulin (TM), factors involved in cell-to-cell contact and thrombogenicity, respectively. In a separate analysis, the endothelial mitogen, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was also assessed. ResultsVarying rates of endothelialization among comparator DES were most notable at 14 days, where coverage above struts remained poor in SES, PES, and ZES (≤ 30 %) relative to EES and ML Vision controls (≥ 70 %), whereas no significant differences were observed at 28 days. Select DES with poor endothelialization showed a further reduced expression of PECAM- 1. All DES showed an absence or weak expression of the antithrombotic cofactor TM.

Changes in male caring patterns are under study {{in the last two decades}} of the previous century. The key themes include their motives to care (differently), and the costs and benefits. In an era of modernity, choosing - even with respect to care - implies having to motivate such choices. As a result social selection processes progress differently, imitation and identification have become more important. Rational value motivations for men to care can be broadly observed in the Netherlands, but behavioural patters, as charted more often, lag behind. Pressure exerted by the traditional, complementary division of labour and pressure from the traditional labour regime are the most important counter forces, where value rationality appears to be quickly discarded. By contrast, affective motivations in terms of caring for children, coupled with the wishes of a female partner and her economic potential appear to be the most important changing factors. The sustainability of change is reflected in his affective motivations and her aspirations, while the care provided by men takes shape and has developed in different ways and in different socio-economic milieus. The dominance of the Dutch one-and-a-half income household can be understood within the context of reconciling old demands with new desires: change is 'produced' here and incorporated in the continuity of the (main) breadwinner model.

40|$|The EC-Earth {{earth system}} {{model has been}} {{recently}} developed to include the dynamics of vegetation. In its original formulation, vegetation variability is simply operated by the Leaf Area Index (LAI), which affects climate basically by changing the vegetation physiological resistance to evapotranspiration.

In reality, the effective sub-grid vegetation fractional coverage will vary seasonally and at interannual time-scales in response to leaf-canopy growth, phenology and senescence. Therefore it affects biophysical parameters such as the albedo, surface roughness and soil field capacity. To adequately represent this effect in EC-Earth, we included an exponential dependence of the vegetation cover on the LAI. By comparing two sets of simulations performed with and without the new variable fractional-coverage parameterization, spanning from centennial (twentieth century) simulations and retrospective predictions to the decadal (5 -years), seasonal and weather time-scales, we show {{for the first time a}} significant multi-scale enhancement of vegetation impacts in climate simulation and prediction over land. Particularly large effects at multiple time scales are shown over boreal winter middle-to-high latitudes over Canada, West US, Eastern Europe, Russia and eastern Siberia due to the implemented time-varying shadowing effect by tree-vegetation on snow surfaces. Over Northern Hemisphere boreal forest regions the improved representation of vegetation cover tends to correct the winter warm biases, improves the climate change sensitivity, the decadal potential predictability as well as the skill of forecasts at seasonal and weather time-scales. Significant improvements of the prediction of 2 m temperature and rainfall are also shown over <b>transitional</b> land <b>surface</b> hot spots. Both the potential predictability at decadal time-scale and seasonal-forecasts skill are enhanced over Sahel, North American Great Plains, Nordeste Brazil and South East Asia, mainly related to improved performance in the surface evapotranspiration.

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) in indoor environments depends, in part, on sorptive interactions between VOCs in the gas phase and material surfaces. Since information on the types and quantities of interior material surfaces is not generally available, this pilot-scale {{study was conducted in}} occupied residences to develop and demonstrate a method for quantifying surface areas of objects and materials in rooms. Access to 33 rooms in nine residences consisting of bathrooms, bedroom/offices and common areas was solicited from among research group members living in the East San Francisco Bay Area. A systematic approach was implemented for measuring rooms and objects from 300 cm{sup 2 } and larger. The ventilated air volumes of the rooms were estimated and surface area-to-volume ratios were calculated for objects and materials, each segregated into 20 or more categories. Total surface area-to-volume ratios also were determined for each room. The bathrooms had the highest total surface area-to-volume ratios. Bedrooms generally had higher ratios than common areas consisting of kitchens, living/dining rooms and <b>transitional</b> rooms. Total <b>surface</b> area-to-volume ratios for the 12 bedrooms ranged between 2. 3 and 4. 7 m{sup 2 } m{sup - 3 }. The importance of individual objects and materials with respect to sorption will depend upon the sorption coefficients for the various VOC/materials combinations. When combined, the highly permeable material categories, which may contribute to significant interactions, had a median ratio of about 0. 5 m{sup 2 } m{sup - 3 } for all three types of rooms...|$|R
40|$|The denitrified low oxygen zone in Early Paleozoic oceans is {{proposed}} {{as a potential}} habitat of planktic graptolites. Modern analogs of this zone {{are found in the}} eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) and in the north-ern Arabian Sea as shallow regions, up to a 100 meters thick, {{at the top of the}} pycnocline. There, oxygen is low or undetected and hydrogen sulfide has not been found. In modern oceans, denitrification regions are limited vertically and horizontally as oxygen is replenished from below by ventilated deep waters. In the Early Paleozoic ocean, the denitrification layer would be global due to poor deep ventilation. It would be <b>transitional</b> between oxygenated <b>surface</b> waters and toxic sulfide-rich water. Many branched graptolites could have evolved when the denitrified waters were in or close to the photic zone, feeding on the abun-dant phytoplankton attracted to both light and nutrients. As this zone sank below the photic zone, grapto-lites who developed planktic mode of life could have migrated daily toward the food supply, similar to euphausiids in the modern ETP. Thus the changes in graptohte rhabdosomes from pendent to scandent and from many branched to biserial and uniserial are suggested as adaptations to assist vertical migration and feeding. With the continued ventilation of the oceans and the shrinking of the denitrified layer, grap-tohte extinction could have resulted as a combination of reduction in food supply and living space, in-creased predation from the then evolving fish and ammonites, and competition in the zooplankton niche from smaller (less visible) and more motile forms...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxygenation}} of {{our planet}} is perhaps the greatest transition in its history, dramatically affecting geochemical cycles {{and the evolution of}} life. Major first-order questions still remain about late Archean and Proterozoic environments, even as newly developed geochemical techniques provide additional constraints and create subtle conundrums. I apply a new approach to classic localities to understand Precambrian redox character and paleoenvironmental conditions by combining textural observations from optical and electron microscopy, isotopic measurements, and (synchrotron-based) x-ray spectroscopy with scanning magnetic microscopy and bulk rock magnetic experiments. Models paired with data from the literature provide additional context for these measurement results. The first portion of this dissertation focuses on understanding the predominant microbial metabolism recorded in the 2. 72 Ga Tumbiana Formation stromatolites. I proposed that these stromatolites formed in shallow, anoxic waters and record a global signature of unique autotrophy distinct from younger systems dominated by oxygenic photosynthesis. The next portion of this dissertation uses the redox sensitivity of iron as a tool to investigate paleoredox conditions of the 1. 45 Ga lower Belt Supergroup during a potentially <b>transitional</b> time-period in <b>surface</b> environments. Observations of primary mineralogy in early diagenetic pyrite and detrital iron oxides suggest an oxygenated water-column overlying anoxic, sulfidic pore-fluids very similar to the modern. The final portion of this dissertation assesses the effects of prevalent secondary overprints on the use of iron as a paleoredox proxy. Theoretical data-driven models combined with trends from the Belt Supergroup highlight the mobility of iron during progressive burial metamorphism as well as in diagenetic transformations and reactions with infiltrating fluids. Applying coupled techniques, specifically including textural methods, is vital for untangling secondary alterations from primary records of environmental conditions during the Precambrian. ...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{degradation}} {{has both}} indirect and direct {{effects on the}} quality of surface and ground waters. In this sense, agriculture {{is one of the key}} activities causing water quality degradation in many parts of Mediterranean systems. In the European Union, the purpose of the Water Framework Directive (European Commission, 2000) is to establish a framework for the protection of inland <b>surface,</b> <b>transitional,</b> coastal and ground waters too. A major source of surface and ground water pollution is the diffuse contamination caused by nitrates in agricultural lands. This specific water protection was regulated by the Nitrates Directive (ND, 1991 / 676 /EC), which in Spain was developed by a Royal Decree (261 / 1996 /BOE), and in Andalusia region by a Decree (36 / 2008 /BOJA) for the designation of water quality vulnerability zones (22 zones) and an Order of the Regional Government of Andalusia (18. 11. 2008 /BOJA) to establish the action programs (1 unique program) to be implemented by farmers. However, the Nitrates Directive considers that different action programs may be established for different vulnerable zones or parts of those areas. Also, these action programs must take into account scientific and technical information that are available on each particular soil and climatic conditions, such as rainfall erosivity, length of the growing season, slope, soil infiltration and soil denitrification capacity. Within this context, the agro-ecological decision support system MicroLEIS DSS (technology developed by CSIC-IRNAS and transferred to Evenor-Tech, www. evenor-tech. com) is considered a very appropriate tool to include the soil and climatic attributes for a better identification of vulnerable zones and formulation of action programs. In this paper, the MicroLEIS DSS modelling infrastructure to predict soil erosion and contamination risks (ImpelERO and Pantanal models, basically) is discussed, as a scientific approach to identify detailed vulnerable areas, and formulate site-specific management plans for sustainable water use and protection in Andalusia region. The high variability of the results from this agro-ecological land evaluation research in Water Quality Vulnerability Zones demonstrates the importance of using soil information in decision-making regarding the formulation of site-specific soil use and management strategies.
