In 1991, Sheila King won a $250,000 jackpot in the casino at Caesars Palace on a $500 machine, and won $50,000 twice soon afterwards. Over three years she won $200 million on the machines but kept pumping <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>back</b> into the machines. Despite her luck, in 1994 her winnings fell to $500,000, and she spent much of her time {{over the next four years}} in the law courts claiming that the casino operators had tampered with her machines and deceived her to keep her winning.|$|E

25|$|Unjust {{enrichment}} is seen {{to underlie}} a final group of constructive trust cases, although this remains controversial. In Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd Goulding J held that a bank that mistakenly paid money to another bank had a claim to <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>back</b> under a constructive trust. Mistake would typically {{be seen as an}} unjust enrichment claim today, and there is no debate over whether the money could be claimed back in principle. It was, however, questioned whether the claim for <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>back</b> should be proprietary in nature, and so whether a constructive trust should arise, particularly if this would bind third parties (for instance, if the recipient bank had gone insolvent). In Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that a constructive trust could only arise if the recipient's conscience would have been affected {{at the time of the}} receipt or before any third party's rights had intervened. In this way, it is controversial whether unjust enrichment underlies any constructive trusts at all, although it remains unclear why someone's conscience being affected should make any difference.|$|E

A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information.

When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>back</b> in bed with Schultz.|$|E

500|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin and Joseph Johnson, Wollstonecraft's {{publisher}} and close friend, contacted Fanny's father, {{but he was}} uninterested in raising his child. (Neither Wollstonecraft nor her daughter ever saw Gilbert Imlay after 1796.) Wollstonecraft's two sisters, Eliza Bishop and Everina Wollstonecraft, Fanny's only two living female relatives, were anxious to care for her; Godwin, disliking them, turned down their offer. Several times throughout Fanny's childhood Wollstonecraft's sisters asked Godwin {{to allow them to}} raise their niece and each time he refused. Godwin himself did not seem particularly ready for parenthood and he now had two small children to raise and no steady source of income. However, he was determined to care for them. During these early years of Fanny's life, Joseph Johnson served as an [...] "unofficial trustee" [...] for her as he had occasionally for her mother. He even willed her £200, but Godwin owed Johnson so much money upon his death in 1809 that Johnson's heirs demanded Godwin pay <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>back</b> as part of his arrears.|$|E
500|$|Observers, {{including}} series director David Petrarca and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, {{said that}} illegal downloads did not hurt the series' prospects; it benefited from [...] "buzz" [...] and social commentary, {{and the high}} piracy rate did not significantly translate to lost subscriptions.

At a 2015 Oxford Union debate, series co-creator David Benioff {{said that he was}} just glad that people watched the show; illegally downloaded copies of the show sometimes interested viewers enough to buy a copy of the show, especially in countries where the show was not televised. Co-creator D. B. Weiss had mixed feelings, saying that the show was expensive to produce and [...] "if it doesn't make <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>back,</b> then it ceases to exist". However, he was pleased that so many people [...] "enjoy the show so much they can't wait {{to get their hands on}} it."

500|$|Fuming, Sinatra began what The Los Angeles Times {{describes}} as a [...] "weekend-long tirade" [...] against the [...] "hotel's management, employees and security forces". The FBI report says the incident began when Mia Farrow lost US$20,000 at the Sands casino. Sinatra bought US$50,000 in chips and made an attempt to win <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>back.</b> [...] He lost this sum within {{a short period of}} time. [...] Sinatra then asked for credit, which was denied. It culminated when Sinatra reportedly drove a golf cart through the window of the coffee shop where casino manager Carl Cohen was seated and began [...] "screaming obscenities and anti-Semitic remarks" [...] at Cohen. Sinatra reportedly punched Cohen, a heavily built man, who responded with a smack in the mouth, bloodying Sinatra's nose and knocking two of his teeth out. [...] As a result, Sinatra never performed at the Sands again while Hughes owned it, and began performing at Caesars Palace. A number of the staff were not disappointed to see Sinatra leave the Sands. Numerous employees had been humiliated or intimidated over the years, including a busboy Sinatra tripped while he was carrying a tray with dishes. After Sinatra left, the mobsters pulled out of the Sands and gradually left Vegas in the 1970s. [...] In the 1970s it became associated with the likes of Wayne Newton and Liberace. At this time some 30% of the performers at Sands were Italian Americans. Frank Gagliardi became the drummer for the house orchestra in 1964, starting a twelve-year tenure.|$|E
