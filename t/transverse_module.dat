40|$|Transverse {{fracture}} often occurs {{early in}} the loading history {{and is one of}} the key issues limiting the composite structural design. However, the mechanical behavior under transverse loading can not be represented by traditional micromechanical model which does not consider the influence of constituent properties, fiber volume fraction and fiber distribution. A new computational micromechanics finite element method, which the microstructure was idealized as a random dispersion of parallel fibers embedded in the polymeric matrix using improved random sequence absorption algorithm, was presented. The plasticity of matrix and interface decohesion of the composite were included in this model and the residual stress caused by the cooling of composite after the curing process was also taken into consideration. The transverse tension, compression and shear of composite were analyzed by the micromechanical finite element method. Compared with the experiment results, the prediction errors of <b>transverse</b> <b>module</b> were less than 7 %, and the transverse compression strength and shear strength were less than 8 %.

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} unique microcircuits within the subdivisions of the {{amygdala}}. Microcircuits of the amygdala remain {{somewhat of an}} enigma. The amygdala itself is comprised of laterally located glutamatergic projection neuron structures, which are cortical-like, and medially located GABA projection neuron structures, which resemble neurons of the striatum. Within these are many nuclei and subnuclei that are distinguished on histologic, hodologic, and functional criteria. Significant {{progress has been made}} in understanding the organization of microcircuits in the lateral amygdala (LA) and central amygdala (CE), which play important roles in fear learning and fear memory, and the intercalated neurons (ITC), which regulate fear extinction. Emerging data indicate a structured excitatory microcircuit within the LA. Local axon collaterals of excitatory projection neurons are regulated by <b>transverse</b> <b>modules</b> of local GABA inhibition, which control excitation in the dorsal to ventral and ventral to dorsal planes. Bidirectional excitation in this plane may form recurrent networks that contribute to the temporal coordination of sensory signals integrated into the Lad network. Future work on amygdala microcircuits will continue to yield important data on how microcircuits regulate learning, memory, and behavior...|$|R
40|$|Molecular gastronomy is {{the study}} of the {{physical}} and chemical culinary transformations that occur during preparation, cooking and consumption. Molecular gastronomy differs from food science as the social, artistic and technical components of culinary and gastronomic phenomena are explored. At the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) the aim of developing molecular gastronomy modules is to use them as a tool to teach scientific principles to those who work in the Culinary Arts. Students and graduates can then apply their knowledge to develop and create novel dishes and food products. Scientific principles are taught, explained and demonstrated in the kitchen environment, in scientific laboratories and through the use of information technology such as Echo 360 which is a lecture capture software system. Molecular gastronomy modules have been written and validated at levels 6 (basic), 8 (intermediate) and 9 (advanced) in accordance with the Irish National Framework of Qualifications. In addition a Ph. D (level 10) is currently being conducted in the subject area of molecular gastronomy.

We are developing a reconfigurable suite of locomotive modules that permit side-slipping locomotion.

The example truss is a dual-keel design composed of 5 -meter-cube modules. The truss is 21 modules high and 9 modules wide, with a <b>transverse</b> beam 15 <b>modules</b> long. One problem of concern is the amount of mismatch which will be expected when the truss is being erected on orbit. Worst-case thermal loading results in less than 0. 5 inch of mismatch.

40|$|The <b>Transverse</b> Momentum Discriminator <b>Module</b> (PTDM) {{is one of}} {{the three}} main modules used in the Level 1 Charged Particle Trigger System of the BABAR Detector at PEP-II. It {{provides}} trigger decisions for charged particles with a transverse momentum, P t, greater than a configurable threshold. The transverse momentum discrimination algorithm works by evaluating the curvature of the charged tracks in the 1. 5 T axial magnetic field. The capabilities of the PTDM are key to a stable and efficient operation of the BABAR experiment even under severe background conditions. A sharp threshold behavior with an efficiency rise from 10 % to 90 % within 30 MeV=c at 600 MeV=c is achieved by using track segment information with very good spatial resolution (0. 7 mm). This resolution is obtained by using the drift time information from the drift chamber. In this paper the design and implementation of the PTDM are described. I.

40|$|The lateral amygdaloid (LA) nucleus is {{the main}} input station of the {{amygdala}} for sensory afferents. However, {{it is unclear how}} the lateral nucleus transforms these inputs, because its intrinsic connectivity is poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of the fact that glutamatergic neurons of the lateral nucleus send a primarily unidirectional projection to the basomedial nucleus. Consequently, it was possible to infer the targets of their intranuclear axons (projection cells vs inhibitory interneurons) by backfiring some projection neurons from the basomedial nucleus and analyzing evoked responses in other LA projection cells. Basomedial stimuli evoked markedly different synaptic responses depending on the orientation of the slices. In coronal slices (intact and decorticated), the prevalent response of LA neurons was an inhibition, regardless of the stimulation intensity. This inhibition was sensitive to GABAA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists, suggesting that it was mediated by the activation of GABAergic cells of the LA. In contrast, basomedial stimuli primarily evoked EPSPs in horizontal slices, regardless of the position of recorded neurons. In light of these findings, we conclude that the prevalent target of the intrinsic axon collaterals of projection cells depend on the rostrocaudal position of target neurons with respect to the parent cell body: inhibitory interneurons at rostrocaudal proximity versus other projection cells at a distance. Thus, feedback interneurons effectively divide the lateral nucleus in <b>transverse</b> processing <b>modules</b> that prevent runaway excitation within each module but allow intermixing of sensory information in the rostrocaudal plane.

40|$|Bioremediation of {{aromatic}} pollutants {{using the}} ligninolytic enzymes {{of the white}} rot fungi has been thoroughly researched and {{has been shown to}} have considerable potential for industrial application. However, little success in scale-up and industrialisation of this technology has been attained due to problems associated with the continuous production of the pollutant-degrading enzymes using conventional bioreactor systems. The low productivities reported result from the incompatibility of conventional submerged culture reactor techniques with the physiological requirements of these fungi which have evolved on a solid-air interface, viz. wood. The enzymes are also produced only during the stationary phase of growth and can therefore be regarded as secondary metabolites. This study reports the conceptualisation, characterisation and evaluation of a novel bioreactor system as a solution to the continuous production of idiophasic pollutant degrading enzymes by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chlysosporium. The reactor concept evolved from observation of these fungi in their native state, i. e. the metabolism of lignocellulosic material and involves the immobilisation of the organism onto a capillary ultrafiltration membrane. Nutrient gradients established across the biofilm, an inherent characteristic of fixed bed perfusion reactors, are exploited to provide both nutrient rich and nutrient poor zones across the biofilm. This allows growth or primary metabolism in the nutrient rich zone, pushing older biomass into the nutrient poor zone where secondary metabolism is induced by nutrient starvation. In effect, this represents a transformation of the events of a batch culture from a temporal to a spatial domain, allowing continuous production of secondary metabolites over time. Direct contact of the outer part of the biofilm with an air stream simulated the solid-air interface of the native state of the fungus. In order to facilitate the practical application of the membrane gradostat reactor (MGR) concept, conventional capillary membranes and membrane bioreactor modules were first evaluated. These were found to be unsuitable for application of the MGR concept. However, critical analysis of the shortcomings of the conventional systems resulted in the formulation of a set of design criteria {{for the development of a}} suitable membrane and module. These design criteria were satisfied by the development of a novel capillary membrane for membrane bioreactors, as well as a <b>transverse</b> flow membrane <b>module,</b> which is a novel approach in membrane bioreactor configuration. For the physiological characterisation of the MGR concept, a single fibre bioreactor unit was designed, which allowed destructive sampling of the biofilm for analysis. Using this system, it was shown that distinct morphological zones could be observed radially across the mature biofilm obtained through MGR operation. That these morphotypes do represent the temporal events of a typical batch culture in a spatial domain was confirmed by following the morphological changes occurring during batch culture of the immobilised fungus where the onset of primary and secondary metabolic conditions were manipulated through control of the nutrient supply. The different morphotypes were correlated to distinct growth phases by comparison of the morphology to the secretion of known enzymatic markers for secondary metabolism, viz. succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome C oxidoreductase. Detailed structure-function analysis of the biofilm using transmission electron microscopy and adapted enzyme cytochemical staining techniques showed that the biofilm appeared to operate as a co-ordinated unit, with primary and secondary metabolism apparently linked in one thallus through nutrient translocation. This study provided new insights into the physiology of P. chrysosp,o rium and a detailed descriptive model was formulated which correlates well to existing models of wood degradation by the white rot fungi (WRF). Evaluation of the process on a laboratory scale using a novel transverse flow membrane bioreactor showed that a volumetric productivity of 1916 U. L. ⁻¹day⁻¹ for manganese peroxidase, one of the pollutant degrading enzymes, could be attained, corresponding to a final concentration of 2 361 U. L. ⁻¹ This may be compared to the best reported system (Moreira el at. 1997), where a volumetric productivity of 202 U. L. ⁻¹day⁻¹was achieved with a final concentration of 250 U. L. ⁻¹ However, MGR productivity is yet to be subjected to rigorous optimisation studies. The process could be operated continuously for 60 days. However, peak productivity could not be maintained for long periods. This was found to be due to physical phenomena relating to the fluid dynamics of the system which caused fluid flow maldistribution, which would have to be resolved through engineering analysis. In evaluation of the MGR concept for aromatic pollutant removal, in this case ρ- cresol, from growth medium, good performance was also achieved. The VmaxKm calculated by linear regression for the MGR was 0. 8 (R² = 0. 93), which compared favourably to that reported by Lewandowski et al. (1990), who obtained a Vmax/Km of 0. 34 for a packed bed reactor treating chlorophenol. It was concluded that the MGR showed suitable potential to warrant further development, and that the descriptive characterisation of the biofilm physiology provided a sufficient basis for process analysis once engineering aspects ofthe system could be resolved. ...|$|R
