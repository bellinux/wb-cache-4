5|$|In 2011, Saran {{appeared}} in Rowthiram, {{where she worked}} with Tamil actor Jeeva for the first time. The film received fairly low reviews. Although some reviews said that Saran was not given much opportunity to show her acting skills, mainly just adding a romantic touch to a mostly violent film, she was referred to by another as <b>the</b> <b>pivot</b> around which the film revolves. Her performance earned her Best Actress Award at the International Tamil Film Awards. Her only other film in 2011 was a special appearance in a song for the Tamil film Rajapattai.|$|E
5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as <b>the</b> <b>pivot</b> man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pivot</b> catapult, {{known as}} the {{traction}} trebuchet, had existed in China since the Warring States period (as evidenced by the Mozi). It was regularly used in sieges during the Han dynasty, by both besiegers and the besieged. The most common projectile weapon used during the Han dynasty was the small handheld, trigger-activated crossbow (and to a lesser extent, the repeating crossbow), first invented in China during the 6th or 5th century BCE. Although the nomadic Xiongnu were able to twist their waists slightly while horse-riding and shoot arrows at targets behind them, the official Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) deemed the Chinese crossbow superior to the Xiongnu bow.|$|E

50|$|Kater {{found that}} making one of <b>the</b> <b>pivots</b> {{adjustable}} caused inaccuracies, {{making it hard}} to keep the axis of both pivots precisely parallel. Instead he permanently attached the knife blades to the rod, and adjusted the periods of the pendulum by a small movable weight (b,c) on the pendulum shaft. Since gravity only varies by a maximum of 0.5% over the Earth, and in most locations much less than that, the weight only had to be adjusted slightly. Moving the weight toward one of <b>the</b> <b>pivots</b> decreased <b>the</b> period when hung from that <b>pivot,</b> and increased <b>the</b> period when hung from <b>the</b> other <b>pivot.</b> This also had the advantage that the precision measurement of the separation between <b>the</b> <b>pivots</b> only had to be made once.|$|R

5|$|The Norman town of Caen was a D-Day {{objective}} for the 3rd Infantry Division, which {{landed on}} Sword Beach on 6 June 1944. The capture of Caen {{was the most}} ambitious objective of I Corps (Lieutenant-General John Crocker). The Overlord plan called for the Second Army (Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey) to secure the city and then form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen, acquiring airfields and protecting the left flank of the US First Army while it moved on Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture Falaise, {{which could be used}} as <b>the</b> <b>pivot</b> for a swing left of the Allied front to advance on Argentan and then towards the Touques River. The terrain between Caen and Vimont was especially promising, being open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations. The Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units and a battle of manoeuvre would be to their advantage.|$|E

25|$|With a {{partitioning}} algorithm such as {{the ones}} described above (even with one that chooses good pivot values), quicksort exhibits poor performance for inputs that contain many repeated elements. The problem is clearly apparent when all the input elements are equal: at each recursion, the left partition is empty (no input values are less than <b>the</b> <b>pivot),</b> and the right partition has only decreased by one element (<b>the</b> <b>pivot</b> is removed). Consequently, the algorithm takes quadratic time to sort an array of equal values.|$|E

In diagram B, the sett reverses and repeats {{in the same way}} as the warp, and also carries on in the same manner vertically.

However, on an [...] "asymmetrical" [...] tartan, the sett does not reverse at <b>the</b> <b>pivots,</b> it just repeats at <b>the</b> <b>pivots.</b> Also, some tartans (very few) do not have exactly the same sett for the warp and weft.
