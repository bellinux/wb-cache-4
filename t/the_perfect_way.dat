25|$|The modern {{convention}} {{of moving the}} Olympic flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue began in 1936 in Germany.

The Krupp armaments company produced the torches in wood and metal, inspired by an olive leaf. The Olympic flame was lit by a concave mirror in Olympia, Greece and transported over 3,187 kilometres by 3,331 runners in twelve days and eleven nights from Greece to Berlin. Leni Riefenstahl later staged the torch relay for the 1938 film Olympia.

25|$|The film had {{its roots}} in an earlier concept for a new King Kong feature {{developed}} by Willis O'Brien, animator of the original stop-motion Kong. Around 1960, O'Brien {{came up with a}} proposed treatment, King Kong meets Frankenstein, where Kong would fight against a giant version of Frankenstein's monster in San Francisco. O'Brien took the project (which consisted of some concept art and a screenplay treatment) to RKO to secure permission to use the King Kong character. During this time the story was renamed King Kong vs. the Ginko when it was believed that Universal had the rights to the Frankenstein name (it actually only had the rights to the monster's makeup design). O'Brien was introduced to producer John Beck, who promised to find a studio to make the film (at this point in time, RKO was no longer a production company). Beck took the story treatment and had George Worthing Yates flesh it out into a screenplay. The story was slightly altered and the title changed to King Kong vs. Prometheus, returning the name to the original Frankenstein concept (The Modern Prometheus was the alternate name of Frankenstein in the original novel). Unfortunately, the cost of stop-motion animation discouraged potential studios from putting the film into production. After shopping the script around overseas, Beck eventually attracted the interest of the Japanese studio Toho, which had long wanted to make a King Kong film and was also planning for Godzilla to make a comeback around the same time. After purchasing the script, they decided to replace the Frankenstein creature with Godzilla to be King Kong's opponent and would have Shinichi Sekizawa rewrite Yates's script. The studio thought that it would be <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>way</b> to celebrate its thirtieth year in production. It was one of 5 big banner releases for the company to celebrate the anniversary alongside Sanjuro, , Lonely Lane, and Born in Sin. John Beck's dealings with Willis O'Brien's project were done behind his back and O'Brien was never credited for his idea. In 1963, Merian C. Cooper attempted to file a lawsuit against John Beck claiming that he outright owned the King Kong character, but the lawsuit never went through as it turned out he was not Kong's sole legal owner as he had previously believed.|$|E

Though Davies had intended the serial to end with the Tenth Doctor visiting his former companions, he struggled with how to include Rose. An initial idea was for Rose to appear with her part-human Doctor in the parallel universe, where both would sense the original Tenth Doctor regenerating. However, Davies felt this would raise too many questions about {{their lives in the}} parallel universe. Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat, felt that Davies ended Rose's story in <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>way</b> by choosing to take it {{back to the beginning of}} her acquaintance with the Doctor.

During the episode Piper's character has dialogue solely with John Hurt's War Doctor, and is unseen by the other characters, including the Tenth Doctor.

[...] She praised the pod format, saying it [...] "helped tighten the season {{and give it a}} stronger throughline" [...] and added that each new pod the season introduced was more successful than the previous, with the Agents of Hydra pod and Framework story arc possibly the strongest of the entire series. Schwartz also spoke fondly of the guest stars throughout the season, particularly Jansen, who she called [...] "the season's MVP" [...] and felt [...] "stole the show" [...] with Aida, who was [...] "the standout new character" [...] of the season. Some negatives on the season were the additional villains, Eli Morrow and the Superior (not [...] "a particularly standout villain", and never [...] "as imposing or terrifying as he should have been", respectively), and some of the early effects work, though she also praised [...] "the great CGI work" [...] with Ghost Rider.
