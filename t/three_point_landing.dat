5000|$|On June 28, 1933 I {{departed}} from the Municipal Airport, Kansas City, Missouri, flying Flamingo NC 9489. Ship was functioning properly throughout the entire trip until I reached the vicinity of Goodland, Kansas. While flying {{at an altitude of}} approximately two thousand feet I suddenly discovered fire which seemed to originate around the rear portion of the motor section and which permitted flames and fumes to enter through the floor boards into the pilot's cockpit. I immediately cut the throttle and switch and turned off the right hand gas tank. It was impossible to close the left hand gas tank connection due to the flames around that portion. I attempted to smother the flames in the cockpit by the use of a fire extinguisher. I lowered both windows in the pilot's cockpit and placed the ship in a nose high side slip which partly cleared the fumes and kept most of the flames out of the cockpit. A normal <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>landing</b> was made in a corn field approximately three miles east of the Municipal Airport at Goodland, Kansas. I left the ship by the front exit and after having removed the passengers, I then removed the mail and luggage {{with the exception of a}} small amount of personal effects contained in the pilot's cockpit. Contained in the luggage compartment there was approximately 124 pounds of express which was removed.|$|E

50|$|In June, 2009, Griffin {{had moved}} {{his career in}} another direction, signing up with the Nicaraguan League (ACB) Jaguares De La UAM. In regular season action, Griffin {{averaged}} 18 points and 8 rebounds while shooting 49 percent from the floor, and over 40 percent behind the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> arc. Once the playoff semifinals started where the Jaguares faced defending champs U de M, Griffin averaged 28 points and 8 rebounds while shooting 47 percent {{from the floor and}} over 62 percent from <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>land.</b> However, his side lost the playoff series 4-3.|$|R
50|$|Rautins would {{continue}} his tear against Seton Hall (26 points on 7-10 shooting from <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>land),</b> South Florida (14, 4-8) and DePaul (17, 5-10). In those four games, Rautins would hit a combined 25 3-pointers at a 57 percent clip. Other highlights included Rautins 20 points, and six 3-pointers in the epic six overtime game against Connecticut in the Big East tournament. Rautins made a crucial 3-pointer {{in the final}} seconds of the third overtime, forcing a fourth. Rautins also made the go-ahead 3-pointer in the sixth overtime, giving Syracuse their first lead since the end of regulation to help lead to the historic win.|$|R
5000|$|Matt Thomas was {{a crucial}} member of the Lakers summer league. He is often {{regarded}} as an elite Sharpshooter who is deadly from <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>land.</b> Thomas first started making an impact the Summer League playoffs bracket when he scored 10 points versus the 76ers in a 103-102 win. He went 2/3 from three. Thomas had a breakout game versus the Nets as he dropped 17 with 6/9 shooting and 3/4 from three in a 115-106 win versus the Nets. Matt Thomas continued his excellence as he scored 20, and extremely high field goal percentage as he shot 7/10 FG and 6 for 7 from three (85.7%) in a 108-98 win.|$|R
50|$|The players {{control the}} two jetters. After referee Don Lastra blows his whistle {{to begin the}} cycle, the first lap leads the jetters to the Wall of Death (the heavily banked curve of the jetwave). They get one <b>point</b> for getting <b>three</b> steps in the between the two red lines and <b>three</b> <b>points</b> for getting above the top line. On the jet jump, they get <b>three</b> <b>points</b> for <b>landing</b> beyond the 12-foot marker and one <b>point</b> for <b>landing</b> {{in front of the}} line. The rest of the cycle awards one point passing or {{fighting}} off opposing blockers (who come back to haunt the jetters afterwards) and <b>three</b> <b>points</b> for lapping or fighting off the opposing jetter. The team with the most points wins.|$|R
50|$|Going to the Conference Semifinals, the Pacers {{came off}} a tough seven-game {{series against the}} Hawks while the Wizards were able to {{dispatch}} the Bulls in five games, giving them {{plenty of time to}} rest and prepare for the second round. In Game 1, the Wizards held a 13-point lead after one quarter and kept that momentum to take the series opener and the home court advantage away from the Pacers. Trevor Ariza led the Wizards' charge with 22 points including 6/6 from <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>land.</b> After being criticized once again for having a 0-point and 0-rebound performance in Game 1, Roy Hibbert broke loose for 28 points as he led the Pacers to a series-tying 86-82 victory over the Wizards. In Game 3, the Pacers' early season form returned, holding the Wizards to only 63 points and 33 percent shooting as they blew them out to take a 2-1 series lead.|$|R

To this end, <b>three</b> <b>landing</b> <b>points</b> were selected; however, in the end only the diversionary force from No.3 Commando, consisting of only 40 men, was able to land successfully, landing at a beach in Telegraph Bay {{just west of the}} Jerbourg Peninsula at 00:50 on 15 July, despite a faulty compass on the launch.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{account is}} of a tavern keeper, William Earle {{who was born}} in 1690, and flourished in the early 18th century. Prior to the American Revolution, the Three Pigeons Tavern was well known in the area during the colonial era where the community in New Durham was located, {{as can be seen in}} the map below printed 1776. Along with Snake Hill and Priors' Mills, Three Pigeons made up one of <b>three</b> prominent <b>land</b> <b>points</b> in Hudson County; with the Three Pigeons namely being a site well referenced in describing proximity at the time as well. It has been said that General Washington had also spent time at the Three Pigeons, likely before and during the years of the revolution.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, the BC Development Corporation {{bought the}} Jack <b>Point</b> <b>land</b> from private owners, and the Duke <b>Point</b> <b>land</b> from then McMillan Bloedel, and then {{levelled}} and serviced the lands {{to create the}} industrial park, three sawmill sites, and a 2 berth shipping terminal (only one berth was built). The 350 acre Duke Point Industrial Park was built by the BC Development Corporation from 1980 to 1983, under the Federal/Provincial Industrial Subsidiary Agreement (“TIDSA”). The Duke Point Ferry Terminal was built on Provincial land outside the TIDSA lands, and sits on land that was originally called “Jack Point”, but which was amalgamated with the Duke <b>Point</b> <b>Land.</b> Originally, the Jack <b>Point</b> <b>land</b> was separated from the Duke <b>Point</b> <b>land</b> by Canoe Pass, that connected the Northumberland Channel to {{the waters of the}} Nanaimo Estuary.|$|R

40|$|We {{estimated}} timber investment {{returns for}} the principal exotic and selected native plantation {{species in the}} Southern Cone of Latin America and in the Southern United States. Exotic eucalypts plantations in South America were most profitable, with internal rates of returns (IRRs) of about 13 % to 24 %, followed by exotic loblolly pine, with IRRs of about 9 % to 17 %. Average loblolly pine plantation returns in the U. S. South were less profitable, with an IRR of about 9. 5 %, and natural forest management in the South had IRRs of 4 % to 8 %. Subtropical native species plantations of the best aracauria and nothofagus species had reasonable financial returns, with IRRs ranging from 5 % to 13 %. Subtropical or tropical native forests had fewer commercial timber species, and had much lower growth rates and returns. Their IRRs were less than 4 %, or even negative for unmanaged stands. State subsidy payments for forest plantations or for timber stand improvements increased IRRs about two to <b>three</b> percentage <b>points</b> and <b>land</b> expectation values (LEVs) about $ 300 to $ 500 per ha, but are less available and less useful for applications in natural stands, which have less initial investment costs.
