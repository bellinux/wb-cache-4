Director Kim Manners urged McCrane {{to play the role of}} Betts with [...] "emotional conviction."

2500|$|The {{northern}} end of the ranges are home to two curiosities: a tiny township {{by the name of}} Yongala, familiar to all South Australians for commonly being the coldest place in the State (being a hundred kilometres inland, and on a somewhat elevated plateau as with much of the Mid North). The other curiosity is a locality near Orroroo called [...] "Magnetic Hill". The name stems from a reputation <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> your car there, it will roll uphill.|$|E

"I {{have been}} {{particularly}} fascinated, for example, {{by the work of}} a remarkable man called Allan Savory, in Zimbabwe and other semi arid areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive.

60|$|I do {{not wish}} to be insulting, but I firmly believe <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> an average tow-line, and {{stretched}} it out straight across the middle of a field, and then turned your back on it for thirty seconds, that, when you looked round again, you would find that it had got itself altogether in a heap {{in the middle of the}} field, and had twisted itself up, and tied itself into knots, and lost its two ends, and become all loops; and it would <b>take</b> <b>you</b> a good half-hour, sitting down there on the grass and swearing all the while, to disentangle it again.|$|R

I heard how your son's death had changed you, and thought that, maybe, you would like to take his daughter; but, before {{bringing}} her to you, I thought she should have a better education than I had time to give her, and that she should be placed with a lady, so <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> her, <b>you</b> need not be ashamed of her manners.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{course we}} knew about expectations. Muth was a {{colleague}} of ours the early 1960s. We just didn't think it was important. The hypothesis {{was more or less}} buried during the '60s. Arrow used it in his paper on learning-by-doing in the '60s. Prescottand I used it in that paper of ours on investment.

60|$|Next, {{what are}} the striped pears? They are sea-anemones, and of a species only lately well known, Sagartia viduata, the snake-locked anemone (Pl. V. Fig. 3(5)).

2500|$|Initially, {{the entire}} {{principal}} cast of The Original Series {{was featured in}} the film's first script, but only three members appeared in the film: William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, James Doohan as Montgomery Scott, and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov. Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley declined to appear as Spock and Leonard McCoy. Nimoy (who was offered the job of directing the film) felt that there were story problems with the script and that Spock's role was extraneous—"I said to everybody concerned [...] <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> {{the dozen or so}} lines of Spock dialog and simply changed the name of the character, nobody would notice the difference."

60|$|Now, {{that the}} others also may be transparent, though they do not appear so to the Microscope, may be made {{probable}} by this Experiment: <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> ammel that is almost opacous, and grind it very well on a Porphyry, or Serpentine, the small particles will by reason of their flaws, appear perfectly opacous; and that 'tis the flaws that produce this opacousness, may be argued from this, that particles of the same Ammel much thicker if unflaw'd will appear somewhat transparent even to the eye; and from this also, that the most transparent and clear Crystal, if heated in the fire, and then suddenly quenched, so that it be all over flaw'd, will appear opacous and white.|$|E
6000|$|But let me dismiss this {{question}} now, and, in conclusion, {{let me say}} that you may go away with it as my mature conviction, that Mr. Darwin's work is the greatest contribution which has been made to biological science since the publication of the [...] "Regne Animal" [...] of Cuvier, and since that of the [...] "History of Development," [...] of Von Baer. I believe that if you strip it of its theoretical part it still remains one of the greatest encyclopaedias of biological doctrine that any one man ever brought forth; and I believe <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> it as the embodiment of an hypothesis, it is destined to be the guide of biological and psychological speculation for the next three or four generations.|$|E

60|$|They {{say that}} young men fresh from college are pretty {{positive}} {{about what they}} know.

I am specially convinced of this from the case of my friend Colonel Hogshead, a portly, choleric gentleman who made a fortune in the cattle-trade out in Wyoming, and who, in his later days, has acquired a chronic idea that the plays of Shakespeare are the one subject upon which he is most qualified to speak personally.|$|E
