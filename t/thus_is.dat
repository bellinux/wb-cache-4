5|$|In {{synthetic}} diamond {{grown by}} the high-pressure high-temperature synthesis or chemical vapor deposition, defects with symmetry lower than tetrahedral align to {{the direction of}} the growth.

5|$|Plutonium also {{exhibits}} valence states {{between 3 and 7}} inclusive, and <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> chemically {{similar to}} neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures {{as low as}} 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range–more than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)–and because its {{population}} is increasing, rather than declining by 30% over ten years or three generations and <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> not warranted a vulnerable rating. Also, the population size of the mallard is very large.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Tug Argan was a land {{battle between}} {{forces of the}} British Empire and Italy which took place on 11–15 August 1940 in what was British Somaliland (later {{independent}} and renamed Somalia).

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control.

5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E

After losing a lawsuit filed against it by Hungry Jack's ownership, the company ceded the territory to its franchisee.
