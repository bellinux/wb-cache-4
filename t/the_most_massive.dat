5|$|The Eta Carinae {{star system}} is {{currently}} one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> {{that can be}} studied in great detail. Until recently Eta Carinae {{was thought to be}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> single star, but the system's binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from Eta Carinae A and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed as dust from the great eruption finally clears.|$|E
5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the life span of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 200 {{million light-years}} from Earth with a {{redshift}} of 0.016 is Abell 3627; {{also called the}} Norma Cluster, {{it is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> galaxy clusters known to exist, at ten times the average cluster mass. Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive object that is pulling the Local Group, the Virgo Supercluster, and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.|$|E
500|$|Among known {{bodies of}} the Solar System, Eris is <b>the</b> ninth <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> {{directly}} orbiting <b>the</b> Sun, and <b>the</b> 16th <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> overall, because seven moons are more massive than all known dwarf planets. It is also the largest which {{has not yet been}} visited by a spacecraft. Eris was measured to be [...] in diameter. Eris' mass is about 0.27% of the Earth mass, about 27% more than dwarf planet Pluto, although Pluto is slightly larger by volume.|$|R
5000|$|Building on Barnes's earlier work, Michael Grant of the University of Colorado at Boulder re-examined the clone, {{named it}} [...] "Pando", and claimed {{it to be}} <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> {{organism}} in 1992.|$|R

5|$|Eris (minor-planet {{designation}} 136199 Eris) is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> and second-largest dwarf planet {{known in}} the Solar System. Eris was discovered in January 2005 by a Palomar Observatory-based team led by Mike Brown, and its identity was verified later that year. In September 2006 it was named after Eris, the Greek goddess of strife and discord.|$|E
5|$|Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets {{primarily}} {{composed of}} {{hydrogen and helium}} and are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> planets in the Solar System. Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses, is the largest planet in the Solar System, and Saturn is one third as massive, at 95 Earth masses.|$|E
5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} monument commemorating Perry is the Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial at Put-In-Bay, Ohio. Its [...] tower, <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> Doric column, was constructed by a multi-state commission between 1912 and 1915.|$|R

5000|$|BAT99-98 {{is a star}} in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It {{is located}} near the R136 cluster in the 30 Doradus nebula. At 226 [...] and 5,000,000 [...] it is <b>the</b> second <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> and <b>the</b> fifth <b>most</b> {{luminous}} star known.|$|R
5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Eris (68AU average) is {{the largest}} known {{scattered}} disc object, and caused a debate about what constitutes a planet, because it is 25% more massive than Pluto and about the same diameter. It is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> of the known dwarf planets. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. Like Pluto, its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an aphelion of 97.6 AU, and steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane.|$|E
5|$|Four of Norma's {{brighter}} stars—Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta—make up {{a square}} {{in the field of}} faint stars. Gamma2 Normae is the brightest star with an apparent magnitude of 4.0. Mu Normae {{is one of the most}} luminous stars known, with a luminosity half- to one million times that of the Sun. Four star systems are known to harbour planets. The Milky Way passes through Norma, and the constellation contains eight open clusters visible to observers with binoculars. The constellation also hosts Abell3627, also called the Norma Cluster, one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> galaxy clusters known.|$|E

5|$|Lying {{within the}} bounds of the {{constellation}} is the gigantic Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion light years away, making it one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> galaxy clusters. It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars a year. Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012. Located around 7.2 billion light years away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images.|$|E
5|$|Messier 87 (also {{known as}} Virgo A or NGC 4486, and {{generally}} abbreviated to M87) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy {{in the constellation}} Virgo. One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> galaxies in the local universe, it is notable for its large population of globular clusters—M87 contains about 12,000 compared to the 150–200 orbiting the Milky Way—and its jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1,500 parsecs (4,900 light-years), travelling at relativistic speed. It {{is one of the}} brightest radio sources in the sky, and is a popular target for both amateur astronomy observations and professional astronomy study.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus coexisted {{with fellow}} large theropods Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus {{in both the}} United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had {{different}} ecological niches, based on anatomy {{and the location of}} fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from Allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), {{and the fact that it}} was among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged.|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} monument commemorating Perry is the Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial at Put-In-Bay, Ohio. Its 352 ft. (107 m) tower, <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> Doric column, was constructed by a multi-state commission between 1912 and 1915.|$|R

DE431 (JPL small-body perturber ephemeris: SB431-BIG16) better models the gravitational perturbations {{of the planets}} and includes <b>the</b> 16 <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> main-belt asteroids.|$|R
5|$|As objects {{increasingly}} {{closer in}} size to Pluto were discovered in the region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified {{as one of the}} Kuiper belt objects, just as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{peoples of}} early Iron Age Scotland, {{particularly}} {{in the north and}} west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 to 300 with the most imposing structures having been created around the 2ndcentury. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> constructions that date from this time are the circular broch towers. On average, the ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed 6.5m (21ft) in height. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland. Despite extensive research, their purpose {{and the nature of the}} societies that created them are still a matter of debate.|$|E
5|$|There are 69 known moons of Jupiter. This gives Jupiter {{the largest}} number of moons with {{reasonably}} stable orbits of any planet in the Solar System. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> of the moons are the four Galilean moons, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. From the end of the 19th century, dozens of much smaller Jovian moons have been discovered and have received the names of lovers or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 65 moons and its rings together comprising just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass.|$|E

5|$|There are {{approximately}} 460 globular clusters {{associated with the}} Andromeda Galaxy. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> of these clusters, identified as Mayall II, nicknamed Globular One, has a greater luminosity than any other known globular cluster in the Local Group of galaxies. It contains several million stars, and is about twice as luminous as Omega Centauri, the brightest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. Globular One (or G1) has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary globular. As a result, some consider G1 to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by Andromeda in the distant past. The globular with the greatest apparent brightness is G76 which {{is located in the}} south-west arm's eastern half.|$|E
5|$|The {{action has}} been {{described}} as inconclusive by British historian C. Northcote Parkinson as neither side could achieve a decisive result. Parkinson is also scathing of his criticism of both Clark and Waller, accusing them of failing to properly to prepare for battle or effectively manoeuvere their ship under fire. During the battle neither side had actually sought a decisive result, both unwilling to risk damage which would jeopardise their mission. Sercey's orders were to raid British trade routes, not to engage heavy warships and suffer the consequent damage: the battle severely curtailed his opportunities to prey on British merchant shipping in the East Indies during 1796. Lucas sought to block Sercey's passage through the Malacca Straits, but was aware that his ships, though large and powerful, were outnumbered and outgunned in the engagement, particularly given the size of the main French line, composed of ships with batteries of 18-pounder long guns and including Forte, one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>massive</b> frigates then at sea. William James considers that had the winds been more favourable Lucas {{might have been able to}} cut off and capture at least two French frigates, but had Sercey attempted a boarding action against the ships of the line his more numerous crews would probably have successfully seized them.|$|E
