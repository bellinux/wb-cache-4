Nhu then decided to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided to counteract him. The other generals were still suspicious of Đính, fearing he would betray them. Having discovered that Nhu was trying to use him to trap <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> sure which side he was really on, they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow the Ngô brothers.|$|E
25|$|Landlords opt for {{sharecropping}} {{to avoid}} the administrative costs and shirking that occurs on plantations and haciendas. It is preferred to cash tenancy because cash tenants take all the risks, and any harvest failure will hurt <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> the landlord. Therefore, they tend to demand lower rents than sharecroppers.|$|E

Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> overwork them.|$|E

Many people in the southern part opposed the new government, but several prominent people refused to lead a counterrevolution. Mariano Chávez, a wealthy young relative of Armijo's, proposed him for the position and Armijo accepted.

25|$|In the Anguttara Nikaya (5:33), Buddha tells future wives {{that they}} should be obedient to their husbands, please <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> make them angry through their own desires. Furthermore, the Buddha offers advice to married women in the Anguttara Nikaya (7:59; IV 91-94), from the Pali (Theravada) canon, where he tells of seven types of wives—the first three types are destined for unhappiness, while the last four, as they are imbued with long term self-control, are destined to be happy. These latter wives are characterised as caretakers (motherly-wife), companions (friend-wife) and submissives (sister-wife and slave-wife)—the Buddha thus {{endorsed}} a variety of types of wives within marriage.|$|E

500|$|The {{internal}} {{classification of}} pterosaurs {{has historically been}} difficult, because there were many gaps in the fossil record. Starting from the 21st century, new discoveries are now filling in these gaps and giving a better picture {{of the evolution of}} pterosaurs. Traditionally, they were organized into two suborders: the Rhamphorhynchoidea, a [...] "primitive" [...] group of long-tailed pterosaurs, and the Pterodactyloidea, [...] "advanced" [...] pterosaurs with short tails. However, this traditional division has been largely abandoned. Rhamphorhynchoidea is a paraphyletic (unnatural) group, since the pterodactyloids evolved directly from <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> from a common ancestor, so, with the increasing use of cladistics, it has fallen out of favor among most scientists.|$|E

Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: [...] "We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of 1987.... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... ecause we bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement {{and we can do}} what we like with <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> break any laws." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{this time}} moves were afoot to prevent {{cancellation}} of matches {{by creating a}} new competition with a [...] "fixity of fixtures". The brainchild of Aston Villa's William McGregor, the competition became known as The Football League. Sudell himself suggested the name [...] "Football League", {{as an alternative to}} McGregor's suggestion, [...] "Association Football Union". Plans to create the competition had been ongoing for a period of months without Preston's involvement, but as the most skilful team McGregor was keen to interest them. Once involved, Sudell was eager for the embryonic League to assert primacy in relation to other competitions, joining with J. J. Bentley to propose that [...] "The clubs forming the League shall support each other and bind themselves to carry out in the strictest sense the arrangements for matches between <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> allow them to be cancelled on account of any cup competition or other matches". Sudell was more financially minded than the egalitarian McGregor, and urged the League to dispense with proposals for equal sharing of gate money and residential requirements for players.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

That, we suppose, is enough to constitute a small step forward". Kate Brandli of Blogcritics said [...] "Bossy" [...] "is not nearly as good or as catchy as Miss Lohan's previous musical attempts", while commenting that its lyrical content [...] "is an obvious reflection on Miss Lohan's relationship with the paparazzi. As Miss Lohan sings in the lyrics, she does what she wants, she controls <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> vice versa. Unfortunately, Miss Lohan's logic is not entirely correct—neither party {{has the authority to}} boss the other around. That is, sadly, the price of fame these days—once people want in, they want total access and exposure. With some individual's antics, like Miss Lohan and Britney Spears, it is difficult to garner sympathy for them". [...] "Bossy" [...] reached number 77 on the Canadian Hot 100, [...] and became Lohan's first song from her entire career to reach number one on the United States' Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. The song also managed to peak on the Global Dance Tracks component chart.|$|E

500|$|William J. Bell {{had created}} the {{character}} of Phillip Chancellor III in 1976, and he remained {{a vital part of}} the soap opera's storylines until his death onscreen in 1989. In 2007, Latham rewrote Chancellor's birth by establishing that Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), Jill's enemy and Phillip Chancellor II's wife, switched their child with another hours after his birth; the character was brought back to the series as an adult named Cane Ashby, an Australian looking for his birth mother. During that time, Goddard did not want to know the real motives of his character because he did not want that to influence his performance. After the revelation that Jill was Cane's mother, his views changed, saying he [...] "now welcomed the information as it added more color to his portrayal". The initial lack of information made portraying Cane difficult since there was an amount of ambiguity over whether he was a good, bad, or mediocre character. The ambiguity deepened when Goddard read the script revealing that a DNA test performed for Jill and Cane came back negative. He stated that he had never asked Latham [...] "what was going on" [...] with the storyline, but told her that he could [...] "play anything he needed to". A second DNA test later confirmed Cane as Jill's son. Goddard also said it was [...] "too good to be true" [...] for Cane to be Jill's son, adding that, [...] "But, down the road you realize these people actually do care about you, that you can reciprocate that care. For Cane, he's had so much time without them it's pointless to have the time with <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> enjoying it." [...] Though the maternity question was answered, more ambiguity about Cane's intentions appeared as the character received a phone call from his uncle Langley that hinted about Cane scheming against Jill and Katherine. The original intent of the call was to show that Cane wanted what was owed to him after being given away as an infant. The writers changed directions after the popularity of the character grew. Goddard said he felt the phone call was resolved within the story when Cane sent money to his uncle as part of taking care of him.|$|E
