40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a set of}} hypertext linking features that are essential for supporting critical discussion and document annotation, but are missing from the Web. An implementation of these features called "CritLink" enables users to attach annotations to any location on any public page, and to view the annotations on any page, without having to install any special client or server software. All <b>browsers</b> (including <b>text-only</b> <b>browsers)</b> and all operating systems are supported. Annotations can have types, can be public or private, and can annotate other annotations...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} way around these {{problems}} {{is to use}} images of text, which can then be rotated and transformed in an image editor at will, and to represent the text in those images with the alt attribute so that search engines and <b>text-only</b> <b>browsers</b> can read it properly. The use of ANSI art and box-drawing characters to manually draw sideways text {{has the advantage of}} being copiable and pastable (whereas images are not in most plain text situations), but generally creates large characters.|$|R

The markup language known as "HTML/ 2. 0 " provides for image maps. Image maps are document elements which allow clicking different areas of an image to reference different network resources, as specified by Uniform Identifier (URIs). The image map capability in HTML/ 2. 0 is limited in several ways, such as the restriction that it only works with documents served via the "HTTP " protocol, {{and the lack of}} a viable fallback for users of <b>text-only</b> <b>browsers.</b> This document specifies an extension to the HTML language, referred to as "Client...|$|R

50|$|Fahrner Image Replacement (abbreviated FIR) is a Web design {{technique}} that uses Cascading Style Sheets to replace text on a Web page {{with an image}} containing that text. It is intended to keep the page accessible to users of screen readers, <b>text-only</b> web <b>browsers,</b> or other browsers where support for images or style sheets is either disabled or nonexistent, while allowing the image to differ between styles. FIR is named for Todd Fahrner, one of the persons originally credited {{with the idea of}} image replacement.|$|R
50|$|The Agora World Wide Web email browser {{was based}} on the Line Mode Browser. The Line Mode Browser was very popular in the {{beginning}} of the web, since it was the only web browser available for all operating systems. Statistics from January 1994 show that Mosaic had quickly changed the web browser landscape and only 2% of all World Wide Web users browsed by Line Mode Browser. The new niche of <b>text-only</b> web <b>browser</b> was filled by Lynx, which made the Line Mode Browser largely irrelevant as a browser. One reason was that Lynx is much more flexible than the Line Mode Browser. It then became a test application for the libwww.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to provide {{background}} information on Indonesia for educators and {{to serve as a}} pilot project for using instructional materials presented on the World Wide Web. This Honors 499 project initially began as a curriculum packet for the secondary education level on Southeast Asia, and immediately I discovered that information on this region of the world is limited. References in textbooks at the secondary level did not give much detail beyond a one or two line mention in relation to European colonialism. As something of a last resort, I began "surfing the net" and discovered a wealth of materials that could be incorporated into the curriculum. The internet is a flexible and easy-to-use medium. Although graphical browsers add visual and sometimes audio stimulus to instruction, classrooms with <b>text-only</b> <b>browsers</b> can benefit from the information as well. The knowledge needed to begin one's own project on the Web is minimal, and the creation process becomes addictive with each new technique learned. I have begun to learn the invaluable skill of HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language) during this project. This computer language is easy to learn and would provide and invaluable way for teachers to establish directed access to the internet for their classroom lessons. With such an abundance of information a mouse-click away, I chose to highlight one country from Southeast Asia: Indonesia. What I found so appealing about Indonesia was the diversity of this island-group nation, a fact embodied in the Indonesian national motto: Unity through diversity. The information contained within this packet represents the information I compiled to use in instruction. The first section contains printed records that can be accessed from the homepage I created and established on the World Wide Web. The second part of the packet contains photocopies of materials suitable for supplemental reading. Many of the links on my Educational Links to Indonesia Homepage, located at the address: [URL] are links to pages created and established by others. Some of the links are items that I input or adapted from paper resources. I categorized the information by subject: Culture, history, environment, news and activism, food, and resources and classroom activities. By no means is this guide a complete listing of the items available on the internet; the information available on Web continues to grow each day. In respect to this continued growth the materials in this project can and should be revised and expanded continually. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The focus+context {{visualization}} technique flip zooming {{was developed}} to present data sets that can be represented as collections of linearly ordered visual elements, such as {{the pages of a}} document or a collection of images. The technique works by laying out the elements 2 -dimensionally in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom fashion that reflects the linear ordering of the elements. The user move an element to the focus by clicking on it, or by moving the focus forwards or backwards to an adjacent element in the sequence. The chosen element then zooms up to a readable size, while the other elements shrink accordingly. Since the linear ordering is preserved, users have access to both a detailed view of one element and an overview of the remaining elements presented in the correct sequence. Flip zooming has been implemented in a number of prototypes, including a <b>text-only</b> web <b>browser,</b> an image browser, and a browser for hierarchically ordered image collections. During the course of the implementations, user experience motivated a move from a spacepreserving layout strategy (i. e. filling the display with as much information as possible) to a place-preserving one (i. e. trying to maintain the positions of visual elements as far as possible). Currently, the most promising application area for flip zooming is for use in devices with small displays, e. g. hand-held computers. ...|$|R
