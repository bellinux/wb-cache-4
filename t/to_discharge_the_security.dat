However, the parliamentary budget committee decided that it could not fulfill this duty with regard to the 1996 budget until points concerning the reduction of fraud in the transport system had been clarified. For six months, the debate raged, with Green initially supporting <b>the</b> campaign <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>the</b> budget (whilst calling for more radical change), but only after a group of specialists that included two senior Socialist MEPs announced {{that there had been a}} slight improvement.

50|$|The {{simplified}} circuit shown has a well-deserved {{reputation for}} being dangerous, because, in some applications, the capacitor can retain a lethal charge after the AC power source is removed. If supplying a dangerous voltage, a practical circuit would include a reliable way <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>the</b> capacitor safely. If the normal load cannot be guaranteed to perform this function, perhaps {{because it can be}} disconnected, the circuit should include a bleeder resistor connected as close as practicable across the capacitor. This resistor should consume a current large enough <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>the</b> capacitor in a reasonable time, but small enough to minimize unnecessary power waste.|$|R
