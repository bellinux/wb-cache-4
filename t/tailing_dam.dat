40|$|This paper {{may be of}} {{particular}} interest to the readers as it provides a new environmental risk assessment system for phosphogypsum <b>tailing</b> <b>dams.</b> In this paper, we studied the phosphogypsum <b>tailing</b> <b>dams</b> which include characteristics of the pollution source, environmental risk characteristics and evaluation requirements to identify the applicable environmental risk assessment methods. Two analytical methods, that is, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy logic, were used to handle the complexity of the environmental and nonquantitative data. Using our assessment method, different risk factors can be ranked according to their contributions to the environmental risk, thereby allowing the calculation of their relative priorities during decision making. Thus, environmental decision-makers can use this approach to develop alternative management strategies for proposed, ongoing, and completed PG <b>tailing</b> <b>dams...</b>|$|R

The <b>tailing</b> <b>dam</b> at the gold processing plant broke and [...] 70 tons of toxic cyanide and heavy metal-laced waste water escaped into the River Tisza and into Hungary, making its way into the Danube and affecting Romania, Hungary, Ukraine, Serbia, and Bulgaria. More than 1,400 tons of fish, numerous eagles, storks and otters died. Scientists fear the release may have led to the ultimate extinction of at least five fish species. Despite the accident's happening in Romania, much of the adverse effects were suffered in Hungary.

5000|$|The town of Ararat {{is home to}} the [...] "Ararat Cement" [...] {{factory and}} the [...] "Geopromining Gold" [...] {{recovery}} plant. However, there is a major controversy over the pollution and the toxic waste caused by the various enterprises based on the manufacturing of building materials and the gold processing facility in the town of Ararat. The Ararat Gold Recovery extracts gold from the raw ore sent from the gold mine in Sotk located 20 km east of Lake Sevan. About 0.46 grams of gold is extracted from each ton of sand unearthed at the mines. The extraction process involves first pulverizing the raw material, and then filtering out the gold using a cyanide nitrate chemical process. The soupy byproduct of the cyanide nitrate chemical process is both toxic and radioactive and collects in a <b>tailing</b> <b>dam.</b> There have been numerous incidents of animals dying near and around the plant's area. [...] Also, within the years 2003 and 2008, there have been at least 10 accidents at the plant, some of which have resulted in the discharge of the cyanide soup into neighboring agricultural lands and fisheries, killing off cows and fish stock.|$|E
30|$|During decades, tons of {{valuable}} coal particles are accumulated at <b>tailing</b> <b>dams</b> of washing plants due to different problems which were associated by old technologies {{and complexity of}} coal processing. On the other hands, demanding growth for high quality coal products from various industries (power plants, cement, paper production and sponge iron units) and decreasing the number of high grade raw coal deposits (Chehreh Chelgani et al. 2011 a, b; Royaei et al. 2012; Chehreh Chelgani and Makaremi 2013; Dey et al. 2015; Matin and Chehreh Chelgani 2016) have been complicated coal beneficiation methods and subjected enormous volume of coal particles to wastes (<b>tailing</b> <b>dams).</b> Coal wastes typically {{can be used in}} different industries such as building and road making; however, these applications are limited and a huge amount of coal particles are accumulated as dump sand pulps in the <b>tailing</b> <b>dams.</b> These dams can be a source of several environmental and economic problems (Leonhard and Schieder 1990; Valcarce and Canibano 1991; Alonso et al. 1999; Dong et al. 2008).|$|R
30|$|Recovery of coal {{particles}} from <b>tailing</b> <b>dams</b> by using various processing techniques {{is a potential}} method to overcome these problems. Preparation of coal in washing plants employs number of circuits (in parallel) for cleaning operation and each circuit is designed to optimally process a specific size range of coal particles (Cierpisz 2017). Thus, the implementation for recovery of coal {{particles from}} <b>tailing</b> <b>dams</b> has to depend on methods which used for coal washing and the size distribution of particles (Bu et al. 2017). The dissemination of fine ash-forming minerals in the coal structure has a critical challenge in recovery of coal particles from <b>tailing</b> <b>dams.</b> Finding appropriate methods to decrease ash content of coal tailing is essential for upgrading quality of products. Gravity (jigging, tabling or spiral) and flotation separation are typical beneficiation techniques {{that can be used}} to recover coal particles (Dey et al. 2013; Taha et al. 2017; Chehreh Chelgani et al. 2018). It was well understood that coal’s organic and inorganic (ash) parts have different floatability rate for example hydrophobicity of macerals can decrease in the following order examined Eastern Kentucky coal and arranged the macerals according to decreasing of floatability in order of pseudovitrinite (high Rmax) > pseudovitrinite (low Rmax) > vitrinite (high Rmax) > vitrinite (low Rmax) = micrinite = exinite = semifusinite > resinite > fusinite (Jorjani et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2017).|$|R

40|$|A {{considerable}} number of <b>tailing</b> <b>dams</b> is {{scattered all over the}} abandoned mining districts of Sardinia. Some of them are actually huge and represent dangerous sources of contaminant diffusion in soil and underground water. Due to the volume of the basins, the best remediation strategy appears to be the construction of low permeability barriers both at the basin bottom and along its perimeter, aiming at the hydraulic insulation of contaminants. Barriers can be realised by consolidating the contaminated material at the bottom and at the perimeter of the basin in order to obtain the reduction of the material porosity and, consequently, an effective decrease of its permeability. Electroosmotic techniques {{can be used as a}} mean to induce consolidation in selected volumes of accumulated mineral waste. The application of an electric potential difference between two points in a saturated soil produces, in fact, a hydraulic flow that induces faster material consolidation. The paper deals with the environmental safety conditions of the abandoned <b>tailing</b> <b>dams</b> and illustrates the experimental apparatus able to simulate the consolidation process under simultaneous application of a static load and an electric potential difference. The final results of the experimental activity are presented and discussed in order to evaluate the applicability of the proposed technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of the operation of a <b>tailing</b> <b>dam</b> is affected by reservoir water level, phreatic line, and mechanical parameters of tailings.

Multitemporal analysis was carried out through the study of aerial photographs {{which resulted in the}} production of three 1 : 10. 000 land cover maps.
