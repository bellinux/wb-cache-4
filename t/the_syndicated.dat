5|$|In 2001, Millionaire {{producers}} {{began work}} on a half-hour daily syndicated version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea; however, <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002–03 season. <b>The</b> <b>syndicated</b> series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor, however, {{due in part to}} worries that stemmed from a decision made by one of its affiliates.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>syndicated</b> version's {{potential}} contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, {{are required to}} pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who fail the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> program; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they are given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E
5000|$|Criticism and {{opposition}} to <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate</b> came from managers, agents, and actors alike. At first, it was the managers that attempted {{to put a stop}} to <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate,</b> but they failed almost as soon as they began. A more serious threat to <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate</b> came in <b>the</b> form of rebellion from actors. The most prominent actors to take a stand were Nat Goodwin, Francis Wilson, and Richard Mansfield. Others who took a stand against <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate</b> were James A. Herne, James O'Neill. One actress, Minnie Maddern Fiske, became very well known for her opposition of <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate.</b> She became famous for her roles in plays by Ibsen, Shaw, and Wilde. The voices of the actors were much louder than any previous opposition. However, the fight was a very short one as Nat Goodwin, the original leader of the rebellion, was [...] "captured" [...] by <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate.</b> <b>The</b> others agreed to <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate's</b> terms very soon after.|$|R
50|$|Early in 1910, several {{prominent}} actors and playwrights defected from <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate</b> to <b>the</b> Shuberts. The fight of the Shubert brothers gave smaller independent theatres {{the motivation to}} take a stand against <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate,</b> and by April, the New England area had completely declared independence from <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate.</b> In May of that year, 1,200 small town theatre owners joined together to form the National Theatre Owners Association.

5|$|GSN {{acquired}} the rerun {{rights to the}} U.S. Millionaire in August 2003.

5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} {{version of}} Wheel premiered on September 19, 1983, {{preceded by a}} series of episodes taped on location at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio. From its debut, <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart. The show came from humble beginnings: King World chairmen Roger, Michael, and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show, and since they could not find affiliates for <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> Wheel in New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days. Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning, but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it, and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households. Soon,Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated syndicated show, and {{at the beginning of the}} 1984–85 season, Griffin followed up on the show's success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy!, hosted by Alex Trebek. <b>The</b> <b>syndicated</b> success of Wheel and Jeopardy! siphoned ratings from the period's three longest-running and most popular game shows, Tic-Tac-Dough, The Joker's Wild, and Family Feud, to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986. At this point, Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history, and at the peak of the show's popularity, over 40 million people were watching five nights per week. The series, along with companion series Jeopardy!, remained the most-watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011. The program has become America's longest-running syndicated game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication, second to the version of The Price Is Right which began airing in 1972. <b>The</b> <b>syndicated</b> Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans, and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants.|$|E

5|$|The network {{version was}} {{originally}} hosted by Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford, with Charlie O'Donnell as its announcer. O'Donnell left in 1980, Woolery in 1981, and Stafford in 1982. They were replaced, respectively, by Jack Clark, Pat Sajak, and Vanna White. After Clark's death in 1988, M. G. Kelly took over briefly as announcer until O'Donnell returned in 1989. O'Donnell {{remained on the}} network version until its cancellation, and continued to announce on <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> show {{until his death in}} 2010, when Jim Thornton succeeded him. Sajak left the network version in January 1989 to host his own late-night talk show, and was replaced on that version by Rolf Benirschke. Bob Goen replaced Benirschke when the network show moved to CBS, then remained as host until the network show was canceled altogether. <b>The</b> <b>syndicated</b> version has been hosted continuously by Sajak and White since its inception.|$|E

Rodman starred in Simon Sez, a 1999 action/comedy and co-starred with Tom Berenger in a 2000 action film about skydiving titled Cutaway. In 1998, he joined the cast of <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> TV show Special Ops Force, playing 'Deke' Reynolds, a flamboyant but skilled ex-Army helo pilot and demolitions expert.|$|E
5|$|Charlie O'Donnell was the program's {{first and}} longest tenured announcer. In 1980, NBC was {{discussing}} cancelling Wheel and O'Donnell {{agreed to take}} the position as announcer on The Toni Tennille Show. The network decided against the cancellation but O'Donnell decided to honor his commitment and left the series. His replacement was Jack Clark, who added <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> series to his responsibilities when it premiered in 1983 and announced for both series {{until his death in}} July 1988. Los Angeles radio personality M. G. Kelly was Clark's replacement, starting on the daytime series in August 1988 and on <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> series when its new season launched a month later. Kelly held these positions until O'Donnell was able to return to the announcer position, doing so after his duties with Barris Industries came to an end {{at the end of the}} 1988–89 television season. O'Donnell remained with the series until shortly before his death in November 2010. Don Pardo, Don Morrow, and Johnny Gilbert have occasionally served as substitute announcers.|$|E

5000|$|Components of an {{underwriting}} {{spread in}} an {{initial public offering}} (IPO) typically include the following (on a per share basis): Manager's fee, Underwriting fee—earned by members of <b>the</b> <b>syndicate,</b> and <b>the</b> Concession—earned by the broker-dealer selling the shares. The Manager would be entitled to the entire underwriting spread. A member of <b>the</b> <b>syndicate</b> is entitled to the underwriting fee and the concession.

5|$|Producers of {{the network}} version {{included}} Hampton, Rubino, Leslie Fuller, Nikki Webber, and Terrence McDonnell.

The first 65 shuffle format episodes were produced by McPaul Smith, and as of 2011, the title of producer is held by Bryan Lasseter. The network version had Ann Miller and Tiffany Trigg for its supervising producers; they were joined by Wendy Roth in the first two seasons, and by Michael Binkow in the third and final season.

[...] Those who praised <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate</b> believed that they had saved theatre by standardizing bookings. In the time prior to the formation of <b>the</b> <b>Syndicate,</b> routing of road-based companies was described as chaotic. Smaller travelling companies would find themselves in massive amounts of debt because of stiff competition.

5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} version debuted on September 10, 1984, and {{was launched}} {{in response to the}} success of <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> version of Wheel and the installation of electronic trivia games in pubs and bars.

5|$|The {{original}} executive {{producers of}} the U.S. Millionaire were British television producers Michael Davies and Paul Smith, the latter of whom undertook the responsibility of licensing Millionaire to American airwaves {{as part of his}} effort to transform the UK program into a global franchise.

Rich Sirop, who was previously a supervising producer, became the executive producer in 2010 and held that position until 2014, when he left Millionaire to hold the same position with Vieira's newly launched syndicated talk show, and was replaced by James Rowley. Vincent Rubino, who had previously been <b>the</b> <b>syndicated</b> Millionaires supervising producer for its first two seasons, served as that version's co-executive producer for the 2004–05 season, after which he was succeeded by Vieira herself, who continued to hold the title until her departure in 2013 (sharing her position with Sirop for the 2009–10 season).|$|E
