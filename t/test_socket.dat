50|$|The {{removable}} panel allows separation {{of these two}} parts and independent maintenance, and access to a <b>test</b> <b>socket</b> to determine whether line faults are in the customer's wiring or Openreach's (formerly BT's) external network.|$|E
50|$|Control {{equipment}} was based around the 'Line Replaceable Unit' (LRU) ethos {{and consisted of}} 'trays' of circuit boards and equipment arranged in two cabinets. No.1 housed just the usual circuit breakers, relays, reversers and so forth. No.2 also housed standard equipment but included the complex electronic control circuits that ultimately were the un-doing of the class. Each tray could be slid {{in and out of}} the cabinet (with the locomotive switched off) with ease and each had a test connector. Specific testers were made that simply compared the electrical signals and stimuli on the <b>test</b> <b>socket</b> with the design values. If any were not as expected, the whole tray was replaced and the locomotive was good-to-go... at least that was the theory. The use of testers plugged into the <b>test</b> <b>socket</b> removed the need for engineering staff to be competent electronic engineers (as opposed to electrical engineers which they undoubtedly were), but often faults on one tray would only show themselves in combination with faults on other trays. This led to confusing diagnostics and locomotives were often failed for long periods pending in-depth exploration of a fault. Faulty trays were sent for repair. This early attempt was bold and fundamentally sound. Electronic circuit arrangements in modern locomotives use this approach almost unchanged. Unfortunately, powerful control and computational electronics were in their infancy in 1968. Had the resources of just ten years later been available, it is arguable that Class 74 would have been a success.|$|E
40|$|Transparent <b>test</b> <b>sockets</b> {{have been}} {{available}} in various materials {{for more than ten}} years, 5, 7 but their use has not been as widespread or as routine as one would expect. Only recently has the emergence of new materials and new evalu ation techniques, as well as third-party aware ness and reimbursement, made the use of <b>test</b> or check <b>sockets</b> more appealing. The objective {{of this article is to}} present a refined technique for using <b>test</b> <b>sockets</b> and aliginate to guarantee that total contact exists between socket and stump. This technique has been developed as a standard procedure for each and every below-knee amputee fitted with a prosthesis at the University of Virginia. We consider it to be the single most important and recent technique for enhancing the fit of prostheses for our below-knee amputees.

The BeCu furnishes the best combination of electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. The probe of the <b>test</b> <b>socket</b> was designed with a BeCu cantilever. The cantilever was designed with a length of 450 ㎛, a width of 200 ㎛, a thickness of 10 ㎛, and a pitch of 650 ㎛ for 11 × 11 BGA.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for measuring topical microbicide gel dilution using optical imaging. The approach compares gel thickness measurements from fluorimetry and multiplexed low coherence interferometry in order to calculate dilution of a gel. As a microbicide gel becomes diluted at fixed thickness, its mLCI thickness measurement remains constant, while the fluorimetry signal decreases in intensity. The {{difference between the two}} measurements is related to the extent of gel dilution. These two optical modalities are implemented in a single endoscopic instrument that enables simultaneous data collection. A preliminary validation study was performed with in vitro placebo gel measurements taken in a controlled <b>test</b> <b>socket.</b> It was found that change in slope of the regression line between fluorimetry and mLCI based measurements indicates dilution. A dilution calibration curve was then generated by repeating the <b>test</b> <b>socket</b> measurements with serial dilutions of placebo gel with vaginal fluid simulant. This methodology can provide valuable dilution information on candidate microbicide products, which could substantially enhance our understanding of their in vivo functioning...|$|E

40|$|Practitioners {{have been}} {{requesting}} improvements in myoelectrodes to facilitate better client fittings. Greater sensitivity, better immunity to external interference, {{more and better}} (linear) gain adjustment and good common mode rejection are all desirable features. Mechanical changes were also needed to create more cosmetically appealing sockets. Preamplifier cases had to be small and thin and provided with electrode cables of various lengths. When LTI designed their Remote Electrode System, they addressed all of these issues. This new remote electrode system has improved performance and low-profile packaging. The CavityBack™ Electrodes are available in three sizes/shapes, so the prosthetists can choose the best for their client. In addition to the cables for <b>test</b> <b>sockets</b> and soft socket liners, cables can be adapted for snap-on attachment to roll-on silicone sleeves...|$|R
40|$|Most {{researchers}} concentrate {{their studies}} on the design, stress and pressure distributions of the prosthetic socket. A little attention is considered for the stiffness of the various materials of the prosthetic sockets. Prosthetic laminated sockets in Iraq are costly to be manufactured while polypropylene socket is relatively cheap in comparing with the laminates. Experimental study is conducted to compare the stiffness of five prosthetic sockets made of different materials. Compression, three point flexural and tensile tests are implemented by the Testometric machine. The laminate sockets give better results in compression than polypropylene. Polypropylene gives good results in bending compared with the laminate sockets. When the socket loads are mainly in compression i. e. the low activity level patients, it seems {{that any of the}} <b>tested</b> <b>sockets</b> could be used, however, when the load will be not only in compression but in flexion as well i. e. high activity patients, socket No. 1 and 5 could be use...|$|R
30|$|As {{well as we}} know, the {{stoichiometric}} NiO crystal is an insulator, however, typical NiO {{exhibits a}} reasonable electrical conductivity due to nickel vacancies or interstitial oxygen atoms in NiO crystal (p-type semiconductor) [31]. As-synthesized Zn-doped NiO film exhibited oxygen-rich stoichiometry (see Fig.  5 A 2 –C 2), such as the atomic ratio O/Ni of 0  mol% Zn-NiO was about 51.16 / 48.84. Ammonia-sensing devices based on doped NiO films were fabricated via connecting the gas-sensing materials to the <b>testing</b> <b>sockets</b> using homemade silver paste combined with subsequent sputtering pure Au, as shown in Fig.  2. In our testing experiments, the conductance between {{the positive and negative}} electrodes was measured with a precision semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent 4156 C) to investigate the response of gas-sensing devices. The sensor response is defined via the equation (ΔG/G 0 [*]=[*](G–G 0)/G 0), where G 0 and G are the conductance of sensing films when exposed to the air and target gas with 25  % of relative humidity, respectively. The response time (τresponse) and recovery time (τrecovery) are defined as the time needed to reach 90  % of the final steady state conductance upon exposure to the testing gas and air, respectively [32].|$|R

In this paper, I will demonstrate a <b>test</b> <b>socket</b> chip for easily testing large array size FPA by measuring dark currents of IR sensors. A calibration technique of leakage current is applied to certify the correctness of measurement. I will also show a crosscheck test scheme for efficiently testing FPA. For an array size of M by N, the testing times can be reduced from the order of M*N to M+N.

40|$|Novel spring {{contactors}} {{were designed}} and characterized for wafer-level interposer and high-speed package test system applications, especially for wafer-level packages. These contactors {{can be used}} as replacement for vertical wafer probes as well as test sockets used in the final test. The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical stainless steel spring wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the plunger and the spring. The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0. 51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional spring pins called Pogo pins used in package tests. A <b>test</b> <b>socket</b> containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows $-$ 1 -dB bandwidth of 3. 73 GHz for 0. 8 -mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by TDR, and the propagation delay was 23 ps. The electrical conduction path is through the pin and the spring, making it a reliable contact. However, the electrical path is known to be through the barrel, not the spring for the regular spring pins...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to show the {{effectiveness}} of die shrink as a package solution for memory devices. In the case of the 8 mm x 10 mm Direct Rambus DRAM device, about 350 dies can be obtained from a single 8 -inch wafer. The 85 % linear shrink (15 % shrink in both x and y-directions) allows an additional 150 dies from the same size wafer. This simple calculation explains the importance of die shrink. There are two basic requirements for the die shrink package solution. First, the footprint of the new package must be the same as that of the earlier package because a mounting board with multiple devices on it can not be changed to accommodate the footprint change of single device. Second, the <b>test</b> <b>socket</b> for the new package must be the same or compatible with minimal modification because the delivery time and expense for new sockets for test and burn-in are significant. In this paper, the CSP die shrink solution will be limited to a discussion of the µBGA ® package only. There are two different types of µBGA CSP: a package for peripheral pad die and a package for center pad die. Each type has its own package solutions for the die shrink problem. Flash, SRAM, and 64 / 72 M Direct RDRAM are devices with peripheral bonding pads. For this study, a 6 x 8 ball matrix was used. The majority of conventional DRAMs, 128 / 144 M and 256 M Direct RDRAM are devices with a center bonding pad. A 8 x 15 ball matrix with two-row depopulation was used for the case study [1]. A total of 13 package configurations were evaluated and proposed as viable design solutions. The assembly process, package material, test, and reliability are discussed for each package configuration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the integration of}} MATLAB and LabVIEW {{for the implementation of}} testing system for control panel of medium voltage switchgear. This system tests two types of sockets of control panel i. e. nonstandard socket and standard socket. The standard socket is the one who has universal wiring diagram (64 pins socket) and nonstandard socket (generally 8, 16, 24 or even 32 pins socket) is the one who‟s wiring diagram changes from panel to panel. For testing of nonstandard type of socket system needs its wiring diagram, which is to be decoded by Image processing algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The LabVIEW is central controlling element and it is also used to <b>test</b> nonstandard <b>socket</b> along with DAQ hardware. The system checks „Normally closed ‟ and „Normally open ‟ status of pin pairs of control panel mentioned in the wiring diagram in case of non standard socket while in case of standard socket there is no such need of scanning the wiring diagram as it has universal wiring diagram, so those pin pairs are already mentioned in LabVIEW those need to be checked.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} the second phase of an EPRI sponsored program to perform high cycle fatigue <b>testing</b> of <b>socket</b> welds in order to quantify the effects of various factors upon the fatigue strength. Analytical results had demonstrated that the socket weld leg size configuration can have an important effect on its high cycle fatigue resistance, with longer legs along the pipe side of the weld greatly increasing its predicted fatigue resistance. Other potentially important factors influencing fatigue life include residual stress, weld root and toe condition, pipe size, axial and radial gaps, and materials of construction. The second phase of the program <b>tested</b> 27 additional <b>socket</b> weld specimens of various designs by bolting them to a vibration shaker table and shaking them near their resonant frequencies to produce the desired stress amplitudes and cycles. Another objective of the second phase of testing was to evaluate various methods of in-situ modification or repair of socket welds, which could be used as alternatives to replacement with butt welds. The results of the program are presented which include comparisons of the various socket weld designs with standard Code socket welds, butt welds, ASME mean failure data, and recent test data published by Higuchi et al.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} results of gait analysis, timed walking <b>tests,</b> and <b>socket</b> comfort for transfemoral amputees wearing {{initially}} a Multiflex conventional prosthetic foot and then a Vari-Flex energy-storing prosthetic foot. DESIGN: Experimental crossover trial. SETTING: A regional prosthetic and amputee rehabilitation tertiary referral center in a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Six established unilateral transfemoral prosthetic users. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gait analysis, a timed walking test, and a Prosthetic Socket Fit Comfort Score for each amputee wearing the Multiflex foot and then repeated wearing the Vari-Flex foot. RESULTS: Wearing the Vari-Flex foot, our subjects walked faster in the gait lab (1. 38 +/- 0. 13 m/s, P <. 001) and took more equal step lengths at fast speed (1. 063 +/- 0. 05, P <. 05). They also had greater peak ankle dorsiflexion at push-off on the prosthetic side (18. 3 degrees +/- 4. 73 degrees, P<. 001) and 3 times as much power from the prosthetic ankle at push-off (1. 13 +/- 0. 22 W/kg, P <. 001). There were no significant changes in temporal symmetry or loading of the prosthetic limb, in the timed walking test with each foot, or in the comfort score. CONCLUSIONS: A transfemoral amputee who wears an energy-storing foot can have a more symmetric gait with regard to some measures of spatial symmetry, kinetics, and kinematics than one who wears a conventional foot. However, in this study important aspects such as more symmetric loading and comfort {{did not differ significantly}} between the 2 foot types...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{considerable}} demand for lower limb prostheses globally due to vascular disease, war, conflict, land mines and natural disasters. Conventional composite materials used for prosthetic limb sockets include acrylic resins, glass and carbon fibres, which produce harmful gasses and dust in their manufacture. To investigate the feasibility of using a renewable plant oil-based polycarbonate-polyurethane copolymer resin and plant fibre composite, instead of conventional materials, to improve safety and accessibility of prosthetic limb manufacture. Test pieces of the resin {{with a range of}} plant fibres (10. 0 % by volume) were prepared and tensile strengths were <b>tested.</b> Test <b>sockets</b> of both conventional composite materials and plant resin with plant fibres were constructed and tested to destruction. Combinations of plant resin and either banana or ramie fibres gave high tensile strengths. The conventional composite material socket and plant resin with ramie composite socket failed at a similar loading, exceeding the ISO 10328 standard. Both wall thickness and fibre-matrix adhesion {{played a significant role in}} socket strength. From this limited study we conclude that the plant resin and ramie fibre composite socket has the potential to replace the standard layup. Further mechanical and biocompatibility testing as well as a full economic analysis is required. Using readily sourced and renewable natural fibres and a low-volatile bio-resin has potential to reduce harm to those involved in the manufacture of artificial limb sockets, without compromising socket strength and benefitting clinicians working in poorer countries where safety equipment is scarce. Such composite materials will reduce environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to pursue quality standards for computer-manufacturing of prosthetic sockets for people with transtibial limb loss. Thirty-three duplicates of study participants’ normally used sockets were fabricated using central fabrication facilities. Socket-manufacturing errors were compared with clinical assessments of socket fit. Of the 33 <b>sockets</b> <b>tested,</b> 23 were deemed clinically to need modification. All 13 sockets with mean radial error (MRE) greater than 0. 25 mm were clinically unacceptable, and 11 of those were deemed in need of sizing reduction. Of the remaining 20 sockets, 5 sockets with interquartile range (IQR) greater than 0. 40 mm were deemed globally or regionally oversized and in need of modification. Of the remaining 15 sockets, 5 sockets with closed contours of elevated surface normal angle error (SNAE) were deemed clinically to need shape modification at those closed contour locations. The remaining 10 sockets were deemed clinically acceptable and not in need modification. MRE, IQR, and SNAE may serve as effective metrics to characterize quality of computer-manufactured prosthetic sockets, helping facilitate the development of quality standards for the socket manufacturing industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{realization}} of a cryptographically secured Virtual Private Network (VPN) layer was {{the topic of}} this thesis. Although the implementation was done for UNIX hosts, interoperability with other platforms was required. The prototype had to provide transparency for users and applications and state-of-the art cryptographic security. It was integrated into the CIPRESS system developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics. First an analysis of possible solutions for the cryptographic processing {{as well as for}} the network integration was carried out. Among other possible solutions, e. g. the design of a custom cryptographic protocol, the use of the well <b>tested</b> Secure <b>Socket</b> Layer (SSL) protocol was figured out to be the best choice. It is reliable, proven by a wide deployment, and provides a flexible framework for integration of new cryptographic methods. The most suitable solution for the network integration turned out to be a UNIX kernel module based on the STREAMS mechanism, which provides a well defined interface for implementing extensions to the UNIX network interface. This avoids re-implementating networked applications, since the commonly used interface is changing. Like that a STREAMS module was the right choice for a general solution. The implemented prototype consists of two applications. The STREAMS module operating on kernel level processes transfered data in two layers. The first layer called VPN-layer checks whether a connection to another host should be allowed or not and whether to encrypt the transferred data. For already established connections the VPN layer encrypts the data payload using symmetric encryption provided by SSL. The second layer is invoked when a new connection to a host dedicated to encryption is requested. It establishes an SSL secured connection to the destinated host. For configuration and certificate handling a daemon operating in user level has been deployed...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} clinically and radiographically, extraction socket healing using autologous platelet rich fibrin (PRF). Materials and methods: Twenty-four subjects needing single tooth simple extractions were selected. Twenty-four extraction sockets were divided into test group (PRF, n =  12) and control group (blood clot, n =  12). PRF was prepared with blood drawn from individuals after extraction using standard technique. PRF was placed in <b>test</b> group <b>sockets</b> followed by pressure application and figure 8 sutures. Sockets in control group were allowed to heal in the presence of blood clot and received a figure 8 suture. Ridge width was assessed using cast analysis with the help of acrylic stent and a pair of calipers. Radiographic analysis of socket surface area was performed using computer graphic software program. The clinical follow up assessments were performed at 1, 4 and 8  weeks. Collected data was assessed using ANOVA and multiple comparisons test. Results: Subjects were aged between 25 and 50 (mean 37. 8) years, including 15 females. The mean horizontal ridge width for <b>sockets</b> in the <b>test</b> group were 11. 70  ±  2. 37  mm, 11. 33  ±  2. 30  mm and 10. 97  ±  2. 33  mm at 1, 4 and 8  weeks respectively. Ridge width proportions were significantly higher among test group as compared to control group between baseline to 4 and 8  weeks respectively. The mean radiographic bone fill (RBF) percentage in the test group, was 74. 05  ±  1. 66 %, 81. 54  ±  3. 33 % and 88. 81  ±  1. 53 % at 1, 4 and 8  weeks respectively. The mean RBF was significantly higher in the test group than control group at all time intervals.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an assessment technique for testing {{the quality of}} prosthetic socket fabrication processes at computer-aided manufacturing facilities. The assessment technique is potentially useful to both facilities making sockets and companies marketing manufacturing equipment seeking to assess and improve product quality. To execute the assessment technique, an evaluator fabricates a collection of <b>test</b> models and <b>sockets</b> using the manufacturing suite under evaluation, then measures their shapes using scanning equipment. Overall socket quality is assessed by comparing socket shapes with electronic file (e-file) shapes. To characterize carving performance, model shapes are compared with e-file shapes. To characterize forming performance, socket shapes are compared with model shapes. The mean radial error (MRE), which is the average difference in radii between the two compared shapes, provides insight into sizing quality. Interquartile range (IQR), the range of radial error for the best-matched half of the points on the compared socket surfaces, provides insight into regional shape quality. The source(s) of socket shape error may be pinpointed by separately determining MRE and IQR for carving and forming. The developed assessment technique may provide a useful tool to the prosthetics community and industry to help identify problems and limitations in computer-aided manufacturing and give insight into appropriate modifications to overcome them...|$|R

Six left mandibular third incisors (n (1) / 4 6) of experimental pigs are treated with the root replicas and four contralateral incisors are used as nontreated controls (n (1) / 4 4). Two animals each were killed at 20, 40, and 60 weeks of observation periods. The mandibular jaw segments were prepared in toto for light microscopy by resin embedding and serial ground sectioning. Additionally, one Beta-TCP-treated socket at 60 weeks was thoroughly investigated by correlative light, electron microscopic and electron probe X-ray microanalysis to assess the bio-absorbability and host removal of the replica material from the implant site. The extraction wounds of the animals healed satisfactorily with very little histologically observable differences in the healing pattern of the test and control sites.

Users of mobile phones are now capable of hosting server applications from their personal devices. Whether providing services individually or in an ad hoc network setting the devices are currently not configured for defending against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks, often launched from a botnet, have existed in the space of personal computing for decades but recently have begun showing up on mobile devices. Research is done first into the required steps to develop a potential botnet on the Android platform. This includes testing for the amount of malicious traffic an Android phone would be capable of generating for a DDoS attack. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum is the need of mobile devices running networked applications to develop security against DDoS attacks. For this mobile, phones are setup, with web servers running Apache to simulate users running internet connected applications for either local ad hoc networks or serving to the internet. Testing is done for the viability of using commonly available modules developed for Apache and intended for servers as well as finding baseline capabilities of mobiles to handle higher traffic volumes. Given the unique challenge of the limited resources a mobile phone can dedicate to Apache when compared to a dedicated hosting server a new method was needed.

40|$|Background: Tooth {{extraction}} is conventionally performed {{without any}} additional tissue manipulation {{and left for}} healing by secondary intention. Maintaining hard and soft tissue volume after tooth extraction may be crucial to achieve a highly aesthetic restoration and it may also facilitate stability of the results on the long-term. Therefor, different approaches have been proposed to eliminate post-extraction ridge reduction. Today, however, no technique seems {{to be able to}} preserve the entire socket volume. Aim/Hypothesis: To evaluate histomorphometrically the influence of local administration of pamidronate, adsorbed on a deproteinized porcine bone substitute, on extraction socket healing. Material and methods: Two American Fox-hound dogs were used within this proof-of-principle study. Following endodontic treatment of the distal root of the three lower premolars, the teeth were hemisected and the mesial roots were extracted flapless. The sockets were then loosely filled, in a split-mouth fashion, with a deproteinized porcine bone substitute in particulate form (Osteobiol Gen-Os; DPB), rehydrated either with sterile saline (control) or 90 mg/ml pamidronic acid solution (Aredia; <b>test).</b> Extraction <b>sockets</b> were sealed with connective tissue punches obtained from the palate and secured with sutures. After 4 months of healing, specimens containing the sockets sites and remaining roots were retrieved and histomorphometrically evaluated. Vertical and horizontal ridge changes were evaluated comparing the section containing the remaining root and the corresponding extraction sites. Results: Histological evaluation of the sections revealed significant differences in healing patterns between test and controls. While the latter group presented complete closure of the sockets with newly formed bone, pamidronate treated sites presented with open socket entrances, only sealed with soft connective tissue. Within the socket, control sites presented with various amounts of newly formed bone and no evidence of DPB; limited amounts of bone healing were observed within test sites, that were filled with DPB mainly embedded in connective tissue. Socket (bone) wall loss in a vertical dimension showed only minor differences between tests and controls sites (buccal: – 1. 01 vs – 1. 15 mm; lingual: – 0. 92 vs – 1. 15 mm;). Horizontal bone loss, measured at a level corresponding to 3 mm below the cemento-enamel-junction (CEJ), was nearly three times higher in control sites (2. 19 1. 81 mm vs. – 0. 80 0. 91 mm;), while no differences were observed between groups at a level corresponding to 5 mm below the CEJ. Conclusion and clinical implications: Local administration of pamidronate adsorbed on a deproteinized porcine bone substitute in particulate form appeared to delay extraction socket healing, but may also reduce post-extraction dimensional changes in the alveolar ridge, in terms of horizontal bone loss. Additionally, pamidronate appears to obstruct resorption of the porcine bone substitute...|$|R
