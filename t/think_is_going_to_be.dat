500|$|In May 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Susan strikes up a friendship with local builder, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), as he fights cancer, causing problems between herself and Karl. When asked by Channel 5 about her reaction to the storyline, Woodburne said [...] "I think it's a great story. Karl and Susan are both in their 50s; they've been married together; they've raised a bunch of kids; they’ve had careers and jobs. And to use the popular term 'empty nesters', that's what they’re looking at. For him he thinks, 'That's great, terrific! More time for us; we can travel.' But for her it's, 'Well, I don't know how to be that person. I know how to be this person, who's someone who's wrangling kids and busy doing things.' But her challenge I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> to find out who she is as one half of a couple, as opposed to being the hub of a wheel." [...] The actress revealed she and Fletcher were both worried about Susan and Karl breaking up and having to work with new people, but they believe any new development for the characters is good. Woodburne told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she thought the new storyline was great and said any relationship which has been going {{for as long as the}} Kennedys' has, will have its [...] "turbulent patches". Woodburne said Susan develops a very strong attachment to Jim because of her desire to help and be needed. When asked if she was worried about revisiting old ground with the storyline, Woodburne said the new conflict, which arises within Karl and Susan's relationship, is [...] "very appropriate" [...] for the time of their lives and where they are at.|$|E

He lost five kilograms during pre-season training {{in which he}} credited his drink driving charge as a key driver behind wanting to improve his training standards. His drive during the pre-season drew public praise from his teammates including Aaron vandenBerg and Tom McDonald, and Melbourne's development and strategy coach, Brendan McCartney, who all stated they believed Oliver was the player to watch for the 2017 season as he could take his [...] "game to new heights." [...] Furthermore, former Melbourne captain, Garry Lyon, nominated Oliver as the player who could surpass all of his teammates {{in the future to}} become the club's best player by stating on SEN Breakfast's, [...] "they've got a great group of youngsters coming through ... and there's a boy called Clayton Oliver who I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better than all of them ... this guy is so good and clean in tight that I don't think most people—and I'm not putting him down—but unless you take a particular interest in the kid, you can't see how good he is." ...|$|E

The Dean had just come into the drawing-room to have his afternoon tea and a little gossip with his wife and his own sister, Mrs. Forrester, from London.

[...] He added: [...] "What we didn't know is how the story would end for each of our characters, especially the ones that we created. It's been really challenging to wrap up people's stories in a satisfying way ... We've gone down a lot of blind alleys and we've taken a lot of wrong turns and we've lost our way.

5000|$|It's such {{a no-brainer}} that {{there needs to}} be female heroes. It's about keeping the stories {{interesting}} and having fresh stories to tell. I always like that about Ant-Man and Wasp because it dealt with gender politics as well as superhero stuff. In the comics, particularly in the '60s comics, the Janet van Dyne Wasp was clearly written by all men and was pretty one-dimensional. She’s gotten much more dimensionalized since then. That's one of those things that I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> really exciting and fresh about this movie. You do feel a certain amount of responsibility. At the end of the day it's organic to that character and the movie. —Director Peyton Reed, on the Wasp's inclusion in the film. In June 2015, Peyton Reed, director of Ant-Man, stated, [...] "If we were lucky enough to be able to do a sequel or even a prequel, I'd be way into it. I've really fallen in love with these characters... There's a lot of story to tell with Hank Pym." [...] In July, Michael Douglas, who portrayed Pym, expressed the desire to have his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones play Janet van Dyne, while Evangeline Lilly hoped to see Michelle Pfeiffer in the role. Douglas also revealed he was not signed for any additional films, but [...] "would look forward to more if it comes my way". Producer Kevin Feige revealed that the studio had [...] "a supercool idea for the next Ant-Man film, and if audiences want it, we'll find a place to do it." [...] Reed also mentioned that there had been talks of doing a standalone adventure with Hank Pym as Ant-Man, possibly including the original opening to Ant-Man that featured Jordi Mollà, which had been cut from the final film. Eric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend opined that a standalone adventure with Pym and the cut sequence would be a good candidate to revive the Marvel One-Shots short film series. By the end of the month, David Dastmalchian expressed interest in returning for a sequel as Kurt.|$|E

5000|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines - suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, and I think we can all relate to that."In May 2011, it was revealed that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man.

Although most of my talk will relate to laminated composite materials, obviously it is very generic to bonded joints. The bond plies are really bonded together by adhesive material, the resin.
