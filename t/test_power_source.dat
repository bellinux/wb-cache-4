40|$|ABSTRACT What is {{it inside}} the colorfully wrapped present? You pick it up to ear level and listen, shake it, and then listen again. To you, the basic {{principle}} of active sensing is quite clear—first absorb, then, {{if there is no}} movement or sound, shake it, and then reabsorb. We propose an extremely basic hypothesis for the active sensing of haptic interaction with dynamical systems. Our hypothesis asserts that in order to improve the efficiency of extracting information from a probed system, the sensor should act according to the following basic principle: if the probed system is passive, the sensor should be active; conversely, when the probed system is active, the sensor should be passive. We proved the proposed principle for interaction with a second-order mechanical system with the goal to enhance classification performance between two possible sine <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> We showed that the addition of an active <b>power</b> <b>source</b> to a passive testing sensor leads to decreased sensitivity in the amplitude and frequency of the <b>tested</b> <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> Further, an extension of this principle is provided, presenting the conditions for reduced sensitivity to spring and damper parameters. To test its applicability for a linear system in a noisy environment, a computer simulation was performed demonstrating that classification performance improved by following the proposed principle. At last, ten subjects probed an active virtual system under either active or passive conditions. A comparison of the mean just-noticeable difference of both conditions indicated significantly better sensitivity was obtained by following the principle.

The <b>power</b> <b>source</b> is a self-oscillating inverter that includes a resonant network and a Current Comparing and Toggling Circuit (CCTC) that is used to generate the control signals of the inverter’s power switches. The power driver can be used to ignite and operate one or several serially connected fluorescent lamps, without the need of additional resonant networks and redesign of the power stage, while still maintaining high efficiency and low output crest factor.

40|$|Abstract—Conventional linear power {{amplifiers}} (LPAs) show a high output voltage quality but {{are characterized by}} high power losses and/or low power density. Therefore, {{there is a growing}} interest in increasing the efficiency of LPAs, e. g., for the realization of high <b>power</b> <b>testing</b> voltage <b>sources.</b> In this paper, a high-frequency isolated boost-type tracking power supply (TPS) system is proposed for the conditioning of the input voltage of an LPA. The output voltage of the TPS is varied according to the voltage to be formed by the LPA so that the voltage drop across the power amplifier output transistors is reduced to low values. This results in a significant increase of the total system efficiency. The operating principle of the proposed system is described. A design method for the output filter using the power supply rejection ratio of the LPA is proposed. This method ensures that the ampli-fier output voltage has minimal switching frequency components. Furthermore, a control system design method is presented that ensures good performance in the control of the constant inductor current of the switch-mode tracking stage. Finally, the theoretical considerations are verified by measurements on a 1 -kW laboratory prototype.

It is packaged as stackable module containing and protecting a nuclear fuel fabricated into ceramic pellets. The radioactive material poses potential hazards {{in case of a}} mission accident. For this reason, safety is treated as an inherent feature of design. The pellets are encapsulated in a refractory metal clad, and are encased within nested layers of composite materials. The performance and safety of the radioisotope <b>power</b> <b>source</b> depend in part on the dimensions and mechanical properties of the many protection layers surrounding the fuel. Safety <b>testing</b> of nuclear <b>power</b> <b>source</b> components must be used to understand their responses for a variety of accident scenarios.
