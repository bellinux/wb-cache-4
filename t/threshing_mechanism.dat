50|$|Various other {{applications}} of the screw or auger conveyor include its use in snowblowers, to move snow towards an impeller, where it is thrown into the discharge chute. Combine harvesters use both enclosed and open augers to move the unthreshed crop into the <b>threshing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and to move the grain {{into and out of}} the machine's hopper. Ice resurfacers use augers to remove loose ice particles from the surface of the ice. An auger is also a central component of an injection molding machine. An auger is used in some rubbish compactors to push the rubbish into a lowered plate at one end for compaction.|$|E
5000|$|The cut crop {{is carried}} up the feeder throat (commonly called the [...] "feederhouse") by a chain and flight elevator, then {{fed into the}} <b>threshing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the combine, {{consisting}} of a rotating threshing drum (commonly called the [...] "cylinder"), to which grooved steel bars (rasp bars) are bolted. The rasp bars thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through {{the action of the}} cylinder against the concave, a shaped [...] "half drum", also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the straw walkers. This action is also allowed because grain is heavier than straw, which causes it to fall rather than [...] "float" [...] across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is variably adjustable on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged disawning plates are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops. After the primary separation at the cylinder, the clean grain falls through the concave and to the shoe, which contains the chaffer and sieves. The shoe is common to both conventional combines and rotary combines.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{seeks to}} design a motorized rice thresher that can be manufactured by local artisans and accessed by all small-holder rice farmers. The concept of the thresher emanated from the working principles of a throw-in axial flow thresher a peg type <b>threshing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a screw type <b>threshing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Components of the thresher were designed and a prototype was made. The power requirement of the thresher was evaluated and validated with the power thresher standards of the Institute of Agricultural Machinery Japan which recommends an average power requirement of 3. 5 PS or less. The result was a rice thresher with threshing drum of diameter 400 mm and length 1120 mm a threshing drum shaft of diameter 36 mm a shaft bearing SKF self-aligning of designation 1406 a V-belt of number B 66 an SKF wedge belt pulleys of designation PHP 3 SPB 125 TB and PHP 3 SPB 280 TB and a main assembly drawing. The power requirement was 1. 4 PS 1. 03 kW for threshing long crops of length 1282 mm at feed rates up to 402 kghr and 1. 2 PS 0. 88 kW for threshing short crops of length 812 mm at feed rates up to 429 kghr...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of combine harvester setting on harvest losses and it aims on individual components of combine harvesters. The principles of tangential and axial threshing mechanisms are described. Separator rotors and straw walker principles are analysed {{in the part of}} remaining grain separation. Also the cleaning mechanisms are mentioned and clarified. Theoretical part finishes by the description of combine harvester settings impact on harvest losses. The influence of combine harvester settings on harvest losses were verified by experimental measurement. The change of <b>threshing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and ground speed were realized with subsequent monitoring of cleaning and grain separation losses. Finally the calibration of controlled engine choking was investigated for the material flow monitoring...|$|E

Until now, the threshing practice is caried out by traditional method in which the pepper beries are trampled. This method is not eficient nor hygienic and it also causes high losses of the berries. To overcome those problems, a hand-powered thesher has been designed. The experiment consisted of thee steps, namely designing, constructing and testing. The <b>threshing</b> <b>mechanism</b> was based on impact and friction, whereas {{the separation of the}} berries from the stalks was based on the difference in shape and dimension. The dimension of the pepper thesher is 900 mm length, 450 mm width, and I 200 mm height. The test results showed that the hand-powered thresher have a good performance. The capacity of the thesher is 100 kg of pepper berries (berries + stalks) per hour. The operational cost is Rp 30. 02 per kg of pepper beries, cheaper than that of the traditional theshing method (Rp 50 /kg). This equipment is easy to apply in rural area, and can covee the theshing operation of 2. 1 hectare of pepper plantation during harvesting periode...|$|E
40|$|Freshly {{harvested}} guayule seed often contains extraneous {{material and}} floral attachments. Seed of higher germination and purity is achievable through effective threshing and separation. The main {{objective of this}} study was to develop and evaluate an effective seed processing system for guayule. A combined threshing and grading system was developed following laboratory investigation of different approaches to seed threshing and separation. The seed processing system includes a rough surface belt type <b>threshing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> a cleaning unit consisting of a three layer reciprocating screen and an air assisted momentum discrimination chamber for grading and final separation. Harvested seed was processed using the machine at three belt clearances and speeds. The processed seed was analysed for seed purity, germination, thousand seed mass, clean seed recovery and processing efficiency. A threshing efficiency of up to 77 % was achieved at processing capacity of 300 g/h of clean seed. Belt clearance and speed both affected the quality of processed seed. The grading system resulted in separation of up to 63. 5 % of first grade seed with a purity of 98 % and germination of up to 76 %. It was also possible to produce heavy seeds of up to 756 mg per thousand seed using the unit. Crown Copyright © 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to compare aktivity and grade work combine {{harvester}} with different threshing system at harvesting a grain and oilseed rape {{in the business of}} agricultural production. Work was focuse on the size harvesting losses, grade grind and spreading crop residues, influence on the moisture of harvested crops on the size losses grade grind and spreading crop residues, throughput combine harvester, analysis of performance and consumption fuel. Work is complete about principal parametr agricultural operations, principal parametr owner machines and simply analysis of operating and investment costs. Although combine harvester didn't work at same land, measurement was done in the most consistent as possible in harvested condition regarding the weather, terrain, etc. From results are clearly that almost all the results achieved best results with a conventional combine harvester <b>threshing</b> <b>mechanism</b> Claas Lexion 580. Exception was only throughput at harvest of winter oilseed rape, which had machine John Deere S 690 with axial threshing of 1. 23 kg ha- 1 higher than Claas Lexion 580. Consumption fuel was lower at harvest of winter wheat with procrastination straw on the line by machine Claas Lwxion 670 with value 11, 0 l. ha- 1.. When shredding straw was reached average values for all combine. The worst grind and spread straw demonstrated combine harvester John Deere S 690 where avoid spreading crop residues over the entire stroke. All machines accomplish agro-technical requirements for the combine in terms of losses off 1, 5 % in direct harvest, performance, throughput, quality scatter chop, shred the quality of crop residues and working speed. Results this work convince me to recommend harvester Claas Lexoon 580 especially for large agricultural business and for service businesses with minimum efficiency 1 340 ha. rok- 1. For smaller business or business with higer structure of livestock production I would have chosed thresher with straw walker technology separation device and to Claas Lexion 670. Combine harvester John Deere S 690 U would advised more for service businesses and large business engaged in growing corn for grain with minimum area coverage. For both machines I would choose the cutter adapter on the frame 9 meters...|$|E
