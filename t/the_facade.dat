One addition was the covering of <b>the</b> <b>facade</b> with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. <b>The</b> <b>facade</b> consists of fourteen stone arches, {{most of which are}} of a Romanesque style. The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design. The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} facade, oriented {{southwest and}} located behind the portico, was built {{together with the}} stone church built by the Jesuits in 1727. <b>The</b> <b>facade</b> is simply designed with its upper half hidden by an extended choir loft which houses an 1824 pipe organ. A way of glazed blue tiles connects <b>the</b> <b>facade</b> and the portico. The portico was added as an extension to <b>the</b> <b>facade</b> in 1875 by the Augustinian Recollects. An inscription on the portico's pediment based on the year of construction of <b>the</b> <b>facade</b> (1875) was invisible due to church renovations.

5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on <b>the</b> <b>façade,</b> the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. <b>The</b> <b>facade</b> is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of <b>the</b> <b>facade</b> an ascending undulating form. He also faced <b>the</b> <b>facade</b> with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. <b>The</b> <b>facade</b> culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E

5|$|The church {{itself is}} a large brick {{building}} constructed {{in the shape of}} a Greek cross; it was designed by Andrew DeCurtins of Lima and built under the supervision of John Burkhart of Kenton. A Romanesque Revival structure erected in 1903, it is centered on a large bronze dome. Worshippers may enter the building through its eastern end; <b>the</b> <b>facade</b> is pierced by three large doorways and a massive rose window. Capping <b>the</b> <b>facade</b> are two square towers; each one includes an octagonal belfry and is topped with a smaller bronze dome. Inside, the church is heavily decorated; many of the walls feature paintings, and the altar is distinctly Romanesque in its style. The entire building rests on a stone foundation with a basement.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} {{is divided}} in three sections {{separated by a}} row of arches. The left section (as seen from the cathedral) belongs to the Communs wing, which housed the servants. The right section belongs to the stables wing. Left and right of <b>the</b> <b>façade</b> are exedras decorated with busts of Roman emperors. The entrance to the palace is through the left exedra. Facing the courtyard façade is a peristyle with five arches. The central arch, the highest and widest, faces the centre of <b>the</b> <b>façade</b> and opens on the palace's main gate.|$|E

50|$|Work on the {{building}} began in 1969 and was completed in 1972. As of 2014 {{it is the second}} tallest building in Cape Town. The 34-degree diagonal twist, which puts it on a north-south axis, reduces sun loads on <b>the</b> <b>façades,</b> thereby reducing pressure on the air-conditioning system. To further shield <b>the</b> <b>façades,</b> a pre-cast screen is mounted on every floor, allowing good air flow and cutting off direct sun rays. This unique orientation also means that all the offices have views of either the mountain or the harbour, and that none stare straight into <b>the</b> <b>façades</b> of <b>the</b> surrounding buildings.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>façade,</b> though {{built in}} the style of the Taj Mahal, lacks {{symmetry}} as the vertical axis has been given prominence which has resulted in an unbalanced appearance to the tomb. The dome is more elongated; the central part has a taller pishtaq. The four minarets at the four corners are part of the main mausoleum which was totally a different concept in elevation compared to the Taj Mahal where the towers are detached and away from <b>the</b> <b>facade</b> of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|The {{laboratory}} on the Castellania's {{second floor}} {{which was used}} by the Malta Fever Commission was restored and converted into The Brucellosis Museum in 1980, and it is now open to the public by appointment. Since the British period some of the prison cells were modified and converted into government offices and at present still serve this purpose. Other parts of the Castellania's interior, including the chapel and one of the prison cells, were restored in the 1990s. The restored cell appears on the front cover of the book Kissing the Gallows: A Cultural History of Crime, Torture and Punishment in Malta, 1600–1798, authored by William Zammit. There were further plans to restore <b>the</b> <b>façade</b> in the late 1990s, but nothing materialized. <b>The</b> <b>façade</b> is again on plan to be restored as part of a number of projects of the Valletta 2018 - European Capital of Culture.

500|$|The {{treatment}} of the upper floors provides a striking contrast. 134,000 green, orange, lime and yellow glazed terracotta tiles cover <b>the</b> <b>façades</b> in 13 irregularly oriented vertical panels on the external perimeter. <b>The</b> <b>façades</b> facing <b>the</b> inner courtyard are lined with another eight panels covered with grey tiles, a design which project architect Maurits van der Staay says was intended to [...] "ensure that the upper storeys did not detract from the transparency of the ground floor and to maximise the amount of light reflected back into the offices." [...] <b>The</b> <b>façades</b> are hung on an internal chassis carrier system (a similar system is in use in another Piano development on Berlin's Potsdamer Platz). Pierced by rows of identical windows repeated across the entire development, <b>the</b> <b>façades</b> {{are expected to be}} effectively self-cleaning and immune to fading. The colours of <b>the</b> <b>façades</b> are evoked in the design of many of the development's interior fittings, such as lift-door reveals, handrails and lift displays. The tiles were produced in Germany by NBK of Emmerich am Rhein and mounted on prefabricated façade units in Wrocław, Poland, by Schneider Fassadenbau.|$|R
