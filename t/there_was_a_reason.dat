25|$|In 1911, the Imperial Household Ordinance on Imperial Family Dress was promulgated, and an {{additional}} clause in it abolished the pertinent Dajō-kan edicts of 1873 and 1876. This order defined two levels of formal dress, changed the chrysanthemum foliage scrollwork to use a sakura motif instead, and specified fully closed mandarin collars. However, as Imperial Family members were now supposed to wear the uniforms of their offices if they held any, and most princes were appointed as officers in the military or navy unless <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not to, most wore military uniforms, and these new uniforms for the Imperial Family saw little actual use.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} {{received}} well by young Austrians in the 1980s. To them, the book represented {{a story of}} truth that was long hidden. At a time when Austria was starting to take on responsibility for its nonaction during World War II, February Shadows threw light on problems of the past. Reichart displayed to her own nation that ignoring and forgetting {{events such as the}} Mühlviertler Hasenjagd was unacceptable and not to be tolerated. Some older Austrians, who had lived through the war, considered February Shadows controversial and inappropriate. Much like the character Hilde, they felt the past should stay in the past, that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for Austrian silence about the events of World War II: to protect lives.|$|E

But {{this is not just a}} 'pop album,' it's a woman holding forth on the role of women in our society, how they should approach the nuances of their life and most importantly, how they can choose to value relationships... That isn't just the work of a diva, that is the work of a political figure." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{line was}} mostly well {{received}} by critics and Stefani was appreciated for taking fashion seriously {{even though she}} is a celebrity. Fern Mallis of IMG praised the line and Stefani as well and said, [...] "the L.A.M.B. line is clearly at the top of these lines and is as unique and individual as Gwen herself." [...] The shoes were well received by the critics, though considered to be pricey. Desiree Stimpert of About.com said, [...] " ... these shoes aren't for everyone, but will most definitely appeal to fans of Ms. Stefani's music and fashion - sense." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "L.A.M.B.'s embellished tracksuits, Rasta-inspired knits, and gaucho-heel combos deliver the edge" [...] Nicole Phelps of Style.com said, [...] "The collection, which looked like the sixties as seen by someone {{who grew up in the}} eighties, was altogether more wearable and on trend." [...] Fashion journalist Cathy Horyn of The New York Times differed and said, [...] "If ever <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for a pop star to concentrate on her vocal skills, it was Gwen Stefani's fashion meltdown." ...|$|E
500|$|De Boer {{felt that}} the {{producers}} {{did a good job}} with involving Ezri {{over the course of the}} seventh season, but not to the extent that it detracted from the more established members of the main cast. However, there was one part of the season where she was concerned that the fans would suffer from [...] "Ezri overload". But she {{felt that the}} character had a real story arc and character evolution as the season went by. She said that she did not want Ezri to remain the same [...] "young and confused" [...] person that she was in her first appearances, which was something that the writers and producers agreed with. She said that [...] "As time went on, you saw that Ezri was intelligent, that she was endearing and a good person. She became a more complicated character than you might have thought in her first few episodes." [...] She praised specific episodes which evolved the character, such as [...] "The Siege of AR-558" [...] which required Ezri to draw upon Dax's past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed [...] "" [...] as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in [...] "" [...] were [...] "fascinating". As she approached the end of Deep Space Nine, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining , saying that [...] "My first instinct would be to say no. I would need to feel <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for Ezri to be on Voyager". She was interviewed at the series wrap party after completing filming on the final episode, [...] "What You Leave Behind", and said, [...] "The last episode was very emotional, especially on the last day... I couldn't believe that a season had gone by already. I realized all the people I'd grown close to must be feeling it much more because they'd been doing it 7 years. I cried." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason,</b> and it {{presented}} a serious {{obstacle to the}} Deepwater Railway plans: collusion.

The C and the N had apparently agreed {{with each other to}} refuse to negotiate with Col. Page and his upstart Deepwater Railway. It wasn't just the rates that Page wanted to share, which could possibly have been negotiated. The bigger issue was the coal lands which both larger railroads, especially the N, had large investments in.|$|E
