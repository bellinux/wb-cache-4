5|$|Any counterattack or {{relief effort}} {{contemplated}} by the South Vietnamese was doomed {{by the thousands}} of refugees that took to the roads in order to escape the fighting. Desertion among South Vietnamese units became common, as soldiers began disappearing from the ranks in search of family members. This pattern was to become <b>too</b> <b>common</b> as the offensive continued, not just among the territorial forces, but among the regular troops.|$|E
5|$|Development of Burning Rangers started around November 1996, {{after the}} release of Sonic Team's {{previous}} game Christmas Nights (a Christmas-themed demo for Nights into Dreams...). The concept originated with the idea of rescuing people as opposed to killing them, which was an element that producer Yuji Naka felt was <b>too</b> <b>common</b> in contemporary video games. The development team of 31 (out of Sonic Team's staff of about 50) was directed by Naoto Ohshima, the director and lead designer Takao Miyoshi. The rest of the team consisted of three game planners, six programmers, eighteen designers, and two sound producers, most of whom had worked on Nights into Dreams....|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the quality of}} success {{at the level of}} the {{individual}} may remain open to question. While now more often usefully restored to society, it appears all <b>too</b> <b>common</b> that the individual may be less than faithfully restored to the earlier self. This issue is axiomatically problematic, as a patient will seldom have been psychiatrically profiled prior to contact with medical services, and before-after comparison by the professional is therefore rare.|$|E
25|$|Wakley's last campaigns {{were against}} the {{adulteration}} of foodstuffs. That was far <b>too</b> <b>common</b> in his day, and his opposition was significant {{in bringing about}} much-needed reforming legislation. To provide evidence, Wakley set up The Lancet Analytical and Sanitary Commission, which provided 'records of the microscopical and chemical analyses of the solids and fluids consumed by all classes of the public'. The methods were devised by Wakley, Sir William Brooke O'Shaughnessy and Dr Arthur Hill Hassall, who was the Commissioner.|$|E

25|$|Trademark erosion, or genericization, is {{a special}} case of antonomasia related to {{trademark}}s. It happens when a trademark becomes so common that it starts {{being used as a}} common name and the original company has failed to prevent such use. Once it has become an appellative, the word cannot be registered any more; this is why companies try hard not to let their trademark become <b>too</b> <b>common,</b> a phenomenon that could otherwise be considered a successful move since it would mean that the company gained an exceptional recognition.|$|E
25|$|It {{is good to}} {{remember}} that all these documents were written by humans, who used human judgment as to whether to note something. For example, once in Europe, German air raids and picking up dead bodies from the sea were fairly common occurrences. At some point, they became <b>too</b> <b>common</b> to report. The Deck Log might mention an air raid on one day but the War Diary might make no mention of it. A week later, the opposite might be true. The clearest picture comes from reading all the documents.|$|E
25|$|Toole's highly cultured {{mother was}} a {{controlling}} woman, especially with her son. His father was less involved and sometimes complained of his lack of influence in their child's upbringing. Despite this, {{he and his father}} bonded through a mutual interest in baseball and cars. Toole's mother chose the friends he could associate with, and felt his cousins on his father's side were <b>too</b> <b>common</b> for him to be around. Toole received high marks in elementary school and, from a young age, expressed a desire to excel academically. He skipped ahead a grade, from first to second, after taking an IQ test at the age of six.|$|E

25|$|In the Egyptian, Greek and Roman empires, women usually fed {{only their}} own children. However, {{breastfeeding}} {{began to be}} seen as something <b>too</b> <b>common</b> to be done by royalty, and wet nurses were employed to breastfeed the children of the royal families. This extended over time, particularly in western Europe, where noble women often made use of wet nurses. Lower-class women breastfed their infants and used a wet nurse only if they were unable to feed their own infant. Attempts were made in 15th-century Europe to use cow or goat milk, but these attempts were not successful. In the 18th century, flour or cereal mixed with broth were introduced as substitutes for breastfeeding, but this was also unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|If {{passwords}} {{are written}} down, they {{should never be}} kept in obvious places such as address books, Rolodex files, under drawers or keyboards, or behind pictures. Perhaps the worst, but all <b>too</b> <b>common,</b> location is a Post-It note on the computer monitor. Better locations are a safe deposit box or a locked file approved for information of sensitivity comparable to that protected by the password. Most locks on office file cabinets are far from adequate. Software is available for popular hand-held computers that can store passwords for numerous accounts in encrypted form. Another approach is to encrypt by hand on paper and remember the encryption method and key. And another approach {{is to use a}} single password or slightly varying passwords for low-security accounts and select distinctly separate strong passwords for a smaller number of high-value applications such as for online banking.|$|E
25|$|Family name: A name used by {{all members}} of a family. In China, {{surnames}} gradually came into common use beginning in the 3rd century BC (having been common only among the nobility before that). In some areas of East Asia (e.g. Vietnam and Korea), surnames developed {{in the next several}} centuries, while in other areas (like Japan), surnames did not become prevalent until the 19th century. In Europe, after the loss of the Roman system, the common use of family names started quite early in some areas (France in the 13th century, and Germany in the 16th century), but it often did not happen until much later in areas that used a patronymic naming custom, such as the Scandinavian countries, Wales, and some areas of Germany, as well as Russia and Ukraine. The compulsory use of surnames varied greatly. France required a priest to write surnames in baptismal records in 1539 (but did not require surnames for Jews, who usually used patronymics, until 1808). On the other hand, surnames were not compulsory in the Scandinavian countries until the 19th or 20th century (1923) in Norway, and Iceland still does not use surnames for its native inhabitants. In Spain, Portugal and most Latin American countries, two surnames are used, one being the father's family name and the other being the mother's family name. Whereas Spain used to put the father's family name before the mother's family name, Portugal and Brazil keep the inverse order but use the father's family name as the principal one. A Portuguese man named António de Oliveira Guterres would therefore be known commonly as António Guterres. In Spain, though, the second surname is frequently used if the first one is <b>too</b> <b>common</b> to allow an easy identification. For example, Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero is often called Zapatero. In most of the cultures of the Middle East and South Asia, surnames were not generally used until European influence took hold in the 19th century.|$|E

Kelly stated she didn't think Becky would slap other characters, rather opting for punches.

John Campbell, in The Lives of the Chief Justices of England, said that [...] "His reasoning... is narrow minded; [...] utter contempt for method and style in his compositions", and says that Coke's Reports were [...] "tinctured with quaintness and pedantry".
