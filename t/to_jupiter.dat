5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter,</b> but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E
5|$|Comets 42P/Neujmin and 53P/Van Biesbroeck {{appear to}} be {{fragments}} of a parent comet. Numerical integrations have shown that both comets had a rather close approach <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> in January 1850, and that, before 1850, the two orbits were nearly identical.|$|E
5|$|Domitian firmly {{believed}} in the traditional Roman religion, and personally {{saw to it that}} ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small chapel dedicated <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> Conservator was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> Custos.|$|E

25|$|The Saturnian {{atmosphere}} is {{in several ways}} similar <b>to</b> that of <b>Jupiter.</b> It exhibits a banded pattern similar <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter's,</b> and occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals caused by storms. A storm formation analogous <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter's</b> Great Red Spot, the Great White Spot, is a short-lived phenomenon that forms with a roughly 30-year periodicity. It was last observed in 1990. However, the storms and the band pattern are less visible and active than those of <b>Jupiter,</b> due <b>to</b> the overlying ammonia hazes in Saturn's troposphere.|$|R
5|$|Two of {{the middle}} planets {{are located in the}} system's {{habitable}} zone; however, they are giant planets believed to be analogous <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{major problem}} in sending space probes <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Although close <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter,</b> New Horizons {{instruments}} made refined {{measurements of}} the orbits of Jupiter's inner moons, particularly Amalthea. The probe's cameras measured volcanoes onIo, studied all four Galilean moons in detail, and made long-distance studies of the outer moons Himalia and Elara. The craft also studied Jupiter's Little Red Spot and the planet's magnetosphere and tenuous ring system.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{its high}} mass, Gliese 876 c {{is likely to}} be a gas giant with no solid surface. Since it was {{detected}} indirectly through its gravitational effects on the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown.

5|$|Europa (Jupiter II), {{the second}} of the four Galilean moons, is the second closest <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> and the {{smallest}} at 3121.6 kilometers in diameter, which is slightly smaller than the Moon. The name comes from a mythical Phoenician noblewoman, Europa, who was courted by Zeus and became the queen of Crete, though the name did not become widely used until the mid-20th century.|$|E

It orbits within the main ring of Jupiter, and is thought to be a major contributor of material to the rings.|$|E

5|$|Voyagers 1 and 2 arrived <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> in 1979–1980 and {{traveled}} almost in its equatorial plane. Voyager 1, which passed within 5RJ from the planet's center, {{was first to}} encounter the Io plasma torus. Voyager 2 passed within 10RJ and discovered the current sheet in the equatorial plane. The next probe to approach Jupiter was Ulysses in 1992, which investigated the planet's polar magnetosphere.|$|E

5|$|A minor Army-Air Force fight {{then broke}} out about what targets {{would be used}} for the Kwajalein tests. The Army favored using its Jupiter design, fired from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, while the Air Force {{recommended}} using Atlas fired from Vandenberg AFB in California. The Army had already begun converting the former Thor launchers <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered the issue. On 26 May 1960 they decided in favor of Atlas, and this was made official on 29 June when the Secretary of Defense ended pad conversion and additional Jupiter production earmarked for Zeus testing.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main {{contributor}} of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is tidally locked <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully {{illuminated}} when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> that crescent views of the planet were obtained. A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A large telescope will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.|$|E

5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E
5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it {{is likely}} that Gliese 876 b is a gas giant with no solid surface. Since the planet has only been {{detected}} indirectly through its gravitational effects on the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that the atmosphere of Gliese 876 b is cloudless, though cooler regions of the planet may be able to form water clouds.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 an {{extrasolar planet}} similar in size <b>to</b> <b>Jupiter</b> {{designated}} HD 28185 b {{was discovered in}} orbit around the star with a period of 1.04 years. Unlike many long-period extrasolar planets, it has a low orbital eccentricity. The planet experiences similar insolation to Earth, {{which has led to}} speculations about the possibilities for habitable moons. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that low-mass planets located in the gas giant's Trojan points would be stable for long periods. The planet's existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2008.|$|E
