5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E
25|$|More formally, {{the data}} being sorted can be {{represented}} as a record or tuple of values, and {{the part of the}} data that is used for sorting is called <b>the</b> <b>key.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> card example, cards are represented as a record (rank, suit), and the key is the rank. A sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key, and R appears before S in the original list, then R will always appear before S in the sorted list.|$|E

Clorinda wants {{to get away from}} her mother as soon as possible. When Lady Tramaine returns home, she confronts Ella and demands answers as to where Clorinda went. She then notices the glass slipper and uses it as bait to make Ella tell the truth. Ella gives in, but Lady Tramaine drops the glass slipper and it {{shatters}} into pieces.|$|E

25|$|Also, most of {{the coins}} of the Greek kings in India were bilingual, written in Greek {{on the front and}} in Pali on the back (in the Kharosthi script, derived from Aramaic, rather than the more eastern Brahmi, which was used only once on coins of Agathocles of Bactria), a {{tremendous}} concession to another culture never before made in the Hellenic world. From the reign of Apollodotus II, around 80 BC, Kharosthi letters started to be used as mintmarks on coins in combination with Greek monograms and mintmarks, suggesting the participation of local technicians to the minting process. Incidentally, these bilingual coins of the Indo-Greeks were <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decipherment of the Kharoshthi script by James Prinsep (1799–1840). Kharoshthi became extinct around the 3rd century AD.|$|E

500|$|Back at Nico’s apartment, Bruno {{reveals that}} the stolen key was the Key of Solomon; Susarro would need it to access a special armillary in an ancient building, the {{location}} of which is unknown. Whilst looking at the Omega Stone, George realises he saw the same symbol, {{in exactly the same}} style as <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Congo, leading him and Nico to travel there and investigate. [...] The pair quickly find another stone with the alpha symbol upon it, and manage to evade Petra, who had come after them and the site. [...] Upon returning to Paris, the pair learn that Bruno had been captured whilst Nico's apartment was ransacked, and taken to Prague, leaving Nico to find out where exactly by returning to the abandoned theatre and searching it for clues, quickly finding out that he was taken to a large castle owned by Susarro. [...] Whilst there, they manage to track down Bruno, along with the discovery that the armillary is in Egypt, and that the Key of Solomon was taken by the St. Stefan chapter of the Knights Templar - a surviving remnant of the Templars that still exist, and known to Susarro. He promptly returns to Paris to confront them, while Bruno is taken to Egypt. George decides to track the St. Stefan chapter as well, and returns to Paris and the Montfauçon where they are based, only to arrive too late to stop their base being invaded. Despite finding bodies, George manages to find survivors of the attack, including the Preceptor for the chapter's temple. The Preceptor tasks George with stopping Susarro, revealing the key was taken from them, before handing over a third stone key needed to pinpoint the armillary, bearing a psi symbol on it, and knighting George.|$|E
