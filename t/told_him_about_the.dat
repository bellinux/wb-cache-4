5|$|In 1952, the Reverend Francis Dixon of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth, England, began hearing several testimonies {{from people}} who became Christians after Jenner accosted them on George Street, Sydney. The {{following}} year, Dixon met with Jenner in Australia and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people he had met who had become Christians {{as a result of}} Jenner's evangelism, and Jenner, then fifty years old, cried because he had not previously known that even one of the people he had talked to had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

50|$|Already {{involved}} in urban arts in general, {{he met in}} 1998 the rapper Nima who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything <b>about</b> <b>the</b> hip hop underground culture which triggered A1one's desire to grow in that direction. His first significant work was a painting under the Tehran-Karaj expressway called Searching for friends.|$|R
5|$|By mid-1942, over 1,000 {{children}} {{that had been}} rounded up during the Kozara Offensive were being held at the Stara Gradiška concentration camp, itself a sub-camp of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex. Information {{about the plight of}} these children was passed to concerned citizens in the NDH capital, Zagreb, one of whom was Diana Budisavljević, an Austrian. Budisavljević approached an Ustaše-appointed {{member of the board of}} the Croatian Red Cross, Kamilo Brosler, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> children at Stara Gradiška. Brosler was horrified, and with the support of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross began to place pressure on the NDH government to release the children. Budisavljević also used her contacts with the German Army to intervene with the Ustaše regime on behalf of the children.|$|E
5|$|Hours earlier, Lucan had again {{called his}} mother, at about 12:30am. He {{told her that}} he would be in touch later that day, but {{declined}} to speak with the police constable who had accompanied her to her flat; instead, he said he would call the police later that morning. Ranson discovered that Lucan had travelled to Uckfield when he was called by Ian Maxwell-Scott, who told him that Lucan had arrived at his home a few hours after the murder, and spoken with his wife, Susan. While there, the earl had written two letters to his brother-in-law, Bill Shand-Kydd, and posted them to his London address. Maxwell-Scott also called Shand-Kydd at his country house near Leighton Buzzard and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> letters, prompting the latter to immediately drive to London to collect them. After reading them, and noting that they were bloodstained, he took them to Ranson.|$|E
5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the Ark {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the ark, since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the ark within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the ark, and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The ark reaches its final destination {{in front of the}} Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E
60|$|Billy the Mule stumped {{off with}} the swaggering limp of an old campaigner, as the troop-horse's head came nuzzling into my breast, and I gave him biscuits, while Vixen, who is a most {{conceited}} little dog, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> fibs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> scores of horses that she and I kept.|$|R

50|$|During {{the second}} day of his {{remaining}} three days, he met up with his son and spoke of his desire for him to come to his senses, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>about</b> <b>the</b> significance of the casino.

5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren {{standing in front of the}} National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{said that}} {{on the night of}} September 21, 1823, Moroni {{appeared}} to him and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> golden plates that were buried in a stone box a few miles from Smith's home. Smith said that the same angel visited him various times {{over the course of the}} next six years; Smith also said that the angel visited him to retrieve the golden plates after Smith had finished translated a portion of the writing on the plates into the Book of Mormon.|$|E
25|$|Miguel Figueres had a loyal slave named Ambrosio who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{plans for}} the rebellion. The {{whistleblower}} also had both personal and financial interests, as the colony rewarded slaves who reported any kind of slave conspiracy by granting them freedom and paying 500 pesos. Figueres told the mayor of Bayamón who mobilized 500 soldiers for defense. They pursued the slaves, quickly capturing the ringleaders and followers of the conspiracy. A total of 61 slaves were imprisoned in Bayamón and San Juan.|$|E

He also claimed the miracle “was so public and well-known, how it all happened, that even the children sang all about it in their games.” ...|$|R
60|$|Creeping {{back into}} the scrub, he set off for camp. When he got there Father Lucien was asleep, and when they resumed the march next morning Thirlwell <b>told</b> <b>him</b> nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other party.

25|$|Hazard took Jung's advice {{seriously and}} set about seeking a {{personal}} spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a First-Century Christian evangelical movement known as the Oxford Group (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was Ebby Thacher, a long-time friend and drinking buddy of Bill Wilson, later co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group, and through them Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly {{found its way into}} the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original twelve-step program.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the parties}} confer. The {{man in the}} teashop was Mr Lipscombe and when Miss Carnaby {{recognised}} him, she put on an act of allegiance to Andersen. Poirot realised this {{when he had the}} man followed back to the lodge. Andersen's chemistry background (although he was probably not a Jewish refugee) came in useful for preparing injections of hashish to produce ecstasy in his adherents, and also for injecting them with relevant bacteria when he wanted to kill them and inherit their estates. Andersen was about to inject Miss Carnaby with tuberculosis bacteria to tie in with the fictional ailment she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> proof has been obtained in the laboratory in the sanctuary that the police have raided.|$|E
25|$|An oral {{tale about}} the shava sadhana is {{told by the}} Tantrikas of Bengal. Vasudeva Bhattacharya of Tipperah (West Bengal) went to the Goddess temple of Kamakhya and worshipped the deity by Tantric means. A voice <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ritual {{and that he will}} gain moksha in his next life when he will be reborn as his own {{grandson}} Sarvananda. Vasudeva gave his servant Purvananda an engraved copper plate with a mantra. Purvananda, now an old man, now served Sarvananda, who he passed the secret of shava sadhana ritual, told by his former master. Purvananda volunteered to be used as the corpse for shava sadhana and Sarvananda performed the ritual, where ghosts tormented him; storms tried to interrupt his practice; beautiful dancers tempted him, until the Goddess gave him a vision. She blessed him with vak siddhi, the ability to make something happen by just saying it. She also revived the servant. Sarvananda became a siddha and the first tantrika to see the theophany of the Goddess' ten mahavidya forms. The Shakta poet Ramprasad Sen is also told to have performed the ritual and gained the vision of his patron, goddess Kali.|$|E
500|$|Ann Druyan, Steven Soter, and [...] {{astrophysicist}} Neil deGrasse Tyson {{were planning}} on producing a new, updated sequel to Carl Sagan's [...] and continued pitching {{the idea to}} various television stations even after Sagan's death. In 2008 producer Seth MacFarlane met with Tyson at the Science & Entertainment Exchange, where Tyson <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> rebooting <b>the</b> Cosmos series. MacFarlane took interest in the idea and presented it to the Fox Broadcasting Company television network.|$|R
60|$|It {{certainly}} {{occurred to}} the servant {{who had to}} clean his boots that they were astonishingly old boots for such a rich lord. But that was because {{he had not yet}} bought new ones; next day he appeared in respectable boots and fine clothes. Now, instead of a common soldier he had become a noble lord, and <b>the</b> people <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> all <b>the</b> grand doings of the town and the King, and what a beautiful Princess his daughter was.|$|R
25|$|In an October 2014 {{episode of}} PBS's Finding Your Roots programme, Nas learned about five generations of his ancestry. His great-great-great-grandmother, Pocahontas Little, {{was a slave}} who was sold for $830. When host Henry Louis Gates showed Nas her bill of sale and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man who bought her, Nas remarked that he is {{considering}} buying the land where he lived. Nas is also shown the marriage certificate of his great-great-great-grandmother, Pocahontas and great-great-great-grandfather, Calvin.|$|R
500|$|In 2007, Chuck Lorre, {{the creator}} of Two and a Half Men, {{contacted}} Carol Mendelsohn, the show runner of , about a crossover. The first reactions to this were {{that it was a}} stupid idea. CSI writer and executive producer Naren Shankar commented that when Mendelsohn first <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> idea he replied: [...] "What a nut". However, that same year, the idea resurfaced, when Lorre and Mendelsohn met at the World Television Festival in Banff. Upon hearing this, the cast of both shows were surprised and not interested, but they eventually jumped aboard. In an interview with The New York Post, before the idea was fully worked out, Mendelsohn described the possible crossover as [...] "a great challenge".|$|E
500|$|Ford {{also had}} three half-siblings {{from the second}} {{marriage}} of Leslie King, Sr., his biological father: Marjorie King (1921–1993), Leslie Henry King (1923–1976), and Patricia Jane King (1925–1980). They never saw one another as children {{and he did not}} know them at all. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a [...] "carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two [...] "maintained a sporadic contact" [...] until Leslie King, Sr.'s death in 1941.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} Jenner's life continued to propagate {{at least as}} late as 2006. In some accounts of Jenner's evangelism, Jenner {{is referred to as}} [...] "Mr. Genor". One such account was recorded by Ray Comfort on the Living Waters website and then repeated in the 2006 book Spirit-led Evangelism: Reaching the Lost through Love and Power by Ché Ahn. Ahn is one of the storytellers who refers to Jenner as a [...] "little white-haired man", and Ahn concludes his story by writing that Jenner died two weeks after encountering Dixon, who is not named. These details contradict the information provided by Wilson, who writes in his biography that Jenner died more than twenty years after Dixon <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people who had become Christians {{as a result of his}} evangelism.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Savitri tells Sagar of Manohar's {{intentions}} and he confronts Manohar. Manohar tries to kill Sagar with a pistol, but Savitri again saves Sagar and drives Manohar away. Thus, Sagar and Savitri start living together happily. While going away, Manohar meets Savitri's brother {{and tells him}} that relationship has changed (Badal gaye rishtey). Chandar thus explains to his wife that Manohar had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> all <b>the</b> events and was intentionally behaving in a cruel way so that Savitri hates him and falls for Sagar.|$|R
5000|$|Smoltz counts Doc Rivers as a {{personal}} friend dating back to Rivers' playing days in Atlanta.

Inside, he finds more of Amselstein's mysterious contraptions, and shouting angrily at Amselstein, asking where he is hiding, he breaks open a door, {{only to find the}} insides of Amselstein's cabin in Labrador. In shock and disbelief, Shelby steps through the door, whereupon the portal immediately closes behind him.|$|R
500|$|In Moscow in 2000, Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev {{announced}} that Wallenberg had been executed in 1947 in Lubyanka prison. He claimed that Vladimir Kryuchkov, the former Soviet secret police chief, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> shooting {{in a private}} conversation. The statement did not explain why Wallenberg was killed or why the government had lied about it. General Pavel Sudoplatov claimed that Raoul Wallenberg died after being poisoned by Grigory Mairanovsky, a notorious NKVD assassin. In 2000, Russian prosecutor Vladimir Ustinov signed a verdict posthumously rehabilitating Wallenberg and his driver, Langfelder, as [...] "victims of political repression". A number of files pertinent to Wallenberg were {{turned over to the}} chief rabbi of Russia by the Russian government in September 2007. The items were slated to be housed at the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center in Moscow, which opened in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Muransky testified under a {{grant of}} {{immunity}} as a government witness in the March 2000 trial of Edwards.

DeBartolo, Sr.; he discussed DeBartolo's exasperation at Edwards' solicitation of cash. [...] According to Muransky, DeBartolo complained about Edwards and his associates: [...] "They don't quit."; ...|$|E
