40|$|International audienceTwo {{experiments}} were carried out, {{one in a}} glasshouse {{and the other in}} the field, to assess the effect of weeding management (type and date) on blackgrass seed production during set-aside. The results of the field experiment were used to establish relationships between head length and spikelet <b>number</b> per <b>head.</b> <b>Head</b> <b>number</b> per plant was not reduced by one mowing in glasshouse, but it was reduced by double mowing. Early (beginning of anthesis) or intermediate (half-anthesis) glyphosate reduced <b>head</b> <b>number</b> by 72 or 50 %, respectively, compared to a control, but later (during seed ripening) application did not. A first mowing reduced the length of heads elongated after the mowing by 25 % compared to a control, but less than two successive mowings (by 50 %). Seed viability was greatly reduced by early glyphosate (by 91 %) compared to a control, less by medium date spraying and two mowings (by 17 and 47 %, respectively), and not by one mowing or late spraying. These results were checked at two densities in the field experiment. The results of head length for low density were consistent with those in glasshouse, but <b>head</b> <b>number</b> did not differ between treatments. <b>Head</b> <b>number</b> per plant and head length at the highest density were lower (from 50 to 76 % according to the treatments for <b>head</b> <b>number</b> and from 3 to 16 % according to the treatments for head length) than those for individual plants. These preliminary results give indications, which should be checked in farmers’ field conditions, for better control of blackgrass in set-aside fields...|$|R

This study is possible due to the increasing demand and interest of the international markets, especially the Canadian market, regarding the organic and functional healthy products such as the Sacha Inchi and its outstanding benefits for the human health and the opportunities that implies for the Peruvian exports success of the mentioned product. In order to accomplish that, it was necessary to analyze: the Canadian consumer profile, the evolution and tendency of the Peruvian exports to the World and Canada during the 2008 – 2012 period, the evolution of the number of enterprises and the <b>number</b> of <b>tariffs</b> <b>heading</b> used for Peruvian exports of Sacha Inchi to the target market, and the Canadian Imports regarding the most representatives <b>tariffs</b> <b>heading</b> used in Peru for the export of the Sacha Inchi to the Canadian market, this way it was possible to demonstrate the success of the Sacha Inchi in the target market. In conclusion, it was possible to conclude that the Canadian’s market window of opportunity will positively influence on the Peruvian exports of Sacha Inchi by increasing them in the 2014, which is why, according to the interviewee experts; it should be used by the Peruvian producers and exporters in order to succeed in the Canadian market. TesisEl presente trabajo denominado ―Análisis de la ventana de oportunidad del mercado canadiense y su influencia en las exportaciones peruanas de Sacha Inchi‖, teniendo como línea base el periodo 2008 – 2012, tiene por finalidad demostrar la influencia que tendría la ventana de oportunidad del mercado canadiense en las exportaciones peruanas de Sacha Inchi para el año 2014. Este proyecto de investigación nace en vista de: la creciente demanda e interés de los mercados internacionales, especialmente Canadá, respecto a los productos orgánicos, saludables y funcionales como el Sacha Inchi y sus excepcionales beneficios para el ser humano; y de las oportunidades que esto implica para el éxito de las exportaciones peruanas de dicho producto. Para ello, se procedió a analizar el perfil del consumidor canadiense, también se analizó la evolución y tendencia de las exportaciones peruanas de Sacha Inchi al mundo y a Canadá durante el periodo 2008 – 2012, así como la evolución del número de empresas y del número de partidas arancelarias utilizadas para la exportación del Sacha Inchi a dicho mercado;así mismo se analizaron las importaciones canadienses en general respecto a las partidas arancelarias más utilizadas en el Perú para la exportación de Sacha Inchi a dicho mercado, con el objetivo de demostrar la prosperidad del segmento de mercado para el Sacha Inchi en Canadá. Finalmente, se concluyó que la ventana de oportunidad del mercado canadiense influirá positivamente incrementando las exportaciones peruanas de Sacha Inchi en el año 2014, razón por la cual, según reafirman los expertos entrevistados, deberá ser aprovechada por los exportadores peruanos para lograr el éxito en dicho mercado...|$|R
