50|$|Fair dealing {{is to be}} {{examined}} on a case-by-case basis.

Those favouring a broad interpretation of fair dealing argue {{there ought to be}} reasonable unauthorized reproduction of works because it facilitates creativity and free expression. They also argue that fair dealing provides reasonable access to existing knowledge. Those arguing that fair dealing ought to be more restrictive and specific state that fair dealing will reduce revenue to those creating works. They also argue the reproduction of works and sends a wrong message to the public that works are free as long as it falls under this banner. Their economic argument is that fair dealing should not compensate for the market's inability to meet the demand for public knowledge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} fair dealing {{allows users to}} engage in some {{activities}} {{that might otherwise be}} considered copyright infringement.

The second step assesses whether <b>the</b> <b>dealing</b> is “fair”. A number of fairness factors are used to help courts determine if <b>the</b> <b>dealing</b> is [...] "fair": the purpose, character, and amount of the dealing; the existence of any alternatives to the dealing; the nature of the work; and the effect of <b>the</b> <b>dealing</b> on <b>the</b> work. The person invoking the doctrine of “fair dealing” bears onus to satisfy all aspects of the test.|$|R
