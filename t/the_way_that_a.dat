25|$|The eye {{has limited}} {{bandwidth}} {{to the rest}} of the visual system, estimated at just under 8 Mbit/s.

Television, using power from the electrical grid, tunes its rate in order to avoid interference with the alternating current being supplied – in North America, some Central and South American countries, Taiwan, Korea, part of Japan, the Philippines, and a few other countries, this is 60 video fields per second to match the 60Hz power, while in most other countries it is 50 fields per second to match the 50Hz power.|$|E
25|$|Schwartz's firm {{worked on}} the {{proposal}} {{for over a year}} and considered five options aside from streetcars. One other option, Select Bus Service, was estimated to cost $1 billion to implement, and wasn't chosen as it wouldn't raise property values <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> streetcar would. The engineers projected 52,000 to 53,000 riders per day on the streetcar, which would have required a bus every minute. Each street car would be able to carry 150 to 175 passengers. Additionally, buses would also have a harder time navigating the 12 to 15 streets along the route. The engineers' route would have its own dedicated lanes for the whole route. The study recommended that two facilities for maintenance and storage would be built at a cost of $100 million. In addition, the streetcar would need at least 140 employees to operate the streetcars {{and a host of other}} workers, including traffic enforcement agents.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Bennett, in 1994, {{discussed}} the poem's effectiveness: [...] "What {{is important and}} compelling in this poem {{is not so much}} what happens on the urn or in the poem, but <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> response to an artwork both figures and prefigures its own critical response". In 1999, Andrew Motion claimed that the poem [...] "tells a story that cannot be developed. Celebrating the transcendent powers of art, it creates a sense of imminence, but also registers a feeling of frustration." [...] Ayumi Mizukoshi, in 2001, argued that early audiences did not support [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] because it [...] "turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' drew neither attention nor admiration. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> person frames a {{situation}} heavily influences a decision's outcome. Research on [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "cool" [...] strategies suggests that when children cognitively represent {{what they are}} waiting for as a real reward {{by focusing on the}} reward's arousing, [...] "hot" [...] qualities (taste, smell, sound, feel, etc.) their self-control and delay of gratification decreases, while directing attention to a symbol of the reward by focusing on its abstract, [...] "cool" [...] qualities (shape, color, number, etc.), can enhance self-control and increase the delay. Optimal self-control and the longest delay to gratification can be achieved by directing attention to a competing item, especially the arousing, [...] "hot" [...] qualities of a competing item. For example, delays are increased when thinking about the taste and smell of popcorn while waiting to eat candy. This illustrates an individual's ability to manipulate his/her cognitive representation of external stimuli for goal-directed purposes.|$|E

500|$|When Rhodes was {{involved}} in matches, Cardus believed that [...] "he {{was not a man}} given to affability", showing annoyance on the field and being critical of the performances of others.

An introvert, he did not always get along with the more extrovert Hirst, possibly owing to mutual jealousy and some of Hirst's jocular comments, and was rarely pictured smiling. However, Rhodes became more relaxed and approachable in later life, particularly after his eyesight failed. Cardus was surprised, after meeting him in 1950, at how much more readily Rhodes engaged in conversation, commenting that [...] "history comes from his mouth in rivers". His obituary in The Times concluded: [...] "Gruff or mellow, he was all of a piece, a fighting Yorkshireman, superbly gifted." ...|$|E
500|$|Pluto's {{rotation}} period, its day, {{is equal}} to 6.39 Earth days. Like Uranus, Pluto rotates on its [...] "side" [...] in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120°, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its solstices, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness. The reason for this unusual orientation has been debated. Research from University of Arizona has suggested {{that it may be}} due to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> body's spin will always adjust to minimise energy. This could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles. This is called polar wander. According to a paper released from the University of Arizona, this could be caused by masses of frozen nitrogen building up in shadowed areas of the dwarf planet. These masses would cause the body to reorientate itself, leading to its unusual axial tilt of 120°. The buildup of nitrogen is due to Pluto's vast distance from the Sun. At the equator, temperatures can drop to , causing nitrogen to freeze as water would freeze on Earth. The same effect seen on Pluto would be observed on Earth if the Antarctic ice sheet was several times larger.|$|E

500|$|During the concepting {{process of}} Halo 4, O'Connor {{decided it would}} be best for the {{franchise}} to explore the Forerunner fiction of the Halo universe, which had remained largely a mystery before 343 Industries' involvement in the franchise. This ultimately {{led to the creation of}} a new race of enemy, the Prometheans, warriors of the Forerunner empire. Given that the Forerunners themselves had never been featured in previous Halo games, the design process for the appearance of the Prometheans was long and tedious. [...] The art team produced a large number of sketches, which were presented to other member's of the studio to get feedback and reactions. Many variations of different character models were concepted before the team decided on a final design. The main goal when designing their appearance was to make them resonate with the player, and evoke the image of the Forerunner architecture and language that had been portrayed in previous Halo media. Upon death, the Promethean Knight dissolves from the point where it was last shot; this visual effect also occurs when certain enemies are killed by Promethean weapons. From a gameplay standpoint the design for the Prometheans also needed to fit in well with the sandbox so they would be suitable enemies to fight. A goal when designing their behaviour was to make them highly adaptive from a tactical standpoint. For example, the Promethean Knight can phase in and out of space, allowing it to retreat or charge the player at any given moment; this changes <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> player engages in a combat encounter.|$|E
