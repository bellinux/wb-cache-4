5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and <b>tears</b> <b>on</b> the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} a year with Cheerleader, Rollason left the company to {{concentrate}} on her broadcasting career, and became a freelance reporter. She covered the 1987 World Student Games from Zagreb for Thames Television, and then presented the 1988 World Junior Athletics championships from Sudbury, Ontario for Channel 4. Later on in 1988, she provided coverage of that year's Summer Olympics, held in Seoul, for ITV. During the mid-1980s, she also joined the presenting team of the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, with a view to increasing its sports coverage, and presented several features on topics such as gymnastics and female jockeys, as well as presenting Newsround Extra, a show that covered a specific issue in more detail. One such programme was a report on the street children of Bogotá, a subject that deeply moved her and reduced her to <b>tears</b> <b>on</b> screen.|$|E
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or <b>tears</b> <b>on</b> the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E

5|$|Massive Dynamic {{executive}} Mark Young (Ptolemy Slocum) {{delivers a}} {{presentation at the}} company’s Manhattan office. When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon picking it up, he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing {{to go out to}} dinner with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding <b>tears</b> <b>on</b> his shirt. At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.|$|E
5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She burst into <b>tears</b> <b>on</b> the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of <b>tears)</b> <b>on</b> the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Bigg {{and his colleagues}} {{discovered}} that individual killer whales can be identified from a good photograph of the animal's dorsal fin and saddle patch taken when it surfaces.

25|$|In January 2014, Van Gerwen won the World Championship and {{replaced}} Taylor {{as the world}} number one, and a month later inflicted the first whitewash over Taylor in Premier League history by beating him 7–0 in 13 minutes {{with an average of}} 109.59. Van Gerwen whitewashed Taylor 4–0 in the final of the World Cup, en route to the Netherlands' 3–0 win over England. In July, they contested the final of the World Matchplay; Taylor won 11 of the first 13 legs and went on to win 18–9, averaging 107.27. The loss reduced Van Gerwen to <b>tears</b> <b>on</b> the stage afterwards.
