40|$|International audiencePrenatal HIV {{counselling}} {{and testing}} is mainly an entry-point to {{the prevention of}} mother-to-child transmission of HIV, {{but it may also}} {{play an important role in}} triggering the development of spousal communication about HIV and sexual risks and thus the adoption of a preventive attitude. In Abidjan, C?d'Ivoire, we investigated couple communication on STIs and HIV, male partner HIV-testing and condom use at sex resumption after delivery among three groups of pregnant women who were offered prenatal counselling and HIV testing: HIV-infected women, uninfected women, and women who refused HIV-testing. The proportion of women who discussed STIs with their regular partner greatly increased after prenatal HIV counselling and testing in all three groups, irrespective of the women's serostatus and even in the case of test refusal. Spousal communication was related to more frequent male partner HIV-testing and condom use.

An MO for HIV testing {{was defined as a}} medical consultation for a clinical indicator (e. g. symptoms, hospitalization, and pregnancy) or a non-clinical indicator (e. g. high-risk sexual behavior, HIV-infected partner) potentially related to an HIV infection but did not lead to HIV <b>test</b> <b>proposal</b> by a health care professional. Of the 341 patients who attended the center suring this period, 273 (157 women and 116 men) were included in this analysis. 130 (47. 6 %) reported at least one medical consultation for an indicator relevant for a <b>test</b> <b>proposal</b> between 1 month and five years prior to their diagnosis.

40|$|This article investigates a fatigue {{approach}} conducted {{from the}} design phase to testing approval. It considerers modern analytical and experimental tools for structural durability assessment over each development phase for two reference components aiming an early approval methodology validation {{for a new}} design. A Finite element analysis procedure was used to set critical spots for measurements minimizing the data acquisition efforts. Based on measured data, strain life calculation was done for two reference components in order to set the release goals for a new design submitted to this approach. An innovative fatigue experimental technique is proposed using component extracted specimens and an edited input cycle loads. Considering the random data from a standard test track and signal proportionality evaluation, while assuming the Brown Miller equation for bi-axial fatigue together with Ramberg-Osgood model, equivalent damage load blocks were edited and used as input for durability assessment on specimens representing the component material. The results for the three parts materials were plotted as Weibull diagram for B 10 life estimation. Fatigue life results showed good correlation with the reference parts structural performance thus validating the method as well as approving the new design for production without additional on-vehicle durability testing. The methodology and the fatigue <b>testing</b> <b>proposal</b> is therefore recommended for future applications on similar developments...|$|E
40|$|A University of California faculty committee, the Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS), has {{recommended}} eliminating achievement tests and requiring only the “New SAT” {{for admission to}} the UC system. The proposal to endorse the New SAT has thus far drawn relatively little notice, as {{it is part of}} a broader and more controversial set of proposed changes in how UC identifies the top 12. 5 percent of California high school graduates who are eligible for admission. Yet the <b>testing</b> <b>proposal</b> deserves much more attention in its own right since, if approved by the Regents, it would reverse a decade of UC research and policy development. In 2002 UC was among the first universities to adopt a formal policy on admissions testing. That policy strongly favored achievement tests, which measure students’ knowledge of college-preparatory subjects, over tests of general reasoning such as the SAT. UC research showed that achievement tests predicted student performance in college at least as well as reasoning tests, while having a less adverse impact on low-income and minority applicants. In response to UC, the College Board introduced several changes in the SAT in 2005, including the addition of a writing exam, intended to position the New SAT as more of an achievement test. The UC Regents provisionally approved use of the New SAT on the understanding that BOARS would conduct a careful evaluation of the extent to which the test conformed to UC’s 2002 testing policy before the New SAT was adopted on a permanent basis. That evaluation has never been completed. Moreover, a closer look at BOARS’ proposal reveals that it is based on questionable and often misleading evidence. Like the old SAT, the New SAT remains a relatively weak predictor of student success at UC and a strong deterrent to admission of low-income and underrepresented minority applicants. Achievement tests remain the better standard for UC admissions...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} {{developing}} a fundamental conceptual design for a gas-cooled, modular, pebble bed reactor. Key technology areas associated with this design are being investigated which intend to address issues concerning fuel performance, safety, core neutronics and proliferation resistance, economics and waste disposal. Research has been initiated in the following areas: · Improved fuel particle performance · Reactor physics · Economics · Proliferation resistance · Power conversion system modeling · Safety analysis · Regulatory and licensing strategy Recent accomplishments include: · Developed four conceptual models for fuel particle failures that are currently being evaluated {{by a series of}} ABAQUS analyses. Analytical fits to the results are being performed over a range of important parameters using statistical/factorial tools. The fits will be used in a Monte Carlo fuel performance code, which is under development. · A fracture mechanics approach has been used to develop a failure probability model for the fuel particle, which has resulted in significant improvement over earlier models. · Investigation of fuel particle physio-chemical behavior has been initiated which includes the development of a fission gas release model, particle temperature distributions, internal particle pressure, migration of fission products, and chemical attack of fuel particle layers. · A balance of plant, steady-state thermal hydraulics model has been developed to represent all major components of a MPBR. Component models are being refined to accurately reflect transient performance. · A comparison between air and helium for use in the energy-conversion cycle of the MPBR has been completed and formed the basis of a master’s degree thesis. · Safety issues associated with air ingress are being evaluated. · Post shutdown, reactor heat removal characteristics are being evaluated by the Heating- 7 code. · PEBBED, a fast deterministic neutronic code package suitable for numerous repetitive calculations has been developed. Use of the code has focused on scoping studies for MPBR design features and proliferation issues. Publication of an archival journal article covering this work is being prepared. · Detailed gas reactor physics calculations have also been performed with the MCNP and VSOP codes. Furthermore, studies on the proliferation resistance of the MPBR fuel cycle has been initiated using these code · Issues identified during the MPBR research has resulted in a NERI proposal dealing with turbo-machinery design being approved for funding beginning in FY 01.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is the evaluation of {{a proposal for a}} gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test, used for study of hydrogen cracks in relatively thin sheets of welded steel. That new proposal consists of the replacement of the usual solid blocks by an assembly of blocks {{in such a way that}} the test can evaluate weld beads on thin sheets. Student t distribution is applied to examine the functionality of the proposed test. Weld metals were deposited with flux-cored wires E 71 T- 1 and E 71 T 8 -K 6, with diameters of 1. 6 and 1. 7 mm, respectively, under two different preheating temperatures. Metal susceptibility to hydrogen cracking was evaluated by the presence and percentage of cracks in the weld metal. In order to evaluate and verify the functionality of the new G-BOP <b>test</b> <b>proposal,</b> the following were examined: efficiency of the new test in inducing hydrogen cracks in the weld metal, result replicability, fracture modes present in cracks, and the cooling rate imposed on the welding zone.

We describe missed opportunities for earlier HIV testing in newly-HIV-diagnosed patients. METHODS: Cross sectional study. Adults living in France for >= 1 year, diagnosed with HIV-infection <= 6 months earlier, were included from 06 / 2009 to 10 / 2010. We collected information on patient characteristics at diagnosis, history of HIV testing, contacts with healthcare settings, and occurrence of HIV-related events 3 years prior to HIV diagnosis. During these 3 years, we assessed whether or not HIV testing had been proposed by the healthcare provider upon first contact in patients notifying that they were MSM or had HIV-related conditions. RESULTS: 1, 008 newly HIV-diagnosed patients (mean age: 39 years; male: 79 %; MSM: 53 %; diagnosed with an AIDS-defining event: 16 %). During the 3 -year period prior to HIV diagnosis, 99 % of participants had frequented a healthcare setting and 89 % had seen a general practitioner {{at least once a}} year.
