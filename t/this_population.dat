5|$|Cats hunt small prey, {{primarily}} {{birds and}} rodents, {{and are often}} used {{as a form of}} pest control. Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.4–3.7 billion birds and 6.9–20.7 billion mammals annually. The bulk of predation in the United States is done by 80 million feral and stray cats. Effective measures to reduce <b>this</b> <b>population</b> are elusive, meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts. In the case of free-ranging pets, equipping cats with bells and not letting them out at night will reduce wildlife predation.|$|E

However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. <b>This</b> <b>population</b> has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.

It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in <b>this</b> <b>population</b> is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E

5|$|Mustelids {{have never}} colonised Stewart Island/Rakiura, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it was {{apparent}} that cats killed kakapo at a rate of 56% per year. At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed kakapo were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that <b>this</b> <b>population</b> should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales can {{be found}} in oceans nearly worldwide, but data about current {{population}} sizes is deficient. The long-finned pilot whale prefers slightly cooler waters than the short-finned, and is divided into two populations. The smaller group is found in a circumpolar band in the Southern Ocean from about 20 to 65°S. It may be sighted off the coasts of Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. An estimated more than 200,000 individuals were in <b>this</b> <b>population</b> in 2006. The second, much larger, population inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean, in a band from South Carolina in the United States across to the Azores and Morocco at its southern edge and from Newfoundland to Greenland, Iceland, and northern Norway at its northern limit. <b>This</b> <b>population</b> was estimated at 778,000 individuals in 1989.

As a result, the retention rates for <b>this</b> student <b>population</b> have traditionally been lower than for other student populations. In order to support the persistence of <b>this</b> student <b>population</b> it is important to study the experiences of those students who are persisting in college. This study explores the college experiences of seven low income, first-generation students who are persisting in college, in order to better understand how university faculty and staff can better support degree attainment for <b>this</b> student <b>population.</b> <b>This</b> qualitative study addresses the question, "What are the experiences of persisting low income, first-generation students during their enrollment in college?" The study also addresses the two secondary questions, "What factors contribute to low income, first-generation student persistence?" and "How can their university better support low income, first-generation students to graduation?" This study explores the emerging themes of the challenges <b>this</b> student <b>population</b> faces and their personal drive and motivation to persist in college, as well as experiences with advising and orientation, academic support resources, and non-academic support resources. The end result of this study is a set of suggestions for how university faculty and staff can provide resources to better support low income, first-generation students in their college persistence...|$|R
