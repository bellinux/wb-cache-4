60|$|But {{the shouts}} had died away behind them, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> {{the sound of}} the {{galloping}} of their horses' hoofs. Then that also grew faint and died away, and silence and darkness fell upon the mind of Wulf.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the silence}} that ensued <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> that of old Gaunt supping at his crusty-broth.

60|$|They {{arrived at}} the old house, and stood, listening, {{in the shadow of}} <b>the</b> doorway. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> those of distant barking dogs, and of the bugles at the barracks.|$|R

60|$|The two lads {{remained}} motionless {{in the saddle}} for several minutes, listening. No other howl reached their ears, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> that of <b>the</b> rushing stream as it tumbled over some rocks, and {{the cries of the}} night birds and the humming of the insects.|$|R
60|$|We {{heard the}} doors close behind her, and the distant voices of those who bore her litter, then all was silence. Otomie listened at the window for a while, but the guards seemed to be gone, where or why I do not know to this hour, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> that of distant revelry from the camp.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the evening}} before Aynsley’s departure, and he and Clay and the Osbornes {{were sitting on the}} veranda. Not a breath of wind was stirring, and the inlet {{stretched}} back, smooth as oil and shining in the evening light. The tops of the tall cedars were motionless; not a ripple broke upon the beach; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the soft splash of water somewhere among the trees.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} to be seen from the bright cabin windows of the GOLDEN CITY but night {{deepening}} over the water. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the pattering rain, and that had grown monotonous for the past two weeks, and did not disturb the national gravity of my countrymen as they silently sat around the cabin stove. Some on errands of relief to friends and relatives wore anxious faces, and conversed soberly on the one absorbing topic. Others, like myself, attracted by curiosity listened eagerly to newer details. But with that human disposition to seize upon any circumstance that might give chance event the exaggerated importance of instinct, I was half-conscious of something more than curiosity as an impelling motive.|$|E

60|$|Once {{more the}} house was quiet. Hamel pushed his window wide open and looked out into the night. The air was {{absolutely}} still, there was no wind. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the falling of the low waves upon the stony beach and the faint scrunching of the pebbles drawn back by the ebb. He looked along the row of windows, all dark and silent now. A rush of pleasant fancies suddenly chased away the grim depression {{of the last few}} minutes. Out of all this sordidness and mystery there remained at least something in life for him to do. A certain aimlessness of purpose which had troubled him during the last few months had disappeared. He had found an object in life.|$|E

60|$|She stood, and looked. And all the leapings and pulsings {{of flesh}} and spirit slowly died in that wide dark loneliness, where <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the wistful {{breaking}} of small waves. She was well used to these dead hours--only last night, at this very time, Harbinger's arm had been round her in a last waltz! But here the dead hours had such different faces, wide-eyed, solemn, and there came to Barbara, staring out at them, {{a sense that the}} darkness saw her very soul, so that it felt little and timid within her. She shivered in her fur-lined coat, as if almost frightened at finding herself so marvellously nothing before that black sky and dark sea, which seemed all one, relentlessly great.... And crouching down, she waited for the dawn to break.|$|E
60|$|Christian {{uttered a}} cry. For a minute in <b>the</b> gloom <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> heard <b>was</b> <b>the</b> short, hard {{breathing}} {{of the two}} men.|$|R
60|$|They {{held their}} breath, so that almost <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> patter {{of the rain}} and the hiss of the raindrops in the ashes. And then, after an interminable time, a crash, and a shriek of fear, and a growling. They sprang to their feet, shouting, screaming, running this way and that, but brands would not burn, and in a minute the victim was being dragged away through the ferns. It was Irk, the brother of Wau.|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} {{standing at the}} edge of the pit that the Thing had made for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already warm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> faint movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the common.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Jim took up an {{advantageous}} {{position and}} shepherded {{them out in}} a bunch through the doorway: all that time the torch had remained vertical {{in the grip of}} a little hand, without so much as a tremble. The three men obeyed him, perfectly mute, moving automatically. He ranged them in a row. [...] "Link arms!" [...] he ordered. They did so. [...] "The first who withdraws his arm or turns his head is a dead man," [...] he said. [...] "March!" [...] They stepped out together, rigidly; he followed, and at the side the girl, in a trailing white gown, her black hair falling as low as her waist, bore the light. Erect and swaying, she seemed to glide without touching the earth; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the silky swish and rustle of the long grass. [...] "Stop!" [...] cried Jim.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, a late hour of {{the next}} night found these two gentlemen, {{accompanied}} by a son of the minister, in {{the road in front}} of the old Deluse house. There was a light inside; it appeared now at one window and now at another. The three men advanced to the door. Just as they reached it there came from the interior a confusion of the most appalling sounds--the clash of weapons, steel against steel, sharp explosions as of firearms, shrieks of women, groans and the curses of men in combat! The investigators stood a moment, irresolute, frightened. Then Mr. Galbraith tried the door. It was fast. But the minister was a man of courage, a man, moreover, of Herculean strength. He retired a pace or two and rushed against the door, striking it with his right shoulder and bursting it from the frame with a loud crash. In a moment the three were inside. Darkness and silence! <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the beating of their hearts.|$|E
60|$|They {{selected}} rooms--Maraton and Selingman adjoining ones on {{the first}} floor; the others higher up. Then Selingman departed on his expedition, and Maraton sat down before {{the window in the}} sitting-room. He drew aside the curtain and stared. They had been in the hotel rather less than half an hour, but the autumn twilight had deepened rapidly. Darkness had fallen upon the city--a strange, unredeemed darkness. The street lamps were unlit. It was as though a black hand had been laid upon the place. Only here and there the sky was reddened as though with conflagration. Maraton's head sunk upon his arms. These, indeed, were the days when he would need all his courage. He threw open the window. There was a curious silence without. The roar of traffic had ceased entirely. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the footfall of the people upon the pavement. He looked down into the street, crowded with little knots of men, one or two of them carrying torches. He watched them stream by. It was the breaking up of the crowd which had gathered together to sack and burn his house.|$|E
50|$|Hillsides {{thick with}} trees line the Wilson Trail where Section 4 climbs up from Tseng Lan Shue. Utterly {{different}} {{to the open}} ridges of the previous section, here an old stone paved village path ascends into the hills. The air is moist, the ground carpeted with fallen leaves. Lichen covered trees and jumbled boulders line the trail. Farther up, deeper into the woods, the last sounds of the village fade. With no distant views to savour, close up details dominate. Bright green foliage shimmers with <b>the</b> wet. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> buzz of insects, chirping birds and the drip-drip of ground water.|$|R
50|$|These words {{describe}} Vernazza’s art perfectly. However, they do {{not belong}} to him. The mime Marcel Marceau spoke this praise. Vernazza made a series of drawings of Marceau during a series of the mime's South American tours. The mime also pointed to the relationship between his work and Spanish dance. Arms up, bodies that transform the dancers into trees or beasts, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> music and stamping hard on one's feet. No words to explain what happens among the dancers. Vernazza also draws and paints {{some of the most important}} figures of Spanish dance: Carmen Amaya, Antonio Gadez, and Cristina Hoyos.|$|R
50|$|The h <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> nasalized {{in several}} languages, {{apparently}} {{due to a}} connection between glottal and nasal sounds called rhinoglottophilia. Examples of languages where <b>the</b> <b>only</b> h-like <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> nasalized are Krim, Lisu, and Pirahã.|$|R
6000|$|When she {{had been}} {{properly}} undressed and made to {{lie down on the}} sofa, for she insisted so that she would not go to bed that they dared not oppose her, the doctor made his diagnosis. It was double pneumonia, of that sudden sort which declares for life or death in forty-eight hours. At her age a desperate case. Her children must be wired to at once. She had sunk back, seemingly unconscious; and Augustine, approaching the drawer where she knew the letters were kept, slipped out the lavender sachet and gave it to the doctor. When he had left the room to extract the addresses and send those telegrams, the girl sat down by the foot of the couch, leaning her elbows on her knees and her face on her hands, staring at that motionless form, while the tears streamed down her broad cheeks. For many minutes neither of them stirred, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the restless stropping of the parrot's beak against a wire of his cage. Then her mistress's lips moved, and the girl bent forward. A whispering came forth, caught and suspended by breathless pausing: ...|$|E
60|$|The chapel, {{where you}} might trace art from the richly Gothic tomb, {{designed}} by some neighbouring abbot, to the last effort of Flaxman; the riding-house, where, brightly framed, looked down upon you with a courtly smile the first and gartered duke, who had been Master of the Horse, were alike visited, and alike admired. They mounted {{the summit of the}} round tower, and looked around upon the broad county, which they were proud to call their own. Amid innumerable seats, where blazed the hearths of the best blood of England, they recognised, with delight, the dome of Dacre and the woods of Dallington. They walked along a terrace not unworthy of the promenade of a court; they visited the flower gardens, where the peculiar style of every nation was in turn imitated; they loitered in the vast conservatories, which were themselves a palace; they wandered in the wilderness, where the invention of consummate art presented them with the ideal of nature. In this poetic solitude, where all was green, and still, and sweet, or where <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> falling water or fluttering birds, the young Duke recurred to the feelings which, during the last momentous week, had so mastered his nature, and he longed to wind his arm round the beautiful being without whom this enchanting domain was a dreary waste.|$|E
60|$|The {{engineer}} did not answer, {{and they}} ate their supper in silence. The cabin was {{lit by a}} dim oil lamp. When they had eaten the canned apricots with which the meal finished the Chink brought them a cup of tea. The skipper lit a cigar and went on the upper deck. The island now was only a darker mass against the night. The stars were very bright. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the ceaseless breaking of the surf. The skipper sank into a deck-chair and smoked idly. Presently three or {{four members of the}} crew came up and sat down. One of them had a banjo and another a concertina. They began to play, and one of them sang. The native song sounded strange on these instruments. Then to the singing a couple began to dance. It was a barbaric dance, savage and primeval, rapid, with quick movements of the hands and feet and contortions of the body; it was sensual, sexual even, but sexual without passion. It was very animal, direct, weird without mystery, natural in short, and one might almost say childlike. At last they grew tired. They stretched themselves on the deck and slept, and all was silent. The skipper lifted himself heavily out of his chair and clambered down the companion. He went into his cabin and got out of his clothes. He climbed into his bunk and lay there. He panted a little {{in the heat of the}} night.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} the rapid dip of our paddles and {{the rush of}} our canoe through <b>the</b> water <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that <b>were</b> heard. Then Peterkin spoke again. He could never keep silence for any great length of time.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{stifling}} afternoon. As I trod {{the yellow}} gravel the quivering atmosphere all but blinded me with its reflected glare. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> to <b>be</b> heard were the clang of a milkman's hand-cart, and the pirouettes {{of a distant}} piano.|$|R
5000|$|Hunter S. Thompson's book Hell's Angels {{includes}} an ode to {{the joys of}} pushing a motorcycle to its limits, [...] "with the throttle screwed on there is <b>only</b> <b>the</b> barest margin, and no room at all for mistakes ... that's when the strange music starts ... fear becomes exhilaration <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> wind and a dull roar floating back from the mufflers" [...] and T. E. Lawrence wrote of the [...] "lustfulness of moving swiftly" [...] and the [...] "pleasure of speeding on the road". A sensation he compared to feeling [...] "the earth moulding herself under me ... coming alive ... and heaving and tossing on each side like a sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'After all,' he told himself, 'it's {{a little}} thing to ask--one letter a month. I never {{heard of such a}} case.' It was {{wonderful}} indeed how they stood it! It showed how much they valued Pippin! What was the matter with him? What was the nature of his trouble? One glimpse Scorrier had when even Hemmings, as he phrased it, received [...] "quite a turn." [...] It was during a drive back from the most outlying of the company's trial mines, eight miles through the forest. The track led through a belt of trees blackened by a forest fire. Pippin was driving. The secretary seated beside him wore an expression of faint alarm, such as Pippin's driving was warranted to evoke from almost any face. The sky had darkened strangely, but pale streaks of light, coming from one knew not where, filtered through the trees. No breath was stirring; the wheels and horses' hoofs made no sound on the deep fern mould. All around, the burnt tree-trunks, leafless and jagged, rose like withered giants, the passages between them were black, the sky black, and black the silence. No one spoke, and literally <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> Pippin's breathing. What was it that was so terrifying? Scorrier had a feeling of entombment; that nobody could help him; the feeling of being face to face with Nature; a sensation as if all the comfort and security of words and rules had dropped away from him. And-nothing happened. They reached home and dined.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{scene of}} death hath Roscius now to act?" [...] I muttered to myself as I {{looked at the}} dark casements. At first I thought I saw a light in one of them, but {{it proved to be}} merely the {{refraction}} of the moon-beams, while <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the crackling branches as the breeze whirred the snow flakes from them--the moon sailed high and unclouded in the interminable ether, while the shadow of the cottage lay black on the garden behind. I entered this by the open wicket, and anxiously examined each window. At length I detected a ray of light struggling through a closed shutter in one of the upper rooms--it was a novel feeling, alas! to look at any house and say there dwells its usual inmate--the door of the house was merely on the latch: so I entered and ascended the moon-lit staircase. The door of the inhabited room was ajar: looking in, I saw Lucy sitting as at work at the table on which the light stood; the implements of needlework were about her, but her hand had fallen on her lap, and her eyes, fixed on the ground, shewed by their vacancy that her thoughts wandered. Traces of care and watching had diminished her former attractions--but her simple dress and cap, her desponding attitude, and the single candle that cast its light upon her, gave for a moment a picturesque grouping to the whole. A fearful reality recalled me from the thought--a figure lay stretched on the bed covered by a sheet--her mother was dead, and Lucy, apart from all the world, deserted and alone, watched beside the corpse during the weary night. I entered the room, and my unexpected appearance at first drew a scream from the lone survivor of a dead nation; but she recognised me, and recovered herself, with the quick exercise of self-control habitual to her. [...] "Did you not expect me?" [...] I asked, in that low voice which the presence of the dead makes us as it were instinctively assume.|$|E
60|$|I {{had plenty}} of time to think of this, for the rain kept me {{practically}} housed for the first twenty-four hours. It had been raining in, these regions for a month, and people had begun to look askance at the Rhone, though as yet the volume of the river was not exorbitant. The only excursion possible, while the torrent descended, was a kind of horizontal dive, ac- companied with infinite splashing, to the little musee of the town, which is within a moderate walk of the hotel. I had a memory of it from my first visit; it had appeared to me more pictorial than its pictures. I found that recollection had flattered it a little, and that it is neither better nor worse than most provincial museums. It has the usual musty chill in the air, the usual grass-grown fore-court, in which a few lumpish Roman fragments are disposed, the usual red tiles on the floor, and the usual specimens of the more livid schools on the walls. I rang up the gardien, who ar- rived with a bunch of keys, wiping his mouth; he un- locked doors for me, opened shutters, and while (to my distress, as if the things had been worth lingering over) he shuffled about after me, he announced the names of the pictures before which I stopped, in a voice that reverberated through the melancholy halls, and seemed to make the authorship shameful when it was obscure, and grotesque when it pretended to be great. Then there were intervals of silence, while I stared absent-mindedly, at hap-hazard, at some indis- tinguishable canvas, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> the down- pour of the rain on the skylights. The museum of Avignon derives a certain dignity from its Roman frag- ments. The town has no Roman monuments to show; in this respect, beside its brilliant neighbors, Arles and Nimes, it is a blank. But a great many small objects have been found in its soil, - pottery, glass, bronzes, lamps, vessels and ornaments of gold and silver. The glass is especially chaming, - small vessels of the most delicate shape and substance, many of them perfectly preserved. These diminutive, intimate things bring one near to the old Roman life; they seem like pearls strung upon the slender thread that swings across the gulf of time. A little glass cup that Roman lips have touched says more to us than the great vessel of an arena. There are two small silver casseroles, with chi- selled handles, in the museum of Avignon, that struck me as among the most charming survivals of anti- quity.|$|E
40|$|March, 2008. 7 : 45 am. I'm on a cosy train goingfrom Ashford to East Sheen, in Greater London. The {{train is}} packed with {{passengers}} -sitting, standing. People of diverse ages, backgrounds and ethnicity. They {{are on their way}} to work or school. Most of them are reading papers or books; some stare somewhere out of focus, avoiding eye-contact. A few fiddle with their laptop, while others have their eyes closed. Nobody speaks - <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> du- dum, du-dum of the train on the rails, and the rustle of newspapers.
