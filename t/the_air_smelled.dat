60|$|When {{she awoke}} from the sleep into {{which she had}} seen Miltoun fall, the cab was slowly {{mounting}} a steep hill, above which the moon had risen. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> strong and sweet, {{as though it had}} passed over leagues of grass.|$|E
60|$|Alas! {{she had no}} time {{to finish}} her polite objection, for the next moment she felt herself lifted in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>smelled</b> the bark thatch within an inch of her nose, saw the firelight vanish behind her, and subsiding into his curved arms as in a hammock, the two passed forth into the night together.|$|E

6000|$|And {{while her}} brother lay {{face to the}} sky under the tamarisks, she kept {{trying to think of}} how to console him, {{conscious}} that she did not in the least understand the way he thought about things. Over the fields behind, the larks were hymning the promise of the unripe corn; the foreshore was painted all colours, from vivid green to mushroom pink; by the edge of the blue sea little black figures stooped, gathering sapphire. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> sweet {{in the shade of the}} tamarisk; there was ineffable peace. And Barbara, covered by the network of sunlight, could not help impatience with a suffering which seemed to her so corrigible by action. At last she ventured: ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{climbed the}} {{staircase}} where dim light lay so invitingly, and came presently {{to a little}} darker chamber. Green, blunt things had pushed and burst through the casement. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> faintly-sour of brier, and was as still as boughs of snow. There the not-unhappy Princess reclined before a looking-glass, whither I suppose she had run to view her own alarm when the sharp needle pierced her thumb. All alarm was stilled now on her face. She, one might think, of all that company of the sleepy, {{was the only one}} that dreamed. Her youthful lips lay a little asunder; the heavy beauty of her hair was parted on her forehead; her childish hands sidled together like leverets in her lap. [...] "Why!" [...] I cried aloud, almost involuntarily, [...] "she breathes!" ...|$|E
60|$|After dinner {{they went}} out on to the terrace to have coffee. They sat there long, the evening was so lovely, {{watching}} the summer night come very slowly on. It was still warm and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> of lime blossom--early this summer. Two bats were flighting with the faint mysterious little noise they make. He had placed the chairs {{in front of the}} study window, and moths flew past to visit the discreet light in there. There was no wind, and not a whisper in the old oak-tree twenty yards away! The moon rose from behind the copse, nearly full; and the two lights struggled, till moonlight conquered, changing the colour and quality of all the garden, stealing along the flagstones, reaching their feet, climbing up, changing their faces.|$|E

6000|$|All that long, silent jog {{home with}} Winton in fading daylight, she felt very happy--saturated with air and elation. The trees and fields, the hay-stacks, gates, and ponds beside the lanes grew dim; lights {{came up in}} the cottage windows; <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> sweet of wood smoke. And, for the first time all day, she thought of Fiorsen, thought of him almost longingly. If he could be there in the cosy old drawing-room, to play to her while she lay back--drowsing, dreaming by the fire in the scent of burning cedar logs--the Mozart minuet, or that little heart-catching tune of Poise, played the first time she heard him, or a dozen other of the things he played unaccompanied! That would be the most lovely ending to this lovely day. Just the glow and warmth wanting, to make all perfect--the glow and warmth of music and adoration! ...|$|E
6000|$|And Ashurst puffed his pipe. Awaken her! That fool had {{the best}} opinion of himself! He threw up the window and leaned out. Dusk had {{gathered}} thick. The farm buildings and the wheel-house were all dim and bluish, the apple trees but a blurred wilderness; <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> of woodsmoke from the kitchen fire. One bird going to bed later than the others was uttering a half-hearted twitter, as though surprised at the darkness. From the stable came the snuffle and stamp of a feeding horse. And away over there was the loom of the moor, and away and away the shy stars which had not as yet full light, pricking white through the deep blue heavens. A quavering owl hooted. Ashurst drew a deep breath. What a night to wander out in! A padding of unshod hoofs came up the lane, and three dim, dark shapes passed--ponies on an evening march. Their heads, black and fuzzy, showed above the gate. At the tap of his pipe, and a shower of little sparks, they shied round and scampered. A bat went fluttering past, uttering its almost inaudible [...] "chip, chip." [...] Ashurst held out his hand; on the upturned palm {{he could feel the}} dew. Suddenly from overhead he heard little burring boys' voices, little thumps of boots thrown down, and another voice, crisp and soft--the girl's putting them to bed, no doubt; and nine clear words [...] "No, Rick, you can't have the cat in bed"; then came a skirmish of giggles and gurgles, a soft slap, a laugh so low and pretty that it made him shiver a little. A blowing sound, and the glim of the candle which was fingering the dusk above, went out; silence reigned. Ashurst withdrew into the room and sat down; his knee pained him, and his soul felt gloomy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Life," [...] she wrote, [...] "is {{like looking}} at the night. One never knows what's coming, only suspects, as in the {{darkness}} you suspect which trees are what, and try to see whether you {{are coming to the}} edge of anything.... A moth has just flown into my candle before I could stop it! Has it gone quite out of the world? If so, why should it be different for us? The same great Something makes all life and death, all light and dark, all love and hate--then why one fate for one living thing, and the opposite for another? But suppose there IS nothing after death--would it make me say: 'I'd rather not live'? It would only make me delight more in life of every kind. Only human beings brood and are discontented, and trouble about future life. While Derek and I were sitting in that field this morning, a bumblebee flew to the bank and tucked its head into the grass and went to sleep, just tired out with flying and working at its flowers; it simply snoozed its head down and went off. We ought to live every minute to the utmost, and when we're tired out, tuck in our heads and sleep.... If only Derek is not brooding over that poor man! Poor man--all alone in the dark, with months of misery before him! Poor soul! Oh! I am sorry for all the unhappiness of people! I can't bear to think of it. I simply can't." [...] And dropping her pen, Nedda went again to her window and leaned out. So sweet <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> that it made her ache with delight to breathe it in. Each leaf that lived out there, each flower, each blade of grass, were sworn to conspiracy of perfume. And she thought: 'They MUST all love each other; it all goes together so beautifully!' Then, mingled with the incense of the night, she caught the savor of woodsmoke. It seemed to make the whole scent even more delicious, but she thought, bewildered: 'Smoke! Cruel fire--burning the wood that once grew leaves like those. Oh! it IS so mixed!' It was a thought others have had before her.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>air</b> {{was soft}} and grey and mild and evening was coming.

60|$|A {{half hour}} later a naked giant, {{swinging}} easily through the lower branches of the trees, paused, and with raised head, and dilating nostrils sniffed <b>the</b> morning <b>air.</b> <b>The</b> <b>smell</b> of blood fell strong upon his senses, and mingled with it was the scent of Numa, the lion. The giant cocked his head upon one side and listened.|$|R
6000|$|On Sunday morning, when Holly {{had gone}} with her governess to church, he visited the {{strawberry}} beds. There, accompanied by the dog Balthasar, he examined the plants narrowly and succeeded in finding at least two dozen berries which were really ripe. Stooping was not good for him, and he became very dizzy and red in the forehead. Having placed the strawberries in a dish on the dining-table, he washed his hands and bathed his forehead with eau de Cologne. There, before the mirror, {{it occurred to him}} that he was thinner. What a 'threadpaper' he had been when he was young! It was nice to be slim--he could not bear a fat chap; and yet perhaps his cheeks were too thin! She was to arrive by train at half-past twelve and walk up, entering from the road past Drage's farm at the far end of the coppice. And, having looked into June's room to see that there was hot water ready, he set forth to meet her, leisurely, for his heart was beating. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> sweet, larks sang, and the Grand Stand at Epsom was visible. A perfect day! On just such a one, no doubt, six years ago, Soames had brought young Bosinney down with him to look at the site before they began to build. It was Bosinney who had pitched on the exact spot for the house--as June had often told him. In these days he was thinking much about that young fellow, as if his spirit were really haunting the field of his last work, on the chance of seeing--her. Bosinney--the one man who had possessed her heart, to whom she had given her whole self with rapture! At his age one could not, of course, imagine such things, but there stirred in him a queer vague aching--as it were the ghost of an impersonal jealousy; and a feeling, too, more generous, of pity for that love so early lost. All over in a few poor months! Well, well! He looked at his watch before entering the coppice--only a quarter past, twenty-five minutes to wait! And then, turning the corner of the path, he saw her exactly where he had seen her the first time, on the log; and realised that she must have come by the earlier train to sit there alone for a couple of hours at least. Two hours of her society missed! What memory could make that log so dear to her? His face showed what he was thinking, for she said at once: ...|$|E
