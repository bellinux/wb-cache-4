25|$|The {{impetus for}} the {{construction}} of the tunnels came from the garrison's need to cover a blind angle on the north-east side of The Rock. The only solution found <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> angle was via a gun mounted on a spur of rock known as The Notch. There was no possibility of building a path there due to the vertical cliff face, so Sergeant-Major Henry Ince of the Military Artificers suggested digging a tunnel to reach it. His plan was approved and construction work began on 25 May 1782.|$|E

The existing L-Series 2-litre diesel was not suitable for use in Land Rover products and could not be developed into such a unit.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Moss lobbied {{the state}} {{legislature}} on behalf of Oregon's military veterans who were still owed pensions and back pay. In 1856, volunteers were promised $2 per day, but were only paid 55 cents. As a result, Oregon veterans were owed an average $118 for their service. Moss was a leading advocate for a state appropriation <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> obligation. Moss also continued to expand his business interest in Lakeview and throughout Lake County. He was {{on the board of}} director for the First National Bank of Lakeview and the Lake County Loan and Savings Bank. In 1910, Moss helped found the Chewaucan Mercantile Company. The purpose of the firm was to conduct general mercantile business in the Paisley area. The company was capitalized with $40,000 from eight shareholders, including Moss. Moss became a company director and was elected vice president of the company’s board. He was also an advocate for bringing the Nevada–California–Oregon Railway to Paisley.

500|$|Cannon {{was traded}} to the Oakland Raiders before the 1964 season. Raiders head coach Al Davis liked Cannon's {{abilities}} but did not know how he wanted to use him. At first Davis moved Cannon to fullback, where he was an asset in catching passes, an attribute not all fullbacks then possessed. After a slow start, he finished the season with 37 receptions for 454 yards and eight touchdowns. He also rushed for three more touchdowns. Next season Davis moved him to tight end, to the chagrin of Cannon; he expected to be made into a wide receiver, but the Raiders had both Art Powell and rookie Fred Biletnikoff <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> position. He eventually accepted his [...] new role and adapted quickly to it. However, the tight end was seldom used in the Raiders' offense. He caught only seven passes that season with no touchdowns. Before the 1966 season, John Rauch took over as head coach as Al Davis became AFL commissioner and the Raiders' general manager. Cannon established himself as a deep threat in Rauch's offense and caught fourteen passes for 436 yards—an average of 31.4 yards per reception.|$|E

With the docks in the harbour rendered unusable by German air attacks, senior naval officer Captain (later Admiral) William Tennant initially ordered men to be evacuated from the beaches. When this proved too slow, he re-routed the evacuees to two long stone and concrete breakwaters, called the East and West Mole, as well as the beaches. Almost 200,000 troops embarked on ships from the East Mole (which stretched nearly a mile out to sea) over the next week. On 28 May, 17,804 soldiers arrived at British ports. On 29 May, 47,310 British troops were rescued. Of the total 338,226 soldiers, several hundred were unarmed mule handlers, Muslim Indians on detachment from the Royal Indian Army Service Corps, forming four of the six units of Force K-6 transport. Three units were successfully evacuated and one captured. Also present at Dunkirk were a small number of French Senegalese soldiers and Moroccans.|$|E

[...] "There can be no doubt, then, these terms are vague." [...] That vagueness does not put citizens on notice, in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, she ruled. A key question throughout these proceedings has been..precisely what the statute means—what and whose activities it is meant <b>to</b> <b>cover.</b> <b>That</b> is no small question bandied about amongst lawyers and a judge steeped in arcane questions of constitutional law; {{it is a question of}} defining an individual's core liberties.

Here, the stakes get no higher: indefinite military detention—potential detention during a war on terrorism that is not expected to end in the foreseeable future, if ever.
