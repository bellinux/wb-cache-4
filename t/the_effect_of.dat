5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> biting and chewing on the pain, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> thermal stimuli, and <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E

40|$|When {{administered}} systemically, benzodiazepine receptor agonists {{have been}} shown to increase food intake in a number of species. Conversely, benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists bring about reliable decreases in feeding. The aim of the experiments reported in this thesis was to investigate the brain and behavioural mechanisms involved in <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepines on ingestion. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> on food intake of microinjection of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam into the brainstem of the rat was investigated. A reliable hyperphagic response was elicited following injection of midazolam into both the IVth ventricle and the parabrachial nucleus (PEN). This increase in intake was reversed by pretreatment with the selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors located in the brainstem, specifically in the PEN, may be responsible for <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepines on ingestion. In further experiments, a microstructural approach was adopted which involved analyzing <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepine ligands on the detailed pattern of licking for both a carbohydrate and a fat in <b>the</b> rat. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> midazolam were similar to <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> increasing concentration. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist Ro 15 - 4513 were similar to <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> decreasing concentration. These results suggest that benzodiazepines influence ingestive behaviour by modulating palatability. The proposal that benzodiazepines may interact with opioids to influence feeding behaviour was examined in Chapters 7 and 8. Although <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opioid agonist morphine and the opioid antagonist naloxone on licking behaviour were not the same as <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepine ligands, naloxone blocked <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> midazolam. These results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepine on palatability may depend on release of endogenous opioid peptides. This work has implications for understanding the neural control of ingestive behaviour and may help in developing new therapies for clinical disorders such as anorexia and bulimia...|$|R
