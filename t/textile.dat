Coimbatore is home to more than 17% of the fibre <b>textile</b> mills in India. Coimbatore has trade associations such as CODISSIA, COINDIA and COJEWEL representing the industries in the city. Coimbatore houses a number of <b>textile</b> mills and is the base of <b>textile</b> research institutes like the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International School of Textiles & Management, Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) and the South India <b>Textile</b> Research Institute (SITRA).

While Punjab's economy is driven primarily by agriculture, the <b>textile</b> industry along with leather products and light engineering goods play an important role, with more than 48,000 industrial units spread across Punjab. In an effort to boost bilateral trade, Romania and Turkey have honorary-consulates in Faisalabad which enable trade links with the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor, {{a position he}} held until his appointment as the school's second president in 1896. Hall had a solid background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty. As president, Hall was noted for his aggressive fundraising and improvements to the school, including his special project, the A. French <b>Textile</b> School.

5|$|After the WTO {{phased out}} {{quantitative}} quotas on <b>textile</b> in 2004 under the Agreement on <b>Textile</b> and Clothing(ATC).

The flood of similar articles from these two nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result {{in the loss of}} 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the <b>textile</b> industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent {{as it did in the}} rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the <b>textile</b> industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The <b>textile</b> industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E
