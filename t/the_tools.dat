40|$|Purpose: This article mainly {{describe}} {{the reliability of}} <b>the</b> cutting <b>tools</b> in <b>the</b> high speed turning by normaldistribution model. Design/methodology/approach: A series of experimental tests have been done to evaluate the reliabilityvariation of <b>the</b> cutting <b>tools.</b> From experimental results, <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> wear distribution and <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> life are determined,and <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> life distribution and the reliability function of cutting tools are derived. Further, <b>the</b> reliability ofcutting <b>tools</b> at anytime for high speed machining (HSM) is easily calculated from cutting parameters and toolwear limit from the derived reliability function. Findings: The higher the cutting speed, <b>the</b> sooner <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> flank wear, and the faster the degrade speed of thereliability curve. It means that <b>the</b> sooner <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> flank wear rate, <b>the</b> shorter <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> life, {{and it is the}} time tochange <b>the</b> cutting <b>tool.</b> Practical implications: This paper shows that <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> flank wear rate can be described by the reliabilitydegrade rate, the higher the flank wear rate, <b>the</b> steeper <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> reliability degrade rate. Originality/value: This article is discussing about <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> wear variation of <b>the</b> cutting <b>tool</b> from <b>the</b> point ofreliability. From the reliability variation of <b>the</b> cutting <b>tool,</b> we can further predict <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> life, in order to decidethe tool replacement time...|$|R

5|$|Jumpscares {{are present}} {{in all of the}} series' main games, and occur when any animatronic manages to reach and attack the player-{{character}}. Most jumpscares involve an animatronic character suddenly appearing in the player's view, followed by a loud, bellowing sound. Some jumpscares, including those of Golden Freddy, Nightmare, and Nightmarionne, consist of a single screen supplemented with shrill, distorted audio. These jumpscares usually crash or restart the game. The player can utilise <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> listed above to prevent attacks, thus preventing any jumpscares from occurring.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Sociology, 2005 An {{evaluation}} of the Humboldt County Juvenile Detention Risk Assessment Tool was conducted. Those probation officers that use <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> were interviewed to determine {{if all of the}} parts of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> are functional and if <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> is operating as {{it is supposed to be}} operating. The interview questions focused on the methods in which the probation officers fill out <b>the</b> <b>tool,</b> as well as focusing on the officer???s attitudes toward <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> It can be concluded from this evaluation that <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> would operate effectively if more uniformity existed in the way in which <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> is filled out.

40|$|Abstract. The powder {{particles}} using <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> grinder {{is composed}} of two types. One is mounted on the rotating shaft of <b>the</b> machine <b>tool.</b> This tool is generally single cutting edge. <b>The</b> installation <b>tool</b> is a bolt shank fixed to the rotary shaft of the positioning groove. When you need to replace <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> mechanical enclosure open, loosen all bolts to remove <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> to replace <b>the</b> new <b>tool.</b> With no cutting edge tools can extend <b>tool</b> life. Reduce <b>the</b> number of replacement <b>tools.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>tool</b> is mounted on the housing of <b>the</b> machine <b>tool.</b> Single cutting edge of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> mounting clearance is small, difficult to adjust the gap. Multi-blade cutter working gap can be formed when using the wedge mounting the inlet and outlet ports of the difference. Move the material in the resulting gap wedge and promote the formation of shear extrusion processing.

Quick tool change involves cooling structure, <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> fixed way, <b>the</b> position of the discharge port design and rapid tool change...|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic bore tools do have {{drawbacks}} {{which can}} cause difficulties completing the bore. First the distance of <b>the</b> bore <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> can create {{is limited by the}} length of the hose that supplies <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> with air. Also <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> is not steerable. Once it has exited the bore pit, the operator no longer has control over it. <b>The</b> <b>tool</b> can be deflected by rocks and soil density to a path the operator had not intended. If this deflection is in the direction of <b>the</b> surface, <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> can cause damage to the obstacle being bored under. If it is downward, <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> can dive to an unrecoverable depth. If it is deflected side to side <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> could also run into other utilities. These hazards make it important for the operator to maintain close observation of the tool.The type of ground <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> is working in can also lead to problems. If the soil is too loose, <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> cannot compact <b>the</b> soil, stalling it out or leaving no bore hole. If the soil is rocky <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> may be deflected or fail to pound forward due to its inability break the rock. These drawbacks can be overcome by directional boring.|$|R
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E

30|$|The {{hardness}} of hard phase TiAlN in {{the coating}} {{is higher than}} the hard phase WC of <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> <b>The</b> coating can restrict the diffusion of hard phase Cr and Mo, which can refine grains and increase <b>the</b> <b>tool’s</b> strength, increasing <b>the</b> wear resistance of <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> As Al in the coating is easy to be oxidized to form Al 2 O 3 dense membrane on <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> surface, <b>the</b> strength decreasing due to C diffusion and adhesion due to adhesive phase diffusion can be avoided to some extent. The resistance of diffusion wear and adhesive wear of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> are therefore increased.|$|R

5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E

50|$|Many users {{choose to}} equip their air-powered impact {{wrenches}} {{with a short}} length of air hose rather than attaching an air fitting directly to <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> Such a hose greatly aids in fitting the wrench into tight areas, by not having the complete coupler assembly sticking {{out the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>tool,</b> as well as making it easier for the user to position <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> An additional benefit is greatly reduced wear on the coupler, by isolating it from the vibration of <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> A short length of hose also prevents the air fitting from being broken off in the base of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> if <b>the</b> user loses their grip and <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> is allowed to spin.|$|R

5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically.

30|$|The thrust forces {{predicted}} by the two criteria are also different. Both thrust forces remain negative at the early stage but increase gradually and turn into positive, reaching nearly 0.5  N and 3.5  N, respectively, at a later stage. In the beginning, the thrust force is negative because at the initial stage of penetration of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> edge into workpiece, the workpiece contacts <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> edge and <b>the</b> rake area. Besides the reaction forces ahead in the horizontal direction, <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> also encounters a reaction force from upper left perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> rake. <b>The</b> resultant force has a negative (downwards) thrust force component. However, with additional advances of <b>the</b> <b>tool,</b> when <b>the</b> contacts between the workpiece and <b>the</b> bottom of <b>tool</b> edge and <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> flank are established, the reaction force from <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> bottom becomes dominant, which results in a positive thrust force.|$|R
