25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
2500|$|Opium {{tincture}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent oral formulations of morphine available by prescription. [...] Accidental or deliberate overdose is common with opium tincture given the highly concentrated nature of the solution. Overdose and death may occur with a single oral dose of between 100 and 150mg of morphine in a healthy adult who is not habituated to opiates. [...] This represents the equivalent of between two to three <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> opium tincture. [...] Suicide by laudanum was not uncommon in the mid-19th century. [...] Prudent medical judgment necessitates toward dispensing very small quantities of opium tincture in small dropper bottles or in pre-filled syringes to reduce the risk of intentional or accidental overdose.|$|E

60|$|I {{do not see}} any {{wisdom in}} {{building}} a monster cask to hoard up emptiness in, when {{you can get a}} better quality, outside, any day, free of expense. What could this cask have been built for? The more one studies over that, the more uncertain and unhappy he becomes. Some historians say that thirty couples, some say thirty thousand couples, can dance on the head of this cask at the same time. Even this does not seem to me to account for the building of it. It does not even throw light on it. A profound and scholarly Englishman--a specialist--who had made the great Heidelberg Tun his sole study for fifteen years, told me he had at last satisfied himself that the ancients built it to make German cream in. He said that the average German cow yielded from one to two and half <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> milk, when she was not worked in the plow or the hay-wagon more than eighteen or nineteen hours a day. This milk was very sweet and good, and a beautiful transparent bluish tint; but in order to get cream from it in the most economical way, a peculiar process was necessary. Now he believed that the habit of the ancients was to collect several milkings in a teacup, pour it into the Great Tun, fill up with water, and then skim off the cream from time to time as the needs of the German Empire demanded.|$|E
60|$|That we {{have shown}} {{this to be a}} {{remarkable}} book, we think no one will deny. That is a pernicious book to place {{in the hands of the}} confiding and uniformed, we think we have also shown. That the book is a deliberate and wicked creation of a diseased mind, is apparent upon every page. Having placed our judgment thus upon record, let us close with what charity we can, by remarking that even in this volume there is some good to be found; for whenever the author talks of his own country and lets Europe alone, he never fails to make himself interesting, and not only interesting but instructive. No one can read without benefit his occasional chapters and paragraphs, about life in the gold and silver mines of California and Nevada; about the Indians of the plains and deserts of the West, and their cannibalism; about the raising of vegetables in kegs of gunpowder by the aid of two or three <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> guano; about the moving of small arms from place to place at night in wheelbarrows to avoid taxes; and about a sort of cows and mules in the Humboldt mines, that climb down chimneys and disturb the people at night. These matters are not only new, but are well worth knowing. It is a pity the author did not put in more of the same kind. His book is well written and is exceedingly entertaining, and so it just barely escaped being quite valuable also.|$|E
5000|$|Frappé is in Greece {{available}} in three degrees of sweetness, {{determined by the}} amount of sugar used. These are: glykós (γλυκός, pronounced , [...] "sweet", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> coffee and 4 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> sugar); métrios (μέτριος, [...] "medium", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> coffee and 2 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> sugar); and a skétos (σκέτος, [...] "plain", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> coffee and no sugar). All varieties may be served with evaporated milk (με γάλα [...] ), in which case they may be called in slang φραπόγαλο (frapógalo, , [...] "frappé-milk"), or without. Sometimes, frappé is served without any water (besides the water used in the foam) and milk is used instead. This variation is most commonly found in Cyprus.|$|E
