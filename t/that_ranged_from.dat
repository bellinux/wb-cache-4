5|$|Case No. 1 {{contained}} {{a selection of}} lamps that represented the basics of the technology involved {{in the early stages}} of the electric light bulb development. The case displayed actual physical light bulbs made by Thomas Edison and others from 1878 to 1883. Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite filament lamps are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a pear shape was in this display, which was the universal shape for electric light bulbs for decades. These in this display case contained numbers <b>that</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 1 – 109.|$|E
5|$|The mutineers {{issued a}} lengthy list of demands, <b>that</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> {{longer periods of}} leave to and end to the war, based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The {{following}} day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned the effort and rejoined loyalist forces in the inner harbor; first the light cruisers {{and most of the}} torpedo boats escaped from the guns of the mutineers, followed by several of the other larger vessels. By late in the day, only the men aboard Sankt Georg and a handful of destroyers and torpedo boats remained in rebellion. Only on the morning of 3 February, after the arrival of the s of the III Division, were the last of the mutineers convinced to surrender. Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly, and four men were executed, including the sailor who had shot Sankt Georgs commander.|$|E
5|$|PedroI's {{successor}} in Brazil was his five-year-old son, PedroII. As {{the latter}} was still a minor, a weak regency was created. The power vacuum resulting from {{the absence of a}} ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, PedroII, once he was declared of age, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under PedroII's rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888. Brazilian visual arts, literature and theater developed during this time of progress. Although heavily influenced by European styles <b>that</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> Neoclassicism to Romanticism, each concept was adapted to create a culture that was uniquely Brazilian.|$|E

Lower elevations had more frequent fire return intervals, whilst higher and wetter elevations saw much longer intervals between fires. Native Americans tended to set fires during fall and winter, and land at a higher elevation was generally occupied by Native Americans only during the summer.|$|E
25|$|Erickson and Tumanova {{reported}} Psittacosaurus mongoliensis fossils from Khamaryn Us in Mongolia <b>that</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 0.9kg juveniles to 19.9kg adults. They {{found that}} it took 9 years for a Psittacosaurus to become fully grown. To reach that size in that time frame it must have grown {{at a rate of}} 12.5 grams per day. This is four times faster than modern reptiles and 25% faster than modern marsupials. However it is only three to twenty times as slow as modern eutherian mammals and birds.|$|E

50|$|Wade's main pitches are a four-seam fastball <b>that</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>from</b> 86 to(-) 90 mph, a cutter <b>that</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>from</b> 84 to(-) 86 mph, a changeup {{that breaks}} away from left-handers and averages between 79 to(-) 83 mph, and a {{traditional}} 12-6 curveball <b>that</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>from</b> 74 to(-) 77 mph, {{that he uses}} more commonly against right-handers. Although he does not use them frequently, Wade also has a two-seam fastball and slider—both of which he uses mainly against right-handed hitters. Though he lacks the size and premium fastball velocity of the prototypical late-inning relief pitcher, Wade has above-average command and is adept at using his off-speed pitches to induce weak contact.|$|R

25|$|In 1786 French explorer, the Comte de la Pérouse visited San Francisco {{and left}} a {{detailed}} account of it. Six years later, in 1792 British explorer George Vancouver also stopped in San Francisco, in part, according to his journal, to spy on the Spanish settlements in the area. In addition to Western Europeans, Russian fur-traders also visited the area. From 1770 until about 1841, Russian traders colonized an area <b>that</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> Alaska south to Fort Ross in Sonoma County, California. The naming of San Francisco's Russian Hill neighborhood is attributed to the remains of Russian fur-traders and sailors found there.|$|E
25|$|The study Effect of Breast Augmentation Mammoplasty on Self-Esteem and Sexuality: A Quantitative Analysis (2007), {{reported}} that the women attributed their improved self image, self-esteem, and increased, satisfactory sexual functioning to having undergone breast augmentation; the cohort, aged 21–57 years, averaged post-operative self-esteem increases <b>that</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 20.7 to 24.9 points on the 30-point Rosenberg self-esteem scale, which data supported the 78.6 per cent increase in the woman’s libido, relative to her pre-operative level of libido. Therefore, before agreeing to any surgery, the plastic surgeon evaluates and considers the woman’s mental health to determine if breast implants can positively affect her self-esteem and sexual functioning.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Hultén left Stockholm {{to enter}} {{one of the}} most {{significant}} periods of his career. As founding director of the new museum of modern art at the Centre Georges Pompidou, which opened in 1977, Hultén organized large-scale shows that examined the making of art's history through the links between artistic capitals: Paris-Berlin, Paris-Moscow, Paris-New York, and Paris-Paris included not only art objects <b>that</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> Constructivist to Pop, but films, posters, documentation, and reconstructions of exhibition spaces such as Gertrude Stein's salon. Multivalent and interdisciplinary, these shows marked a paradigm shift in exhibition making, entering the collective memory of generations of artists, curators, and critics as few others have.|$|E

Several sites reported highest on record daily rainfall amounts including Mandora (281.0mm on 6th) and Mount Narryer (152.0mm on 10th). Carnarvon (100.6mm on 9th) reported its highest March daily rainfall since records commenced {{at the airport in}} 1945. Rainfall ranging from 50 to 100mm continued over inland parts extending in a south-easterly direction from the west Gascoyne to the south coast near Esperance. Flooding occurred in the Esperance area and number of roads and bridges were washed away. Salmon Gums Research Station recorded 91mm of rain on 11 March.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} of the Iron Age the eastern Pomeranians became {{involved}} in long distance amber trade <b>that</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> the Sambian Peninsula, through Pomerania, the Lusatian and Hallstatt lands all the way to Italy. The amber trade gave them access to imported products. At roughly the same time climatic changes favored a rural economy different from that typical of the Lusatian societies. Animal husbandry and the less demanding cereals (rye and barley) became more important, as the villages had to be built at higher altitudes (because of climatically elevated water tables and environmental exploitation of the lowland settlement areas). This in turn favored small communities based on the family and extended family, flexible and capable of greater mobility. All such factors gave the Pomeranian people a competitive advantage over the traditional Lusatian settlements.|$|E
25|$|In 1835, the U.S. Army {{arrived to}} enforce the treaty. The Seminole leader Osceola led the vastly outnumbered {{resistance}} during the Second Seminole War. Drawing on {{a population of about}} 4,000 Seminole and 800 allied Black Seminoles, he mustered at most 1,400 warriors (Andrew Jackson estimated they had only 900). They countered combined U.S. Army and militia forces <b>that</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 6,000 troops at the outset to 9,000 at the peak of deployment in 1837. To survive, the Seminole allies employed guerrilla tactics with devastating effect against U.S. forces, as they knew how to move within the Everglades and use this area for their protection. Osceola was arrested (in a breach of honor) when he came under a flag of truce to negotiations with the US in 1837. He died in jail less than a year later. He was decapitated, his body buried without his head.|$|E
