5|$|A topological {{ordering}} of a directed graph is an {{ordering of}} its vertices into a sequence, such {{that for every}} edge the start vertex of <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E

50|$|Problem {{sizes for}} {{hidden line removal}} are the total number n of <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> model and the total number v of the visible {{segments}} of <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> Visibility can change at the intersection points of the images of <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> Let k denote {{the total number of}} the intersection points of the images of <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> Both k = Θ(n2) and v = Θ(n2) in the worst case but usually v < k.|$|R

(Direct {{adjacent}} edges/indirect adjacent edges) If {{there is}} no cost from an edge to its adjacent <b>edge,</b> <b>the</b> adjacent <b>edge</b> is called <b>the</b> <b>edge’s</b> direct adjacent edge. Otherwise, it’s called <b>the</b> <b>edge’s</b> indirect adjacent <b>edge.</b> <b>The</b> weight of an indirect adjacent <b>edge</b> represents <b>the</b> cost from an edge to its adjacent edge.|$|R

40|$|Using {{the density}} {{functional}} theory with the effective screening medium method, we study the electronic properties of graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges that are terminated by hydrogen and ketone, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl functional groups.
