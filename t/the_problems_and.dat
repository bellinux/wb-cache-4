5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|As Griffith stopped portraying {{some of the}} sheriff's more unsophisticated {{character}} traits and mannerisms, {{it was impossible for}} him to create his own problems and troubles in the manner of other central sitcom characters such as Lucy in I Love Lucy or Archie Bunker in All in the Family, whose problems were the result of their temperaments, philosophies and attitudes. Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian and counselor.|$|E

5|$|Davout {{anticipated}} <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> {{withdrew his}} corps from Regensburg, leaving a garrison of only 2,000 for defence. The northbound Austrian columns in the KelheimAbbach zone {{ran into the}} four French columns heading west towards Neustadt {{in the early hours}} of the 19th. The Austrian attacks were slow, uncoordinated, and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps. Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians: while the Austrians attacked to the north, Masséna's corps, later augmented by Oudinot's forces, would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of rolling up the entire Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout. Napoleon was reasonably confident that the joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could pin the Austrians while his other forces swept the Austrian rear.|$|E

In 1947, he took up a teaching position at the Jamia Millia, Delhi, where he worked for three years. In 1950, Khan migrated to Pakistan to teach at Islamia College, Karachi. In the same year, he was invited by the Government of Pakistan to take charge as Principal of Comilla Victoria College in East Pakistan, a position he held until 1958. During this time (1950–58) he also served as President of the East Pakistan Non-Government Teachers' Association.|$|E

He lived in Alexandropol (Gyumri) for six months. In 1848 once again moved to Constantinople via Tiflis, Batumi, and Trabzon. From 1848 to 1850 he taught at an all-girl school in Constantinople's Khasgiugh (Hasköy) quarter. In 1851 he {{traveled}} to Cilicia where {{he was sent to}} report on the state of Armenian schools. By traveling and living in various Armenian-populated provinces, he acquired an intimate knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> aspirations of ordinary Armenians. He was upset with the apathy the upper and middle classes of the Armenian community of Constantinople showed towards provincial Armenians.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Works {{took the}} tower into its {{guardianship}} in 1953 to address <b>the</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> promptly undertook an extensive sequence of repairs that lasted until 1958. No archaeological investigation {{was carried out}} during these works, however, and a full architectural survey of the building was only carried out between 1985 and 1986, by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission. In the 21st century, Cow Tower is managed by English Heritage and Norwich City Council; the tower is now only a shell, however, as the floors and the roof have been lost. The tower is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of defects {{encountered}} during flight testing of the MiG-1 forced Mikoyan and Gurevich to make a number of modifications to the design. Testing was done on a full-size aircraft in the T-1 wind tunnel belonging to the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute (TsAGI) to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> their proposed solutions. The first aircraft {{to see all of}} these changes applied was the fourth prototype of the I-200. It first flew on 29 October 1940 and was approved for production after passing its State acceptance trials. The first MiG-3, as the improved aircraft was named on 9 December, was completed on 20 December 1940 and another 20 were delivered {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|Each {{episode of}} Degrassi is written {{following}} the same formula {{with two or three}} storylines (Plot A, Plot B and Plot C). The main storyline, A, opens and closes the episode and is usually driven by a single character. Plot B is usually more comedic in tone and sometimes slightly intertwined with the other stories, often moving story arcs forward. Plot C was usually used sporadically in a season-long arc, but is now used in every episode as comedic relief. <b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> issues presented in the episode are not always resolved {{by the end of the}} episode, and are carried over to the next, or create a mini-arc over several episodes. The majority of episodes are named after songs from the 1980s, and since the tenth season, episodes are named after songs from the 1990s to the present, representing the entering of a new decade and a completely different cast from the earlier seasons. For the first nine seasons, Degrassi: The Next Generation had been produced as a weekly half-hour teen comedy-drama series, with each season consisting of between fifteen and twenty-four episodes.|$|E

Later, the two look-alikes pass each other and a sewer grate blows open, sucking Mulder into the storm drain and sealing him in. Scully finds that the girls share the same father, {{a man by the}} name of Bob Damphouse, who is in prison. Damphouse is revealed to be mentally insane, and is always in a fit of rage. Eventually, Mulder finds his way out of the storm drain. At the prison, Scully meets a man that looks exactly like Bert Zupanic. Lulu and Betty meet at a stadium and everyone in the audience breaks into a fight. The other Bert Zupanic shows up and everyone stops fighting. The two Zupanics see each other and a fight breaks out again. The episode ends with Mulder and Scully shown bruised and beaten.|$|E
