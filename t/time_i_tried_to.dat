2500|$|Once in Amman, Arar {{claims he}} was blindfolded, {{shackled}} {{and put in a}} van. [...] "They made me bend my head down in the back seat," [...] Arar recalled. [...] "Then these men started beating me. Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> talk, they beat me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The race {{restarted}} with 129 laps {{to go and}} a multi-car wreck {{brought out}} the seventh caution of the race. It started when Busch spun out and collected Brad Keselowski. Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Ryan Blaney, Jimmie Johnson and Elliott all suffered damage in the wreck. Busch said afterwards {{that he thought he}} [...] "just missed the bottom groove by a few inches, got loose and the wreck was on. The way that our car was restarting it felt comfortable, it felt good. That inside with the rosin and the VHT, if you don’t hit it exactly right you lose a lot of <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make up for it and got loose. I feel really bad for the Monster Energy guys. We had a win in our sights and I just drove the car at 101 percent instead of that 99 that I probably needed to be at." [...] Joey Logano assumed the race lead.|$|E
2500|$|... "Happy Anniversary" [...] {{is written}} {{from the point}} of view of a dying loved one, which Pierre based on his grandmother, who died several years prior of cancer. [...] " [...] is {{basically}} [...] from the person's point of view who is dying, and all of the things that they can't necessarily say to the person that they're leaving behind," [...] remarked Pierre. The event occurred in late 2009, shortly after the band had learned of a [...] "big break, this big opportunity," [...] which Pierre skipped out on to go see his ailing grandmother. [...] "It was a weird experience being with this shell of a woman that I used to know. She couldn't move or communicate," [...] he later said; she passed the next morning. He noted that had he not gone, he would not have had another experience with her, which factored into the song’s lyrics to live in the moment. The band considered it the darkest on the album. The song was so personal, it affected the group recording the song. [...] "The song gives me shivers. I couldn't sing the song [...] I kept breaking down every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sing it. It was really weird," [...] said Pierre. Pierre interpreted the final song on the album, [...] "Floating Down the River", as a celebration of his newfound excitement for life.|$|E

60|$|After a <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{disengage}} her arms, {{but found}} {{this to be}} impossible without a degree of violence which I could not exert. Overcome by the strain, and probably by long want of rest, the poor child soon fell into a profound slumber.|$|E

6000|$|But, oh, how I {{felt that}} at present I must pick my own phrases!

60|$|And now I had awakened, {{without any}} {{assignable}} cause, hours before my usual <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> compose myself to sleep again. The effort was useless.

60|$|It sounds foolish, but I {{leave it}} standing, {{wondering}} if to others a like experience has ever come. The little chap {{never came back}} to me.

40|$|Abstract This {{paper offers}} a four-decade {{overview}} {{of the evolution of}} empirical software engineering from a personal perspective.

6000|$|And then Delia's manner {{began to}} change towards me. The ease of our {{intercourse}} vanished. I felt she was learning to dislike me. I grinned, and capered, and scowled, and posed at her in a thousand ways, and knew--with what a voiceless agony!--that I did it all the <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> resign again, and Barnaby talked about [...] "X" [...] and [...] "Z" [...] and [...] "Y" [...] in the New Review, {{and gave me a}} strong cigar to smoke, and so routed me.

60|$|The journey {{came to an}} end finally, as {{must all}} {{journeys}} in this world whether they bring us to a haven of rest or a sink of iniquity, and then did I forget all things in the outside world that might give me pain or trouble, in the pleasure I had with my dear mother, telling what I had seen in the American camp, repeating the words father had said to me, or striving to make her believe it would be possible for Saul and me to accomplish that which we had set before us.

At the same <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> relate Lejeune's critical attitudes to some of the theoretical reflections on his critical work. Both processes of identification and of critical distance will be studied here through the figuration of the reader...|$|R
40|$|The main {{intention}} of bachelor {{project is the}} linguistic analysis of baroque text. The work is devided into two parts { [...] } theoretical and practical one. In the theoretical one I report on characteristic of baroque period, language and preaching. In the practical one I deal with printing, phonology and morphology. Analysis of baroque text is based on research of formal means which are used by the author in the text. I compare them with means of today´s Czech language. At the same <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate that baroque Czech language was not a degeneracy language...|$|R
60|$|I worked away ironing {{shirts and}} other things in the laundry, and wrote in all my spare <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> keep on at both, but often fell asleep with the pen in my hand. Then I left the laundry and wrote all the time, and lived and dreamed again. After three months' trial I gave up writing, having decided that I was a failure, and left for the Klondike to {{prospect}} for gold. At {{the end of the}} year, owing to the outbreak of scurvy, I was compelled to come out, and on the homeward journey of 1,900 miles in an open boat made the only notes of the trip. It was in the Klondike I found myself. There nobody talks. Everybody thinks. You get your true perspective. I got mine.|$|E
60|$|I {{was there}} a year trying to steal that money; that is, it seemed a year, though, of course, {{it must have been}} much less. The worshipers went and came; there were hardly ever three in the church at once, but there was always one or more. Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit my crime {{somebody}} came in or somebody started out, and I was prevented; but at last my opportunity came; for one moment there was nobody in the church but the two beggar-women and me. I whipped the gold piece out of the poor old pauper's palm and dropped my Turkish penny in its place. Poor old thing, she murmured her thanks--they smote me to the heart. Then I sped away in a guilty hurry, and even when I was a mile from the church I was still glancing back, every moment, to see if I was being pursued.|$|E
60|$|But to {{come back}} to the river. Food was plentiful, principally berries and {{succulent}} roots, and on the river bank we played and lingered for days. And then the idea came to Lop-Ear. It was a visible process, the coming of the idea. I saw it. The expression in his eyes became plaintive and querulous, and he was greatly perturbed. Then his eyes went muddy, as if he had lost his grip on the inchoate thought. This was followed by the plaintive, querulous expression as the idea persisted and he clutched it anew. He looked at me, and at the river and the far shore. He tried to speak, but had no sounds with which to express the idea. The result was a gibberish that made me laugh. This angered him, and he grabbed me suddenly and threw me on my back. Of course we fought, and in the end I chased him up a tree, where he secured a long branch and poked me every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get at him.|$|E

40|$|Kalhat has forcefully criticised Wittgenstein's {{linguistic}} or conventionalist {{account of}} logical necessity, drawing partly on Waismann and Quine. I defend conventionalism against {{the charge that}} it cannot {{do justice to the}} truth of necessary propositions, renders them unacceptably arbitrary or reduces them to metalingustic statements. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reconcile Wittgenstein's claim that necessary propositions are constitutive of meaning with the logical positivists' claim that they are true by virtue of meaning. Explaining necessary propositions by reference to linguistic conventions does not reduce modal to non-modal notions, but it avoids metaphysical accounts, which are incapable of explaining how we can have a priori knowledge of necessity...|$|R
