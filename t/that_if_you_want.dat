500|$|The {{success of}} the first conference {{prompted}} the announcement of a second ISMB conference {{at the end of}} the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in Seattle. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at Stanford University in August 1994 and was organised by Russ Altman, a research scientist at Stanford University School of Medicine. To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at Robinson College, Cambridge. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. ISCB Board member and Director of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute Alfonso Valencia has stated that, in 1995, [...] "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to make progress, there has to be more focus in biology." ...|$|E
500|$|Licciardello {{stated that}} they did not know they had entered the red zone, and [...] "we had the advice of our lawyers ring in our ears; 'Do NOT go into the red zone. You can go into the green zone if they let you, but DO NOT go into the red zone.'" [...] He said that they [...] "were {{absolutely}} sure we would never get past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E
500|$|The company {{contemplated}} {{purchasing the}} Argonauts of the CFL at least twice, with minority partner Tanenbaum keen {{to add the}} team to his list of franchises, but concluded that the cost and effort {{that would be required}} to make the team profitable was not worth the minimal financial upside. [...] In 2013, it was reported that the company was again considering purchasing the team and having them play at a renovated BMO Field, with the asking price reportedly $20 million, but later coming down to $10 million. [...] A vote by MLSE's board on purchasing the team was called in December 2013, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the issue. [...] On May 20, 2015 it was announced that two of the three ownership partners of MLSE, Bell Canada and Tanenbaum's Kilmer Group, had acquired ownership of the Argos, with the deal to close {{at the end of the}} year, and would move the team to BMO Field for the 2016 season. It has been speculated that Rogers was not interested in investing in the team since Bell has exclusive rights to broadcast all CFL games. It is thought that control of the Argos by MLSE will enhance Toronto's chances of acquiring an NFL franchise, with Peddie saying [...] "the NFL is telling them <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> an NFL team, you better make sure the Argos are okay." [...] Leiweke has said that moving into a renovated BMO field [...] "will help turn [...] around" [...] and that [...] "there's no way the NFL comes here without the CFL being unbelievably successful first." ...|$|E

500|$|Blackout {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. On music review aggregator Metacritic the album holds {{a score of}} sixty-one out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on 24 critical reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of AllMusic, described the album as [...] "state-of-the-art dance-pop, a testament to skills of the producers and perhaps even Britney being somehow cognizant enough to realize she should hire the best, even if she's not at her best." [...] Dennis Lim of Blender deemed it as [...] "her most consistent , a seamlessly entertaining collection of bright, brash electropop." [...] Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly commented that while the album is not poetry, [...] "there is something delightfully escapist about Blackout, a perfectly serviceable dance album abundant {{in the kind of}} bouncy electro elements that buttressed her hottest hits." [...] A reviewer for NME said that the heavily treated vocals make Spears sound robotic, adding that [...] "it could really do with a few more human touches." [...] Pitchfork's Tom Ewing called [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] the centerpiece of the album, and added that [...] "like most of Blackout, is superb modern pop, which could probably only have been released by this star at this moment. Britney as walking catastrophe makes for great car-crash copy and her record can fit into <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it to." [...] Ewing also compared the relationship between Spears and Blackout with American television series Twin Peaks, saying that what made the show [...] "so great wasn't the central good-girl-gone-bad story, it was the strangeness that story liberated. And Britney's off-disc life is both distraction from and enabler for this extraordinary album". Mike Schiller of PopMatters said that [...] "Right down to its utterly garish cover, Blackout is utterly disposable and ultimately forgettable." [...] Melissa Maerz from Rolling Stone explained that Blackout [...] "is {{the first time in her}} career that she's voiced any real thoughts about her life" [...] and that [...] "she's gonna crank the best pop booty jams until a social worker cuts off her supply of hits." [...] Rob Sheffield of the same magazine described Blackout as [...] "one of the most influential albums in modern pop".|$|E
2500|$|As the Nintendo 64 {{reached the}} end of its lifecycle, {{hardware}} development chief Genyo Takeda repeatedly referred to the programming challenges using the word hansei ( [...] "reflective regret"). Looking back, Takeda said [...] "When we made Nintendo 64, we thought it was logical <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to make advanced games, it becomes technically more difficult. We were wrong. We now understand it's the cruising speed that matters, not the momentary flash of peak power".|$|E
2500|$|Explaining why Leskov had not {{yet come}} into his own with English-speaking readers, {{in spite of the}} admiration for him of some English critics, like Maurice Baring, Mirsky wrote in 1926: [...] "The Anglo-Saxon public have made up their minds as to what they want from a Russian writer, and Leskov does not fit into that idea. But those who really {{want to know more about}} Russians sooner or later {{recognize}} that Russia is not all contained in Dostoyevsky and Chekhov, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know anything, you must first be free of prejudice and on your guard against hasty generalizations." ...|$|E
3000|$|When <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{to teach}} {{children}} to think, you begin by treating them seriously when they are little, giving them responsibilities, talking to them candidly, providing privacy and solitude for them, and making them readers and thinkers of significant thoughts from the beginning. <b>That's</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{to teach them to}} think.

2500|$|Although {{the band}} {{supported}} Aristide and Lavalas {{during the years}} of the Cédras regime, like many other Haitians, Morse began to grow disillusioned with the nation's president and his new political party, Fanmi Lavalas. [...] Aristide aides approached the band to first request songs favorable to the government and later threaten the band when Morse refused. [...] In 1998, Manno Charlemagne, the newly elected Fanmi Lavalas mayor of Port-au-Prince and himself an accomplished professional musician who had lived in exile during the Cédras junta, sent armed men to the Oloffson. [...] They dismantled the float on which RAM was scheduled to perform in the upcoming annual Carnival on February 24. [...] The mayor had taken offense to the lyrics of one of the band's songs, which he interpreted as an accusation of corruption. [...] After the destruction of the float, the band was told they would be allowed to perform on a flatbed truck. [...] However, the brakes on the truck were sabotaged and during the Carnival procession, the truck swerved into the crowd, killing eight and forcing the members of the band to flee for their lives. [...] In 2000, Morse stated in an interview that [...] "The precedent has been set <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be involved in politics in this country, you've got to get your guns together... Nothing's changed, the teams have changed but not the modus operandi." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Jeffries from Allmusic noted Diddy's [...] "unfiltered self" [...] and [...] "unique attitude", stating [...] "This hook-filled, vibrant {{effort is}} that rare heartbreak album that can speak on a lovelorn level {{and then put}} a little strut back in your step." [...] Matt Sayles from The Boston Globe complimented its concept and praised the mixture of R vocals from Dirty Money and the guest {{features}} from the range of A-list friends, particularly Grace Jones stating that [...] "There’s no telling why she turns up but she sounds right {{at home on the}} thumping club anthem. [...] cameo is just one more pleasant surprise on an album full of them." [...] Brandon Soderberg from The Village Voice was also impressed with the artistic creation. He said [...] "Once you hear Pariss mish-mash (Diddy’s word) of sounds, all that producer-genius experimentalism makes some sense. Every song is full of swift change-ups and jarring musical detours; Diddy often interrupts these jagged dance tracks to emote... It’s lots of fun, and though confessional in parts, it’s overall far from the self-serious, petulant complaint-raps of say, Drake or Kanye. Paris looks back to dance music as soulful catharsis and emotionalism, not the cold thump that’s taken over as of late." [...] Nitsuh Abebe from New York magazine said [...] "Last Train to Paris {{is one of the first}} records that's really made me feel like [...] sounds clever. [...] makes what seems to me to be an aesthetic error, which is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to put sleek, rainy-sounding synths everywhere ... this album hits its mood right, though — gray skies, Eurorail, and drama — it's excellent stuff. The hectic format fades away, and the music actually becomes the hypnotic cruise it aspires to be." ...|$|E

50|$|Thus, in {{the early}} days of panel board systems, alarms were {{regulated}} by both real estate, and cost. In essence, they were limited by the amount of available board space, and the cost of running wiring, and hooking up an annunciator (horn), indicator (light) and switches to flip to acknowledge, and clear a resolved alarm. It was often the case <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> a new alarm, you had to decide which old one to give up.|$|R
