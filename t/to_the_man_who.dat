5|$|The {{number of}} works {{attributed}} to the trobairitz is estimated at thirty-two songs, but ranges anywhere from 23 to 46. There {{are a number of}} reasons why an exact number is not known. In the courtly love tradition it was common for poems to be written as an exchange of letters, or a debate, as in a tenso. Some of these may have been originally written by one poet; however, some were originally an actual exchange of epistles, later gathered together in a manuscript. Some of these were between men, and some were {{between a man and a}} woman. Some modern editors attribute these solely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> originated the exchange, and some attribute them to both the man and the woman involved. There is a long history of attributing these solely to men, even when all evidence points to the contrary.|$|E

25|$|Several of Gotland's image stones show {{scenes that}} allude {{to death and}} eroticism, and the stones are two to three metres tall phallic {{memorial}} stones in remembrance of the dead. The stones have richly decorated surfaces and they often have a certain motif in the upper field: a welcoming scene {{in the realm of}} the dead between a man and a lady. The lady offers a drinking horn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> arrives on Sleipnir. It is the man's phallic shape, among other things, which allows us to connect the images to the literary sources. The scene may depict the deceased who is united with Hel or with Rán. It is primarily kings and chieftains who are portrayed with an erotic death, but also the death of a hero can be portrayed in the same way.|$|E

25|$|After {{several months}} {{of living in the}} dojo, Kenshin discovers that his {{successor}} as assassin of the shadows, Shishio Makoto, plans to conquer Japan by destroying the Meiji Government, starting with Kyoto. Feeling that his friends may be attacked by Shishio's faction, Kenshin goes to meet Shishio alone in order to defeat him. However, many of his friends, including a young Oniwabanshū named Makimachi Misao, whom he meets in his travels, decide to help him in his fight. After his first meeting with him, Kenshin realizes he needs to get stronger to defeat Shishio without becoming the cold assassin he was in the past and returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> taught him kenjutsu, Hiko Seijūrō, in order to learn the school's final technique. He finally accepts his friends' help and defeats Shishio in a close fight; Shishio dies being engulfed in flames due to the rise in his body temperature caused by his severe burns.|$|E
25|$|O'Brian used {{literary}} {{license in}} making Aubrey a Commodore while still a relatively junior captain, however this puts him equal in rank <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> led the squadron in history, Commodore Rowley. In the novel, Aubrey was appointed {{directly by the}} Admiralty {{with the help of}} Maturin's persuasion, as Maturin had been at work on the intelligence side of the project. There are other differences from the historical event, one being that the French captain of the Vénus Hamelin survived the encounter, surrendering to the British, going on to honor in France. In contrast, Captain Corbett's reputation and death aboard ship match that of Robert Corbet, who was captain of Néréide and then given the Africaine when he brought the captured Caroline in to England. Lord Clonfert is fictional, in place of Nesbit Willoughby, who was captain of HMS Néréide; though Willoughby had a spotty career and took many wounds, he survived the battle and lived unmarried. Lord Clonfert takes the same splinter wound to the eye as Willoughby received. In the battle, Pym was taken prisoner by the French in the Battle of Grand Port in August 1810, released only when a later squadron from Cape Town re-took Île de la Passe in December 1810, freeing Pym and others taken prisoner. For the loss of his ship, Pym faced the usual court martial, and was exonerated of blame for the losses. In the novel, it is Captain Lord Clonfert who is left a prisoner in the action, seriously wounded, under the care of his own and French physicians until the squadron arrives under Admiral Bertie to accept the island's capitulation, but he does not live to face a court martial.|$|E

On October 3, he was found delirious in Baltimore, Maryland, [...] "in great distress, and ... in need of immediate assistance", according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> found him, Joseph W.

[...] An additional 80 cows [...] "for word and supplication" [...] were to be paid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> entreated for Olaf's release.

500|$|By {{the time}} William and Marlborough had {{returned}} from an uneventful campaign in the Spanish Netherlands in October 1691, their relationship had further deteriorated. In January 1692, the Queen, angered by Marlborough's intrigues in Parliament, the army, and even with Saint-Germain, ordered Anne to dismiss Sarah from her household – Anne refused. This personal dispute precipitated Marlborough's dismissal. On 20 January (O.S.), the Earl of Nottingham, Secretary of State, ordered Marlborough to dispose of all his posts and offices, both civil and military, and consider himself dismissed from all appointments and forbidden the court. No reasons were given but Marlborough's chief associates were outraged: Shrewsbury voiced his disapproval and Godolphin threatened to retire from government. Admiral Russell, now commander-in-chief of the Navy, personally accused the King of ingratitude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had [...] "set the crown upon his head".|$|E

Although the murder had received wide media coverage, the police had not revealed all of the significant details. At Hodgson's subsequent murder trial these were described as the [...] "secret details". It was never investigated whether any of the officers taking Hodgson's statements had in fact disclosed any of these secret details to him when they interviewed him.|$|E
