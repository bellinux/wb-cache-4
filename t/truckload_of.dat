5|$|Casualties {{during the}} 25th Battalion's {{campaign}} in Greece amounted to nearly 30 killed and wounded with 150 personnel captured and made prisoners of war. The {{majority of the}} captured personnel were from the battalion's reinforcement company, which had been left in Athens when the 6th Brigade moved up to the Aliakmon Line, {{as well as a}} <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> infantrymen that had been misdirected to Kalamata during the retreat. One soldier managed to escape and eventually make his way to Turkey by sea, an act for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.|$|E
5|$|Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Gordon Dean {{appointed}} Libby to its influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) in 1950. In 1954, he {{was appointed}} an AEC commissioner by President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{on the recommendation of}} Dean's successor, Lewis Strauss. Libby and his family moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C. He brought with him a <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> scientific equipment, which he used to establish a laboratory at the Carnegie Institution there to continue his studies of amino acids. Staunchly conservative politically, {{he was one of the}} few scientists who sided with Edward Teller rather than Robert Oppenheimer during the debate on whether it was wise to pursue a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb. As a commissioner, Libby played an important role in promoting Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program, and was part of the United States delegation at the Geneva Conferences on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, {{the rebels}} ambushed a <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> Italian soldiers, {{prompting}} the Italian Army {{commander in the}} NDH to warn the NDH government {{that he would take}} unilateral action to secure communication routes. A further gendarmerie post was destroyed by the rebels, and in the evening the rebels captured the village of Avtovac, looting and burning it, and killing dozens of non-Serb civilians. The following day an Italian column cleared the rebels from Avtovac and relieved the hard-pressed NDH garrison in the town of Gacko. From 3 July, an NDH force of over 2,000 fanned out from Nevesinje, clearing towns, villages and routes of rebels. The rebel forces did not put up any significant opposition to the clearing operation, and either retreated into nearby Montenegro, or hid their weapons in the mountains and went home. By 7 July, NDH forces had regained full control of all towns and major transport routes in eastern Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Department {{announced}} in July 1921 that Edward Doheny had been awarded a lease to drill {{along the edges}} of naval reserve Elk Hills in California. The announcement attracted little controversy, as the oil would have been lost to wells on adjacent private land. Wyoming Senator John Kendrick had heard from constituents that Teapot Dome had also been leased, but no announcement had been made. The Interior Department refused to provide documentation, so he secured the passage of a Senate resolution compelling disclosure. The department sent a copy of the lease granting drilling rights to Harry Sinclair's Mammoth Oil Company, along with a statement that there had been no competitive bidding because military preparedness was involved—Mammoth was to build oil tanks for the Navy as part of the deal. This satisfied some people, but some conservationists, such as Gifford Pinchot, Harry A. Slattery, and others, pushed for a full investigation into Fall and his activities. They got Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. to begin a Senate investigation into the oil leases. La Follette persuaded Democratic Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh to lead the investigation, and Walsh read through the <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> material provided by the Interior Department through 1922 into 1923, including a letter from Harding stating that the transfer and leases had been with his knowledge and approval.|$|E

25|$|Once commingled recyclates are {{collected}} and delivered {{to a central}} collection facility, {{the different types of}} materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> material can be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as single-stream recycling. In plants, a variety of materials is sorted such as paper, different types of plastics, glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of batteries. A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 2011, Dykstra {{was arrested}} for {{investigation}} of grand theft by Los Angeles police at his Encino home on suspicion of trying to buy a stolen car, the day after Dykstra, in an unrelated federal complaint, {{had been charged with}} embezzling from a bankruptcy estate. He faced up to five years in federal prison if convicted. Federal prosecutors contended that after filing for bankruptcy Dykstra hid, sold or destroyed more than $400,000 worth of items from the $18.5 million mansion in question without permission of a bankruptcy trustee. The items allegedly ranged from sports memorabilia to a $50,000 sink. At one point, he sold “a <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> furnishing and fixtures” for cash at a consignment store, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney’s office.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature {{of both the}} Porajmos and the Holocaust was the extensive use of human subjects in medical experiments. The most notorious of these physicians was Dr. Josef Mengele, {{who worked in the}} Auschwitz concentration camp. His experiments included placing subjects in pressure chambers, testing drugs on them, freezing them, attempting to change their eye color by injecting chemicals into children's eyes and various amputations and other brutal surgeries. The full extent of his work will never be known because the <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> records he sent to Dr. Otmar von Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was destroyed by von Verschuer. Mengele's own journals, consisting of some 3,300 pages, are likely never to be published, and they are suspected to contain denials of the Holocaust. Subjects who survived Mengele's experiments were almost always killed and dissected shortly afterwards.|$|E

Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the exiled Baloch leaders, have also condemned the killings and demanded that the Pakistani security establishment take stern action against those involved in terrorism and acts of violence against civilians. In his reaction on March 29, 2012, Sardar Akhtar Mengal accused the Pakistani military establishment of trying to sow hatred and division among the oppressed peoples by promoting religious extremism and intolerance, which his people regarded against their traditions.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 2014, at {{approximately}} 1 p.m., the final upper deck bleachers and concrete bleacher-support girders (on the northwest {{side of the}} Metrodome) were brought down, taking away any standing remnants of the exterior stadium walls. On April 11, 2014, just after 1:30p.m., the final portion of the inner-stadium concrete walls (that were only visible due to the stadium's subsequent removal of the upper deck bleachers and baseball press box that {{stood in front of}} it) were reduced to rubble, marking the official end of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Demolition of the Metrodome was formally declared complete on April 17, 2014, just after 1 p.m.--one full month ahead of schedule—as the final <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> rubble was loaded up and removed from the new stadium construction site.

25|$|As the {{battalion}} trained {{at its base}} in Helwan in preparation for {{the battalion}}'s impending move to Greece, reinforcements from New Zealand arrived to fill the ranks, depleted by illness. Baker was placed in command of the excess troops, which had been formed into a reinforcement company. When the battalion arrived in Greece on 27 March 1941, Baker's company was responsible for the battalion's advance base outside of Athens. Attached to the 5th Infantry Brigade, the battalion made a good account of itself defending its assigned portion of the Olympus Pass against elements of the 9th Panzer Division but were forced to withdraw from its positions on 17 April. Baker, having been tasked by Brigadier Edward Puttick, the commander of the 4th Infantry Brigade, with the collection of stragglers, was captured by German paratroopers. He managed to escape and, falling in with a <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> Greeks, returned to Puttick's headquarters. He was once more ordered to collect stragglers (this time with infantry support) and direct them to the Porto Rafti beaches in preparation for embarkation for Crete.|$|E

50|$|When {{the pots}} are {{loaded into the}} kiln, wood gatherers bring in wood by the {{truckload}} for this firing. The wood comes {{from as far away}} as 60 kilometers, and is generally harder wood. The firing process differs from western firing because the fire master does not know the specific temperatures that they fire pots to. Instead, they measure how long to fire these pots for based on how many <b>truckloads</b> <b>of</b> wood they have to use and the duration. Although every wood kiln firing is different, they tend to fire for two days and use four <b>truckloads</b> <b>of</b> wood.|$|R

A critic from Resonance magazine praised the album for [...] "stay true {{to the belief}} that guitar pop can have cool, utopian sounds without bringing in a <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> keyboards and sequencers". A Launch.com reviewer stated that [...] "no one else stateside is currently making pop quite this lush and lovely," [...] but disapproved of the track [...] "Undertow" [...] for being [...] "short of perfection".

500|$|The Gadget was hoisted {{to the top}} of a [...] steel tower. The height {{would give}} a better {{indication}} of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber, as detonation in the air would maximize the amount of energy applied directly to the target (as the explosion expanded in a spherical shape) and would generate less nuclear fallout. The tower stood on four legs that went [...] into the ground, with concrete footings. Atop it was an oak platform, and a shack made of corrugated iron that was open on the western side. The Gadget was hauled up with an electric winch. A <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> mattresses was placed underneath in case the cable broke and the Gadget fell. The seven man arming party, consisting of Bainbridge, Kistiakowsky, Joseph McKibben and four soldiers including Lieutenant Bush, drove out to the tower to perform the final arming shortly after 22:00 on July 15.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} of Bart crashing down the stairwell to the Mafia bar {{is similar to}} a scene in the film GoodFellas, in which a young boy is employed by a Mafia as their messenger. All of the horses in the race that Bart bets on are named after a famous animated character's catchphrase: [...] "Ain't I a Stinker?" [...] (Bugs Bunny), [...] "Yabba Dabba Doo" [...] (Fred Flintstone), [...] "Sufferin' Succotash" [...] (Sylvester), [...] "That's All Folks" [...] (Porky Pig), [...] "I Yam What I Yam" [...] (Popeye), and Bart's catchphrases [...] "Eat my shorts" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow". The Chiffons's song [...] "One Fine Day" [...] is heard when Bart serves drinks to the mobsters during a game of poker. The writers originally wanted to use the song [...] "Be My Baby" [...] by The Ronettes for the scene, but they could not clear the copyrights for it. In his room, Bart stores the Springfield Mafia's loot—a <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> cartons of Laramie cigarettes. While strutting around the kitchen, he sings Frank Sinatra's song [...] "Witchcraft". The scene in which Bart wakes up screaming after having a nightmare about Skinner is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film The Godfather, in which Jack Woltz screams after waking up in bed and finding a decapitated horse head by his side. Skinner frees himself from being trapped under the newspapers in a way similar to the character Angus MacGyver's escapes in the American television series MacGyver.|$|E
