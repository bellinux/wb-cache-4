5|$|This Extended Range Nike Zeus, or Zeus EX for short, {{would be}} able to provide {{protection}} over a wider area, reducing the number of bases needed to provide full-country defense. Work on this concept continued throughout the 1960s, eventually becoming the primary weapon in the following Sentinel system, and in the modified Sentinel system <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>later</b> renamed Safeguard.|$|E
5|$|Tintagel and its castle are {{associated}} with the conception of the legendary King Arthur and a 15th-century house <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>later</b> used as a post office. The path continues to Trebarwith Strand, Tregardock, then to Port Gaverne, Port Isaac, and Port Quin, three small harbours. Overlooking Port Quin is Doyden Castle, a 19th-century folly.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 1,050runs (including six centuries) at {{an average}} of 75.00 in the 1940–41 season, Barnes played little cricket until 1945–46, when he scored centuries in five {{successive}} matches for New South Wales. He was picked for the 1945–46 Australian tour of New Zealand and played in the representative match <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>later</b> designated as the first Test match between the two countries: he made 54 as Australia won easily. The post-war period also saw a new approach to batting on the part of Barnes. He discarded his aggressive and flamboyant shot-making and re-invented himself as a watchful, more defensive player, which made his scoring more prolific, although less crowd pleasing.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman Conquest, in 1066, Æthelwig {{was one of}} the few Englishmen trusted by the new King William the Conqueror, and {{was given}} {{authority}} over parts of western England. As part of his duties, he was a royal judge and held important prisoners. During the Harrying of the North in 1069–1070, Æthelwig gave aid to refugees from the north of England. He also helped the king in the rebellion of 1075, preventing one of the rebels from joining the others. Æthelwig died on 16 February in either 1077 or 1078, and was memorialised in a work on his life <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>later</b> incorporated in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, a 13th-century history of the abbey and its abbots.|$|E

5|$|Data {{processing}} led to {{the acquisition}} of 24,943 data points that suggested that some body transited, or crossed in front of (and briefly dimmed), WASP-15 every 3.7520 days. Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM photometer at the La Silla Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements. Analysis confirmed {{the presence of a}} planet <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>later</b> designated WASP-15b.|$|E
5|$|Development on {{the film}} began in 2001, when Spears created a concept <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>later</b> {{expanded}} by Rhimes. Principal filming began on March 2001, and encompassed {{over a period of}} six months. Critics gave negative reviews to Crossroads; however, they considered it a better effort when compared to Mariah Carey's 2001 film Glitter. Despite the movie's response from critics, it was a box office success, grossing over $61.1 million worldwide in three months.|$|E
5|$|East Coker is {{the second}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. It was started {{as a way for}} Eliot to get back into writing poetry and was {{modelled}} after Burnt Norton. It was finished during early 1940 and printed for the Easter edition of the 1940 New English Weekly. The title refers to a small community that was directly connected to Eliot's ancestry and was home to a church <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>later</b> to house Eliot's ashes.|$|E

Lautner trained with Chaturantabut for several years, earning his black belt by the age of eight, and winning several junior world championships.

5|$|In total, 1,650 Whites {{died in the}} Red terror, while around 10,000 Reds {{perished in}} the White terror, which {{eventually}} became political cleansing. The White victims have been recorded exactly, while in particular {{the number of the}} Red troopers executed immediately after the combats remains unclear. Together with the prison camp experiences of the Reds in summer 1918, the executions caused the deepest mental war wounds and scars among the Finns, regardless of their political allegiance. Some of those, who carried out the killings were seriously traumatized, a phenomenon <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>later</b> to become well-documented.|$|E
5|$|Monteux {{was well}} known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a {{conducting}} class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>later</b> moved to his summer home in Les Baux {{in the south of}} France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine.

The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.|$|E
