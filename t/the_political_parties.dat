This blend of transformation contains a multistructure in which anthropological reasoning guarantees the best possible measurements of liminality. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>party</b> represents a social irradiation through the idea of liminality...|$|R

5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> represented in Parliament.|$|E

5|$|In Tamil Nadu, {{partisan}} television channels {{associated with}} the ruling AIADMK and the opposing DMK political parties were criticised for using the disaster for their own political purposes.

5|$|The end of {{cooperation}} between the FVdG and <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> in the Ruhr region {{was part of a}} nationwide trend after Paul Levi, an anti-syndicalist, became chairman of the KPD in March. Moreover, Rudolf Rocker, a communist anarchist and follower of Kropotkin, joined the FVdG in March 1919. He returned via The Netherlands in November 1918 after living in exile in London, where he had been active in the Jewish anarchist scene. Augustin Souchy, more of a Landauer-esque anarchist, also joined the federation in 1919. Both rapidly gained influence in the organization and—as anti-Marxists—were opposed to close collaboration with communists.|$|E
5|$|The governor's {{relationship}} with the General Assembly has typically been the determining factor in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power {{at a time in}} which his party controlled the assembly. Since <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{suggested}} that McKinley's campaign {{of education of}} the voter through speakers and literature brought him victory, but with a cost to the close identification between voters and <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> that was typical in the 19th century. Voter turnout was almost 80 percent in 1896, about average for presidential elections in the late 19th century, but then dropped substantially and remained at lower levels as voters, who once participated in rallies and torchlight processions for candidates, were distracted by radio and by professional sports. Nevertheless, later campaigns tried to recapture the magic of 1896; Warren G. Harding conducted his own front porch campaign in 1920, even borrowing the flagpole from McKinley's old front yard.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> that did not exist when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not been put to a vote by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was elected}} mayor of Tiquicheo. Several drug {{trafficking}} organizations, particularly the La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel, {{are based in}} the area. Michoacán is a leading producer of marijuana and opium poppy, making it a lucrative route for smugglers taking narcotics into the United States. Despite receiving threats, Gorrostieta Salazar publicly denounced the activities of these groups. The drug cartels, which are constantly fighting each other for territorial control, often target mayors who confront them. Other mayors, however, are corrupted and bribed by the cartels. Mexico has more than 2,500 municipalities, {{many of which are}} far from the capital cities and lack amenities available {{in other parts of the}} country. Many of these areas are plagued with drug-related violence, so <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> have faced difficulties finding people interested in holding the post of mayor.|$|E

Consultations with 23 parliamentary and extra-parliamentary parties discussed issues such as: a transitional government including, an interim president and head of the National Assembly, as well as a PAIGC-nominated prime minister other than the incumbent and a government of national unity inclusive of all parties; and the dissolution of the National Assembly with a government led by the National Transitional Council (NTC) under interim leadership.|$|E
