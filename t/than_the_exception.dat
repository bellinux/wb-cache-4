Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.|$|E
25|$|Old growth pine in the Americas, {{of various}} Pinus species, {{was a highly}} desired wood since huge, knot-free boards were the rule rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception.</b> Pine was common and easy to cut, thus many colonial homes used pine for paneling, floors and furniture.

25|$|Economist Thomas Sowell (2001) {{argues that}} {{immigrants}} during Riis's time were typically {{willing to live}} in cramped, unpleasant circumstances as a deliberate short-term strategy {{that allowed them to}} save more than half their earnings to help family members come to America, with every intention of relocating to more comfortable lodgings eventually. Many tenement renters physically resisted the well-intentioned relocation efforts of reformers like Riis, states Sowell, because other lodgings were too costly to allow for the high rate of savings possible in the tenements.

25|$|Aside from Feyenoord and PSV, Ajax {{have several}} other rivalries, {{although}} {{in most cases}} the sentiment is mostly felt by the opposition and is more directed towards Ajax, with one of them being Utrecht. Although the rivalry is more felt on the Utrecht side then with Ajax, matchups between the two sides are often quite intense. Both teams have fanatic supporters, and clashes off the pitch are more often the rule <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception.</b> The same goes for ADO Den Haag, with both supporter groups often getting in conflicts, when ADO-Hooligans set fire to the supporters home of Ajax, and Ajax hooligans subsequently broke into the Supporters home of ADO tensions between the two clubs rose.

WOWO could be heard {{as far away as}} Florida, especially {{early in the morning and}} late at night and many snowbirds listened to WOWO year-around.

25|$|Gluck's reforms made {{most of the}} composers {{of opera}} seria of the {{previous}} decades obsolete. The careers of Hasse, Jommelli, Galuppi, and Traetta were effectively finished. Replacing them came {{a new wave of}} composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Antonio Salieri (a disciple of Gluck), Antonio Sacchini, Giuseppe Sarti, and Domenico Cimarosa. The popularity of the aria da capo began to fade, replaced by the rondò. Orchestras grew in size, arias lengthened, ensembles became more prominent, and obbligato recitative became both common and more elaborate. While throughout the 1780s Metastasio's libretti still dominated the repertory, a new group of Venetian librettists pushed opera seria in a new direction. The work of Gaetano Sertor and the group surrounding him finally broke the absolute dominance of the singers and gave opera seria a new impetus towards the spectacular and the dramatic elements of 19th-century Romantic opera. Tragic endings, on-stage death and regicide became the norm rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception.</b> By the final decade of the century opera seria as it had been traditionally defined was essentially dead, and the political upheavals that the French Revolution inspired swept it away once and for all.|$|E
500|$|In New Guinea, {{the main}} {{role of the}} fighters was escort—something not {{foreseen}} before the war. Early losses of bombers made fighter protection the rule rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception,</b> and if fighter cover was not available, the bombers flew by night. During {{the last half of}} 1943, V Fighter Command flew 6,607 sorties in support of bombers and 10,215 to protect transports, out of 24,397 sorties for the period in total. These missions often depended upon securing forward fighter fields, particularly for long missions. Wurtsmith made what he claimed was the [...] "shortest landing ever made in a P-40" [...] at Marilinan in order to see if it could serve as a forward fighter strip. He proved that it could, although a better site was subsequently located at nearby Tsili Tsili. This base allowed Wurtsmith's fighters to support the bombing of Wewak and the landing at Nadzab. The range of the fighters was increased by the addition of external 200-gallon fuel tanks. Then, in July 1944, Charles Lindbergh, who was visiting the South West Pacific area as civilian observer, taught Wurtsmith's pilots how to obtain additional range by economical operation of their engines. The new technique increased the combat radius of the P-38s to , a gain of some 30 percent. Combining three external droppable tanks with new techniques increased the range of the P-40s to [...]|$|E

The strength of the Hambledon/Hampshire team during Nyren's captaincy can be seen in its being rated the (unofficial) Champion County in 10 seasons: 1766–1771 inclusive, 1776–1777 inclusive, 1779 and 1783.|$|E
40|$|In this essay, I {{make the}} case for {{choosing}} to examine small subsets of Big Data datasets—making big data small. Big Data allows us to produce summaries of human behavior at a scale never before possible. But in the push to produce these summaries, we risk losing sight of a secondary but equally important advantage of Big Data—the plentiful representation of minorities. Women, minorities and statistical outliers have historically been omitted from the scientific record, with problematic consequences. Big Data affords the opportunity to remedy those omissions. However, to do so, Big Data researchers must choose to examine very small subsets of otherwise large datasets. I encourage researchers to embrace an ethical, empirical and epistemological stance on Big Data that includes minorities and outliers as reference categories, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>exceptions</b> to statistical norms...|$|R

2500|$|In {{imperial}} times, the praenomen {{became increasingly}} {{confused by the}} practices of the aristocracy.

[...] Several members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty exchanged their original praenomina for cognomina, or received cognomina in place of praenomina at birth. [...] An emperor might emancipate or enfranchise large groups of people at once, all of whom would automatically receive the emperor's praenomen and nomen. [...] Yet another common practice beginning in the first century AD was to give multiple sons the same praenomen, and distinguish them using different cognomina; by the second century this was becoming the rule, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception.</b> [...] Another confusing practice was the addition of the full nomenclature of maternal ancestors to the basic tria nomina, so that a man might appear to have two praenomina, one occurring in the middle of his name.|$|E
2500|$|The narrowest {{definition}} would be: {{a system}} with unpaired spins that do not interact with each other. In this narrowest sense, the only pure paramagnet is a dilute gas of monatomic hydrogen atoms. Each atom has one non-interacting unpaired electron. Of course, the latter could be said about a gas of lithium atoms but these already possess two paired core electrons that produce a diamagnetic response of opposite sign. Strictly speaking Li is a mixed system therefore, although admittedly the diamagnetic component is weak and often neglected. In the case of heavier elements the diamagnetic contribution becomes more important {{and in the case}} of metallic gold it dominates the properties. Of course, the element hydrogen is virtually never called 'paramagnetic' because the monatomic gas is stable only at extremely high temperature; H atoms combine to form molecular H2 and in so doing, the magnetic moments are lost (quenched), because of the spins pair. Hydrogen is therefore diamagnetic and the same holds true for many other elements. Although the electronic configuration of the individual atoms (and ions) of most elements contain unpaired spins, they are not necessarily paramagnetic, because at ambient temperature quenching is very much the rule rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception.</b> The quenching tendency is weakest for f-electrons because f (especially 4f) orbitals are radially contracted and they overlap only weakly with orbitals on adjacent atoms. [...] Consequently, the lanthanide elements with incompletely filled 4f-orbitals are paramagnetic or magnetically ordered.|$|E
