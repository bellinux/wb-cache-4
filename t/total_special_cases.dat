40|$|Given a network, the {{facility}} location problem consists of locating {{a set of}} sites on the network to serve existing clients so as to minimize its <b>total</b> cost. <b>Special</b> <b>cases</b> include the simple plant location problem (SPLP), bank account location, p-facility location, and p-median problem. We characterize families of networks on which all basic feasible solution from simple linear programming (LP) relaxations are integral. For all these location problems, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for which their basic LP solutions are integral. For the SPLP, we show that the basic LP solutions are integral {{if and only if}} the network contains no cycles of length 2 (mod 4), or equivalently, the graph is obtainable from an even ear composition. Finally, we study polyhedral structures of SPLP and characterize a class of facet inducing inequalities induced by odd cycles. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{minimizing}} weighted flow time on a single machine in the preemptive setting. We present an O(log 2 P) -competitive semi-online algorithm where P is {{the ratio of the}} maximum and minimum processing times of jobs in the system. In the offline setting we show that a (2 + ε) -approximation is achievable in quasi-polynomial time. These are the first non-trivial results for the weighted versions of minimizing flow time. For multiple machines we show that no competitive randomized online algorithm exists for weighted flow time. We also present an improved online algorithm for minimizing <b>total</b> stretch (a <b>special</b> <b>case</b> of weighted flow time) on multiple machines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Maximal Pairing Problem (MPP) is the {{prototype}} of a class of combinatorial optimization problems that are of considerable interest in bioinformatics: Given an arbitrary phylogenetic tree T and weights ω xy for the paths between any two pairs of leaves (x, y), what is the collection of edge-disjoint paths between pairs of leaves that maximizes the <b>total</b> weight? <b>Special</b> <b>cases</b> of the MPP for binary trees and equal weights have been described previously; algorithms to solve the general MPP are still missing, however. Results We describe a relatively simple dynamic programming algorithm for the <b>special</b> <b>case</b> of binary trees. We then show that the general case of multifurcating trees can be treated by interleaving solutions to certain auxiliary Maximum Weighted Matching problems with an extension of this dynamic programming approach, resulting in an overall polynomial-time solution of complexity (n 4 log n) w. r. t. the number n of leaves. The source code of a C implementation can be obtained under the GNU Public License from [URL]. For binary trees, we furthermore discuss several constrained variants of the MPP {{as well as a}} partition function approach to the probabilistic version of the MPP. Conclusions The algorithms introduced here make it possible to solve the MPP also for large trees with high-degree vertices. This has practical relevance in the field of comparative phylogenetics and, for example, in the context of phylogenetic targeting, i. e., data collection with resource limitations. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a time-indexed integer programming formulation for scheduling dependent jobs executed {{by a team}} of workers in an area contaminated with radio-active or chemical materials. The dynamics of the harmful factor and the norms of organism recovery imply that each work period for a job should be immediately followed by a rest period for the worker executing this job and the length of the rest period depends on the start time of the corresponding work period. The problem is modeled as an NP-hard problem of scheduling on unrelated parallel processors with start time dependent processing times and different objective functions: maximum or total completion time and maximum or <b>total</b> tardiness. The <b>special</b> <b>case</b> of scheduling jobs executed by a single worker is also considered. Numerical examples and some computational results are reported.
