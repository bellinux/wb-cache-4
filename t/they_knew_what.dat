5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: <b>They</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>What</b> They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was {{going to happen in the}} story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|Most in {{the crowd}} {{believed}} <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> would follow; Constantine and Maxentius, the only adult sons of a reigning emperor, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had traveled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and {{was present at the}} palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment. In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine. It was not to be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.|$|E

25|$|Questions {{were raised}} {{on why the}} SS Uganda {{did not come to}} give {{assistance}} when the distress rockets were fired. The captain of the ship, Captain Kilpatrick, stated that he thought the lights were from Troubridge Island Lighthouse, and were not distress signals; as a result, he continue on according to procedure. This excuse was challenged {{by the fact that the}} locals nearby could see and identify the lights as distress signals. Furthermore, one of the survivors stated that the SS Uganda did answer the distress signal by replying with an answering light. This suggests that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> it was but did not came to help them.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} reasons some Germans decided {{to end their}} lives in the last months of the war. First, by 1945, Nazi {{propaganda}} had created fear among some sections of the population about the impending military invasion of their country by the Soviets or Western Allies. Information films from the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda repeatedly chided audiences about why Germany must not surrender, telling the people they faced the threat of torture, rape, and death in defeat. Secondly, many Nazis had been indoctrinated in unquestioning loyalty to the party and with it its cultural ideology of preferring death over living in defeat. Finally, others killed themselves because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> would happen to them following defeat. The Soviets, Americans and the British had made it clear in 1943, with the Moscow Declaration, that all those considered war criminals would face judgment. Many party officials and military personnel were, therefore, aware they would face severe punishment for their conduct during the war.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the five}} {{geographical}} {{divisions of the}} Tamil country in Sangam literature, the Marutam region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. The prosperity of a farmer depended on getting the necessary sunlight, seasonal rains and the fertility of the soil. Among these elements of nature, sunlight was considered indispensable by the ancient Tamils, because if rains fail other methods of irrigation could be put to use and if the soil wasn't naturally fertile, artificial manuring would enrich the soil. They differentiated the lands {{on the basis of}} fertility and accordingly cultivated the crops that were best suited for the kind of soil. They were Vanpulam (hardland), Menpulam (fertile land), Pinpulam (dry land) and Kalarnilam or Uvarnilam (salty land). Vanpulam in Mullai and Kurinji regions did not yield rich produce, whereas in Menpulam the yield was very good. Dry crops were cultivated on Pinpulam, because of the limited irrigation facilities. The Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation. Some of the types of soil known to the people of this age were the alluvial soil, red soil, black soil, laterite soil and sandy soil and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> crops could be grown on each type of soil.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of Landis having {{both the}} {{judicial}} and baseball positions began {{almost as soon}} as his baseball appointment was announced in November 1920. On February 2, 1921, lame duck Congressman Benjamin F. Welty (Democrat-Ohio) offered a resolution calling for Landis's impeachment. On February 11, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer opined that there was no legal impediment to Landis holding both jobs. [...] On February 14, the House Judiciary Committee voted 24–1 to investigate Landis. Reed Landis later stated, [...] "one of the other congressmen wanted Father impeached but they did want him to come down and defend himself because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> a show it would be." ...|$|E

A JNA soldier who fought at Vukovar told the Serbian newspaper Dnevni Telegraf that [...] "the Chetnik [...] behaved like professional plunderers, <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> {{to look for}} in the houses they looted." [...] The JNA also participated in the looting; an official in the Serbian Ministry of Defence commented: [...] "Tell me of even one reservist, especially if he is an officer, who has spent more than a month at the front and has not brought back a fine car filled with everything that would fit inside the car." [...] More than 8,000 works of art were looted during the battle, including the contents of the municipal museum, Eltz Castle, which was bombed and destroyed during the siege. Serbia returned 2,000 pieces of looted art in December 2001.|$|E

Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea {{to write a story}} about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E

500|$|Through a {{collaboration}} with science consultant André Bormanis, the producers established the Phage as a bacteriophage. During a behind-the-scenes feature {{included on the}} DVD release of the show's second season, Bromanis explained that the writers and producers paid close attention to imagining a virus that could believably almost exterminate an entire species. Both Piller and Braga responded positively to Taylor's concept of the Vidiians. Piller viewed the idea of [...] "an alien culture who are a civilized people who are forced to do uncivilized things in order to survive" [...] as a compelling plot point. Braga agreed with Piller's assessment, saying: [...] "Very rarely do you stumble on something that has real resonance." [...] Freelance writer Skye Dent, who had helped with the original development of the Vidiians, felt that pride characterized the alien species. She explained: [...] "ven though <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they were doing was wrong {{in terms of the}} actual action, they were very confident that because they were culturally superior, they were totally justified in killing people and taking their organs".|$|E
500|$|Kahn, a European-American student, {{enrolled}} for {{his junior}} and senior years at HowardUniversity, where he became a leader in student politics. Kahn worked closely with Stokely Carmichael, who later became a national leader of young civil-rights activists {{and then one of}} the leaders of the Black Power movement. Kahn and Carmichael helped to fund a five-day run of Three Penny Opera, by the Marxist playwright Berthold Brecht and the socialist composer Kurt Weill: [...] "Tom Kahn—very shrewdly—had captured the position of Treasurer of the Liberal Arts Student Council and the infinitely charismatic and popular Carmichael as floor whip was good at lining up the votes. Before <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> hit them the Student Council had become a patron of the arts, having voted to buy out the remaining performances." [...] Kahn and Carmichael worked with Howard University's chapter of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Kahn introduced Carmichael and his fellow SNCC activists to Bayard Rustin, who became an influential adviser to SNCC. Kahn and Rustin's emphasis on economic inequality influenced Carmichael. Kahn graduated from Howard in 1961.|$|E
500|$|A {{low quality}} snippet of [...] "Frozen" [...] was leaked by fans on January 23, 1998, after it debuted on radio in Singapore, and posted {{it on the}} Internet. They said <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they were doing was wrong, but that they hoped it would simply {{generate}} interest from Madonna. The song was played on the US radios, including the WKTU New York radio. Warner Bros. Records enlisted the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)'s Anti-Piracy Unit to delete the Internet downloads of the song. Erik Bradley, musical director of Chicago B96, classified [...] "Frozen" [...] as a [...] "the mark of a smash. Clearly, American pop radio needs Madonna", after he played the track on his station. According to Jon Uren, marketing director of Warner Music Europe, the song also had [...] "fantastic" [...] early support across Europe. Shortly after the song leaked, a remix version of [...] "Frozen" [...] was broadcast by the BBC website, and also was previewed on the soundtrack at the 1998 Versace fashion spring parade. The single was released commercially on February 23, 1998 in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is {{nice to be able to}} do something like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E
500|$|Oswald's {{head was}} interred in Durham Cathedral {{together}} with the remains of Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (a saint with whom Oswald became posthumously associated, although the two were not associated in life; Cuthbert became bishop of Lindisfarne {{more than forty years}} after Oswald's death) and other valuables in a quickly made coffin, where it is generally believed to remain, although there are at least four other claimed heads of Oswald in continental Europe. One of his arms is said to have ended up in Peterborough Abbey later in the Middle Ages. The story is that a small group of monks from Peterborough made their way to Bamburgh where Oswald's uncorrupted arm was kept and stole it under the cover of darkness. They returned with it to Peterborough and in due time a chapel was created for the arm - Oswald's Chapel. This - minus the arm - can be seen to this day in the south transept of the cathedral. When creating this chapel the monks of Peterborough had thought of how they had acquired it and built into the chapel a narrow tower - just big enough for a monk to climb to the top by an internal stair and stand guard over Oswald's Arm 24 hours a day, every day of the year. [...] The monk had to stand because the tower is not large enough for him to sit - sitting could lull him to sleep - and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> could happen when no-one was watching.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
