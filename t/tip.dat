Before DLC coating, the <b>tips</b> were bombarded with argon ion to clean the surface.

40|$|The <b>tipping</b> of {{hospitality}} workers by customers is an increasingly common custom in Australia. <b>Tips</b> are a substantial (though unquantified) {{part of the}} income {{of hospitality}} workers. Such workers are often casual and vulnerable young employees. <b>Tipping</b> occurs in a tripartite relationship between the business operator, the customer and the worker. It is almost completely unregulated by the labour law instruments of awards and enterprise agreements. This is a ‘regulatory space’ where labour law and consumer protection law may potentially intersect. Who owns <b>tips?</b> While customers may reasonably assume that service workers will receive all the <b>tips</b> they leave, either individually or {{as a share of}} a common fund (the <b>tips</b> jar), the legal ownership of <b>tips</b> is uncertain. English case law indicates that it is the business operator/employer who owns <b>tips,</b> as <b>tips</b> are monies received by employees as an aspect of their employment. However if the employer sets up a system for sharing <b>tips</b> between employees which involves an independently administered fund (the 2 ̆ 7 tronc 2 ̆ 7), <b>tips</b> are then owned beneficially by the employees. Express or implied terms may also operate to provide that employees are entitled to <b>tips,</b> either individually or jointly. The legal incidents of the customer-server relationship are even less clear. The legal position regarding <b>tips</b> is unsatisfactory and runs contrary to customers’ expectations. In this paper we will explore common <b>tipping</b> practices in Australia, the legal ownership of <b>tips,</b> and the potential for regulatory intervention...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tipping</b> (dricks) is {{commonly}} not expected, but is practiced to reward high quality service or {{as a kind}} gesture. <b>Tipping</b> is most often done by leaving small change on the table or rounding up the bill.

40|$|Plectranthus edulis (Vatke) Agnew {{is one of}} the tuber crops of {{the genus}} Plectranthus that is widely {{cultivated}} in Africa and Asia. P. edulis produces below-ground tubers on stolons originating from the stems, comparable to the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Farmers apply several laborious cultural practices to enhance shoot growth and yield, among which shoot <b>tipping</b> is very common. <b>Tipping</b> (pinching) is the removal of the shoot apex with one or two pairs of leaves from the main stems and branches. The rationale of this practice, especially when repeated more than once during one cropping season, is not fully understood. One similar experiment with two cultivars was carried out at two locations (Awassa and Wondogenet) in Ethiopia to assess and analyse the effects of shoot <b>tipping</b> and its frequency on crop development and tuber production. <b>Tipping</b> treatments included zero <b>tipping,</b> <b>tipping</b> once, <b>tipping</b> twice and <b>tipping</b> thrice, with the first <b>tipping</b> taking place 68 days after planting (DAP), a stage at which most of the stems reached a height of about 0 · 15 m, and the remainder following at intervals of 44 – 46 days. <b>Tipping</b> stimulated stem branching; it significantly increased the number of primary, secondary and tertiary stems in both experiments. Soil cover increased with an increase in the frequency of the <b>tipping</b> in Awassa, because of the <b>tipping</b> effects on the different canopy development variables. <b>Tipping</b> also enhanced the soil cover in Wondogenet, but the crop did not gain any extra benefit from a third <b>tipping.</b> <b>Tipping</b> enhanced early stolon formation, but did not consistently affect the number of stolons per hole later in the growing season. The number of tubers increased with an increase in the frequency of <b>tipping</b> in both cultivars in Wondogenet and in one cultivar in Awassa. Tuber dry matter yield increased with an increase in the frequency of <b>tipping</b> at both sites. Fresh tuber yield in the final harvest at 208 DAP was c. 1 · 9 kg/m 2. <b>Tipping</b> on average increased fresh tuber yield by 17 % in Wondogenet, whereas the difference was not detectable in Awassa. Because senescence was delayed slightly by <b>tipping,</b> yield effects of <b>tipping</b> might be larger when harvesting later. In general, there was a positive effect of <b>tipping</b> on canopy development and tuber yield...|$|R

We find that <b>tipping</b> is explained by both increased out-migration and decreased in-migration of whites, although increased out-migration seems to be more important. <b>Tipping</b> seems to be driven by relatively rich individuals and by individuals with kids, suggesting that <b>tipping</b> behavior may increase segregation of whites in a number of dimensions.

40|$|Excerpt] <b>Tipping</b> is an {{interesting}} economic behavior {{because it is an}} expense that consumers are free to avoid. Although called for by social norms, <b>tips</b> are not legally required. Furthermore, since <b>tips</b> are not given until after services have been rendered, they are not necessary to get good service in establishments that are infrequently patronized. For this reason, many economists regard <b>tipping</b> as mysterious or seemingly irrational behavior. The present chapter explores this behavior and its implications for economic theory and public policy. The chapter is divided into four sections. The first two sections provide more detail about the phenomenon of <b>tipping</b> by summarizing and discussing the results of empirical research on the determinants and predictors of restaurant <b>tipping</b> and of national differences in <b>tipping</b> customs respectively. Then, economic theories about <b>tipping</b> are reviewed in light of the previously summarized empirical literature. Finally, the public welfare and policy issues raised by <b>tipping</b> are discussed...|$|R

30|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{retraction}} force was applied, the bracket rotated within a {{play of the}} archwire-bracket slot, and the incisor <b>tipped</b> lingually thereby. This <b>tipping,</b> which was produced without moment, {{was a kind of}} uncontrolled <b>tipping.</b> The lingual <b>tipping</b> continued till the <b>tipping</b> angle reached the maximum rotation angle Δθ so that both diagonal corners of rectangular section of the archwire contacted to the bracket slot (Fig.  1). After that, the lingual <b>tipping</b> was prevented by the archwire. This {{is one of the reasons}} why the lingual <b>tipping</b> angle of the incisor increased with decreasing the archwire size. A play between the archwire and bracket slot produces lingual <b>tipping</b> in all the teeth whenever their brackets move. This <b>tipping</b> cannot be prevented by using an inversely prebent archwire. In clinical situations, the amount of <b>tipping</b> due to a play changes depending on the initial position of archwire in the bracket slot. When an archwire is placed into the bracket slot with a clearance gap as shown in the top illustrations of Fig.  1, the maximum <b>tipping</b> occurs. When an archwire is initially in contact with the bracket slot as shown in the bottom illustrations of Fig.  1, <b>tipping</b> due to a play does not occur. This initial contact will be caused by using an archwire with an initial twist or bend and by a misalignment between the archwire and bracket slot.|$|R
