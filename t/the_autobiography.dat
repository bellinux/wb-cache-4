5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Autobiography</b> of Malcolm X was {{published}} in 1965, {{the result of a}} collaboration between human rights activist MalcolmX and journalist Alex Haley. Haley coauthored <b>the</b> <b>autobiography</b> based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and MalcolmX's 1965 assassination. <b>The</b> <b>Autobiography</b> is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines MalcolmX's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue. He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of MalcolmX's life.|$|E
5|$|Haley coauthored <b>The</b> <b>Autobiography</b> of MalcolmX, {{and also}} {{performed}} the basic functions of a ghostwriter and biographical amanuensis, writing, compiling, and editing <b>the</b> <b>Autobiography</b> based {{on more than}} 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with MalcolmX between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination. The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote {{an article about the}} Nation of Islam for Reader's Digest, and again when Haley interviewed MalcolmX for Playboy in 1962.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 {{while at}} Boston University, Massaquoi {{completed}} editing <b>the</b> <b>autobiography</b> (which was originally titled Bush to Boulevard: <b>The</b> <b>Autobiography</b> of a Vai Noblewoman). Thanks to her extensive travels and education, by this time, she spoke several languages—at least eight and four tribal dialects. In {{addition to her}} native Vai and Mende, she spoke English which she had first learnt at school in Liberia, German from her many years in Hamburg, and French from her schooling in Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on <b>the</b> <b>Autobiography,</b> modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>Autobiography,</b> or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E

The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time he read <b>the</b> <b>autobiography</b> of actress Jane Lapotaire, who {{had gone through the}} same experience, something which he believed aided his recovery more than anything else.|$|E

5|$|Committed to {{national}} cultural preservation and expansion, Massaquoi {{served as the}} director, later dean, of the Liberal Arts College and was the founding director of the Institute of African Studies. She co-founded the Society of Liberian Authors, helped abolish the practice of usurping African names for Westernized versions, and worked towards standardization of the Vai script. In the late 1960s, Vivian Seton, Massaquoi's daughter, had the autobiographical manuscript microfilmed for preservation. After Massaquoi's death, her writings and notes were rediscovered, edited and published in 2013 as <b>The</b> <b>Autobiography</b> of an African Princess.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, {{there was a}} {{resurgence}} of interest in his life among young people.
