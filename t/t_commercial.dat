6000|$|... "The {{engineer}} was hoist {{with his}} own petard," [...] and Curll, the intended victim, had the satisfaction of being the executioner. The poet plainly considered {{him to be a}} scoundrel whom he had a right to damage by any means, foul or fair. Walter Scott believed that his inveterate persecutor administered the emetic to him, and extraordinary as it may seem that a celebrated man of letters should adopt this method of punishing an obnoxious bookseller, the language of Pope obliges us to accept the conclusion[87]. The trick was puerile and degrading, but it inflicted no injury. The prosecution in the House of Lords, and the subsequent effort to fasten his own misdeeds upon his enemy was an outrage of a different description. To lure him into purchasing a book, and then to employ the influence conferred by genius in founding charges upon the act which were absolutely groundless, and in branding him with the disgrace which belonged to his accuser, was a baseness of which the lowest Grub-street scribbler satirised in the Dunciad would probably not have been capable. A spirit of unfairness, which, bad as it might be, was less injurious, pervaded his commercial dealings with Curll. The bookseller paid ten pounds in money, and twenty pounds in promissory notes, for three hundred copies of the work. Two hundred and forty only were delivered, and of these one hundred and ninety wanted the letters to Jervas, Digby, Blount, and others[88]. P. T. and Smythe stated in their advertisement of May 23 that Curll's notes [...] "had proved not negotiable," [...] which they seem to have designed as an excuse for not completing the imperfect books[89]. Curll maintained that the defence added slander to treachery; for the notes were not due till the 12th of June, and he indignantly declared that they would be honoured if the terms of the bargain were fulfilled[90]. But these terms were never intended to be performed. Smythe had contracted to reserve the whole impression for Curll, and assured him on May 10 that no one else should sell a single copy.[91] The pledge was violated as soon as made by sending a parcel of the books to Lintot, and one of the artifices which marked every part of the transaction was employed in public to counteract the promises which had been given in private. As Curll was to provide his own title-page and preface, and the copies seized by the order of the House of Lords had a title-page and preface by P. T., Smythe wrote to Curll on the 13th of May to explain this departure from the arrangement. A [...] "wonderful caution" [...] had suddenly seized P. T., who, apprehending that an injunction might be obtained in Chancery against Curll, had furnished a preface which [...] "threw the publication entirely off him," [...] and a title-page, in which, substituting the entire trade for an individual, it was said that the volume was [...] "printed and sold by the booksellers of London and Westminster."[92] This was pronounced by Smythe to be [...] "as lucky as could be," [...] and it was certainly a curious piece of fortune which caused P. T. to transmit the fifty early copies without title or preface, and inspired him immediately afterwards to attach both to the copies which were instantly to be pounced upon by a messenger from the Lords. To deceive Curll by promises was the first end to be attained, and he was led to believe that he would have a monopoly of the work. To deprive him of the advantages he imagined he had secured was a second, though a subordinate object of the conspiracy. The whole corporation of booksellers were to be invited to encroach upon his rights, and the preface and title-page affixed to the copies produced at the bar of the House of Lords had been drawn up with the secret purpose of contradicting any claim which might be set up by Curll. When Smythe wrote his deceptive explanation of the motives of P. T., these confederates were endeavouring to coax their dupe into owning that he was the collector of the letters, and it was necessary that he should still be humoured and beguiled. When the mask was thrown off, P. T. and Smythe joined in the declaration that they had neither of them [...] "given or could pretend to give any title whatever to Mr. Pope's letters to Curll," [...] and they promised [...] "that every bookseller should be indemnified every way from any possible prosecution or molestation of the said Curll."[93] This invitation to all the world to republish the correspondence of Pope was advertised in the newspapers, and the poet shortly afterwards reprinted it in his [...] "Narrative" [...] without a word of direct remonstrance against the pretension to dispose of his property. P. T. had always hitherto adopted the course which furthered the projects of Pope, and Pope, in return, appeared to smile upon the enormous prerogative to make a general grant of his correspondence which had been assumed by P. <b>T.</b> <b>Commercial</b> honesty was not to be expected in a plan which was based upon falsehood and calumny; but if an ordinary tradesman had conducted his dealings {{in the same manner as}} Pope, his custom and character would have been destroyed. The events which followed the publication lead to the same conclusion with the incidents which preceded and attended it. Pope stated in his [...] "Narrative" [...] that there were so many omissions and interpolations in the surreptitious volume, that it was impossible for him to own the contents in their present condition.[94] In two distinct advertisements which he put forth in May and July, 1735, he went further, and declared that some of the letters were not his at all.[95] Nevertheless the bookseller, Cooper, with whom he was now in alliance, reprinted the entire collection, and brought it out on the 12th of June. He at the same time announced that his edition had been entered at Stationers' Hall, according to the Act of Queen Anne, and that [...] "Edmund Curll or any other pirater of the book should be prosecuted." [...] Curll then served upon him a process, the purport of which does not appear, and Pope wrote to his friend and counsel Fortescue, who a few months later was raised to the bench, and informed him that he had bid Cooper send him the document for his legal opinion, begged to be acquainted with the steps which were necessary to be taken, and acknowledged that he had connived at Cooper's publication. In a subsequent note he asks for further directions in the conduct of the case. The poet and the bookseller were therefore working in conjunction, or to speak more correctly, the bookseller was the agent of the poet. It must have been by Pope's authority that he appropriated the copyright of the letters, and threatened proceedings against any one who invaded it. When Curll took up the gauntlet Pope adopted the cause, engaged Fortescue in the defence, and carried on with him the correspondence respecting it. His sanction of the publication is confirmed by the catalogue of surreptitious editions, since this impression of Cooper is omitted from the list, notwithstanding the insertion of a later impression by the same bookseller, containing some slight additions that had not been ordered by Pope. Thus while the poet pretended that he could not own the P. T. collection, with its mutilated, interpolated, and forged letters, he had secretly authorised a reprint which was identical with the collection he denounced. His actions evince the insincerity of his words. He had the power to erase the forgeries and interpolations with a stroke of his pen, and unless he had approved of the book in its primitive state he would not have entered into a league with Cooper to produce it unaltered. He afterwards seemed to disclaim the republication he had espoused. In the preface to his avowed edition in 1737, he spoke of the [...] "piratical printers" [...] of the surreptitious editions, without making any exception, and said that there was [...] "not one of them to whom he had ever given the least title, or any other encouragement than that of not prosecuting them." [...] This was either a direct untruth or, what was more in accordance with his peculiar morality, a deceptive quibble. Though he knew that his readers must infer that the epithet [...] "piratical" [...] was applied to all the printers who had put forth an edition of the volume of 1735, he may yet have justified to himself the assertion that he had never given the least title to any of them, by the reflection that as he had given a title to Cooper he was not a piratical printer.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{synthesize}} and functionalize different bio-relevant nanomaterials like silica-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as contrast agents for T 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and detonation nanodiamond (DND) with the neurohormone peptide allatostatin 1 (ALST 1) and a fluorescent dye. Analytical techniques for the determination and quantification of surface functional groups like amines, azides, and peptides were also developed and established. Thus, {{in the first part}} of the work, a TGF- 1 binding peptide and allatostatin 1 (ALST 1), both supposed to act as active tumour targeting vectors, were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry. Then, azide-functionalized silica nanoparticles were synthesized by the Stöber process and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The surface loading of amine and azide groups was determined by a new protocol. The azide groups were reduced with sodium boronhydride to amine and then functionalized with Fmoc-Rink Amide linker according to a standard SPPS protocol. Upon cleavage of Fmoc by piperidine, the resulting dibenzofulvene and its piperidine adduct were quantified by UV/Vis spectroscopy and used to determine the amount of amine groups on the nanoparticle surface. Then, ALST 1 and related tyrosine- and phenylalanine substituted model peptides were conjugated to the azide-functionalized silica nanoparticles by copper(I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC). The successful peptide conjugation was demonstrated by the Pauly reaction, which however is only sensitive to histidine- and tyrosine-containing peptides. As a more general alternative, the acid hydrolysis of the peptides to their individual amino acid building blocks followed by derivatization with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) allowed the separation, determination, and quantification of the constituent amino acids by HPLC. In the second part of the work, amine- and azide-functionalized silica-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were synthesized by co-precipitation and subsequent silica-coated based on the Stöber process and characterized by TEM and IR. The amine surface loading was determined by the method already established for the pure silica systems. The azide surface loading could also be quantified by reduction with sodium boronhydride to amine groups and then conjugation to Fmoc-Rink amide linker. Upon cleavage of Fmoc with piperidine, the total amine surface loading was obtained. The amount of azide surface groups was then determined from the difference of the total amine surface loading and the amine surface loading. Thus, it was possible to quantify both amine and azide surface groups on a single nanoparticle system. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are potent T 2 contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to their natural metabolism after injection into the blood stream, SPIONs mostly end up inside macrophages, liver, spleen or kidneys. To generate a potential target-specific SPION-based T 2 contrast agent for MRI, the neurohormone peptide ALST 1 was conjugated by CuAAC to the azide- and amine functionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, since ALST 1 is supposed to target difficult-to-treat neuroendocrinic tumours due to its analogy to galanin and somastatin receptor ligands. The organic fluorescent dye cyanine 5 (Cy 5) was also conjugated to the silica-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) via a NHS-ester to the amines to enable cell uptake studies by fluorescence microscopy. These constructs were characterized by TEM, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and IR. The amino acids of the conjugated ALST 1 were determined by the HPLC method as described before for peptide-modified silica nanoparticle surfaces. Then, the relaxivity r 2 was measured at 7 T. However, a r 2 value of 27 L/mmolFe·s for the dual ALST 1 -/Cy 5 -functionalized silica-coated SPIONs was not comparable to T 2 contrast agents in clinical use, since their relaxivity is commonly determined at 1. 5 T, and no such instrument was available. However, it can be assumed that the synthesized dual ALST 1 -/Cy 5 -functionalized silica-coated SPION would show a lower r 2 at 1. 5 T than at 7 <b>T.</b> <b>Commercial</b> T 2 MRI contrast agents like VSOP-C 184 from Ferropharm show at r 2 values of about 30 L/mmolFe·s at 1. 5 T. Still, the relaxivity of the new material has some potential for application as a T 2 contrast agent. Then, the material was used in cell uptake studies by fluorescence microscopy with the conjugated Cy 5 dye as a probe. The dual ALST 1 -/Cy 5 -functionalized silica-coated SPION showed a high degree of agglomeration with no cellular uptake unlike described for ALST 1 -functionalized nanoparticles in literature. It is assumed that upon agglomeration of the particles, constructs form which are unable to be internalized by the cellular endocytotic pathways anymore. As a future perspective, the tendency of the particle to agglomerate should be reduced by changing the coating material to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or chitosan, which are known to be bio-compatible, bio-degradable and prevent agglomeration. In the third part of the work, the rhenium compound [ReBr(CO) 3 (L) ] with L = 2 -phenyl- 1 H-imidazo[4, 5 -f][1, 10]phenanthroline and its manganese analogue were synthesized by heating the ligand and rhenium pentacarbonyl bromide or and manganese pentacarbonyl bromide respectively, in toluene. However, [MnBr(CO) 3 (L) ] was unstable upon illumination by UV light at 365 nm. Thus, it was dismissed for further application. The photophysical properties of [ReBr(CO) 3 (L) ] were explored, by determination of the excited-state life time by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) method and the quantum yield by a fluorescence spectrometer equipped with an integration sphere. A value of  = 455 ns, a Stokes shift of 197 nm and a rather low quantum yield =were found. Metal complexes are supposed to have superior properties compared to organic dyes due to their large Stokes shifts, long excited-state life times, and high quantum yields. Thus, amine- and azide-functionalized detonation nanodiamond (DND) as an alternative biological inert carrier system was functionalized with ALST 1 to enhance its cell uptake properties. A luminescent probe for cell uptake studies using fluorescence microscopy was also attached, either based on the new rhenium complex or the commercially available organic dye Cy 5, respectively. The aldehyde-functionalized rhenium complex was conjugated to the DND via oxime ligation, which is known to be a mild and catalyst-free conjugation method. The amount of peptide ALST 1 on the DND was analyzed and quantified after acid hydrolysis and PITC derivatization by HPLC as described before. Then, the ALST 1 -/luminescent probe-functionalized DND was investigated for its photophysical properties by fluorescence spectroscopy. The Cy 5 -functionalized material showed a slightly lower fluorescence performance in aqueous solution than reported in literature and commercial suppliers with a life time  < 0. 4 ns and quantum yields not determinable by integration sphere due to the week signal intensity. The rhenium complex-functionalized material had a very low signal intensity in only aqueous medium, and thus determination of life times and quantum yield by fluorescence spectroscopy was not possible. After incubation with MDA-MB 231 cells, the Cy 5 -functionalized DND could easily be detected due to its red fluorescence. However, it was not possible to visualize the rhenium complex-functionalized DND with fluorescence microscopy due to the low fluorescence intensity of the complex in aqueous medium and the lack of proper filters for the fluorescence microscope. Cy 5 -functionalized DND did not show any cellular uptake in fluorescence microscopy after conjugation with ALST 1. Since the nanodiamond surface is known to strongly adsorb peptides and proteins, it is assumed that the peptide chain is oriented perpendicular to the nanoparticle surface and thus not able to interact with cell membrane receptors to promote cell uptake of the particles. As a future perspective, the ALST 1 -promoted cellular uptake of the DND should be improved by using different linker systems for peptide conjugation to prevent adsorption of the peptide chain on the particle surface. The new analytical methods for amino-, azide-, and peptide-functionalized nanoparticles have great potential to assist in the quantification of nanoparticle surface modifications by UV/Vis spectroscopy and HPLC. The determination of surface amine and azide groups based on the cleavage of conjugated Fmoc-Rink amide linker and detected by UV/Vis spectroscopy is applicable to all amine-/azide-functionalized nanomaterials. However, particles which form very stable suspension with the cleavage mixture can cause quantification problems due to scattering, making an accurate quantification of dibenzofulvene and its piperidine adduct impossible. The detection of tyrosine- and histidine-containing peptides based on the Pauly reaction is well-suited as a fast and easy-to-perform qualitative demonstration of successful peptide surface conjugation. However, its major drawback as a colourimetric approach is that coloured particles cannot be evaluated by this method. The amino acid analysis based on HPLC after acid hydrolysis of peptides conjugated to nanoparticle surfaces to its individual building blocks and subsequent derivatization with PITC, can be used on all nanomaterials with peptide or protein surface modification. It allows detection of amino acids down to picomolar concentrations and even enables analysis of very small peptide surface loadings. However, the resulting HPLC traces are difficult to analyze. Three new analytical methods based on UV/Vis and HPLC techniques have been developed and established. They assisted in the characterization of the synthesized DND and SPIONs with dual functionalization by ALST 1 and Cy 5 or [ReBr(CO) 3 (L) ], respectively. However, the nanomaterials showed no cellular uptake due to a high tendency to agglomerate. The cellular uptake should be improved and the tendency to agglomerate of the SPIONs should be reduced by changing the surface coating from silica to either PEG or chitosan. Furthermore, different linker systems for connecting peptides to DND surfaces should be synthesized and evaluated to reduce potential peptide chain adsorption. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Synthese und Funktionalisierung biologisch relevanter Nanomaterialien wie die Silica-umhüllten superparamagnetischen Eisenoxid Nanopartikel (SPIONs) als Kontrastmittel für T 2 gewichtete Magnetresonanztomographie (MRT) und Detonantionsnanodiamant mit dem Neurohormonpeptid Allatostatin 1 (ALST 1) sowie einem Fluoreszenzfarbstoff. Des Weiteren sollten analytische Methoden zur Bestimmung und Quantifizierung von funktionellen Oberflächenmodifikationen wie Amine, Azide und Peptide entwickelt und etabliert werden. Aus diesem Grund wurden im ersten Teil der Arbeit ein TGF- 1 bindendes Peptid und Allatostatin 1 (ALST 1), welche beide spezifisch Tumorgewebe anzielen, mit Hilfe der Festphasen Peptid Synthese (SPPS) hergestellt und durch HPLC und Massenspektrometrie charakterisiert. Danach wurden Azid-funktionalisierte Silica-Partikel durch den Stöber Prozess hergestellt und mit Hilfe von Transmissionselektronenmikroskopie (TEM) und Infrarot Spektroskopie (IR) charakterisiert. Die Oberflächenbeladung von Aminen und Aziden wurde mit einer neuen Methode bestimmt. Azidgruppen wurden mit Natriumborhydrid zu Aminen reduziert und anschließend mit dem Fmoc-Rink Amid Linker unter Verwendung des allgemeinen SPPS Verfahrens. Durch die Abspaltung von Fmoc mit Piperidin wurden Dibenzofulven und sein Piperidin-Adduct gebildet und mit Hilfe von UV/Vis Spektroskopie quantifiziert um die Oberflächenbeladung der Amino-Gruppen auf den Nanopartikeln zu bestimmen. Danach wurden ALST 1 und verwandte Tyrosin- und Phenylalanin- substituierte Modellpeptide synthetisiert und durch die Kuper(I) -katalysierte Azid-Alkin dipolare Cycloaddition (CuAAC) an die Oberfläche der Silica-Partikel konjugiert. Die erfolgreiche Peptidkonjugation wurde mit Hilfe der Pauly Reaktion, welche jedoch ausschließlich auf Tyrosin- und Histidin-haltige Peptide und Proteine anwendbar ist, nachgewiesen. Als eine universellere Alternative wurden die Peptid-konjugierten Nanomaterialien mit konzentrierter Salzsäure hydrolysiert und anschließend mit Phenylisothiocyanat (PITC) derivatisiert, was die Trennung, Bestimmung und Quantifikation der individuellen Aminosäuren des Peptids durch HPLC ermöglichte. In dem zweiten Teil dieser Arbeit wurden Amin- und Azid-funktionalisierte Silica-umhüllte superparamagnetische Eisenoxidnanopartikel (SPIONs) durch Co-Präzipitation und anschließender Silica-Ummantelung basierend auf dem Stöber Prozess synthetisiert und mit Hilfe von TEM und IR charakterisiert. Die Oberflächenbeladung der Aminogruppen wurde an Hand der bereits etablierten Methode für Silica-Partikel bestimmt. Die Oberflächenbeladung der Azidgruppen wurde quantifiziert durch deren Reduktion mit Natriumborhydrid zu Aminogruppen und der darauf folgenden Verknüpfung mit dem Fmoc-Rink Amid Linker. Durch die Abspaltung des Fmoc mit Piperidin und dessen Quantifizierung durch UV/Vis Spektroskopie wurde so die gesamte Aminogruppen Oberflächenbeladung erhalten. Die Oberflächenbeladung mit Azidgruppen wurde dann durch die Differenz aus gesamter Amin- und tatsächlicher Amin-Oberflächenbeladung berechnet. Auf diese Weise war es möglich die Oberflächenbeladung sowohl von Aminen, als auch von Aziden an nur einem einzigen Nanopartikelsystem zu bestimmen. SPIONs können als Kontrastmittel für T 2 -gewichtete MRT Messungen verwendet werden. Jedoch werden sie auf Grund ihres Metabolismus nach der Injektion ins Blutsystem von Makrophagen, Leber, Milz und Niere aufgenommen. Um ein potentielles, gewebespezifisches SPION-basiertes Kontrastmittel für T 2 -gewichtete MRT Messungen zu erzeugen wurde das Neurohormonpeptid ALST 1 mit Hilfe der CuAAC an die Azid-/Amin-funktionalisierten Silica-ummantelten SPIONs konjugiert, da von ALST 1 eine Spezifität auf schwierig zu behandelnde neuroendokrine Tumore vermutet wird, auf Grund seiner Ähnlichkeit zu Galanin und Somastatin Rezeptorliganden. Der organische Fluoreszenzfarbstoff Cyanin 5 (Cy 5) wurde ebenfalls an den Azid-/Amin-funktionalisierten Silica-ummantelten SPIONs über einen NHS-Ester konjugiert um Zellaufnahmestudien mit Hilfe von Fluoreszenzmikroskopie zu ermöglichen. Diese Materialien wurden mit TEM, dynamischer Lichtstreuung (DLS) und IR charakterisiert. Die Aminosäuren des konjugierten ALST 1 wurden an Hand der bereits für Silica-Partikel beschriebenen HPLC-Methode bestimmt. Danach wurde die Relaxivität r 2 bei 7 T gemessen. Leider sind der gemessene Wert von 27 L/mmolFe·s für das duale System ALST 1 -/Cy 5 -functionaliserte Silica-ummantelte SPIONs nicht mit klinisch verwendete T 2 Kontrastmittel zu vergleichen, da diese bei einer Feldstärke von 1. 5 T verwendet werden. Es ist jedoch anzunehmen, dass das synthetisierte Nanopartikelsystem bei 1. 5 T eine geringere Relaxivität r 2 zeigen würde als bei 7 T. Jedoch zeigen kommerzielle Kontrastmittel für T 2 -gewichtete MRT Messungen wie zum Beispiel VSOP-C 184 von Ferropharm r 2 Werte um die 30 L/mmolFe·s. Von daher hat das neue Material durchaus Potential als Kontrastmittel für T 2 -gewichtete MRT Messungen. Danach wurde das Material auf seine Zellaufnahme mit Hilfe von Fluoreszenzmikroskopie unter Verwendung des konjugierten Cy 5 als Sonde untersucht. Die dualen ALST 1 -/Cy 5 -functionaliserte Silica-ummantelte SPIONs wurden mit MDA-MB 231 Zellen inkubiert, zeigten jedoch einen hohen Grad an Agglomeration, wobei große Konstrukte gebildet wurden die nicht mehr durch die zellularen Endozytosewege internalisiert werden konnten. Für weitere Anwendungen muss die Tendenz der Partikel zur Agglomeration verringert werden. Dies kann durch einen Wechsel der Hülle von Silica zu Polyethylenglykol (PEG) oder Chitosan erreicht werden, welche dafür bekannt sind Agglomeration zu verhindern als auch biologisch kompatibel, abbaubar zu sein. Im dritten Teil der Arbeit wurde die Rheniumverbindung [ReBr(CO) 3 (L) ] mit L = 2 -Phenyl- 1 H-imidazo[4, 5 -f][1, 10]phenanthrolin und ihr Mangan-Analogon synthetisiert durch Erhitzen des Liganden und Bromopentacarbonylrhenium, beziehungsweise Bromopentacarbonyl-mangan, in Toluol. Der Komplex [MnBr(CO) 3 (L) ] wurde jedoch wegen seiner Instabilität bei Belichtung mit UV-Licht der Wellenlänge 365 nm für weitere Anwendungen verworfen. Die photophysikalischen Eigenschaften von [ReBr(CO) 3 (L) ] wurden untersucht durch die Bestimmung der Lebenszeit des angeregten Zustandes mit der time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) Methode und die Quantenausbeute mit Hilfe eines Fluoreszenzspektrometers welches mit einer Integrationsphäre ausgerüstet war. Ein Wert von  = 455 ns, einem Stokes shift von 197 nm und eine eher niedrige Quantenausbeute  = 0. 05 wurden ermittelt. Es wird behauptet, dass Metallkomplexe den organischen Fluoreszenzfarbstoffen überlegende Stokes shifts, Lebenszeiten des angeregten Zustandes sowie Quantenausbeuten haben. Aus diesem Grund wurde der Amino- und Azid-funktionalisierte DND mit ALST 1, auf Grund seiner Eigenschaft die Zellaufnahme zu verstärken, funktionalisiert. Des Weiteren wurde eine Fluoreszenzsonde für Zellaufnahmestudien unter Verwendung von Fluoreszenzmikroskopie und die Partikeloberfläche konjugiert, welche entweder auf [ReBr(CO) 3 (L) ] oder Cy 5 basierten. Die Aldehyd-funktionalisierte Rheniumverbindung wurde über die Oxime Ligation an den Nanopartikel konjugiert, welche als milde und Katalysator-freie Konjugationsmethode bekannt ist. Die Menge des Peptids ALST 1 auf der DND Oberfläche wurde durch HPLC nach saurer Hydrolyse und Derivatisierung mit PITC wie zuvor beschrieben analysiert und quantifiziert. Danach wurden die dualen ALST 1 -/Lumineszenzsonde-funktionalisierten DND in Bezug auf ihre photophysikalischen Eigenschaften mit Hilfe der Fluoreszenzspektroskopie untersucht. Das Cy 5 -funktionaliserte Material zeigte in wässrigem Medium etwas geringere Lebenszeit des angeregten Zustandes mit  < 0. 4 ns als in der Literatur beschrieben und eine nicht bestimmbare Quantenausbeute durch die Integrationssphäre auf Grund der schwachen Emissionsintensität. Das [ReBr(CO) 3 (L) ]-funktionalisierte Material zeigte eine sehr geringe Emissionsintensität in wässrigen Medium, welche es unmöglich machte die Lebenszeit des angeregten Zustandes und die Quantenausbeute zu bestimmen. Es war nicht möglich das Rhenium Komplex-funktionalisierte Material auf Grund seiner geringen Emissionsintensität in der Fluoreszenzmikroskopie nach Inkubation mit MDA-MB 231 Zellen zu visualisieren. Nach der Inkubation des Cy 5 -functionalisierten DND mit MDA-MB 231 Zellen, konnte das Material sehr gut auf Grund seiner roten Fluoreszenz identifiziert werden. Jedoch zeigte es keine Internalisierung in die Zellen nach Konjugation mit ALST 1. Es wird vermutet dass die Peptidkette flach auf die Nanodiamantoberfläche, welche für ihre starke, nicht-kovalente Interaktion mit Proteinen und Peptiden bekannt ist, adsorbiert ist. Für zukünftige Anwendungen muss die ALST 1 -vermittelte Zellaufnahme der Detonationsnanodiamanten verbessert werden. Dies kann erreicht werden durch die Verwendung anderer Linker-Systeme zur Verbrückung von Peptid und Partikeloberfläche um Adsorption zu verhindern. Die neuen analytischen Methoden für Amino-, Azid-, und Peptid-funktionalisierte Nanopartikel haben großes Potential in der Quantifizierung von Oberflächenmodifikationen von Nanopartikeln durch HPLC und UV/Vis. Die Bestimmung von Oberflächenbeladungen von Amin- und Azidgruppen basierend auf der Abspaltung von konjugiertem Fmoc des Fmoc-Rink Amid Linkers und Detektion durch UV/Vis Spektroskopie ist anwendbar auf alle Amin- und Azid-funktionalisierten Nanomaterialien. Jedoch kann es bei Partikeln welche besonders stabilen Suspensionen mit der Abspaltlösung bilden zu Problemen in der Quantifikation von Dibenzofulven und seinem Piperidin Addukt mittels UV/Vis Spektroskopie auf Grund von Streuung kommen. Die Detektion von Tyrosin- und Histidin-enthaltenden Peptiden auf Nanopartikeloberflächen auf Grundlage der Pauly Reaktion ist besonders geeignet als schneller und einfach durchzuführender qualitativer Nachweis für die erfolgreiche Konjugation von Peptiden auf Nanopartikeloberflächen. Der Hauptnachteil ist jedoch, dass Partikel mit Eigenfarbe nicht verwendet werden können. Die Aminosäureanalyse auf Grundlage von HPLC nach saurer Hydrolyse von Peptid-funktionalisierten Nanomaterialien und anschließender Derivatisierung mit PITC kann für alle Peptid- oder Protein-modifizierten Nanomaterialien verwendet werden. Es ermöglicht die Detektion von bis zu pikomolaren Konzentrationen und damit die Quantifizierung sehr geringe Oberflächenbeladungen mit Peptiden und Proteinen. Jedoch sind die resultierenden HPLC Chromatogramme schwierig zu interpretieren. Drei neue analytische Methoden auf der Grundlage von UV/Vis und HPLC Techniken wurden entwickelt und etabliert. Sie halfen bei der erfolgreichen Charakterisierung der synthetisierten DND und SPIONs mit dualer Funktionalisierung durch ALST 1 und Cy 5, beziehungsweise [ReBr(CO) 3 (L) ]. Jedoch zeigten die Nanomaterialien auf Grund der hohen Tendenz zur Agglomeration keine Zellaufnahme. Das weitere Vorgehen umfasst die Verbesserung der Zellaufnahme durch ersetzen der Silica-Hülle der SPIONs mit PEG oder Chitosan. Bei den DND müssen andere Linkersysteme in Betracht gezogen...|$|E
