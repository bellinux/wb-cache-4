5|$|There was {{increased}} looting on December 20, both in Buenos Aires and the Conurbano. The cacerolazos continued; {{large groups of}} people started demonstrations calling for the government's resignation. The unions—first the CTA and then the CGT—began general strikes against <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> Most of the UCR withdrew their support to De la Rúa, so he asked the PJ to create a government coalition. The PJ refused, and De la Rúa resigned from government. His last administrative action was to lift <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> He gave his resignation to the Congress at 19:45 local time on December 20, 2001, and left the Casa Rosada in a helicopter. He had ruled for two years, half of his term of office.|$|E

The Tories sought to be included in a wartime coalition government, but Mackenzie King refused. The House of Commons had only a slight role in the war effort; under <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency,</b> most business was accomplished through the Cabinet issuing Orders in Council.|$|E
5|$|Opposing the {{decentralisation}} stance {{taken in}} the treaty, Pavlov {{was one of the}} key players in the establishment of the State Committee for <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Emergency</b> in August 1991. Pavlov's inclusion in the committee has been used to demonstrate its unwillingness to revert to pre-Gorbachev policies. The Committee's main goal was to ensure that the Soviet Union continued as a highly centralised union state. The Emergency Committee was led by Gennady Yanayev, Vice President of the Soviet Union, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, Defence Minister Dmitry Yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust Gorbachev.|$|E

5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3, {{at which point}} they went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of unnecessarily extending <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> (and related curfews) to maintain her political control as predictions at the time suggested {{that she and her}} party would be ousted by the opposition. She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's light damage was not thought to have been a major factor.|$|E
5|$|The Secretaría de Gobernación {{declared}} a state of emergency in 21 of Nuevo León's 51 municipalities, freeing federal disaster funds for use in aid operations. An additional 10 municipalities were placed under <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> on July8. A similar declaration was made for 8 municipalities in Oaxaca, and for 14 municipalities in Tamaulipas; <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> in Tamaulipas was later expanded to 30 municipalities. Mexican President Felipe Calderón requested adding resources to the federal disaster fund, as the $3 billion (2010 MXN; $235 million USD) it held would not be sufficient to face the damage in Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. In the months following the storm, a total of $4.8 billion (2010 MXN; $375 million USD) was released by the federal and state governments to aid in the reconstruction of the disaster areas in Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. In Texas, Governor Rick Perry activated the state's search and rescue capabilities in Laredo and San Antonio. This activation was due to the flooding on the Rio Grande Valley, which was expected to worsen due to the approach of Tropical Depression Two to the area affected by Alex.|$|E
5|$|Born to a Gujarati {{family in}} Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his own stall. He was {{introduced}} to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.|$|E

5|$|In November 2007, Musharraf instituted {{emergency}} rule {{for six weeks}} (see Pakistani state of emergency, 2007), under the pretext of rising Islamist militancy, {{a few days after}} Bhutto's departure for Dubai to meet with Zardari. Immediately after <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal—the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.|$|E
5|$|The BJP's origins {{lie in the}} Bharatiya Jana Sangh, {{formed in}} 1951 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Emergency</b> in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party; it {{defeated}} the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election. After three years in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 {{with the members of}} the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. Although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the 1984 general election, it grew in strength {{on the back of the}} Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government lasted only 13 days.|$|E
5|$|The main militant African {{nationalist}} {{parties in}} each territory were {{banned by the}} federal and territorial governments, but all reorganised under new names only months later. The Southern Rhodesian ANC became the National Democratic Party (later ZAPU), the Northern Rhodesian ANC became the Zambian African National Congress, and the Nyasaland ANC became the Malawi Congress Party. The media's {{use of the term}} 'police state' to describe the response to the violence outraged the Liberals, the Church of Scotland, and leftist Conservatives, and particularly the Labour Party, in Britain. John Stonehouse, a Labour MP, had been deported prior to the declaration of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency,</b> adding to the tension. A Royal Commission was announced to investigate the violence. Welensky was indignant when asked to contribute to the Royal Commission, and the Labour Party boycotted it.|$|E

5|$|General Nguyễn Khánh {{had come}} to power in January 1964 after {{surprising}} the ruling junta of General Dương Văn Minh in a bloodless coup. However, due to American pressure, he kept the popular Minh as a token head of state, while concentrating real power in his hands by controlling the Military Revolutionary Council. In August, the Vietnam War continued to escalate following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, a disputed encounter between communist and American naval vessels off the North Vietnamese coast; Washington accused North Vietnam of attacking their ships in international waters. Khánh saw the tense situation {{as an opportunity to}} increase his authority. On August 7, he declared a state of emergency, increased police powers, banned protests, tightened censorship and allowed the police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. He drafted a new constitution, which would have augmented his personal power {{at the expense of the}} already-limited Minh. However, these moves only served to weaken Khánh as large demonstrations and riots broke out in the cities, with majority Buddhists prominent, calling for an end to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> and the abandonment of the new constitution, as well as a progression back to civilian rule.|$|E
5|$|In the Republic of India's {{first three}} general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own {{unexpected}} death in 1966, by Indira Gandhi, {{who went on}} to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over three years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.|$|E
5|$|In April 1955 the Australian {{government}} had committed army, navy {{and air force}} elements to the Far East Strategic Reserve {{to assist in the}} defence of Malaya from internal and external security threats. While British Commonwealth forces had been operating against the communist terrorists since 1948, the battalions of the regiment came relatively late to the Malayan Emergency, and when 2 RAR arrived in theatre in October 1955 to join the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, the war had been running for over seven years. 2 RAR was replaced by 3 RAR in 1957, which was in turn replaced by 1 RAR in 1959. During the Emergency the three battalions were involved in 45 contacts, killing 17 guerrillas for the loss of seven men killed in action. According to Jim Molan the attention to detail required of five years of infantry soldiering in Malaya exposed the regiment to jungle warfare skills developed by the British Army during its most successful counterinsurgency war. This experience later informed the development of its own doctrine, with the Malayan Emergency making a significant contribution to the professionalism of the regiment. Meanwhile, the regimental depot—which had been renamed 4 RAR soon after formation—was subsequently incorporated into the School of Infantry and renamed Depot Company, Royal Australian Regiment in 1960. Despite the end of <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Emergency</b> in Malaya, 1 RAR was employed on anti-terrorist operations along the Thai border in late 1960. 1 RAR was replaced in Malaya by 2 RAR in 1961, with the battalion involved in training and counter-terrorist operations. It was subsequently employed on operations along the Thai border for three months in mid-1962, and again in May and June 1963, being involved in a number of minor contacts. 2 RAR handed over to 3 RAR in August, and returned to Australia. 3 RAR was also committed to operations along the Thai border in early 1964.|$|E
