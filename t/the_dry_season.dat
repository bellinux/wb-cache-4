5|$|Herbivores, {{including}} wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela {{conservation area}} and migration {{corridor to the}} south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.|$|E

5|$|In October <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> sets in {{across much}} of Florida (starting early in the month in {{northern}} Florida and {{near the end of}} the month in deep southern Florida) and lasts until late April in most years. Fronts from mid-latitude storms north of Florida occasionally pass through northern and central parts of the state which bring light and brief winter rainfall. Mid and late winter can become severely dry in Florida. In some years <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> becomes quite severe and water restrictions are imposed to conserve water. While most areas of Florida do not experience any type of frozen precipitation, north Florida can see fleeting snow or sleet a few times each decade.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} grass {{selectivity}} among the wildebeest, zebra, and the Coke's hartebeest, the hartebeest showed the highest selectivity.

5|$|Late in <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> (around April) of each year, females {{give birth}} to a single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains {{attached}} to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy during <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> when {{water and food}} are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E

50|$|Little {{is known}} on the matting and {{reproduction}} behaviors of Red fruit bats. What is known is that males show {{a tendency to}} mate during <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> rather than <b>the</b> rainy seasons. Females will mate year round, showing that females are polyestrus. Seasons also affect embryo size. Smaller embryos appear more during <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> than during rainy seasons.When pups are born they are covered in fur, the face is pink and has no hair, and their eyes are open. At birth they are 45 mm long, forearm length of 29.4 mm, and have a wingspan of 201 mm.|$|R

5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E

30|$|The {{absence of}} a general {{lowering}} of the water table both during <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> and in <b>the</b> comparison of the periods before and after 1992 / 1993, which is shown in Fig.  7, supports {{the hypothesis that the}} aquifer still has good potential for cyclic seasonal conjunctive use. The overall stability of the level of the water table between <b>the</b> wet and <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> may indicate that the aquifer has significant interactions with the rivers or other aquifers that regularize the surplus or deficit in the water balance during <b>the</b> wet and <b>dry</b> <b>seasons,</b> respectively.|$|R

5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> by seeking refuge in alligator holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E
5|$|As part of Romblon, Banton is {{classified}} under Type III of the Corona climatic classification system. This type of climate {{is described as}} having no prominent wet or dry seasons.

5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} was found with a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, {{at the peak of}} <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them {{from the back of the}} insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
