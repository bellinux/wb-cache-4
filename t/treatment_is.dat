5|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, {{different}} medical issues can appear, such as oral and dental disease, pressure ulcers, malnutrition, hygiene problems, or respiratory, skin, or eye infections. Careful management can prevent them, while professional <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> needed {{when they do}} arise. During {{the final stages of}} the disease, <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> centred on relieving discomfort until death, often with the help of hospice.|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E
5|$|However, a key {{advantage}} of HDR <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> that each dose {{can be delivered}} on an outpatient basis with a short administration time providing greater convenience for many patients.|$|E
30|$|Twelve <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} by factorially combined six levels of N fertilizer (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100  kg N ha− 1) and two Rhizobium inoculation treatments (inoculated and uninoculated). The <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> {{laid out in}} randomized completely block design and all <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> replicated three times.|$|R

5|$|PEP <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> {{recommended}} after {{a sexual}} assault when the perpetrator {{is known to be}} HIV positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown. The duration of <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> usually four weeks and is frequently associated with adverse effects—where zidovudine is used, about 70% of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).|$|E

40|$|Topical therapies <b>are</b> the {{mainstream}} <b>treatment</b> of psoriasis because most patients have mild disease. First-line <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> vitamin D derivatives and corticosteroids. These <b>treatments</b> <b>are</b> usually given in combination schedules. For topical treatments {{the selection of}} the most appropriate vehicle is of major importance, thus improving adherence to the <b>treatment,</b> which frequently <b>is</b> impaired by the complexities of topical therapeutic choices. Evidence for efficacy and safety of topical <b>treatments</b> <b>is</b> readily available for vitamin D treatments and short-term treatment with corticosteroids. However, the scientific evidence for longer-term <b>treatments</b> <b>is</b> limited. Multiple new small molecules are in various stages of development and are reviewed...|$|R
30|$|The <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> 1, 2, 3, or 4 {{capsules}} of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin per day. The {{duration of}} treatment ranged from 2 to 48  months. The mean duration of <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> 12  months.|$|R
5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} TB {{is made by}} identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture. Thus, <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> often begun before cultures are confirmed.|$|E
5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease. In those with HIV, {{the risk of developing}} active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.|$|E
5|$|Although erections are not {{necessary}} for satisfying sexual encounters, many men see them as important, and treating erectile dysfunction improves their relationships and quality of life. Whatever <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> used, it works best in combination with talk-oriented therapy to help integrate it into the sex life.|$|E
40|$|Chemotherapy, in {{conjunction}} with other methods of <b>treatment,</b> <b>was</b> used in 100 patients with invasive hydatidiform mole or choriocarcinoma following mole. When <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> instituted within two to six months of the antecedent mole serious drug resistance was not encountered, drug toxicity was slight, the duration of <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> comparatively short, and sustained remissions were obtained in 57 out of 60 patients. When the start of chemotherapy was delayed beyond six months drug resistance occurred in many instances, toxicity was often severe, the duration of <b>treatment</b> <b>was</b> much longer, and sustained remissions were obtained in 22 out of 40 patients...|$|R

25|$|Some {{doctors say}} an {{advantage}} to stereotactic <b>treatments</b> <b>is</b> that they deliver {{the right amount of}} radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks.

One problem with stereotactic <b>treatments</b> <b>is</b> that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.|$|R
5|$|An alternative, space <b>treatment,</b> <b>is</b> fogging or misting to {{disperse}} a liquid insecticide {{in the atmosphere}} within a building without evacuation or airtight sealing, allowing most work within the building to continue, {{at the cost of}} reduced penetration. Contact insecticides are generally used to minimise long lasting residual effects.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. <b>Treatment</b> <b>is</b> relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|Antiparasitic <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> most {{effective}} {{early in the}} course of infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include azole or nitro derivatives, such as benznidazole or nifurtimox. Both agents are limited in their capacity to completely eliminate T. cruzi from the body (parasitologic cure), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.|$|E
30|$|A {{hypothesis}} {{is a test}} whether there is any such difference between the treatments based on the F ratio. It will ask whether the F ratio for the <b>treatments</b> <b>is</b> unusually high by comparing the F ratio {{to a kind of}} a standard distribution called an F distribution. The p value for the <b>treatments</b> <b>is</b> the probability of getting such a high F ratio if all the <b>treatments</b> <b>were</b> really identical.|$|R

5|$|Before <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> begun, {{several other}} {{investigations}} are recommended. These include a chest x-ray, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and {{a test for}} levels of CA-125, a tumor marker that can be elevated in endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|Between 20% and 50% of high-risk cases do {{not respond}} {{adequately}} to induction high-dose chemotherapy and are progressive or refractory. Relapse after completion of frontline therapy is also common. Further <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> available in phase I and phase II clinical trials that test new agents and combinations of agents against neuroblastoma, but the outcome remains very poor for relapsed high-risk disease.|$|E
5|$|Congenital malformation, {{hereditary}} disorders, {{and acquired}} conditions can affect cerebellar structure and, consequently, cerebellar function.

5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction.

5|$|Epilepsy {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that <b>treatment</b> <b>is</b> no longer needed.|$|E
