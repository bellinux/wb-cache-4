40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} characterisation of an airborne ultrasonic communication system using electrostatic transducers. Initially, digital modulation schemes, namely OOK, BFSK and BPSK were used for transmission of a digital binary stream across an air gap of 0 – 1. 2 m. BPSK {{was found to be}} the most favourable solution for the lowest BER performance. BFSK, being the second best among the three was simpler to implement and was more robust against synchronisation errors. Later, to further improve bandwidth efficiency, several M-nary modulations, namely QPSK, MSK and 8 PSK were used. The data rate reached 800 kbps when 8 PSK was used. An ultrasonic keyboard using BFSK were developed as a simple application. A real-time communication system was also developed using a PXI system and LabVIEW, with which broadband data communication and real-time performance analysis was realised. The channel response of the ultrasonic communication link was modelled, with the characteristic of ultrasonic absorption in air, transducer response, and spatial field response. The latter was found to be crucial factor when the <b>transreceivers</b> were not aligned in parallel. The results recorded at various distances were in good agreement with those predicted using the system model developed. Several equalisation techniques were looked at in this thesis, to combat the selective attenuation response for longer-range propagation, and its effectiveness has been compared to using multicarrier modulation. This thesis has also looked at multipath interference, which is likely to be effect the performance in future applications. It shows that by using spread spectrum techniques, multipath interference can be tackled in an ultrasonic system. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

30|$|Spatial {{modulation}} (SM) {{has been}} identified as a new efficient multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique, which was first proposed in [1]. The main principle of SM is that it jointly uses antenna indices and a conventional signal set to convey information and activates only one antenna to transmit the traditional modulated symbol in each time slot. The advantages of SM, such as the relaxation of antenna synchronization, the avoidance of inter-channel interference, and the reduction in <b>transreceiver</b> complexity, make it become a topic of recent research [2 – 4]. In order to achieve these potential benefits, an adequate hard-decision detector for retrieving the information bits transmitted in the spatial and signal constellation diagrams is needed. A matched filter (MF) detection was first proposed in [1], which detects the antenna index and modulated symbol separately. In [5], the authors first investigated the optimum hard-output maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, which jointly detects the transmit antenna index and the modulated symbol. To achieve a better trade-off between the performance and computational complexity, various sub-optimal hard-output detectors based on ML and MF have been broadly investigated in [6 – 9], respectively.|$|E

OFDM can be used in conjunction with a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) <b>transreceiver</b> to increase the diversity gain and/or the system capacity by exploiting spatial domain. Because the OFDM system effectively provides numerous parallel narrowband channels, MIMO-OFDM is considered a key technology in emerging high-data rate systems such as 4 G, IEEE 802. 16, and IEEE 802. 11 n.

40|$|For {{the sake}} of {{exploring}} the feasibility of providing video services for mobile users, this thesis investigates the design of wireless video communication systems using the British Broadcasting Corporation's recent proprietary wavelet-based video codec {{referred to as the}} Dirac codec. The Dirac video-encoded bitstream is subjected to a rigorous error sensitivity investigation for the scale of assisting us in contriving various joint source-channel coding (JSCC) and decoding schemes for wireless videophones. Unequal Error Protection (UEP) is an attractive technique of implementing JSCC. Based on the Dirac video codec's bit sensitivity studies, an Unequal Error Protection (UEP) scheme using turbo-equalized Irregular Convolutional Codes (IRCCs) was designed. Furthermore, an Iterative Source-Channel Decoding (ISCD) scheme, which exploits the residual redundancy left in the source encoded bitstream for {{the sake of}} improving the attainable system performance was investigated. Hence, a novel ISCD scheme employing a specific bit-to-symbol mapping scheme referred to as Over-Complete Mapping (OCM) was proposed. This allows us to design an attractive video transmission scheme having a high error resilience at a reasonable complexity and a low delay. The research reported in this thesis was concluded with the design of unequal error protection irregular over-complete mapping for wavelet video telephony using iterative source and channel decoding. The philosophy of this video telephone scheme is that we exploit as much redundancy inherent in the Dirac-encoded bitstream as possible for improving the system's BER performance, while protecting the more sensitive portions of the Dirac video-encoded sequence with a lower OCM rate.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 107 - 111). Point-to-point (P 2 P) communication is utilized where each communication node knows the physical or electrical {{positions of the}} other. In this type of communication, only two nodes transmit/receive message between each other and no other node is included in this process. P 2 P communication o ers some advantages such as lower power consumption, better information safety, lower vulnerablity to jamming and better channel capacity usage. With these properties, it is preferred frequently in military. Directional antennas with high gain and low side lobe level (SLL) are desired for P 2 P communication {{in order to achieve}} higher e ective communication distance, lower power consumption and to decrease the interference between channels, respectively. Another requirement is caused by Multiple-Input-Multiple- Output capability, which is a technique to use dual or circularly polarized <b>transreceiver</b> antennas instead of using separate transmitter and receiver antennas in the system. For dual-polarized MIMO antennas, high cross polarization isolation values are desired to separate the transmitting and receiving channels in order to prevent them e ecting each other. In this study, a C-band dual-polarized strip-fed aperture coupled stacked patch antenna array for P 2 P communication is designed. To satsify the requirements of P 2 P communication, the re ection coe cient of the designed antenna is - 10 dB. The gain is 20 dB and SLL is better than - 15 dB in the cardinal and intercardinal planes of the antenna for both polarizations. Additionally, 40 dB cross polarization isolation can be achieved. The idea is based on planar array of strip-fed dual-polarized aperture coupled patch antennas with stripline feed networks. By adjusting the amplitude distribution on the feed network, - 15 dB SLL in both cardinal and intercardinal planes is achieved for both polarizations. In order to block the coupling between feed networks for di erent polarizations and prevent distortion on amplitude and phase distributions, stripline feed networks are chosen. In this way, cross polarization isolation can be increased as well. Hence, a novel antenna element, dual-polarized strip-fed aperture coupled stacked patch antenna is proposed. The parameters that a ect the impedance behaviour of this type of antenna are investigated and examined in detail. Required feed networks to achieve - 15 dB SLL in cardinal and intercardinal planes are designed.

40|$|Introduction Blood {{oxygenation}} level dependent (BOLD) functional {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) is widely used as a measure of neuronal activity. However, the neural basis of BOLD signal is still elusive[1]. In this work, we established a robust light-driven fMRI platform mediated by channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2). Meanwhile, we performed the in vivo recording to characterize the light-evoked local field potential from the activated cortex. This platform will allow us to target specific cell types by optical stimulation, and directly study the coupled fMRI signal from the local cerebrovasculature[2]. Methods All images were acquired with a 14. 1 T/ 26 cm horizontal bore magnet (Magnex), interfaced to an AVANCE III console (Bruker) and equipped with a 12 cm gradient set, capable of providing 100 G/cm with a rise time of 150 us (Resonance Research). A <b>transreceiver</b> surface coil with 10 mm diameter was used to acquire fMRI images. ChR 2 was expressed by AAV 5 virus in the barrel cortex with CaMKII promoter for optical stimulation. Fiber optic (400 um) was inserted into the deep layer cortex for optical stimulation. The optical pulse was modulated with frequency from 1 to 10 Hz. The pulse duration was tested from 1 ms to 50 ms. And the light power was set from 0. 05 mw, 0. 25 mw, 1 mw and 1. 8 mw, which will not lead to the heating-induced pseudo fMRI signal. The block design was set with light on for 5 s, 15 s and 30 s. Light-driven data were acquired from 2 rats. Local field potential was recorded by the ERS module from Biopac. Animal surgical procedures were described previously [3]. The light pulse was delivered through the 470 nm laser (2 Hz, 6 s duration, pulse duration= 45 ms, 15 epoch). AFNI software was used to perform the linear regression analysis to acquire functional maps. Results Fig 1 shows the fiber optic insertion into the deep layer cortex, where the ChR 2 was expressed by AAV viral vectors. The fiber optic trace was also visible in the brain slice by immunostaining. The light-driven fMRI signal was detected in the barrel cortex close to the fiber tips, where the time course from the activated cortical ROI was shown with different duration of optical stimulation (Fig 1 B). Fig 2. The time course of the light-driven fMRI response with different frequency, pulse duration and power level was represented.
