5|$|To {{reduce the}} optical effects workload, Ferren {{rejected}} bluescreen compositing, opting instead for rear projection. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would save time, {{and would make}} sense for elements such as the Enterprises bridge viewer, where compositing would lack <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> of a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a Mac II to create the animatics cut into the film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, {{as can be seen}} when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>softness</b> {{of copper}} partly {{explains}} its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E

5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. <b>The</b> <b>softness</b> of the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick {{is said to have}} been fired at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

40|$|Kinetically frozen {{micelles}} {{formed by}} the amphiphilic diblock copolymer poly(ethylene-alt-propylene) -poly(ethylene oxide) (PEP-PEO) are proposed as a new model system for soft colloids. In this context soft is used with a twofold meaning: <b>the</b> intraparticle <b>softness,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> molecular architecture of an individual micelle, as well as <b>the</b> interparticle <b>softness,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> effective potential for micellar interactions. Both contributions can be precisely adjusted from hard sphere-like to ultrasoft (star-like) by changing the diblock copolymer composition and/or interfacial tension, as shown by small angle neutron scattering in combination with contrast variation techniques. Depending on <b>the</b> degree of <b>softness,</b> PEP-PEO micellar solutions respond variably to the application of external shear fields. In particular, in the star-like regime solutions are already extremely sensitive at low shear rates. Therefore these micelles are an excellent starting point for a comprehensive study on <b>the</b> relation between <b>softness</b> and non-equilibrium phase behaviour in colloidal systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} {{relevance}} of several major material-dependent parameters to <b>the</b> magnetic <b>softness</b> in iron-base superconductors by first-principles electronic structure analysis of their parent compounds. The results are explained in the spin-fermion model where localized spins and orbitally degenerate itinerant electrons coexist and are coupled by Hund’s rule coupling. We found that {{the difference in the}} strength of the Hund’s rule coupling term is the major material-dependent microscopic parameter for determining the ground-state spin pattern. <b>The</b> magnetic <b>softness</b> in iron-based superconductors is essentially driven by the competition between the double-exchange ferromagnetism and the superexchange antiferromagnetism...|$|R
