50|$|Most DNAPLs remain denser {{than water}} {{after they are}} {{released}} into the environment (e.g. spilled <b>trichloroethene</b> does not become lighter than water, it will remain denser than water). However, when the DNAPL is a more complex mixture, {{the density of the}} mixture can change over time as the mixture interacts with the natural environment. As an example, a mixture of <b>trichloroethene</b> and cutting oil may be released and originally be denser than water—a DNAPL. As the mixture of <b>trichloroethene</b> and oil is leached by groundwater, the <b>trichloroethene</b> may preferentially leach out of the oil and the mixture may become less dense than water and become buoyant (e.g. the liquid may become an LNAPL). Similarly changes can be seen at some coal gasification plants or manufactured gas plants where the tar mixtures can be denser than water, be neutrally buoyant or be less dense then water and the densities can change with time.|$|E

50|$|Rittmann is the {{inventor}} of the Hydrogen-based Membrane Biofilm Reactor (MBfR), which can be used to reduce and detoxify a wide range of oxidized pollutants commonly found in water: e.g., nitrate, perchlorate, chromate, selenate, <b>trichloroethene,</b> and uraninite. In the MBfR, H2 gas is delivered directly to H2-oxidizing bacteria that live on the outer surface of a bubble-less gas-transfer membrane. The oxidized contaminants in the water moving past the biofilm are reduced to harmless or readily removed forms. Rittmann holds six patents on the MBfR, which is commercialized at the ARo (Autotrophic Reduction of) technology by APTwater. The MBfR won the 2011 Environmental Engineering Excellence Award from the American Academy of Environmental Engineers.|$|E
50|$|The {{remediation}} efforts {{began with}} the construction of a ground water and soil vapor extraction (SVE) treatment system. Between January 1997 through July 1998, approximately 7,000 pounds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), approximately 40 pounds of which were vinyl chloride, were extracted from the soil and groundwater. The SVE ceased operation in July 1998 due to concerns from nearby residents over exposure to fumes from the exhaust of the system. During the remediation process, additional contamination from methylene chloride, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA), and <b>trichloroethene</b> (TCE) were discovered. Detailed assessments taken during the emergency remediation effort revealed that the danger to the surrounding residences was not imminent but the site would pose long-term dangers.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of SVE, that is, the rate {{and degree of}} mass removal, depends {{on a number of}} factors that influence the transfer of contaminant mass into the gas phase. The {{effectiveness of}} SVE {{is a function of the}} contaminant properties (e.g., Henry’s Law constant, vapor pressure, boiling point, adsorption coefficient), temperature in the subsurface, vadose zone soil properties (e.g., soil grain size, soil moisture content, soil permeability, soil carbon content), subsurface heterogeneity, and the air flow driving force (applied pressure gradient). As an example, a residual quantity of a highly volatile contaminant (such as <b>trichloroethene)</b> in a homogeneous sand with high permeability and low carbon content (i.e., low/negligible adsorption) will be readily treated with SVE. In contrast, a heterogeneous vadose zone with one or more clay layers containing residual naphthalene would require a longer treatment time and/or SVE enhancements. SVE effectiveness issues include tailing and rebound, which result from contaminated zones with lower air flow (i.e., low permeability zones or zones of high moisture content) and/or lower volatility (or higher adsorption). Recent work at U.S. Department of Energy sites has investigated layering and low permeability zones in the subsurface and how they affect SVE operations.|$|E
50|$|It is {{intended}} that the SGVs replace the former ICRCL values. It {{should be noted}} that the CLEA SGVs relate to assessing chronic (long term) risks to human health and do not apply to the protection of ground workers during construction, or other potential receptors such as groundwater, buildings, plants or other ecosystems. The CLEA SGVs are not directly applicable to a site completely covered in hardstanding, as there is no direct exposure route to contaminated soils. To date, the first ten of fifty-five contaminant SGVs have been published, for the following: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, inorganic mercury, nickel, selenium ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene. Draft SGVs for benzene, naphthalene and xylene have been produced but their publication is on hold. Toxicological data (Tox) has been published for each of these contaminants as well as for benzoapyrene, benzene, dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs, naphthalene, vinyl chloride, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2 tetrachloroethane, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, tetrachloroethene, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, <b>trichloroethene</b> and xylene. The SGVs for ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene are dependent on the soil organic matter (SOM) content (which can be calculated from the total organic carbon (TOC) content). As an initial screen the SGVs for 1% SOM are considered to be appropriate.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the long-term, low-concentration elution tailing of organic contaminants from a naturally heterogeneous (poorly sorted) aquifer material, with a specific focus on characterizing the relative contributions of rate-limited sorption/desorption, physical-heterogeneity-related processes, and rate-limited dissolution of nonaqueous phase liquids. The results obtained for the first component of this three-part study indicate (1) sorption of <b>trichloroethene</b> by the aquifer material was relatively small; (2) sorption/desorption of <b>trichloroethene</b> was found to be nonlinear and rate-limited, contributing to low concentration elution tailing; (3) the overall dispersion associated with the poorly sorted aquifer material was relatively large, also contributing to the tailing observed for the contaminant; and most interestingly, (4) <b>trichloroethene</b> elution curves obtained after significant flushing in the higher-fines aquifer material exhibited greater tailing than those obtained with minimal flushing, suggesting temporal variability of the porous medium dispersive properties. These changes appear to associated with the fines fraction of the aquifer material, and are possibly related to chemical weathering effects. This condition-dependent elution behavior has potentially significant ramifications for evaluating the transport behavior of contaminants in porous media, especially with regard to characterizing the nature and rates of mass-transfer processes. In the second part, the relative contributions of core-scale structuring versus those of rate-limited sorption/desorption to the observed nonideal transport of <b>trichloroethene</b> were examined. The results of these experiments were analyzed using a mathematical model incorporating multiple sources of nonideal transport. The results indicate that both physical and chemical factors, specifically rate-limited diffusive mass transfer associated with nonuniform flow conditions and rate-limited sorption, respectively, contribute to the nonideal <b>trichloroethene</b> transport observed for the undisturbed cores. In the third part, the long-term, low concentration elution behavior associated with dissolution of immiscible-liquid phase <b>trichloroethene</b> was investigated. The complete dissolution of <b>trichloroethene</b> was successfully simulated using a combined, multi process mathematical model. A comparison of these results to those discussed above suggests the low concentration elution tailing observed in the dissolution experiment is associated with rate-limited sorption/desorption. This study clearly indicates that multiple sources of nonideal transport behavior must be considered to fully and accurately characterize contaminant transport in the subsurface...|$|E
40|$|Long-term elution tailing {{of organic}} contaminants, often {{observed}} when water or air {{is used to}} flush contaminated porous media, {{has been attributed to}} several factors. Characterization of this tailing behaviour through the quantitative analysis of multiple coupled factors is necessary to enhance our understanding of contaminant transport. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the transport and elution behaviour of <b>trichloroethene</b> in a naturally heterogeneous (poorly sorted) aquifer material, with a specific focus on characterizing and quantifying the relative contributions of rate-limited immiscible-liquid dissolution and nonlinear, rate-limited sorption/desorption to low-concentration elution tailing. A comparison of <b>trichloroethene</b> elution behaviour for systems with and without immiscible-liquid phase present suggests that the low-concentration elution tailing observed in the former experiments is associated primarily with nonlinear, rate-limited sorption/desorption. The transport and elution of <b>trichloroethene</b> was successfully simulated using a mathematical model that combines independent, coupled descriptions of rate-limited dissolution and nonlinear, rate-limited sorption/desorption. Specifically, immiscible-liquid dissolution was described using a first-order mass transfer approach with a temporally variable dissolution rate coefficient, and sorption/desorption was described using an approach incorporating a continuous distribution of rate-limited domains. The results of this study indicate that multiple processes contributed to <b>trichloroethene</b> elution behaviour when immiscible-liquid phase was present and that a multiprocess model was required to accurately simulate the measured data. ...|$|E

40|$|Linear chemometric {{algorithms}} {{were used}} to model the quantitative response of an evanescent fiber optic chemical sensor in aqueous mixtures with concentrations between 20 and 300 ppm. Four data sets were examined with two different experimental arrangements. Two data sets contained <b>trichloroethene,</b> 1, 1, 2 trichloroethane, and toluene. Partial Least Squares, PLS, and Principal Component Regression, PCR, algorithms performed comparably on these calibration sets with cross-validated root mean squared errors of prediction (RMSEP) for <b>trichloroethene,</b> 1, 1, 1 trichloroethane, and toluene of approximately 26, 29 and 22 ppm, respectively. The third data set contained <b>trichloroethene,</b> 1, 1, 2 trichloroethane, toluene, and chloroform and the fourth contained these four analytes as well as tetrachloroethene. Again, both chemometric algorithms performed comparably on a given data set with RMSEP for <b>trichloroethene,</b> 1, 1, 2 trichloroethane, toluene, and chloroform of approximately 6, 6, 9, and 16 ppm from the first set, and 7, 11, 13, and 31 ppm from the second set with tetrachloroethene RMSEP of 31 ppm. The decrease in the quantitative performance of the sensor for modeling toluene and chloroform upon addition of tetrachloroethene to the sample solutions is due to increased cladding absorption features in the spectral response matrix.

40|$|HFC- 134 a can be {{produced}} on an industrial scale from <b>trichloroethene.</b> The <b>trichloroethene</b> for this process is produced via the oxychlorination of 1, 2 -dichl~roethane over a supported copper catalyst. Unfortunately, this process currently exhibits relatively poor selectivity towards <b>trichloroethene</b> and results {{in the formation of}} toxic, oligomeric by-products. The current process also produces significant. quantities of CO 2 through combustion ofits chlorocarbon feedstock. In order to understand the ongms of the selectivity of the oxychlorination of 1, 2 dichloroethane, this study has examined the chlorination and oxychlorination of higher chlorocarbons via thermodynamic calculations, eql;lilibrium measurements, and a continuous flow micro-reactor {{in order to understand the}} delicate balance. between the. surface and gas-phase chemistry within the system. It was found that the presence of the catalyst is not necessary to affect the desired chemistry. However, it was found that the presence of the catalyst favoured the formation of pentachloroethane and tetrachloroethene, as well as supplying chlorine via the Deacon process (conversion ofHCl and oxygen to chlorine). Tetrachloroethene was found to be the thermodynamic minimum of the system, with <b>trichloroethene</b> an intermediate in the formation oftetrachloroethene. At low temperatures Ã‚Â« 473 K) and long reaction times (2 h, batch reactor), radical chlorination to form pentachloroethane was the dominant reaction. Increasing the reaction temperature to > 573 K and moving from a batch to continuous system resulted in the loss ofradical chlorination activity for the system, with radical dehydrochlorination to form <b>trichloroethene</b> becoming the dominant reaction. Heterogeneous chlorination was be performed under flow conditions, and was found to provide a route to pentachloroethane and tetrachloroethene from. High conversions were found favour the formation of oligomeric products, and results suggest that <b>trichloroethene</b> and tetrachloroethene may themselves be major sources ofoligomer formation. Oxychlorination reactions using the continuous flow micro-reactor have shown that, for this system, it is possible to explain the observed chemistry by a series of chlorination and dehydrochlorination processes alone, without the need to invoke additional surface processes. Results have shown that the selectivity of the reaction can be manipulated by parameter control, and that, on a laboratory scale at least; the system can be operated with minimal oligimer and CO 2 formation.
