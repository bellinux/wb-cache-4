25|$|In the United States, {{developers}} such as A. Alfred Taubman of Taubman Centers {{extended the}} concept further in 1980, with <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles</b> at the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, indoor fountains, and two levels allowing a shopper {{to make a}} circuit of all the stores. Taubman believed carpeting increased friction, slowing down customers, so it was removed. Fading daylight through glass panels was supplemented by gradually increased electric lighting, making it seem like the afternoon was lasting longer, which encouraged shoppers to linger.|$|E
25|$|The wide stairs {{leading from}} the subway land in the {{southern}} third of the building at a ticket hall and waiting area, which is open on both sides. A painted steel mid-rail runs the length of these stairs. Opposite the stair void the gaps between the piers are filled with screens made with a metal frame and grill panel bolted to the brick surrounds and resting on low brick walls. The internal faces of the piers are rendered and painted. The ticket windows are directly opposite the stair landing. Only the western one is currently in use, the other now hidden behind a freestanding automatic ticket machine. A number of timetable wall-boxes line the available wall space, one being an early timber example. One of the original chrome-plated ticket rails {{in front of the}} operating ticket window remains. The floor is lined with a chequered pattern of black and white <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles,</b> while the ceiling is made with fibrous cement sheeting. A stainless steel downpipe marks {{the top of the stairs}} and the endpoint of the middle handrail. There were four downpipes in the original design, one next to what had been the telephone box on the south-eastern facade, another between the office and store and another between the toilet and waiting area. How many still exist is unknown as three were enclosed in various walls along the centreline of the building and cannot be viewed. It is likely that some if not all remain.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{lobby is}} {{accessed}} from Fifth Avenue, on the building's east side, and contains an entrance with {{one set of}} double doors between a pair of revolving doors. At {{the top of each}} doorway is a bronze motif of three of the [...] "crafts or industries" [...] used in the building's construction—Electricity, Masonry, and Heating from north to south. The lobby contains two tiers of marble: a lighter marble on the top, above the storefronts, and a darker marble on the bottom, flush with the storefronts. There is a pattern of zigzagging <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles</b> on the lobby floor, which leads from the entrance on the east to the aluminum relief on the west. The chapel-like three-story-high lobby, which runs parallel to 33rd and 34th Streets, contains storefronts on both its northern and southern sides. These storefronts are framed by tubes of dark, [...] "modernistically rounded marble", and above the storefronts is a vertical band of grooves set into the marble. Immediately inside the lobby is an airport-style security checkpoint.|$|E
50|$|One {{building}} abuts the Valley National Bank Building. A three-story {{structure was}} erected in 1912, which became an annex upon its 1953 renovation and received further changes in 1960. The annex features concrete panels and <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tile.</b>|$|R
50|$|Greenwood Community Theatre officially {{began in}} 1954. Originally named the Greenwood Little Theater, the first {{production}} was Dear Ruth. GCT’s present home at 110 Main Street {{was built in}} 1934 as the State Theatre. The floor in the lobby is the original <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tile.</b>|$|R
50|$|After being {{closed for}} 18 months to remodel, the theatre re-opened in February 2007 for the {{production}} Anything Goes. Renovations preserved the original <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tile</b> floor in the lobby. Improvements included seating capacity for nearly 300, better access for wheelchairs, new riggings, curtains, {{the addition of a}} catwalk, and an upgraded sound and lighting system.|$|R
2500|$|The reconfigured {{platforms}} and new station building, platform awnings and subway at Graceville Railway Station, built between [...] and 1959, demonstrate the principal {{characteristics of a}} suburban railway station embodying Modernist post-World War Two architectural ideas. As part of what was a large suite of similar but individually-designed station structures, Graceville stands out as a significant example of the type, being the first constructed and described {{at the time as}} the most modern in Australia. The Graceville and Chelmer railway stations are the most aesthetically successful examples of the butterfly-roof typology adopted for station building and awning design at that time, utilising new materials and technologies to perform the tasks of sheltering passengers, selling tickets and outfitting rail staff. Through a high degree of intactness, the Graceville station complex maintains the integrity of its original design, and is greatly complemented by the standardised butterfly-roofed platform awnings, also largely intact, that accompany it. Significant elements include the platforms, station building, platform awnings, and subway, and fabric of particular note includes: <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles</b> to the waiting room and ticket hall floors, the painted steel balustrade to the stairs leading from the subway, the terrazzo windows sills and the early aluminium double-hung window sets, the tiles to the subway walls, the timber and concrete seating throughout, the cast iron drinking fountain adjacent to the northern facade of the building, and the lettering on the southern and western facades of the building.|$|E

50|$|In June 1994 a 26-month, $20 million {{renovation}} included new roofs, ceilings, <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tile</b> and carpeting, site work, painting, elevators, {{plumbing and}} HVAC, as well renovations to the gymnasium/swimming pool and industrial arts building. All renovations were completed to the eight buildings by 1996. Around 1996 “Senior” was dropped {{and the school}} is currently known as Bethel Park High School.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2008 the {{original}} [...] "Pavimento Pirelli" [...] black rubber flooring on the platforms {{was replaced with}} new biscuit-coloured <b>terrazzo</b> floor <b>tiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{floor in}} the capitol {{building}} is made of <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tile.</b> Common lore says the floor was laid by 66 Italian artists. To give these artists a chance to place a mark in the building (without allowing them to actually sign their names to the floor), each {{is said to have}} been given a blue stone to place in the floor. Only 55 of these tiles have been found, however. It is thought that the remaining stones may have been placed in locations now covered by walls, doors, or carpeting.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 the 1950s asphalt {{floor was}} {{replaced}} with new <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles,</b> incorporating original mosiac edging and new design features. After the work was finished a party {{was held in the}} Arcade, to celebrate the final part of £2m investment.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 the {{original}} [...] "Pavimento Pirelli" [...] black rubber floor tiles on the platforms were removed. They were replaced with new biscuit-coloured <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles,</b> with darker grey tiles nearest to the walls. The platform area overhead lighting was also replaced in late 2008.|$|E
50|$|Public spaces on {{the second}} and upper levels are reached by a masonry {{staircase}} {{at the rear of}} the building. Rooms throughout the second and upper floor levels floors and stairs have been finished in colourful <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles</b> with a checkered border detail and walls and ceiling have been finished with painted plaster. Internal doors and windows are clear-finished timber joinery. The ballroom space features a fibre-cement ceiling and wall-mounted, half-moon shaped uplight fittings.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{cessation}} of passenger service, the depot closed in 1971, at which point it was donated {{to the city of}} Wayzata. [...] The Wayzata Historical Society operates a museum in the building. The original waiting room benches rest on the original <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tile</b> floor. A freight agent's desk and freight scales reproduce the experience of checking passengers' luggage on the train. There is also a ticket window where an agent hands out souvenir tickets for destinations on the Empire Builder train. The office area features the stationmaster's desk and the operator's desk, along with various memorabilia.|$|R
5000|$|The work of David Ellis is {{regularly}} featured {{in design and}} architectural journals and has received a number of international and national design awards, such as his winning entry for the World Banks Malaysian Health Development Project Design Competition, awards from the American Architectural Woodwork Institute (LSSU Crawford Hall), the Association of Registered Interior Designers of Ontario (Floreani Clinic) and the Canadian <b>Terrazzo,</b> <b>Tile</b> and Marble Institute (John Rhodes Community Pool). Recognition of technical expertise is evidenced by his R&D Magazines [...] "Laboratory of the Year" [...] and two [...] "Ontario Global Traders Awards" [...] for his research and work abroad.|$|R
50|$|Structural {{system has}} vaults and marble columns. Main {{staircases}} are three-armed, stone or marble, while side staircases are spiral and iron. The interior walls are plastered and painted, while the representative rooms {{are decorated with}} wall paintings and marble imitation and have pilasters with gilded capitals and applied polychrome decorative female masks. The floors have parquet or <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles.</b> On the facades decoration was made of artificial stone, while the interior is in stucco and plaster.|$|E

50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{includes}} two retail shops {{with a central}} entrance tiled in beige terrazzo, with pink skirtings. While one shop front window has since been altered, the original design featured two steel-framed symmetrical curved glass showcases. <b>Terrazzo</b> <b>tiles</b> continue into the building, lining {{the walls of the}} entrance, lower staircase, and housing the glass showcases, tenants’ directory, and the original brass-cased fire alarm. Office spaces are situated above the first floor. The small width of the building meant that a continuous column-free vertical span could be achieved providing unobstructed space on each floor.|$|E

50|$|The building's architect, Emery Roth drew {{inspiration}} from the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. The Athenian monument was known to Roth from the reproduction that had featured in the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893. Roth also designed The Beresford and other landmark apartment houses and office blocks in New York. Construction began in 1923. The lobby, while completed with <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tile,</b> is of modest size, intended to maintain a residential feel and limit access to press and spectators. The construction process took approximately one year and when the building was completed in October 1924 it opened as a hotel, which it remained until the 1980s.|$|R

50|$|Internally, the {{two floors}} of the {{building}} are arranged around a central hall which continues northward from {{the position of the}} front door {{to the rear of the}} building. On the ground floor the front door provide access to a large porch area which incorporates the area of the tower element. The large proportion of window openings in the walls ensure that this porch area and a similar area on the first floor are naturally lit and ventilated. The flooring in the porch is of <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles</b> which have been formed into patterns reflecting the unusual planform of the spaces. French doors open onto the porches from internal rooms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{northern}} (front) {{elevation of}} the building, facing Russell Street, has a prominent, projecting, rendered front portico {{with a set of}} stairs leading to the entry, which has <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles</b> and timber framed French doors and a breezeway assembly with decorative glass. Double hung sash, timber framed windows are located along the front facade, including in the extensions of the western side of the property, and also along the eastern elevation, facing Neil Street. All the windows have a breezeway assembly with glass panels. A second entrance, with timber French doors, is located at the western end of the northern elevation, forming part of the later extensions. The rendered pediment is located right around the building and conceals the hipped roof clad with tiles. Raised lettering reading [...] "CLEARY AND LEE SOLICITORS" [...] is located {{along the top of the}} projecting portico and along the eastern elevation.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{buildings}} in the Cadet Area are set around a large, square pavilion known as The Terrazzo. The name {{comes from the fact}} that the walkways are made of <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tiles,</b> set among a checkerboard of marble strips. The east quarter of the Terrazzo, known as the [...] "Air Gardens," [...] is a 700 ft space with an ordered geometry of lighted pools, lowered grass sections and maze-like walkways. The Terrazzo area was designed by landscape architect Dan Kiley. The center of the Cadet Area was originally a wooded, sloping hill that extended from the middle of the Terrazzo south to the valley below, creating a blend of natural and man-made environments. With the building of Sijan Hall on the south side of the Terrazzo in 1968, the Terrazzo area was effectively enclosed into a large quadrangle, and this natural part of the landscape was eliminated. Only the top of the hill, now known as [...] "Spirit Hill", remains in the central grassy area of the Terrazzo.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Wexford opposed {{any major}} enhancements, but Lillian ignored his wishes {{and began a}} major {{restoration}} of the hotel in a Greco-Roman architectural style. Between 1917 and 1919, Italian artisans installed a mosaic <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tile</b> floor composed of two million one-inch squares of marble in the atrium. The atrium fireplace was refaced with glazed ceramic tiles from the Rookwood Pottery Company. Marble wainscotting {{was added to the}} atrium's ground level walls, while the brick support columns were wrapped with canvas and painted to resemble marble. Outside, an elaborate veranda was constructed. Wooden shelters at the springs were replaced with brick structures, and a sunken garden was created with a fountain featuring an angel.|$|R
25|$|The Caesarstone factory {{commenced}} {{its operations}} in 1987, at Kibbutz Sdot Yam, replacing its <b>terrazzo</b> <b>tile</b> factory. The company {{was established in}} the wake of development work performed jointly by members of the kibbutz and additional parties such as Professor Moshe Narkis of the Technion. After changing the focus from sale of floor tiles to quartz surfaces and establishing itself in the domestic market, the company started to export its products to different countries around the world. In 2005, an additional production facility was opened at the Bar-Lev Industrial Park. In 2006, TENE Investment Fund invested 25 million dollars in exchange for 21.7% control in the company, which led to the adding of another production line at the Bar-Lev facility.|$|R
50|$|The renovations {{lasted until}} 2013. In {{the spring of}} that year it was {{estimated}} that the renovations would be complete by December. In April, the TTC announced an opinion survey which gave riders three options, continue with the current schedule, speed up renovations by three months by closing the station over six consecutive weekends, or speed up renovations by closing the station for 12 consecutive days. The results were that out of 2,842 respondents, most preferred the third option. The TTC announced that the closure would happen between August 19-30. The closure was originally scheduled for June 15-26, but a strike by the <b>Terrazzo,</b> <b>Tile</b> and Marble Guild of Ontario made it necessary to postpone the closure until the labour dispute was resolved.|$|R
