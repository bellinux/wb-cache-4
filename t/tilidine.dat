40|$|<b>Tilidine,</b> {{alone or}} {{combined}} with naloxone to prevent drug abuse, {{is used as}} an oral opioid analgesic. Although the analgesic action of <b>tilidine</b> and its active metabolite nortilidine is reversed by naloxone and therefore believed to involve the activation of the Mu opioid (MOP, OP 3, mu) receptor, this has never been studied in recombinant systems. We have measured the selectivity of <b>tilidine</b> and nortilidine for human opioid and opioid-like receptors stably expressed in CHO-K 1 cells, using the inhibition of the forskolin (FK) -induced accumulation of cAMP as endpoint. In cells expressing the MOP receptor, <b>tilidine</b> and nortilidine inhibited cAMP accumulation with IC 50 of 11 microM and 110 nM, respectively. The agonist effects of nortilidine and [D-Ala 2 -MePhe 4 -Gly 5 -ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) on the MOP receptor were reversed by naloxone with very similar IC 50 (1. 2 versus 1. 8 nM). At concentrations up to 100 microM, <b>tilidine</b> and nortilidine had no agonist effect on the DOP, KOP and NOP receptors. In conclusion, this study on cloned human receptors demonstrates that nortilidine is a selective agonist of the MOP receptor. Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Segmental hair {{analysis}} {{has been used}} for monitoring changes of consumption habit of drugs. Contamination from the environment or sweat might cause interpretative problems.

The 24 -h hair samples already showed high concentrations of <b>tilidine</b> and nortilidine. Analysis of wash water from sample preparation confirmed external contamination by sweat as reason. The 30 -day hair samples were still positive for <b>tilidine</b> in all segments. Negative wash-water analysis proved incorporation from sweat into the hair matrix.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study whether a {{quadrupole}} time-of-flight (QToF) mass analyzer, coupled to an ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system, can be a valuable alternative for a triple-quadrupole (QqQ) mass analyzer, for quantitative toxicological purposes. The case study considered was the quantification of 16 opioids (6 -monoacetylmorphine, buprenorphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, norbuprenorphine, norcodeine, norfentanyl, oxycodone, oxymorphone, pholcodine and <b>tilidine)</b> in human plasma. Both methods were validated in parallel in terms of selectivity, matrix effects, extraction recovery, carry-over, bias, precision and sensitivity. Accuracy-profile methodology {{was used to determine}} the optimal calibration model, and to estimate bias, repeatability, intermediate precision and total error. Selectivity was demonstrated for all opioids and deuterated analogues, except for codeine-d 3 on the UHPLC-QTOF. For most compounds, extraction recoveries were in the range 60 to 80 % on both systems, except for the synthetic analogues, buprenorphine, fentanyl and <b>tilidine,</b> where large variability is observed. Carry-over was negligible on both systems. For different opioids, the optimal calibration model was different between the systems. The accuracy profiles {{of the majority of the}} opioids indicated that, over the entire tested concentration range, for more than 5 % of the future measurements, total errors are expected to exceed the a priori defined 15 % acceptance limit. For some exceptions, however, the measurements even suffer from total errors above 30 %, which can be attributed to the solid phase extraction procedure that was applied as sample pretreatment technique. Sensitivity was generally tenfold better on the LC-QToF system, probably due to the difference in ion choice for quantification between both systems. In conclusion, the best performing system seemed to depend on the compound, on the parameter and even on the concentration. Accuracy profiles clearly provided valuable information complementary to that obtained in classical validation tests, and therefore preferably are taken into account when deciding on a method's performance.

A better understanding of opioid analgesics combination therapy used for pain management could help warrant medication safety, efficacy, and economic relevance. Until now {{there has been no}} review summarizing the opioid analgesics-related pharmacokinetic drug interactions from the perspective of evidence based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Method: A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library, using a PRISMA flowchart. Results: Fifty-two RCTs were included for data interpretation. Forty-two RCTs (80. 8 %) were conducted in healthy volunteers, whereas 10 RCTs (19. 2 %) enrolled true patients. None of the opioid–drug/herb pairs was listed as contraindications of opioids involved in this review. Circumstances in which opioid is comedicated as a precipitant drug include morphine–P 2 Y 12 inhibitors, morphine–gabapentin, and methadone–zidovudine. Circumstances in which opioid is comedicated as an object drug include rifampin–opioids (morphine, tramadol, oxycodone, methadone), quinidine–opioids (morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, codeine, dihydrocodeine, methadone), antimycotics–opioids (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, methadone, <b>tilidine,</b> tramadol), protease inhibitors–opioids (ritonavir, ritonavir/lopinavir–oxycodone, ritonavir–fentanyl, ritonavir–tilidine), grapefruit juice–opioids (oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone), antidepressants–opioids (paroxetine–tramadol, paroxetine–hydrocodone, paroxetine–oxycodone, escitalopram–tramadol), metoclopramide–morphine, amantadine–morphine, sumatriptan–butorphanol nasal sprays, ticlopidine–tramadol, St John’s wort–oxycodone, macrolides/ketolides–oxycodone, and levomepromazine–codeine. RCTs investigating the same combination, almost unanimously, drew consistent conclusions, except two RCTs on amantadine–intravenous morphine combination where a different amantadine dose was used and two RCTs on morphine–ticagrelor combination where healthy volunteers and true patients were enrolled, respectively. RCTs investigating in true patients may reflect a realistic clinical scenario and overcome the limitation of RCTs performed in healthy volunteers under standardized conditions. Further research opportunities are also presented in this review. Conclusion: Effective and safe combination therapy of opioids can be achieved by promoting the awareness of potential changes in therapeutic efficacy and toxicities, prescribing alternatives or changing administration strategy, tailoring dose, reviewing the appropriateness of orders, and paying attention to medication monitoring.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} work {{describes the}} development, validation {{and application of}} highly sensitive UFLC-MS/MS methods for the bio-analysis of narcotic analgesics. In chapter I, the narcotic analgesics and the LC-MS technique were introduced. The narcotic analgesics are widely used {{for the treatment of}} pain, making them important in the clinical world. Due to their morphine-like effects, these substances are commonly abused which illustrates the forensic context. Analysis of narcotic analgesics and metabolites allowing accurate quantification is thus clearly required for both clinical and forensic investigations. LC-MS is an excellent technique for the analysis of target analytes in complex mixtures such as biological matrices. Recent developments (such as the use of columns with small particles or UPLC or UFLC technology) increase the sensitivity and selectivity of LC-MS even more. The greatest disadvantage of LC-MS, the disturbing effect of co-eluting molecules on ionization of the target analyte was discussed, toghether with strategies to evaluate and overcome these so called matrix effects. In chapter II, several factors (sample preparation, ionization interface, mobile phase and LC column) were optimized in order to obtain highest sensitivity for the detection of fentanyl and its major metabolite norfentanyl. As such, disturbing matrix effects can be minimized while recovery and sensitivity can be maximized. After optimization, the method was fully validated for both urine and whole blood. To the best of our knowledge, the UFLC-MS/MS method presented here is the most sensitive method available for analysis of fentanyl and norfentanyl in urine and blood. Several factors contributed to high sensitivity: (1) appropriate sample preparation: the use of mixed-mode SPE and an extra alkaline wash step in the SPE protocol removed interferences and concentrated the analytes; (2) optimal ionization interface: the use of ESI instead of APCI proved to be more effective for both fentanyl and norfentanyl; (3) optimized chromatography including (a) the use of a mobile phase at high pH instead of the conventional low pH which resulted in a higher signal and (b) the use of columns with small particle size (1. 7 µm versus 2. 5 µm) and small internal diameter (2. 1 mm versus 3. 0 mm) which resulted in smaller and sharper peaks and thus enhanced sensitivity. In chapter III, we extended the method development strategy used in chapter II to other relevant narcotic analgesics. As a result a highly sensitive UFLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the analysis of nine narcotic analgesics and metabolites (buprenorphine, O-desmethyltramadol, fentanyl, norbuprenorphine, norfentanyl, pethidine, piritramide, <b>tilidine</b> and tramadol) in urine and blood. As in chapter II, the alkaline wash step in the SPE protocol, ESI as ionization interface, the mobile phase at high pH and the column with smaller internal diameter and particle size were found to be crucial parameters warranting the high sensitivity of the method. It can be surmised that the optimized parameters (sample preparation, mobile phase, ionization interface and column) should be considered to increase sensitivity of LC-MS methods for other compounds than the opioids studied here. In chapter IV, the applicability of the developed and validated UFLC-MS/MS methods was demonstrated by analysis of thirteen post-mortem forensic cases involving the use of narcotic analgesics. Urine, blood, liver, bile and/or hair were succesfully analyzed and the found results were carefully interpreted. In nine cases, we could conclude that the death of the victim was (partly) caused by the use of narcotic analgesics. It is clear that the presented UFLC-MS/MS methods are useful in forensic research. Moreover, their use can be extended to clinical investigations. status: publishe...|$|E
