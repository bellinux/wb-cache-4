The regulator pressure must take into account the hydrostatic pressure difference between {{the top and bottom of}} the bag so that the bag will be completely filled.|$|E

5000|$|In {{high-pressure}} gas systems, it {{is recommended}} that the outlet of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is in the open air. In systems where the outlet is connected to piping, the opening of a relief valve will give a pressure build up in the piping system downstream of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> This often means that <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> will not re-seat once the set pressure is reached. For these systems often so called [...] "differential" [...] relief valves are used. This means that the pressure is only working on an area that is much smaller than the openings area of the valve. If the valve is opened the pressure has to decrease enormously before the valve closes and also the outlet pressure of the valve can easily keep the valve open. Another consideration is that if other relief valves are connected to the outlet pipe system, they may open as the pressure in exhaust pipe system increases. This may cause undesired operation.|$|E

At 4:15am, <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> diaphragm of <b>the</b> pressurizer <b>relief</b> tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building.

50|$|For liquid-packed vessels, {{thermal relief}} valves are {{generally}} {{characterized by the}} relatively small size of the valve necessary to provide protection from excess pressure caused by thermal expansion.

25|$|The {{design of}} <b>the</b> {{pilot-operated}} <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply {{connected in parallel}} with the valve solenoid, thus implying that <b>the</b> pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and <b>the</b> main <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> stuck open, <b>the</b> unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving {{as they would have}} if <b>the</b> pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.|$|R
