The reflected signal is correlated with the incident signal to identify the locations of these discontinuities. In the case of SSTDV, the correlation is accomplished by adding one bit to the PN code each cycle, thus creating a vernier sequence that can be used to resolve the time delay between incident and reflected signals.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Prestress loss {{adversely}} {{affects the}} behavior of in-service post-tensioned struc-tures in terms of deflection/camber, cracking, and ultimate capacity. It is thus important to determine the level of prestressing force at various loading stages from the initial prestressing force transfer to the structure, through different in-service loads, to the ultimate load of the structure. Prestress loss is difficult to evaluate due to several intertwined factors such as creep, shrinkage, relaxation, geometric configuration, distributed friction, and slippage of post-tensioned strands. Till date, there is no cost-effective and reliable sensor and installation technique for the long-term monitoring and evaluation of prestress loss. In this study, a smart fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) rebar with an embedded novel optical fiber (OF) is developed for the distributed strain of post-tensioned strands. The new OF is an integrated global and local monitoring technology developed by combining the Brillouin optical <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> ana-lysis/refectory sensor and the optical fiber Bragg grating into one single fiber. The FRP rebar and six steel wires were bundled {{together to form a}} seven-wire steel strand for the post-tensioning and monitoring of concrete structures. The performances of the smart rebar and strand were validated with static tests of a prestressed steel frame structure and a post-tensioned concrete beam. The smart steel strand can accurately measure the prestress loss at each loading stage, which agrees well with that measured by a pressure loading cell and predicted by a design code.

Without detailed information as to where the short might occur, attempting destructive decapsualtion to expose both die surface and bond wires is full of risk.

40|$|Water {{content is}} a key {{parameter}} to monitor in nuclear waste repositories such as the planed underground repository in Bure, France, in the Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) clay formation. High-frequency electromagnetic (HF-EM) measurement techniques, i. e., <b>time</b> or frequency <b>domain</b> <b>reflectometry,</b> offer useful tools for quantitative estimation of water content in porous media. However, despite the efficiency of HF-EM methods, the relationship between water content and dielectric material properties needs to be characterized. Moreover, the high amount of swelling clay in the COx clay leads to dielectric relaxation effects which induce strong dispersion coupled with high absorption of EM waves. Against this background, the dielectric relaxation behavior of the clay rock was studied at frequencies from 1 MHz to 10 GHz with network analyzer technique in combination with coaxial transmission line cells. For this purpose, undisturbed and disturbed clay rock samples were conditioned to achieve a water saturation range from 0. 16 to nearly saturation. The relaxation behavior was quantified based on a generalized fractional relaxation model under consideration of an apparent direct current conductivity assuming three relaxation processes: a high-frequency water process and two interface processes which are related to interactions between the aqueous pore solution and mineral particles (adsorbed/hydrated water relaxation, counter ion relaxation and Maxwell-Wagner effects). The frequency-dependent HF-EM properties were further modeled based on a novel hydraulic-mechanical-electromagnetic coupling approach developed for soils. The results show the potential of HF-EM techniques for quantitative monitoring of the hydraulic state in underground repositories in clay formations.

50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>domain</b> <b>reflectometry</b> {{has also}} been {{utilized}} to monitor slope movement {{in a variety of}} geotechnical settings including highway cuts, rail beds, and open pit mines (Dowding & O'Connor, 1984, 2000a, 2000b; Kane & Beck, 1999). In stability monitoring applications using TDR, a coaxial cable is installed in a vertical borehole passing through the region of concern. The electrical impedance at any point along a coaxial cable changes with deformation of the insulator between the conductors. A brittle grout surrounds the cable to translate earth movement into an abrupt cable deformation that shows up as a detectable peak in the reflectance trace. Until recently, the technique was relatively insensitive to small slope movements and could not be automated because it relied on human detection of changes in the reflectance trace over time. Farrington and Sargand (2004) developed a simple signal processing technique using numerical derivatives to extract reliable indications of slope movement from the TDR data much earlier than by conventional interpretation.|$|E

The 7S11 would work in combination with the 7T11 ($4,460 in 1983) or 7T11A sampling sweep units as a time base. The 7T11 could trigger on a 1 GHz signal or it could synchronize to a 1 GHz to 12.4 GHz input.
