40|$|A large {{majority}} of states have enacted recidivist statutes requiring increased punishment for repeat offenders. California 2 ̆ 7 s controversial recidivist statute, the <b>Three</b> <b>Strikes</b> <b>and</b> <b>You</b> 2 ̆ 7 re Out Law (the Three Strikes Law), was approved by ballot initiative and enacted by the state legislature in 1994. Defendants have challenged the constitutionality of sentences under habitual offender statutes for at least twenty years. In Harmelin v. Helm, the United States Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of a life sentence {{without the possibility of}} parole for a first time drug offender convicted of possession of 650 grams of cocaine. Justice Kennedy 2 ̆ 7 s concurrence in Harmelin set forth a three-part gross proportionality analysis to be applied to sentences imposed upon non-violent recidivists challenged under the Eighth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s clause prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. In Andrade v. Attorney General,s the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied Justice Kennedy 2 ̆ 7 s Harmelin analysis to a life sentence without the possibility of parole for fifty years, imposed under the Three Strikes Law on a non-violent recidivist who stole nine videotapes worth under 200 on two separate occasions...|$|E

40|$|We watch enthralled as {{television}} news programs sensationalize {{some of the}} saddest moments of our reality. We are shocked by the violence and brutality of those who prey on the innocent and vulnerable. We become both enraged and frightened as we {{realize that there are}} people among us who have no regard for human life. In the wake of tragedy, we furiously search for answers, we seek ways to avoid suffering the same pain in the future and, often, we sacrifice the rights of many, believing that such a sacrifice is necessary and justified. A prime example of this reaction is California 2 ̆ 7 s anti-recidivist legislation known colloquially as 2 ̆ 2 <b>three</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> 2 ̆ 7 re out. 2 ̆ 2 This comment tracks an occurrence of this vicious cycle in California. Part I explains how the fear of crime as well as frustration with repeat offenders and the revolving door {{of the criminal justice system}} rose to an all-time high and contributed to the development of California 2 ̆ 7 s Three Strikes Law. This section also explores how the California Supreme Court has interpreted and attempted to refine the Three Strikes 2 ̆ 7 Law and specifically how the Court addressed the issue of judicial discretion in sentencing under the Three Strikes Law. Additionally, this section addresses the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of what type of sentence violates a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional rights. Part II describes how California 2 ̆ 7 s lower courts have refused to employ judicial discretion. Part III shows why the application of the law, even with court-attempted refinement, is constitutionally flawed and may also be ineffective as a measure to prevent violent crime. Part IV explores the latest rulings from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal regarding the constitutionality of California 2 ̆ 7 s Three Strikes Law. This Part also suggests a solution to balance the citizens 2 ̆ 7 desire for a workable recidivist statute with the need to keep criminal punishment in California both fair and constitutional...|$|E

The Court accordingly infers that ex-offenders and suspected offenders would encounter obstacles in {{their attempt to}} receive and maintain housing leases, both public and private. Part II discusses the 2 ̆ 2 One <b>Strike</b> <b>and</b> <b>You</b> 2 ̆ 7 re Out 2 ̆ 2 housing act and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Rucker. The Court upheld the federally mandated public housing strict liability clause in part because the tenant would be treated the same in a private lease. This Comment thus explores the development of both private landlord-tenant law and public housing law. Part III examines a landlord 2 ̆ 7 s procedures for tenant selection in private housing leases. Part III compares the legal boundaries in private tenant selection with the Congressional mandates for tenant screening in public housing leases. Part III also displays legal safeguards for the ex-offender who believes she has been denied private housing based on her past. Part IV discusses the grounds, relating to criminality, upon which a private landlord may evict a tenant. Part IV compares judicial interpretations of state statutes regulating private leases providing for strict liability evictions of tenants for criminal acts of guests or third parties, similar to the 2 ̆ 2 One <b>Strike</b> <b>and</b> <b>You</b> 2 ̆ 7 re Out 2 ̆ 2 policy in public housing.
