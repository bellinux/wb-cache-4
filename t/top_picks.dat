Prior to the implementation of the NBA Draft Lottery in 1985, the teams with the two worst records from the previous season would engage in a coin flip to determine which team would receive the <b>top</b> <b>pick.</b> Therefore, when Cleveland finished with the worst record in 1981-82, the Lakers took their place in the coin flip, and won out over the San Diego Clippers to earn the <b>top</b> <b>pick.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Lakers {{earned the}} <b>top</b> <b>pick</b> of the 1982 NBA draft, {{becoming}} the only defending champion {{to earn the}} <b>top</b> overall <b>pick</b> in the same season.

The Phoenix Mercury, despite having the best record of the six teams involved and thus the worst mathematical chance of winning, drew the <b>top</b> <b>pick.</b> It was the first time since the institution of the lottery for the 2002 Draft that the <b>top</b> <b>pick</b> was earned by the team with the worst mathematical chance of winning.
