5000|$|The {{replacement}} lighthouse {{now known}} as [...] "Old Baldy" [...] was completed by 1817. [...] Old Baldy was built further inland where {{it would not be}} threatened by shifting sands along the river for just under $16,000 using bricks salvaged from the old tower. A stone plaque above the entrance identifies the builder as Daniel S. Way, and the foundry for the lantern room, that was also salvaged from the old tower, as R. Cochran. The octagonal brick tower is coated with stucco and stands 110 ft high, the exterior was originally whitewashed or painted white. At its base, the tower is 36 ft wide and at its top 14.25 ft wide, while the walls are 5 ft thick at the base and taper to 2.5 ft at the top. The rectangular stairway leading up the inside of the tower is made of Carolina yellow pine. The lantern room sits on top of one of the <b>tower</b> <b>support</b> beams which makes it offset {{from the center of the}} tower. Old Baldy was originally equipped with an array of 15 lamps and reflectors, and as technology improved, it later housed a Fresnel lens.|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{design of}} support {{structure}} including foundation and turbine tower {{is among the}} most critical challenges for offshore wind turbine. With development of offshore wind industry heading for deeper ocean areas, new support structural concept such as a full lattice tower could be proven to be more advantageous than others when consideration of cost, safety and even environment aspects, etc are taken into. This thesis first gave introduction of present industrial applications of hybrid support structural concept combing a lattice foundation and monotower in relatively deep water areas before the presenting and introduction of challenges with the transition piece component. Conceptual model of transition piece design for a full lattice <b>tower</b> <b>support</b> structure proposal was discussed extensively which included consideration of structural form, functional requirement, mechanical condition, etc. A mechanical model of transition piece with regards to boundary condition and load conditions was also provided. Design and analysis of two different types of transition piece models under various load conditions were performed during preliminary design and with conclusion drawn, a refined final design of transition piece model for the full lattice <b>tower</b> <b>support</b> structural concept which has also included more practical aspects was assessed through investigation of its performance under varying load conditions and different load cases. This refined final design was found to be the most optimal design fulfilling all relevant requirements at a comparable structural cost. Conclusion and recommendation was therefore given in the last part. This thesis work is serving for a novel proposal of support structural concept for future offshore wind industry and relevant present experience is in fact nonexistent. The work applied present industrial information of hybrid support structure as basis along with consideration of offshore wind turbine structural and operational mechanism and their respective requirement. Structural analysis of transition piece design was conducted by means of finite element analysis technique and structural load conditions were simulated through up-to-date numerical modeling code for offshore wind turbine structure. Due to absence of relevant verification sources, advice and correction of the thesis content is much appreciated. </p...|$|E

40|$|An initial {{analysis}} was performed for areas suitable for offshore wind farm development near the California coast. Based on the analysis, California's offshore wind resource was divided up into three areas; Northern California, San Francisco Bay Area, and Southern California.

Acceptable depths for offshore wind farms were broken up into three categories, based on current and future wind turbine <b>tower</b> <b>support</b> technology; <= 20 meters depth for monopile towers, <= 50 meters for water jacket tripods/quadrapods, and < = 200 meters depth for deep water floating tower technology {{which is likely to}} be developed in the next 15 years.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact on}} {{cylindrical}} piles of extreme waves (freak waves), generated by directional wave focusing. Waves are numerically modeled based on a boundary element discretization of fully nonlinear potential flow equations with free surface evolution. Higher-order boundary elements are used for the spatial discretization, and a higher-order time integration scheme based on the Taylor series expansion is applied. We model the pressure impact of a freak wave on a cylindrical offshore support structure, as the slamming process of a wave front around a circular cross-section, by a finite volume – volume of fluid approach. Results are analyzed in detail and compared to an analytic solution and to experimental results. Finally, the full loading on a cylindrical tower structure, due to a freak wave, is determined.

As a result, the numerical results displayed good agreement with the test data. Moreover, the additional mooring chains could play an active role in reducing the surge displacement, surge acceleration and typical tension leg force responses of the FOWT system, which is very beneficial for ensuring the good operational performance and the safety of the FOWT system...|$|E

A {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} always has some form <b>tower</b> <b>support</b> structure, either lattice or tubular structure. Smaller machines tend to be supported on lattice structure whereas larger once use cylindrical tubes, made of either steel or concrete. Both the type of structure offers resistance to the flow causing velocity and pressure fluctuations in the near vicinity of tower and this fluctuation is pronounced to certain region called wake region. The pressure and velocity deficit, unsteady vortex shedding causes 3 p fluctuation or flicker effect and deteriorate power quality in connected power networks. Moreover, this causes a fatigue loading on the blades. Thus an attempt is made {{to minimize the}} turbine blade interaction with the wake region.

40|$|The vast {{deepwater}} wind resource {{represents a}} potential to use offshore floating wind turbines to power {{much of the}} world with renewable energy. Many floating wind turbine concepts have been proposed, but dynamics models, which account for the wind inflow, aerodynamics, elasticity and controls of the wind turbine, along with the incident waves, sea current, hydrodynamics, and platform and mooring dynamics of the floater, were needed to determine their technical and economic feasibility. This work presents the devel-opment of a comprehensive simulation tool for modelling the coupled dynamic response of offshore floating wind turbines and the verification of the simulation tool through model-to-model comparisons. The fully coupled time-domain aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation tool was developed with enough sophistication to address limitations of previ-ous studies and has features required to perform loads analyses for a variety of rotor-nacelle assembly, <b>tower,</b> <b>support</b> platform and mooring system configurations. The developed hydrodynamics module accounts for linear hydrostatic restoring; non-linear viscous drag; the added-mass and damping contributions from linear wave radiation, including free-surface memory effects; and the incident-wave excitation from linear diffrac-tion in regular or irregular seas. The developed mooring line module is quasi-static and accounts for the elastic stretching of an array of homogenous taut or slack catenary lines with seabed interaction.

40|$|Today, {{design of}} wind energy support {{structures}} is {{to a large}} extent a manual process. It requires a lot of experience, and the design tools are often based on simplified methods. As larger structures are being developed and installations move to larger water-depths, the need for efficient and accurate design tools increases. Simulation-based design is a promising technique that can help automate this process. In this study, Spall’s simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) method was implemented to automatically optimize thickness and diameter of the members in offshore lattice <b>tower</b> <b>support</b> structures. The method utilizes a pseudo-gradient based on only two function evaluations per iteration, which allows for a computationally efficient process. Each evaluation of the design consists of time-domain simulations of the complete wind turbine in FEDEM Windpower, subsequent rainflow counting and calculation of joint lifetimes with stress concentration factors. The utilization of both ultimate and fatigue limit states is reported for each joint. Tower weight was chosen as an indicator of cost, and an objective function comprising variables for weight and joint lifetimes was defined. Joint lifetime was ignored whenever its value was above the design lifetime of the tower, allowing the algorithm to search solely for the lightest design, as long as the design lifetime constraint was sustained. The method has shown promising results, and is able to successfully find viable designs, even when starting from highly unacceptable starting points. Some of the major challenges when using SPSA for lattice support structures are to find a good objective function, as well as appropriate values for the parameters controlling perturbation and step size. Existing guidelines were followed when doing this calibration, but for an efficient search the parameters had to be adapted. Results for both appropriate parameters and the optimization itself are reported for the 10 MW NOWITECH reference turbine on a full-height lattice tower. These results show that superior results can be achieved, but at a high cost in terms of computational time. Recommendation is given to use alternative methods {{to come up with a}} partially optimized staring point, from which the SPSA method can optimize further. </p...|$|E

40|$|A renewed {{commitment}} in the United States and abroad to electricity from renewable resources, such as wind, {{along with the}} recent deployment of very large turbines that rise to new heights, makes obtaining the most efficient and safe designs of the structures that support them ever more important. Towards this goal, the present research seeks to understand how optimization concepts and Microsoft Excel 2 ̆ 7 s optimization capabilities {{can be used in}} the design of wind turbine towers and foundations. Additionally, this research expands on the work of previous researchers to study how considering the tower and foundation as an integral system, where <b>tower</b> <b>support</b> conditions are not perfectly rigid, affects the optimal design. Specifically, optimization problems are formulated and solved with and without taking into account the effect of deflections, resulting from the foundation 2 ̆ 7 s rotational and horizontal stiffness, on natural frequency calculations. The general methodology used to transcribe the design of wind turbine towers and foundations into an optimization problem includes: 1) collecting information on design requirements and parameter values 2) deciding how to analyze the structure 3) formulating the optimization problem 4) implementation using Microsoft Excel. Key assumptions include: 1) use of an equivalent lumped mass method for estimating natural frequency 2) International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400 - 1 extreme loading condition controls design (i. e. fatigue loading condition is not considered) 3) extreme loads are obtained from manufacturer provided structural load document that satisfies loading cases outlined in IEC 61400 - 1 4) wind forces on the tower are calculated in accordance with IEC 61400 - 1 5) optimization variables are continuous. The sum of the tower material and fabrication cost and the total foundation cost is taken as the objective function. Important conclusions from this work include: 1) optimization concepts and Microsoft Excel 2 ̆ 7 s optimization capabilities can be used to obtain reasonable conceptual level designs and cost estimates 2) detailed designs and cost estimates could be achieved using a solver capable of handling discrete optimization problems 3) considering the tower and foundation as an integral system results in a more expensive, but safer, design 4) for the assumed parameter values, the constraint on the tower 2 ̆ 7 s natural frequency was found to control the tower design and the bearing capacity constraint was found to control the foundation design 5) relaxing or tightening the limit on the natural frequency will result in the greatest benefit or penalty, respectively, on the optimum solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{tower of}} the Franciscan monastery in Bratislava was {{completely}} restored {{in the last decade}} of the 19 th century under the supervision of Frigyes Schulek. It was first disassembled and then reconstructed. A garden pavilion was built in the Aupark (today Janko Kráľ Park) using the old stones. But there is an important difference between the {{tower of the}} monastery and the pavilion: while the aforementioned has a pointed, pyramid-like spire, the latter’s termination is curved and dome-shaped. As discussed in this article, over the decades it became widely accepted that the dome-shape is the original, mediaeval form, and the pyramidal spire is modern. The 19 th-century reconstruction has also been referred to as a bad example in the (Czecho) slovak and Hungarian secondary literature. Especially the Hungarian literature formulated a very bad opinion in the second part of the 20 th century about the reconstruction, mainly because of the “correction” of the dome-form. This article also discusses the events of the reconstruction, focusing mainly on the actual dismantling and construction works, relying on the files, drawings, and photos of the Commission for Historic Monuments (Műemlékek Országos Bizottsága, MOB), which can be found in the collections of the Gyula Forster National Centre for Cultural Heritage Management (Budapest). As a result, Schulek’s contemporary “report with expertise”, the archive photos, and the survey drawings all make it clear that the original spire was pyramid-shaped. None of them mentions the dome-shape and its “correction”. Schulek did not plan any new design; he let the superintendent László Gyalus build a more or less accurate copy of the old tower instead. However, the comparison of the archive photos, the reconstruction plans, and the existing tower shows several differences, as it is discussed in detail in this article with the conclusion that the theoretically identical three structures (the dismantled tower, the reconstructed tower, the garden pavilion) are in fact three different ones. The most important conceptual difference between the dismantled and the reconstructed tower can be observed on the spire. All the archive photos and the authors who have seen the original <b>tower</b> <b>support</b> the statement that the tower used to have an openwork spire earlier. This fact has great significance for the history of arts: this is the only known openwork Gothic spire on the territory of the one-time Hungarian Kingdom. The question of the origin of the dome shape still exists. The site survey of the garden pavilion brought the result that the stones in it are not in the same arrangement as they were before in the tower, so the dismantling could have happened without the intention of the stones' later use. It is likely that for the construction of the garden pavilion an unsorted mass of stones had to be used. Among the original stones, the ones in the spire could have been the most damaged. All in all, the most plausible explanation for the dome shape could be that Gyalus probably wanted to create a stylish termination for the pavilion at low cost, and the curved form is a plausible solution. The reconstruction of the Franciscan tower indicates a changing of principles in monument preservation: it is a more or less accurate copy of the unsustainable original. All in all, the reconstruction can be considered as a good example of its age, in spite of all the differences discussed in this article, mainly because of the preservation of the old stones...|$|E
