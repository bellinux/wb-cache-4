500|$|Unlike Music, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï {{also as a}} {{songwriter}} on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained {{that there are some}} influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people, and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept [...] "might sound simple at first, even rough. But when you pay attention, {{there is a lot of}} technology underneath". This approach was an imperative for American Life. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï's own gear along with the studio's SSL mixing consoles, the album's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they [...] "tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent. You have to be very minimalist and choose every sound very carefully. Some tracks were composed in the big studio; <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> dangerous because you can lose perspective. But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio." ...|$|E

2500|$|The early Washington wine {{industry}} focused predominately on white wines {{but in recent}} years, led by the [...] "Merlot-craze" [...] of the 1990s have shifted the focus to the state's red wines. Chardonnay also experienced a surge {{of interest in the}} 1990s and along with Riesling are among the most widely planted grape varieties in the state. While the acreage of Riesling has been steadily declining, there has been renewed interest in the grape in recent years that has been bolstered by the joint Eroica venture between Chateau Ste Michelle and German winemaker Ernst Loosen and the investment by Bonny Doon founder's Randall Grahm to open a winery focused solely on Riesling production. Experts like Jancis Robinson have noted that Washington state consistently produces white wines of exceptional quality, specifically mentioning those of the Semillon variety. Merlot {{was one of the first}} major vinifera varieties to garner international attention for the state with its distinctive earthiness and structure <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different from the softer, plusher styles found in California. However the Merlot vine is very sensitive to frost and after significant damages during major winter freezes in 1996 & 2003, more vintners turned their attention to the hardier Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. This led to interest in Bordeaux-style blends. In the early 21st century, Syrah has emerged on the scene as a major player.|$|E
