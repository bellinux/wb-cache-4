It's been {{a little}} frustrating {{in the past for}} us to hear people say, 'Oh yeah, the Insomniac game is running on the Naughty Dog engine.' People assumed that we were using Naughty Dog's engine for Ratchet, and that was not true. We shared some technology with Naughty Dog way back when, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>great,</b> but we are a company that puts stock in developing specialized technology {{and we will continue to}} do so."

500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E
500|$|In their {{review for}} Dragon magazine, the Lessers called Axe of Rage [...] "an engrossing slash 'n hack that'll please most arcaders." [...] Zzap!64s reviewers were {{unanimous}} in recommending Barbarian II to their readers; however, {{two years later}} in a re-review, the magazine's staff said the game has aged badly, finding the gameplay [...] "lot more crude and clichéd" [...] and of dubious replay value. [...] Martyn Carroll concurred in his article for Retro Gamer, 17years after the game's release, calling Barbarian II [...] "hugely disappointing" [...] for [...] " [...] up almost everything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> about the first game." [...] Brown and Palace Software's co-founder Richard Leinfellner admitted as much; {{they said they had}} mixed feelings about Barbarian II, thinking the idea of a simple fun game was lost by stuffing too many features into it.|$|E

500|$|Computer and Video Games called Phantom Hourglass {{one of the}} few [...] "masterpieces" [...] on the Nintendo DS, {{which made}} it [...] "worth every penny". Believing that Phantom Hourglass {{improves}} on everything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> about its predecessor, The Wind Waker, GamePro predicted that the sequel would be another successful game in the franchise. Although feeling that the game does not live up to the standards set in , Game Informer still felt that the adventure is worthy of The Legend of Zelda series, and noted that it [...] "has enough great stuff going for it" [...] for them to consider it one of the year's best video game adventures. GameZone enjoyed the [...] "spectacular blend of touch-screen combat, brilliant puzzles, and Wind Waker beauty" [...] in Phantom Hourglass, calling it a [...] "can't-miss adventure" [...] and one of Nintendo's and the year's best games. Hypers Jonti Davies commended Phantom Hourglass for its [...] "perfect controls and supreme world and dungeon designs". However, he criticized the game for only giving around 30 hours of gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Reception for {{the song}} was mostly positive. Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times said that the song {{was the one that}} [...] "showed her {{impressive}} range to best advantage." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer said that she had a [...] "strong voice" [...] in the song. However, another Philadelphia Inquirer review said that the song was [...] "a not terribly good version of Jules Shear's terribly good [...]" [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post believed that it was her most reflective song. Kevin East of Sensible Sound said that the song was [...] "a heavy, melancholy tune." [...] Leslie Gray Streeter of the Palm Beach Post said that the song was [...] "lovely" [...] and [...] "delicate." [...] Even Shear himself was a fan of Lauper's version, saying [...] "The Cyndi Lauper thing where she did 'All Through the Night,' <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> because she did it so differently than the way I did. I liked that, too." [...] However, the St. Petersburg Times did not like the song, saying that it was a [...] "pedestrian filler number" [...] on the album.|$|E

2500|$|Another historian, Maxime du Camp wrote after Thiers' funeral: [...] "Certainly people {{laughed at}} his contradictions, and during his {{lifetime}} he was not spared mockery, but he continued to be respected, because he passionately loved France. In times of good fortune, he dreamed of a France <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>great,</b> strong, and respected; [...] and when France was bent {{under the weight of}} misfortune which its faults had brought upon it, he made a superhuman effort to save it and to make it less miserable. This pleads in his favor and should earn him the indulgence of the future.|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain who in {{the words}} of Buruma was [...] "an English fetishist of German blood", who wrote long pseudo-scientific {{articles}} about how [...] "Germanic racial genius" [...] manifested itself in the cultural works of Richard Wagner, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Ludwig van Beethoven, and William Shakespeare (Chamberlain considered Shakespeare to be a [...] "Germanic playwright" [...] who properly belonged to Germany), making him the [...] "perfect match" [...] for Wilhelm. Chamberlain frequently wrote to an appreciative and admiring Wilhelm telling him that it was only the noble [...] "German spirit" [...] which was saving the world from being destroyed by a [...] "deracinated Yankee-Anglo-Jewish materialism". Finally, Wilhelm was also a Wagnerite, and found much to admire in Chamberlain's writings praising Wagner's music as a mystical, spiritual life-force that embodied all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> about the [...] "German spirit".|$|E
2500|$|The {{script was}} written by Victor Miller, who later went on to write for several {{television}} soap operas, including Guiding Light, One Life to Live and All My Children. Miller delighted in inventing a serial killer {{who turned out to}} be somebody's mother, a murderer whose only motivation was her love for her child. [...] "I took motherhood and turned it on its head and I think <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I'd always wanted—a mother who would have killed for her kids." [...] Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers' decision to make Jason Voorhees the killer in the sequels. [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain." [...] The idea of Jason appearing at the end of the film was initially not used in the original script, and was actually suggested by makeup designer Tom Savini. Savini stated that [...] "The whole reason for the cliffhanger at the end was I had just seen Carrie, so we thought that we need a 'chair jumper' like that, and I said, 'let's bring in Jason'".|$|E

Writing for Vogue, Alex alluded that R stars Tinashe, FKA twigs, and Jhené Aiko [...] "echoed a familiar kind of sound"; the sultry, futuristic music of R pop singer Mýa. He acknowledged Mýa capabilities to [...] "elbowed out the crunchy catchiness of Britney Spears and aggression of Kid Rock" [...] with interesting, seductive music and dubbed Harrison’s brand of R as neo-R innovative {{take on a}} beloved genre that promised a way forward. Essentially, he observed, [...] "with the dominant sounds of R production at the time", Mýa was capable of [...] "creating something preppy and poppy and radio—friendly that kept pace with the Britneys and the N'Syncs without sacrificing experimentation." [...] While he accepted the three women currently dominating the genre, Tinashe, Jhené Aiko, and FKA twigs, [...] "have been endlessly likened" [...] to Aaliyah. He interjected saying [...] "you can hear Mýa in their cross—generational appreciation of subtle, almost anti-pop that still places a premium on powerfully catchy choruses and light, airy vocals." [...] "You {{can see it in}} their nose rings and crop tops." [...] Thus, Frank concluded with [...] "though Harrison’s career didn’t last, it’s clear that her influence has."
