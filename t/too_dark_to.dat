5|$|An avid {{baseball}} fan, Maxwell {{was among}} {{the founders of the}} Winnipeg Arena baseball club in 1908, and became the team's manager in 1912. At its peak, the team drew as many as 5,000 fans per game. As a player, manager or general manager, Maxwell was a member of eight Arena teams that won the Winnipeg city championship between 1908 and 1923. He was known for his quick, and often barbed, wit; His friends often told a story of an Arenas baseball game where, after failing to convince the umpire that it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> play, Maxwell sent his players onto the field with lighted candles. In his later years, he served on the advisory board of the Winnipeg Goldeyes professional club.|$|E

The fight lasted for three hours and 65 rounds, and was finally declared a draw when it became <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> see. Sayers won at the rematch a month later in London.|$|E
25|$|Herbert {{never again}} equalled the {{critical}} acclaim he received for Dune. Neither his sequels to Dune {{nor any of}} his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although {{almost all of them}} were New York Times Best Sellers. Some felt that Children of Dune was almost too literary and <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> get the recognition it may have deserved; others felt that The Dosadi Experiment lacked an epic quality that fans had come to expect.|$|E

One day, two helicopters were scheduled to drop peanut shells that were to simulate locusts on film; however, Malick decided to shoot period cars instead. He kept the helicopters on hold at great cost. Production was lagging behind, with costs exceeding the budget $3,000,000 by about $800,000, and Schneider had already mortgaged his home in order to cover the overages.|$|E
25|$|The branch's stated aim was {{to publish}} {{high-quality}} Japanese games in North America. While Atlus had become famous in Japan for the Megami Tensei role-playing franchise, the series was deemed <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> be released overseas despite a recognized market: {{a major part of}} this was their use of religious imagery and taboo, which ran counter to potential publishers' content guidelines for overseas releases. It was eventually decided to bring over entries from the franchise to help establish Atlus in the West, as they did not have a role-playing series to compete with other major series such as Final Fantasy, Suikoden and Breath of Fire.|$|E

500|$|The writers {{believed}} John's {{separation from}} his sons {{throughout the season}} [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing", with Kripke likewise feeling that John was keeping Sam and Dean away from the [...] "front lines". His death would allow the brothers to [...] "explore, investigate and confront the yellow-eyed demon directly". The writers originally intended for John to die at the episode's end, with Sam and Dean surviving the crash but John dying in their arms. His death, however, was pushed back into the second-season premiere because the writers deemed it <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> kill John after everything else the brothers had gone through in [...] "Devil's Trap".|$|E
500|$|The ideal coat {{color for}} the breed is a medium cream with pink skin, amber {{eyes and a}} white mane and tail. [...] The {{characteristic}} cream color of the breed is produced by the champagne gene. Recognized colors include light, medium and dark cream, with amber or hazel eyes. [...] A cream mare with dark skin and a light mane and tail may {{be accepted by the}} registry as foundation stock, while stallions must have pink skin and white manes and tails to be registered. Purebred American Cream foals that are <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> be accepted into the main breed registry may be recorded into an appendix registry. The appendix will also accept half-bred Cream Draft horses crossed with other draft bloodlines if they meet certain requirements, and the registry provides an upgrade system that uses appendix horses to strengthen genes, increase breed numbers, and allow more diversified bloodlines.|$|E
500|$|On April 24, 1889, McAleer {{broke into}} the Major Leagues in Cleveland, Ohio, where he {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} graceful outfielder. In 1891, when Patsy Tebeau became manager of the Cleveland Spiders, the club became known for its aggressive tactics. Tebeau encouraged players to block and hold runners, while he himself openly challenged and harassed officials. In 1896, the Cleveland manager was jailed for attacking an umpire who [...] "decided it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> continue a game". On June 27, 1896, McAleer was among several Cleveland players to be fined by a Louisville (Kentucky) judge for their role in the incident. Later that year, the club's notoriety prompted other National League teams to propose a boycott of Cleveland, [...] "until the Spiders mended their ways." [...] McAleer's periodic displays of temper were in keeping with this rowdy environment. During an August 18, 1891 game with the Cincinnati Reds, Reds player Arlie Latham tripped McAleer as he rounded third base; McAleer responded by chasing Latham around the field, while brandishing his bat.|$|E

500|$|Wadsworth {{made her}} fourth depth charge {{attack on a}} U-boat on 29July. At about 17:25, she dropped several charges in what {{appeared}} to be the wake of a submarine proceeding submerged. The conjecture that a U-boat was damaged was supported by the appearance of a large amount of heavy oil on the surface following the attack. Just before 23:00, the warship attacked another supposed submarine wake. It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the results; but, not long thereafter, [...] struck a submerged metallic object which caused her to list 10° temporarily. Later, Wadsworths wireless operator intercepted messages sent by a German submarine over a period of about half an hour which suggested that Wadsworth may have damaged a submarine, although as with the depth-charge attack of 21June, no definite proof was forthcoming. Early in August, the destroyer concluded her summer of peak activity by escorting the first United States merchant convoy on the last leg of its voyage to Europe. During the mission, on the 16th, the destroyer dropped a barrage on what was thought to be a submarine.|$|E

Johanne Jørgensen, the pregnant young wife of Captain Jørgen M. Jørgensen, and their 4-year-old son Carl Zealand Jørgensen, were among those who drowned in a final escape attempt as the ship broke up. One more sailor survived, but other five sailors were also drowned. The Captain was somehow spared and washed ashore semi-conscious, but still alive.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, Gary {{is alleged}} to have raped and/or murdered seven elderly women between 1977 and 1978 in Columbus. [...] Known there as the Stocking Strangler, in three of the cases he was convicted of beating, sexually assaulting and {{strangling}} the victims, mostly by using stockings. Two of the survivors testified that he strangled them into unconsciousness before raping or attempting to rape them. [...] The one Georgia survivor positively identified him as her attacker in court. [...] However, she had previously positively identified three other black men as the attacker, and in her initial statement had indicated that it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> even distinguish the race of the attacker. His fingerprints were found at four of the crime scenes. Gary was indicted for the murders on May 5, 1984, convicted on August 26, 1986 and sentenced to death the following day.|$|E

2500|$|Upon hearing {{their first}} hit single at age14, {{he became a}} great fan of The Beatles.

He said in the 2011 {{documentary}} God Bless Ozzy Osbourne that [...] "as soon as [...] heard 'She Loves You' on the radio, [...] knew [...] wanted to be a rock star for the rest of [...] life". Osbourne left school at 15 and was employed as a construction site labourer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner, and abattoir worker. He attempted to commit burglary, stealing a television (which fell on him during his getaway and had to be abandoned), a handful of baby clothes (originally thought to be adult clothes as it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> see when he committed the burglary, and which were stolen to sell to people at a pub), and some T-shirts. He spent six weeks in Winson Green Prison when he was unable to pay a fine after being found guilty of robbing a clothes shop; to teach his son a lesson, his father refused to pay the fine.|$|E
2500|$|After a British mine {{attack on}} 15 May, a German {{destructive}} bombardment {{on the ridge}} defences was accompanied by artillery registration (adjustments of aim by trial and error, directed by an observer in the air or on the ground) on the British communication trenches. In the five weeks before 21 May, the 25th Division (Major-General Beauchamp Doran) suffered [...] although the British miners were gradually gained an advantage over their German counterparts. The infantry thought that the Germans were going to attack but air reconnaissance found no signs of preparations. In the weeks before the German attack, the weather {{was so bad that}} reconnaissance flights over the ridge by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) over the ridge had been possible on only ten days.

The last reconnaissance before the German attack was flown on 17 May; the crew flew over the German trenches from [...] but found that it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> see into them.
