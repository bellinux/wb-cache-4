25|$|Some smaller {{tools were}} made from large flakes that had been struck from stone cores. These flake tools and the {{distinctive}} waste flakes produced in Acheulean tool manufacture suggest a more considered technique, one that required the <b>toolmaker</b> to think one or two steps ahead during work that necessitated a clear sequence of steps to create perhaps several tools in one sitting.|$|E
25|$|Daimler went to {{work for}} Maschinenfabrik Daniel Straub, Geislingen an der Steige, where he {{designed}} tools, mills, and turbines. In 1863, he joined the Bruderhaus Reutlingen, a Christian Socialist <b>toolmaker,</b> as inspector and later executive. While there, he met Wilhelm Maybach, then a 15-year-old orphan. Thanks to Daimler's organizational skills, the factory managed to show a profit, but he quit in frustration in 1869, joining Maschinenbau Gesellschaft Karlsruhe in July.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{advantages}} for the European tooling industry today is the close geographical proximity between <b>toolmakers</b> and end-users, which enables quick responses to changes and the co-development of products, processes and tools. However, to benefit from this advantage and to provide more added-value services to the end-user a symbiotic relationship between <b>toolmakers,</b> their supply chain and their end users is necessary. In this paper the authors describe selected levers to improve the collaboration in the toolmaking value-chain, which have been identified through interviews with <b>toolmakers,</b> their suppliers and their customers. These results are used to explore new business opportunities for European <b>toolmakers...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{technical}} {{analysis of a}} hand axe tries to discover each of the phases in its chaîne opératoire (operational sequence). The chain is highly flexible as a <b>toolmaker</b> may focus narrowly on {{just one of the}} sequence's links or equally on each link. The links examined in this type of study start with the extraction methods of the raw material, then include the actual manufacture of the item, its use, maintenance throughout its working life and finally its disposal.|$|E
25|$|Banks {{was born}} at Jubilee Maternity Hospital, Belfast, the only son and elder child of Albert Herbert Banks, a {{sergeant}} in the Royal Army Service Corps, who before the Second World War had been a <b>toolmaker,</b> and his wife, Olive Irene (Rene), née Rusca. The family returned to England after the birth and {{he grew up in}} Brixton and Tooting. He was educated in London at St. John's School, Brixton, Tenison's School in Kennington, the University of York and the London School of Economics.|$|E
25|$|A hard hammerstone {{would first}} {{be used to}} rough out {{the shape of the}} tool from the stone by {{removing}} large flakes. These large flakes might be re-used to create tools. The tool maker would work around the circumference of the remaining stone core, removing smaller flakes alternately from each face. The scar created by the removal of the preceding flake would provide a striking platform for the removal of the next. Misjudged blows or flaws in the material used could cause problems, but a skilled <b>toolmaker</b> could overcome them.|$|E

25|$|Brought up as {{a strict}} Roman Catholic, he {{attended}} St Aloysius Boys' School in Somers Town and {{served at the}} altar. He then moved to St Aloysius' College in Hornsey Lane, Highgate, London, whose former pupils include actor Peter Sellers. He later moved to North End, Kent, and attended Crayford Secondary School, before leaving with no qualifications at fifteen. He then gained an apprenticeship with Vickers Armstrong as a <b>toolmaker.</b> By {{the time he was}} 21, he was a qualified engineer. He kept the job for a further year, acquiring a fascination and passion for collecting antique guns, clocks, watches and classic cars.|$|E
25|$|A <b>toolmaker</b> may {{put a lot}} {{of effort}} into finding the highest quality raw {{material}} or the most suitable tool stone. In this way more effort is invested in obtaining a good foundation, but time is saved on shaping the stone, that is the effort is focussed on the start of the operational chain. Equally the artisan may concentrate the most effort in the manufacture so that the quality or suitability of the raw material is less important. This will minimize the initial effort but will result in a greater effort {{at the end of the}} operational chain.|$|E

500|$|Injection {{moulding}} BrE or Injection molding AmE, is {{a manufacturing}} process for producing parts by injecting material into a mould. Injection moulding {{can be performed}} {{with a host of}} materials mainly including metals, (for which the process is called die-casting), glasses, elastomers, confections, and most commonly thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Material for the part is fed into a heated barrel, mixed, and forced into a mould cavity, where it cools and hardens to the configuration of the cavity. After a product is designed, usually by an industrial designer or an engineer, moulds are made by a mould-maker (or <b>toolmaker)</b> from metal, usually either steel or aluminium, and precision-machined to form the features of the desired part. Injection moulding is widely used for manufacturing a variety of parts, from the smallest components to entire body panels of cars. [...] Advances in 3D printing technology, using photopolymers which do not melt during the injection moulding of some lower temperature thermoplastics, can be used for some simple injection moulds.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{developments in}} a pilot project established to investigate possible strategies that could be adopted by Australian <b>toolmakers</b> {{to allow them to}} be more competitive in the global market. The <b>toolmakers</b> agreed to eTransforming their individual businesses, and to collaborate with each other as a virtual organization. Results to date show progress in eTransforming their organizations and steady movement towards eCollaboration. It is suggested that trust is a crucial underlying aspect of successful collaboration, and as such needed to be addressed earlier in this project. The next step in this research will be to deploy the identified strategies and evaluate the outcomes. Future studies include the expansion of the framework and strategies to other Australian <b>toolmakers.</b> 1...|$|R

2500|$|The most authentically {{working class}} of the Birmingham Group authors was Leslie Halward, who was born over a butchers shop in Selly Oak {{and worked as a}} {{plasterer}} and <b>toolmaker.</b> Halward's major works were his short stories, collected in the two anthologies To Tea on Sundays and The Money's Alright and Other Stories, which captured an ambience [...] "peculiarly appropriate to Birmingham" [...] and were commended by E. M. Forster for their [...] "good humour, the sureness and lightness of touch, the absence of any social moral" [...] In contrast to Halward's origins Peter Chamberlain was the grandson of Birmingham architect J. H. Chamberlain and of the city's first Lord Mayor James Smith. He was born in Edgbaston and educated at the private Clifton College. A notable motorcycle journalist and writer of short stories for the New Statesman, his novel Sing Holiday is a tale of motor racing set in Birmingham and the Isle of Man. Two further members of the group – Walter Brierley and Hedley Carter – were from Derbyshire and had few connections with Birmingham, attending meetings of the group irregularly.|$|E

Humans also have thicker metacarpals with broader heads, allowing more precise grasping than the chimpanzee hand can perform. Susman posited that modern anatomy of the human opposable thumb is an evolutionary response to the requirements associated with making and handling tools and that both species were indeed <b>toolmakers.</b>|$|R

He attempted to commit burglary, stealing a television (which fell on him during his getaway and had to be abandoned), a handful of baby clothes (originally thought to be adult clothes as it was too dark to see when he committed the burglary, and which were stolen to sell to people at a pub), and some T-shirts. He spent six weeks in Winson Green Prison when he was unable to pay a fine after being found guilty of robbing a clothes shop; to teach his son a lesson, his father refused to pay the fine.|$|E
