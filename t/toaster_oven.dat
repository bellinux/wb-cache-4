50|$|The classic Ellio's pizza may be {{prepared}} {{only in a}} conventional or <b>toaster</b> <b>oven.</b> In each instance, the baking temperature is 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 Â°C), with the pizza baking either directly on the rack for about 9-12 minutes, or {{on a baking sheet}} for 14-16 minutes (not more than 14 minutes in a <b>toaster</b> <b>oven).</b>|$|E
50|$|Modern {{toasters}} {{are typically}} {{one of three}} varieties: pop-up <b>toasters,</b> <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens,</b> and conveyor belt toasters. For home use, consumers typically choose a toaster type based on their intended use. Pop-up toasters are better than <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens</b> for making evenly toasted toast, but <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens</b> can bake and broil while pop-up toasters cannot.|$|R

5000|$|Bread {{can also}} be toasted under a grill (or broiler), in an open oven, or lying on an oven rack.

50|$|Expensive {{equipment}} {{is required to}} reliably solder BGA packages; hand-soldering BGA packages is very difficult and unreliable, usable only for the smallest packages in the smallest quantities. However, as more ICs have become available only in leadless (e.g. quad-flat no-leads package) or BGA packages, various DIY reflow methods have been developed using inexpensive heat sources such as heat guns, and domestic <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens</b> and electric skillets.|$|R

50|$|Toaster ovens {{are small}} {{electric}} ovens with a front door, wire rack and removable baking pan. To toast bread with a <b>toaster</b> <b>oven,</b> {{slices of bread}} are placed horizontally on the rack. When the toast is done, the toaster turns off, {{but in most cases}} the door must be opened manually. Most toaster ovens are significantly larger than toasters, but are capable of performing most of the functions of electric ovens, albeit on a much smaller scale. They can be used to cook toast with toppings, like garlic bread or cheese, though they tend to produce drier toast since their heating elements are located farther from the toast (to allow larger items to be cooked). They take 4-6 minutes to make toast as compared to 2-3 minutes in pop-up toasters. Since the toast lies on bars in a <b>toaster</b> <b>oven,</b> the toast will have untoasted stripes on one side. The evidence from product testing does not indicate that convection oven toaster ovens perform better than regular toaster ovens. People wishing to make large amounts of toast in a <b>toaster</b> <b>oven</b> should check the size before purchase, as even seemingly large toaster ovens may not fit six standard-size pieces of bread.|$|E
50|$|Toast is sliced {{bread that}} has been browned by {{exposure}} to radiant heat. This browning {{is the result of}} a Maillard reaction altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer so that it is easier to spread toppings on it. Toasting is a common method of making stale bread more palatable. Bread is often toasted using a <b>toaster,</b> but <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens</b> are also used.|$|R
5000|$|Potential {{sources of}} RFI and EMI include: {{various types of}} transmitters, {{doorbell}} transformers, <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens,</b> electric blankets, ultrasonic pest control devices, electric bug zappers, heating pads, and touch controlled lamps.

5000|$|Ripert {{has made}} several guest {{appearances}} on cooking-based television shows, including guest judge and assistant chef roles on the second, third, {{fourth and fifth}} seasons of Bravo TV's [...] "Top Chef". Chef Ripert had been considered to join season 8 of Top Chef as a permanent judge, but bowed out when his employee Jen Caroll was selected as a contestant again. He is friends with and has appeared on many episodes of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. Most recently he has launched a series of brief online cooking videos called [...] "Get Toasted" [...] on his website AVECERIC.com which focuses on easy and quick meals that can be prepared and cooked in minutes with a <b>toaster</b> <b>oven.</b> In the series he uses a somewhat high end brick-oven based <b>toaster</b> <b>oven</b> produced by Cuisinart. Adding to his adventures, PBS has aired Avec Eric episodes (started September 2009) where he travels the world and finds inspiration and shows the idea in a profession setting, travels on location, and then finally shows the enlightenment in his home kitchen. Ripert occasionally resides in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York with his wife, Sandra, and son.|$|E
5000|$|Miscellaneous {{electric}} loads (MELs) {{in buildings}} are electric loads resulting from electronic devices {{not responsible for}} space heating, cooling, water heating, or lighting. [...] MELs are produced by hard-wired and âplug-inâ electrical devices, including home entertainment centers, kitchen electronics such as microwaves and <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens,</b> bath items such as hair dryers and electric hot tubs, and others such as security systems and ceiling fans. MELs are gaining greater importance as home electronics become more sophisticated and more widespread, and miscellaneous electric use can only be expected to rise.|$|R
5000|$|Ovens {{are mostly}} hollow devices that get very hot (up to [...] ) {{and are used}} for baking or {{roasting}} and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens. For example, Indian culture uses a tandoor oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature. Western kitchens use variable temperature convection <b>ovens,</b> conventional <b>ovens,</b> <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens,</b> or non-radiant heat ovens like the microwave oven. Classic Italian cuisine includes {{the use of a}} brick oven containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, gas, electric, or oil-fired.|$|R
5000|$|Tubular (sheathed) {{elements}} normally {{comprise a}} fine coil of nichrome (NiCr) resistance heating alloy wire, that {{is located in}} a metallic tube (of stainless steel alloys, such as Incoloy, or copper) and insulated by magnesium oxide powder. To keep moisture out of the hygroscopic insulator, the ends are equipped with beads of insulating material such as ceramic or silicone rubber, or a combination of both. The tube is drawn through a die to compress the powder and maximize heat transmission. These can be a straight rod (as in <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens)</b> or bent to a shape to span an area to be heated (such as in electric stoves, ovens, and coffee makers).|$|R
5000|$|The {{value of}} entry and exit actions {{is that they}} provide means for {{guaranteed}} initialization and cleanup, very much like class constructors and destructors in Object-oriented programming. For example, consider the [...] "door_open" [...] state from Figure 5, which corresponds to the <b>toaster</b> <b>oven</b> behavior while the door is open. This state has a very important safety-critical requirement: Always disable the heater when the door is open. Additionally, while the door is open, the internal lamp illuminating the oven should light up.|$|E
50|$|A chef may prepare {{hash browns}} by forming riced {{potatoes}} into patties before frying with onions (moisture and potato starch can hold them together); however, if a binding agent is added (egg or oil for example), such a preparation constitutes a potato pancake. Frozen hash browns are sometimes made into patty form {{for ease of}} handling, and the compact, flat shape can also be cooked in a <b>toaster</b> <b>oven</b> or toaster. If a dish of hash browned potatoes incorporates chopped meat, leftovers, or other vegetables, it is more {{commonly referred to as}} hash.|$|E

50|$|The {{retail stores}} in large truck stops offer a large {{selection}} of 12-volt DC products, such as coffee makers, combo television units, <b>toaster</b> <b>ovens,</b> and frying pans primarily targeted towards truck drivers, who often spend {{extended periods of}} time on the road. Such shops generally offer a wide selection of maps, road atlases, truck stop and freeway exit guides, truck accessories (such as CB radio equipment and hazmat placards), plus entertainment media such as movies, video games, music, and audiobooks. Increasingly, as interstate truck drivers have become a large market for satellite radio, these retail stores also sell various satellite radio receivers for both XM and Sirius as well as subscriptions to those services. Kiosks run by cellular phone providers are also common.|$|R
