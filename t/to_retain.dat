40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} financial statement effects of firm attributes on {{the components of}} equity, the market reaction effects on key events in the adoption of IFRS, and the cumulative earnings response coefficient effect {{in the context of}} IFRS adoption in Canada. Firm attributes were tested for association with the adjustment <b>to</b> <b>retained</b> earnings at the transition date when first adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS.) Evidence from the analyses of the adjustment <b>to</b> <b>retained</b> earnings model revealed a statistically significant association between the adjustment <b>to</b> <b>retained</b> earnings and the firm attributes of volatility of income, internationality, and firm industry. Market reaction was measured for two key events of IFRS adoption: early adoption announcement and the release of first quarter financial results under IFRS. A negative mean for Cumulative Average Return (CAR) resulted from tests of both events. However, only the negative mean CAR from marketâ€™s reaction to the release of first quarter financial results under IFRS demonstrated statistical significance. The adjustment <b>to</b> <b>retained</b> earnings model used in this study developed a benchmark for tests of value relevance. In the test of value relevance, the benchmark or unexpected adjustment <b>to</b> <b>retained</b> earnings was tested against the actual adjustment <b>to</b> <b>retained</b> earnings for market reaction. The results from the tests of value relevance were not statistically significant. This study contributes to the literature by identifying firm factors: volatility of income, internationality, and industry as firm factors associated with the adjustment <b>to</b> <b>retained</b> earnings upon adoption of IFRS. Further, evidence from the event study demonstrates that the market reacts negatively to the adoption of IFRS and suggests that the Canadian market may not perceive IFRS as an improvement in financial reporting or a reduction in information asymmetry...|$|R
