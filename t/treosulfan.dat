Moreover, DA rats develop a chronic disease course. We here explored the efficacy of <b>treosulfan</b> {{in the treatment of}} MOG-induced EAE in DA rats. A single dose of <b>treosulfan</b> (1 g/kg body weight i. p.) at the day of immunization significantly reduced disease severity compared with PBS-treated controls. In addition, after disease had evolved, a single dose of <b>treosulfan</b> (1 g/kg body weight) given i. p. on day 14 post-immunization (p. i.) improved long-term disease outcome. Treatment with <b>treosulfan</b> resulted in reduced mRNA expression of IL- 12 and interferon (IFN) -gamma in draining lymph nodes and reduced numbers of IFN-gamma-secreting MOG-specific T cells. No myelosuppression was observed. <b>Treosulfan</b> was applied to different subsets of cultured human blood mononuclear cells in order to asses the effects on human immune cells in vitro: <b>Treosulfan</b> reduced proliferative capacity and increased apoptosis in T cells and antigen-presenting cells. In light of the beneficial effects in EAE in vivo and the in vitro immunosuppressive and pro-apoptotic capacities in cultured human mononuclear immune effector cells, these data may support a potential role of <b>treosulfan,</b> an agent with high immunosuppressive capacity and low toxicity, in the treatment of MS...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: The {{cytotoxic}} drug <b>Treosulfan</b> is clinically {{used for the}} treatment of malignancy. A common side effect of <b>Treosulfan</b> treatment is anemia. <b>Treosulfan</b> is at least partially effective by triggering apoptosis of tumor cells. Similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may enter eryptosis, a suicidal death characterized by cell shrinkage and translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Triggers of eryptosis include oxidative stress, Ca 2 +-entry and increase of cytosolic Ca 2 +-activity ([Ca 2 +]i). The present study explored whether <b>Treosulfan</b> stimulates eryptosis, which may contribute to development of anemia. Methods: Erythrocyte volume was estimated from forward scatter, phosphatidylserine abundance at the erythrocyte surface from Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -annexin-V-binding, [Ca 2 +]i from Fluo 3 fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from 2 ', 7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) -fluorescence. Results: A 48 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to <b>Treosulfan</b> (800 µg/ml) significantly decreased erythrocyte forward scatter, increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells, increased [Ca 2 +]i, and increased ROS. The effect of <b>Treosulfan</b> on annexin-V-binding was virtually abrogated by removal of extracellular Ca 2 +. Conclusion: <b>Treosulfan</b> stimulates suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis at least in part by inducing oxidative stress and stimulating Ca 2 + entry...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of choroidal {{melanoma}} by chemotherapy {{is usually}} unsuccessful, with response rates {{of less than}} 1 % reported for dacarbazine (DTIC) -containing regimens which show 20 % or more response rates in skin melanoma. Recently, we reported the activity of several cytotoxic agents against primary choroidal melanoma in an ATP-based tumour chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA). In this study, we have used the same method to examine the sensitivity of choroidal melanoma to combinations suggested by our earlier study. Tumour material from 36 enucleated eyes was tested against a battery of single agents and combinations which showed some activity in the previous study. The combination of <b>treosulfan</b> with gemcitabine or cytosine arabinoside showed consistent activity in 70 % and 86 % of cases, respectively. Paclitaxel was also active, particularly in combination with <b>treosulfan</b> (47 %) or mitoxantrone (33 %). Addition of paclitaxel to the combination of <b>treosulfan</b> + cytosine analogue added little increased sensitivity. For <b>treosulfan</b> + cytosine arabinoside, further sequence and timing experiments showed that simultaneous administration gave the greatest suppression, with minor loss of inhibition if the cytosine analogue was given 24 h after the <b>treosulfan.</b> Administration of cytosine analogue 24 h before <b>treosulfan</b> produced considerably less inhibition at any concentration. While we have so far been unable to study metastatic tumour from choroidal melanoma patients, the combination of <b>treosulfan</b> with gemcitabine or cytosine arabinoside shows activity ex vivo against primary tumour tissue.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of <b>treosulfan,</b> a cytotoxic alkylating agent, in patients with active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. BACKGROUND: <b>Treosulfan</b> (L-threitol- 1, 4 -bis(methanesulfonate)) is a bifunctional alkylating agent with a favorable profile of side effects, approved {{for the treatment of}} ovarian cancer. <b>Treosulfan</b> has previously been shown to reduce the severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis under pre-therapeutic and therapeutic conditions. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, <b>treosulfan</b> reduces proliferative capacity and increases apoptosis. STUDY DESIGN: This is a nonrandomized, open label study conducted in two centers. Eleven patients with active secondary progressive MS that failed to or did not qualify for approved disease modifying drugs were treated with <b>treosulfan</b> for 1 year. Patients received intravenous infusions of 7 g/m(2) every 4 weeks for 3 months (cycles 1 - 4, induction phase) with a predefined one-step dose escalation, thereafter every 3 months for the following 9 months (cyles 5 - 7, maintainance phase). Cranial MRI was performed every 3 months, EDSS and MSFC as well as physical examination were assessed at each clinical visit. RESULTS: Treatment with <b>treosulfan</b> was safe and well tolerated. Nine of 11 patients remained on study drug over the complete treatment period and showed clinical stabilisation or improvement as determined by EDSS and MSFC. Two patients discontinued study drug because of leukocytopenia and withdrawal of consent, respectively. No clinical relapses were observed during the treatment period. Thus, the median number of relapses per year was reduced signifi- cantly by 1. 5 (range - 3 to 0), p < 0. 016, compared to prestudy. Therapy with <b>treosulfan</b> lead to a clear reduction of MRI activity as revealed by a reduced number of Gd + enhancing lesions on T 1 weighted images. The mean number and volume of T 2 lesions remained unchanged over 1 year. Four out of 9 patients under <b>treosulfan</b> showed no detectable disease activity (no Gd enhancing lesions, no new or newly enlarging T 2 lesions). CONCLUSIONS: Application of <b>treosulfan</b> in MS was safe and well tolerated. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment in secondary progressive MS...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of older and unfit women with advanced ovarian cancer requires postoperative chemotherapy {{but many of}} these patients are not suitable for high-dose cisplatin-based regimes. Carboplatin has been an easier alternative and can be given in the ambulatory setting. Historical data suggests that oral alkylating agents to be just effective with similar efficacy. In this study we have compared platinum-based carboplatin to the alkylating agent <b>treosulfan</b> in a population unfit to receive high-dose cisplatin. The trial randomised patients to either intravenous carboplatin or <b>treosulfan</b> as single agent. The trial was stopped prematurely after the interim analysis showed improved survival and response rates in the carboplatin arm. We conclude that carboplatin is a safe and effective drug in a population that is unfit for high-dose cisplatin. <b>Treosulfan</b> showed limited activity but may be considered along with other oral drugs in limited circumstances. With the exception of myelosuppression, toxicity was mild in both arms. Carboplatin remains the gold standard in this older and less fit group of patients...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pericarditis {{is a rare}} side-effect of {{chemotherapy}} and has been reported following administration of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and other drugs but not <b>treosulfan.</b> CASE REPORTS: We report on 2 patients with retrosternal chest pain and typical widespread upward concave ST-segment elevation in the 12 -lead electrocardiogram prompting the diagnosis of acute pericarditis. The patients had received treatment for multiple myeloma or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma with high-dose <b>treosulfan</b> alone or in combination with etoposide and carboplatin followed by autologous stem cell transplantation 5 days before onset of the symptoms. In both patients, no serological evidence of viral infection was found. Serum creatine kinase and serum cardiac troponin I remained unchanged. Within 24 h of onset of the symptoms, C-reactive protein increased from normal values (< 5 mg/l) to 95 mg/l and 115 mg/l, respectively. In one of the patients, a paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia occurred that persisted for 2 days. After treatment with diclofenac, both patients recovered completely within 1 week.

40|$|AbstractTreosulfan (l-threitol- 1, 4 -bismethanesulfonate) is an {{alkylating agent}} with routine {{clinical}} application {{in the treatment}} of ovarian cancer. In this murine study we show that this drug also has the ability to deplete primitive hematopoietic stem cells in a dose-dependent manner as determined by the cobblestone area-forming cell assay and is similar to its parent compound busulfan. Because busulfan is frequently used as part of the conditioning regimen before stem cell transplantation, we investigated an alternative nonmyeloablative protocol in an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation model in which low-dose <b>treosulfan</b> was added to an immune-suppressive regimen consisting of T cell-depleting antibodies, fludarabine, and thymic irradiation. Although this treatment protocol produced minimal myelosuppression, the addition of <b>treosulfan</b> proved to be important for allowing stable multilineage and mixed chimerism in C 57 BL/ 6 recipients of major histocompatibility complex-mismatched B 10. A bone marrow without evidence of graft-versus-host disease. Donor lymphocyte infusion performed at 10 weeks after bone marrow transplantation had the effect of transforming the state of mixed chimerism to full donor-type cells, again without evidence of graft-versus-host disease. Donor-specific immunologic tolerance in the mixed chimeric animals was indicated by the acceptance of donor-type and rejection of third-party skin grafts. Thus, low-dose <b>treosulfan</b> may be considered as a useful component of a truly nonmyeloablative conditioning protocol in providing for mixed hematopoietic chimerism and, consequently, in establishing a platform for adoptive immunotherapy...|$|E

40|$|Human-specific HIV- 1 and {{hepatitis}} co-infections {{significantly affect}} patient management {{and call for}} new therapeutic options. Small xenotransplantation models with human hepatocytes and hematolymphoid tissue should facilitate antiviral/antiretroviral drug trials.

The best animal strains for hepatocyte transplantation are not optimal for human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment, and vice versa. We evaluated a new strain of highly immunodeficient nonobese diabetic/Shi-scid (severe combined immunodeficiency) /IL- 2 Rγcnull (NOG) mice that carry two copies of the mouse albumin promoter-driven urokinase-type plasminogen activator transgene for dual reconstitution with human liver and immune cells.

However, post-HCT relapse remains a major problem, particularly in patients with high-risk cytogenetics. In this prospective phase II trial, we assessed the efficacy and toxicity of <b>treosulfan,</b> fludarabine, and 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) as conditioning for allogeneic HCT in patients with MDS or AML. Ninety-six patients with MDS (n =  36 : 15 refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 10 refractory anemia with excess blasts type 1, 10 refractory anemia with excess blasts type 2, 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia type 1) or AML (n =  60 : 35 first complete remission [CR], 18  second CR, 3 advanced CR, 4 refractory relapse) were enrolled; median age was 51 (range, 1 to 60) years. Twelve patients had undergone a prior HCT with high-intensity conditioning. Patients received 14  g/m 2 /day <b>treosulfan</b> i. v. on days − 6 to − 4, 30  mg/m 2 /day fludarabine i. v. on days − 6 to − 2, and 2 Gy TBI on day 0, followed by infusion of hematopoietic cells from related (n =  27) or unrelated (n =  69) donors. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate. With a median follow-up of 30  months, the 2 -year overall survival (OS), relapse incidence, and nonrelapse mortality were 73 %, 27 %, and 8 %, respectively. The incidences of grades II to IV (III to IV) acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were 59 % (10 %) and 47 %, respectively. Two-year OS was not significantly different between MDS patients with poor-risk and good/intermediate-risk cytogenetics (69 % and 85 %, respectively) or between AML patients with unfavorable and favorable/intermediate-risk cytogenetics (64 % and 76 %, respectively).

Assuming that imatinib could be included in pretransplantation conditioning therapies, we tested whether combinations of imatinib and γ-irradiation or alkylating agents such as busulfan or <b>treosulfan</b> would display synergistic activity in BCR–ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia BV 173 and EM- 3 cell lines. Further, primary cells of untreated chronic myelogenous leukaemia patients were assayed for colony forming ability under combination therapy with imatinib.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Allogeneic {{hematopoietic cell}} {{transplantation}} (HCT) is a curative therapy {{for patients with}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, post-HCT relapse and regimen-related toxicity remain significant barriers to long-term survival. In recent years, new conditioning regimens have been explored to improve transplantation outcomes in patients with AML. <b>Treosulfan</b> combines a potent immunosuppressive and antileukemic effect with a low toxicity profile. METHODS: To investigate the role of treosulfan-based conditioning, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Acute Leukemia Working Party performed a registry analysis of 520 adult patients with AML who received treosulfan-based conditioning and underwent HCT between 2000 and 2012, including 225 patients in first complete remission, 107 in second or later complete remission, and 188 with active/advanced disease 188 (88 with primary refractory disease). The median patient age was 57 years (range, 20 - 73 years). Donors were human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings (n = 187), unrelated donors (n = 235), or mismatched related donors (n = 98). Conditioning regimens included <b>treosulfan</b> (42 g/m 2 [n = 396], 36 g/m 2 [n = 109], or 30 g/ m 2 [n = 15]) with fludarabine or alkylating agents followed by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells (bone marrow, n = 52; peripheral blood, n = 468). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 61 months, the 5 -year overall survival, leukemia-free survival, relapse incidence, and nonrelapse mortality rates were 38 %, 33 %, 42 %, and 25 %, respectively. The incidence of grade II-IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease was 24 % (grade III-V, 11 %) and 38 %, respectively. Only 11 patients (2 %) developed veno-occlusive disease, with two deaths (0. 4 %) from veno-occlusive disease.

40|$|Allogeneic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (SCT) is a potentially curative treatment for various hematological disorders. Antimalignancy effects result from cytoreduction by the pretransplantation preparative regimen and the immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. The latter effect plays the predominant role {{for a variety}} of hematological malignancies and was the basis for introducing reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens in the allogeneic SCT setting. This made the approach applicable for patients previously ineligible due to advanced age or comorbidity. It has been suggested that, compared to conventional conditioning, RIC might be associated with delayed engraftment and mixed donor hematopoietic chimerism. Mixed chimerism was found to result in a higher relapse risk than complete chimerism in patients with severe aplastic anemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. However, the prognostic value of the degree of chimerism remains controversial in patients with acute leukemia. The nucleoside analogue fludarabine was established in RIC protocols in 1997. Its favorable toxicity profile and immunosuppressive effects, particularly in relation to T-cell activity, makes the substance suitable as part of a RIC regimen prior to allogeneic SCT. The alkylating agent <b>treosulfan</b> offers due to its low non-hematological toxicity a promising alternative to conventional conditioning agents in the autologous and allogeneic SCT setting. Therefore, this conditioning regimen might be considered as “reduced-toxicity” and discriminated from truly “reduced-intensity” regimens. Despite previous evidence substantiating the feasibility of conditioning with fludarabine and <b>treosulfan,</b> limited data are available on engraftment kinetics and the significance of hematopoietic chimerism in terms of relapse, acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and survival. To clarify these open questions we analyzed between 2001 and 2005 the outcomes of 107 patients with different hematological malignancies who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA identical (10 loci) donor were analyzed according to 2 types of conditioning: reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in 52 patients (42 of them received <b>Treosulfan</b> containing regimen), and convention myeloablative conditioning (CMC) in 55 patients. The mean age was 53 years (18 - 72) in RIC group and 40 years (17 - 64) in CMC group (p< 0, 001, Mann-Whitney-Test). 102 patients received stem cells from peripheral blood. There were no statistical differences between gander, stem cell origin and donor characteristics (unrelated/related; CMV status; sex mismatch). We evaluated chimerism in a whole bone marrow at day + 28, + 56, + 90, + 180, + 360, and at end of investigation. In statistical analysis, the 3 -year relapse rate was significantly increased after RIC (log rank test, P< 0, 001). The median overall survival was identical in both groups (Median RIC 909 days, CMC 1216 days). In multivariate analysis, complete donor chimerism at day + 56, diagnosis (high versus low and intermediated malignant) and type of conditioning (RIC) were important factors for overall survival at 3 years (p < 0, 001, multivariant analysis, cox regression) ...|$|E

40|$|Autoimmune {{diseases}} are incurable and affect about 6 - 9 % of the population. Treatments of autoimmune diseases {{include the use}} of monoclonal antibodies, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, or replacement therapy like insulin for type 1 diabetes. Not all these treatments address the cause, but only aim to reduce symptoms. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is currently being trialled to treat autoimmune diseases, however it is associated with high relapse rates. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system. T regulatory cells (Tregs) have the capacity to supress a wide range of immune responses and {{play a key role in}} controlling autoreactive reactions in the periphery, making them an ideal candidate for cellular treatment of autoimmune diseases. They are mainly taken to represent the CD 4 + CD 25 high FoxP 3 + T-cells. Their developments happen naturally in the thymus from a separate lineage and their TCR repertoire is mainly self-reactive. The transcription factor Foxp 3 is crucial for Tregs development and function. It has been demonstrated that antigen specific T cells transduced with Foxp 3 gene have the capability to reduce the symptoms of autoimmune disease. Bone marrow gene modification and subsequent transplantation can be used as a method to express genes, such as T cell receptors linked to Foxp 3 gene, in self-renewing BM derived cells. My hypothesis is induce tolerance to autoimmune diseases by the transfer of bone marrow (BM) stem cells, that have been genetically engineered to express self-antigen, into preconditioned mice using a less toxic non-myeloablative chemotherapy regime. In this study I have examined this hypothesis in EAE induced by the self-antigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and by substituting irradiation which is highly toxic with less toxic non myeloablative regimen drug <b>Treosulfan,</b> as a proof-of-principle that tolerance can be generated with less toxic conditioning. I have shown that when mice are conditioned with a non-myeloablative dose of <b>Treosulfan</b> and received BM cells that have been retrovirally transduced with the autoantigen MOG, they remained EAE free. Furthermore, through this study I have found that using a chemotherapy drug, such as <b>Treosulfan,</b> conditioning promoting a low degree of chimerism at non-myeloablative dose was adequate to promote antigen specific tolerance and protect mice from EAE. In a more clinically relevant scenario, when <b>Treosulfan</b> at non-myeloablative dose was included into a curative protocol for treating mice with established EAE, it resulted in complete remission and proved to be efficient in maintaining disease resistance following subsequent challenge. Taking a different approach but still aimed at promoting tolerance, I have developed a retroviral vector designed to generate antigen specific Tregs. This vector was encoding the Vα 3. 2 and Vβ 11 TCR chains (2 D 2 -TCR) specific for the autoantigen MOG 35 - 55 peptide linked to Foxp 3 gene. Therefore, I hypothesized that the introduction of the 2 D 2 -TCR plus Foxp 3 into BM stem cells would lead to the generation of T regulatory cells specific for EAE autoantigen, which would impose immune regulation and prevent EAE induction. The generated retroviral constructs were tested in vitro in various cell lines including isolated mouse splenic naïve CD 4 cells and found to be able to produce cells expressing 2 D 2 -TCR and Foxp 3 as well as other Tregs markers such as CD 25, GITR and CTLA- 4. Generated retroviruses were also used to transduce BM and create chimeric mice with a quantifiable subpopulation of T cells with MOG 35 - 55 TCR specificity and Foxp 3 driven Treg phenotype. However, mice generated were not efficiently tolerant to the induction of EAE. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that a significant population of 2 D 2 -TCR-Foxp 3 -GFP cells were detected in the thymus but far less in the periphery with lesser Foxp 3 expression than that seen in the thymus. This finding suggests that Foxp 3 expression alone is not enough to confer Treg cell features and that other epigenetic and transcriptional factors are likely to be involved to ensure their stability and function...|$|E
40|$|Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) {{comprise}} {{a family of}} enzymes that utilizes glutathione (GSH) in many enzymatic reactions that involved in transformation of several compounds including therapeutic drug molecules and carcinogens. In addition, GSTs influence cellular survival and proliferation, by repressing apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK 1) thus affecting the activation of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in response to various intra and extracellular stresses. Molecules inhibiting the function of GSTs received attention as an adjuvant therapy to the highly toxic electrophilic agents to avoid usage of high doses and toxicity for better outcomes. There is no detailed in silico analysis exists in literature to describe the binding patterns of known inhibitors to all GST isoforms. This study is aimed at providing details of binding patterns of known and putative substrates (Busulfan, <b>Treosulfan,</b> SS-EBDM, SS-DEB), inhibitors (Ethacrynic acid, Sulfolane and Curcumin) with predominately-expressed seven isoforms of GST (Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Pi 1, Mu 1, Mu 2, Mu 5 and Theta 1). In silico methodology include six steps namely (a) Retrieval of three-dimensional structure of GSTs and Ligand molecules from RCSB-PDB and NCBI-PubChem databases, (b) Protein and Ligand preparation using Auto Dock Tools (ADT), (c) Receptor grid preparation based on known binding site (Direct docking protocol) of GSTs using AutoDock/Vina plugin in PyMOL, (d) Preparation of Auto Dock Vina configuration file, (e) Running of docking calculation using Auto Dock Vina and (f) Analysis of docking results using ADT, PyMOL and LigPlus programs. Molecular docking studies of substrates/inhibitors are performed with both Apo and GSH bounded forms of GSTs. Structural parameters such as estimated free energy of binding (ΔH), estimated inhibition constant (Ki), binding orientation, intermolecular interactions were noted for all the docking interaction models. Then the parameters were compared against each substrate or inhibitor for the affinity towards a selective GST isoform. Out of the three putative or known inhibitors screened, Curcumin showed a significant high binding affinity towards all the classes of GSTs, particularly GST Alpha 1 (ΔH: - 9. 7 kcal/mol and Ki: 0. 08 µM). Ethacrynic acid also showed better binding affinity towards GST Alpha 1 (ΔH: - 7. 6 kcal/mol and Ki: 2. 7 uM). Sulfolane did not exhibited a stronger affinity towards all the seven GST isoforms. Busulfan and <b>Treosulfan</b> exhibited a reasonable binding affinity towards GST Alpha 1 (ΔH: - 5. 2 and - 5. 3 kcal/mol) and weakened affinity for the remaining six GST isoforms. Thus, <b>treosulfan</b> could be a possible substrate for GST Alpha 1. Manual inspection of three-dimensional structures of the docking complexes revealed that binding-sites for inhibitor and substrate are different. In an on-going study, we are evaluating the inhibitory potential of Curcumin and Ethacrynic acid against GSTs in in vitro studies. The {{detailed description of the}} binding interactions may be useful to screen new putative GST substrates and inhibitors. Presence or absence of variants in these binding pockets also can define the amount of inhibitor required and the affinity and potency of an inhibitor and or substrate.

40|$|Studies so far {{indicate}} that reduced intensity transplantation (RIT) {{may have an}} important role in treating patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (PID).

RIT appears to be most appropriate for those patients with significant co-morbidities (eg T cell deficiencies) and those undergoing unrelated donor haematopoietic cell transplantation. More studies are required using pharmacokinetic monitoring (eg busulphan, <b>treosulfan</b> and alemtuzumab) and varying stem cell sources to optimise graft vs marrow reactions and minimise graft vs host disease. In certain PID patients RIT will be the “first step” towards establishing donor cell engraftment; second infusions of donor stem cells, donor lymphocyte infusions, or a second myeloablative HCT, which appears to be well tolerated, may be required in some patients with low level donor chimerism or graft rejection...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacotherapy {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) procedure. Busulfan and <b>treosulfan</b> are two alkylating agents often applied in the conditioning regimen administered prior to the allo-HSCT. Finding the right balance between efficacious conditioning and toxicity remains the challenge for both agents. A majore One of the major complications after allo-HSCT is Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). When patients are diagnosed with grade 2 or higher aGvHD, systemic treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids is started as first line treatment. However, only half of the patients respond adequately to this therapy and also in other diseases non-responsiveness to glucocorticoids has been observed. Optimization of current drug therapies in allo-HSCT holds the potential to improve the outcome and safety. The goal of this thesis is to optimize busulfan- and treosulfan-based conditioning regimens and acute GvHD treatment with glucocorticoids by applying pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic profiling.

40|$|The {{first section}} of the {{presented}} work describes cytogenetic abnormalities in highly purified aberrant plasma cells {{and the distribution of}} different cell subsets in multiple myeloma and MGUS. The coexistence of aberrant plasma cells with and without recurrent IGH translocations (e. g. t(11; 14)) led to assume that also these cytogenetic abnormalities might correspond to secondary genetic events, which contrasts the current hypothesis. Furthermore, we found that the expression of CD 117 and CXCR 4 on the surface of aberrant plasma cells is associated with a markedly altered distribution of different lymphatic and myeloid cell compartments in plasma cell dyscrasias. The presented studies on novel treatment approaches in multiple myeloma suggest that the novel alkylphospholipid perifosine induces apoptosis in vitro and thus should be evaluated further in clinical trials as a treatment option for multiple myeloma. Conditioning with fludarabine and <b>treosulfan</b> prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation is feasible and results frequently in an early complete hematopoietic chimerism.

Here we explored in 121 patients, mostly with advanced stage diseases, a sirolimus-based, calcineurin-inhibitor-free prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) to allow the infusion of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts from partially HLA-matched family donors (TrRaMM study, Eudract 2007 - 5477 - 54). Conditioning regimen was based on <b>treosulfan</b> and fludarabine, and GvHD prophylaxis on antithymocyte globulin Fresenius (ATG-F), rituximab and oral administration of sirolimus and mycophenolate. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred in median at 17 and 19 days after HSCT, respectively, and full donor chimerism was documented in patients' bone marrow since the first post-transplant evaluation. T-cell immune reconstitution was rapid, and high frequencies of circulating functional T-regulatory cells (Treg) were documented during sirolimus prophylaxis. Incidence of acute GvHD grade II-IV was 35 %, and occurrence and severity correlated negatively with Treg frequency. Chronic GvHD incidence was 47 %.

40|$|Background and ObjectiveResults of hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) in childhood acute leukemias, are still unsatisfactory, however better than obtained with conventional chemotherapy. Probability of long-term survival after HSCT is still only 40 % – 50 %. The main cause of failure remains relapse of the disease. Current possibilities to augment an antileukemic effect of HSCT include: protection of GvHD and introduction of adoptive immunotherapy combined {{with the results of}} molecular chimerism and minimal residual disease. Another possibility is the use of more intensive or tailored preparative regimen (prep-reg) before HSCT and modulation of drug resistance of residual leukemic cells against agents used in prep-reg. The aim of the study is the analysis of in vitro drug resistance profile in aspect of leukemia relapse after HSCT. Patients and MethodsA total number of 22 children with acute leukemia (14 ALL, 8 AML), aged 1, 9 – 17 years, who underwent HSCT, were included into the study. For all children, drug resistance profile was done by the MTT assay. Leukemic cells of each child were tested for cytotoxicity of up to 26 drugs (busulfan and melfalan was not tested). Children who have died due to peritransplant complications were excluded from the study. In 13 children HSCT was performed from HLA identical sibling, in 2 from MUD, in 1 from MMRD and 6 children had autotransplantation. 8 / 22 children relapsed after HSCT. Drug resistance profile was performed in Laboratory of Clinical and Experimental Oncology in Bydgoszcz. The cytotoxicity was expressed as the concentration of drug, which was lethal to 50 % of tested blasts. Children with ALL were prepared to HSCT with: FTBI/VP±CY (6 patients) or BU/VP/CY (8 patients). Before MUD-HSCT, ATG was also given. AML children were conditioned with one the following sets of drugs: BU/VP/CY, BU/CY/MEL, BU/CY, BU/MEL, TREO/VP/CY, TREO/FLU/ATG, TRE/FLU/MEL. ResultsChildren who relapsed after HSCT showed higher in vitro resistance of leukemic blasts to most of tested drugs including cyclophosphamide (3, 3 -fold) and fludarabine (2, 3 -fold). Only for 4 / 26 tested drugs chemosensitivity of relapsed patients was better, i. e. : to <b>treosulfan</b> (4, 8 -fold), etoposide (1, 7 -fold), thiotepa (4, 6 -fold) and mercaptopurine (1, 7 -fold) (all differences did not reach statistical significance). 5 / 6 children prepared with FTBI stays in remission. ConclusionsThe results of this analysis might suggest that relative sensitivity of leukemic blasts to <b>treosulfan</b> and etoposide is not sufficient to prevent patient from relapse after HSCT.

There is a continuous search for novel conditioning regimens that will reduce SCT-related toxicity while retaining maximal anti-malignancy effect. <b>Treosulfan</b> (Treo) was initially used in the treatment of certain solid tumors. Preclinical studies showed that in contrast to Busulfan it has an effect on both committed and non- committed hematopoietic stem cells. It also has stronger immunosuppressive characteristics that make it suitable for conditioning regimens for allogeneic SCT including from cord blood and Haploidentical donors.
