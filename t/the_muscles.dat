5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in}} the crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E

5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of <b>the</b> <b>muscles,</b> including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
50|$|Resection {{involves}} detaching one of <b>the</b> eye <b>muscles,</b> {{removing a}} portion of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> from <b>the</b> distal end of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> and reattaching <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> to <b>the</b> eye.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{isotonic}} contractions: (1) concentric and (2) eccentric. In a concentric contraction, <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> tension rises to meet the resistance, then remains the same as <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> shortens.

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this {{investigation}} to study some of the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> fiber and mass of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> from which <b>the</b> fiber was taken. Since <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> fiber is a component part of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> it is assumed that changes in mass or volume of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> are brought about by corresponding changes in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> fiber. <b>The</b> extent of these changes in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> fiber are assumed to include changes in fiber size or fiber number or both.

50|$|The mechanomyogram (MMG) is the {{mechanical}} signal observable {{from the surface}} of a <b>muscle</b> when <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> is contracted. At <b>the</b> onset of <b>muscle</b> contraction, gross changes in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> shape cause a large peak in the MMG. Subsequent vibrations are due to oscillations of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> fibres at <b>the</b> resonance frequency of <b>the</b> <b>muscle.</b> <b>The</b> mechanomyogram is also known as the phonomyogram, acoustic myogram, sound myogram, vibromyogram or muscle sound.|$|R
5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{relatively}} large insects, the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) have the flight muscles attached directly to their wings; the wings can beat no {{faster than the}} rate at which nerves can send impulses to command <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> to beat. All other living winged insects fly using a different mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles which cause the thorax to vibrate; the wings can beat faster than {{the rate at which}} <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> receive nerve impulses. This mechanism evolved once, and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera.|$|E
5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows {{down to one}} or two beats a minute, and blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Force-velocity relationship: {{right of}} the {{vertical}} axis concentric contractions (<b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> is shortening), left of the axis eccentric contractions (<b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> is lengthened under load); power developed by <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> in red.|$|R
50|$|Muscle contractions can be {{described}} based on two variables: force and length. Force itself can be differentiated as either tension or load. <b>Muscle</b> tension is <b>the</b> force exerted by <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> on an object whereas a load is the force exerted by an object on <b>the</b> <b>muscle.</b> When muscle tension changes without any corresponding changes in <b>muscle</b> length, <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction is described as isometric. If <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> length changes while <b>muscle</b> tension remains <b>the</b> same, then <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction is isotonic. In an isotonic contraction, <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> length can either shorten to produce a concentric contraction or lengthen to produce an eccentric contraction. Furthermore, if <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> length shortens, <b>the</b> contraction is concentric. But if <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> length lengthens, then the contraction is eccentric. In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as {{they are able to}} produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner. Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain constant when <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> is active during locomotor activity.|$|R

5|$|Early on, Lull {{postulated}} that the frills may {{have served as}} anchor points for the jaw muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and thus power for <b>the</b> <b>muscles.</b> This has been put forward by other authors over the years, but later studies do not find evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E
5|$|Exercise also {{increases}} the respiratory rate, partly {{in response to}} the movement of the limbs detected by proprioceptors in <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> and joints, an increase in body temperature, the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) from the adrenal glands, and from motor impulses originating from the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|Impaired {{muscle power}} – With {{impairments}} in this category, the force generated by muscles, such as <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of one limb, {{one side of}} the body or {{the lower half of the}} body is reduced, (e.g. spinal cord injury, spina bifida, post-polio syndrome).|$|E
50|$|Delayed stretch {{activation}} {{and delayed}} shortening deactivation allow asynchronous muscles to generate positive work under cyclic oscillations. When <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> shortens, force drops and continues dropping even when <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> length remains constant. Similarly, when <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> lengthens, force increases and continues increasing after <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> length remains constant. Because of these delays, the work produced by <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> during shortening {{is greater than}} the work absorbed during lengthening, therefore producing positive work. In contrast, synchronous muscles absorb work under similar conditions. Both types of muscles consume ATP to drive force production and produce work.|$|R
50|$|Action {{potentials}} {{from the}} central nervous system cause end-plate potentials at the NMJ which causes sodium ions to enter and depolarise <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> cells. This depolarisation propagates to the T-tubules where it triggers the entry of calcium ions via Cav1.1 {{as well as from the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum through the associated ryanodine receptor RyR1. This causes contraction (tensing) of <b>the</b> <b>muscle.</b> Depolarisation of <b>the</b> motor end plate causes potassium ions to leave <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> cells, repolarising <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> and closing <b>the</b> calcium channels. Calcium is pumped away from the contractile apparatus and <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> relaxes.|$|R
50|$|When a <b>muscle</b> lengthens, <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> spindle is {{stretched}} and its nerve activity increases. This increases alpha motor neuron activity, causing <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> fibers to contract and thus resist the stretching. A secondary set of neurons also causes <b>the</b> opposing <b>muscle</b> to relax. <b>The</b> reflex functions to maintain <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> {{at a constant}} length.|$|R

5|$|The {{anatomy of}} <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> and {{skeleton}} {{is described in}} the Hippocratic Corpus, an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors. Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection. Praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins.

5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers {{travel in the}} vagus nerve to supply <b>the</b> <b>muscles.</b> The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance {{the function of the}} vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
30|$|Muscle {{force was}} {{normalized}} to tissue cross-sectional area, calculated by the algorithm: [muscle mass/(fiber length × 1.056)], where <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> mass is <b>the</b> weight of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> strip, <b>the</b> fiber length is the L 0, and 1.056  g/cm 3 is <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> density [27].|$|R
50|$|In {{eccentric}} contraction, {{the tension}} generated {{is insufficient to}} overcome the external load on <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> and <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> fibers lengthen as they contract. Rather than working to pull a joint {{in the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction, <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> acts to decelerate the joint {{at the end of a}} movement or otherwise control the repositioning of a load. This can occur involuntarily (e.g., when attempting to move a weight too heavy for <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> to lift) or voluntarily (e.g., when <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> is 'smoothing out' a movement). Over the short-term, strength training involving both eccentric and concentric contractions appear to increase muscular strength more than training with concentric contractions alone. However, exercise-induced muscle damage is also greater during lengthening contractions.|$|R

5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. <b>The</b> <b>muscles</b> of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically involves <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of {{the proximal}} {{arms and legs}} (<b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. <b>The</b> <b>muscles</b> which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E
50|$|Muscle contractions can be {{described}} based on two variables: length and tension. A muscle contraction is described as isometric if <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> tension changes but <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> length remains <b>the</b> same.

50|$|Action {{potentials}} {{from the}} central nervous system cause end-plate potentials at the NMJ which causes sodium ions to enter by Nav1.4 and depolarise <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> cells.
