5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets {{form in the}} inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains. This results in coagulation of purely rocky grains {{and later in the}} formation of rocky planetesimals. Such conditions are thought <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner 3–4AU part of the disk of a Sun-like star.|$|E
5|$|Electrons {{are thought}} <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Universe since {{early stages of}} the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei forms in {{nucleosynthesis}} reactions.

5|$|In the mid-16thcentury Henry VIII of England {{dissolved}} the monasteries, {{resulting in}} the large areas of land owned by Meaux Abbey, Bridlington Priory and other monastic holdings being confiscated. The Crown subsequently sold these large tracts of land into private ownership. Along with the land already belonging to lay owners, they formed some of the vast estate holdings which continued <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Riding until the 20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} why this {{hurricane}} went unnamed, {{even though it}} clearly met the criteria for doing so. Any statement about why is purely speculative at this point. The hurricane is the furthest north a tropical cyclone existed in the Eastern Pacific, and is also the northernmost existence for a Pacific hurricane. It was the only tropical cyclone <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Pacific this year. No damage or casualties were reported, although it did hassle a few ships.|$|E
5|$|Six {{vascular}} {{plants are}} {{unique in that}} they are at the extreme edge of their range or are disjunct from the main range of their species. They are the Maidenhair spleenwort (Asplenium trichomanes L.), in Minnesota six small populations of 20 to 40 plants have been found in the Rove area; Ross's (or Short) sedge (Carex rossii), only three populations are known <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rove area; Large-leaved sandwort (Moehringia macrophylla or Arenaria macrophylla), evidence indicates {{that this is a very}} rare species with limited distribution and restrictive environmental needs; Sticky locoweed (Oxytropis borealis var. viscida), is restricted to a single cliff in Cook County; Encrusted saxifrage (Saxifraga paniculata ssp. neogaea), 11 populations are known <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rove formation; and Smooth Woodsia (Woodsia glabella), there are small, isolated populations in the Rove Formation.|$|E

5|$|Addax {{are easy}} to hunt due to their slow movements. Roadkill, {{firearms}} for easy hunting and nomadic settlements near waterholes (their dry-season feeding places) have also decreased numbers. Moreover, their meat and leather are highly prized. Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, habitat destruction due to more human settlements and agriculture. Less than 500 individuals are thought <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild today, most of the animals being found between the Termit area of Niger, the Bodélé region of western Chad, and the Aoukar in Mauritania.|$|E
5|$|Alice formed {{later in}} the {{calendar}} year than any Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, forming six hours {{later in the}} season than Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Alice was one of only eight Atlantic tropical cyclones to form in the month of December. Alice was the first of two Atlantic tropical cyclones to exist in two calendar years, the other being 2005's Zeta. The hurricane was also one of only six tropical or subtropical cyclones <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> month of January and the strongest to do so.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, {{was discovered in}} a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.|$|E

5|$|Municipalities {{have the}} right to decentralize {{themselves}} and form submunicipalities as an additional level of government. This right and the submunicipalities will cease <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future {{to reduce the number of}} levels of government. Only Amsterdam, where the districts are called stadsdelen, and Rotterdam, where the districts are called deelgemeenten, consist of such formal subdivisions. The Hague, Almere, Breda, Eindhoven, Enschede, Groningen, Nijmegen and Utrecht have instituted stadsdelen as well, although they do not have the same legal submunicipal status. For administrative use by municipalities and data collection by Statistics Netherlands all municipalities are subdivided into districts (wijken), which in turn are subdivided into neighbourhoods (buurten). These subdivisions have, in contrast to the submunicipalities, no formal status. , the municipalities in the Netherlands were subdivided into 2,621 districts and 11,896 neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|Northwest African cheetah (A. j. hecki) (Hilzheimer, 1913): Also {{called the}} Saharan cheetah. Found in northwestern Africa; the IUCN {{confirms}} {{its presence in}} only four countries: Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. Small populations are known <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ahaggar and Tassili N'Ajjer National Parks (Algeria); a 2003 study estimated a population of 20 to 40 individuals in Ahaggar National Park. In Niger, cheetahs have been reported from the Aïr Mountains, Ténéré, Termit Massif, Talak and Azaouak valley. A 1993 study reported a population of 50 from Ténéré. In Benin, the cheetah still survives in Pendjari National Park and W National Park. The status is obscure in Burkina Faso, where individuals may be confined to the southeastern region. With the total world population estimated at less than 250 mature individuals, it is listed as Critically Endangered.|$|E
5|$|The Society for Human Rights was an American LGBT Rights {{organization}} {{established in}} Chicago in 1924. Society founder Henry Gerber {{was inspired to}} create it by German Doctor Magnus Hirschfeld and his work with the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. It was the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States, having received a charter {{from the state of}} Illinois, and produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. A few months after being chartered, the group ceased <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the arrest of several of the Society's members. Despite its short existence and small size, the Society has been recognized as a precursor to the modern gay liberation movement.|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{evolved from}} the merger of the armies of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania following the 1569 Union of Lublin, which formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The army was commanded by the Hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The most unique formation of the army was the heavy cavalry {{in the form of}} the Polish winged hussars. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy never played a major role in the military structure, and ceased <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-17th century.|$|E
5|$|The present-day Mikea are not {{a remnant}} of an ancient Malagasy {{hunter-gatherer}} society, but are instead descendants of individuals who took refuge in the forest beginning in the 1800s to escape military conflict, heavy taxation and other oppressive factors. Their {{way of life is}} perceived by villagers and city dwellers alike as ancestral, contributing to a mystique about them that has inspired various myths and legends. They are commonly believed to be the mythical Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view.

5|$|Tropical Storm Ana was {{the first}} of two named {{tropical}} cyclones, along with Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017, on record in the North Atlantic basin <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> month of April. The first tropical cyclone of the 2003 season, it developed as a subtropical cyclone from a non-tropical low on April 20 to the west of Bermuda. It tracked east-southeastward and organized, and on April 21 it transitioned into a tropical cyclone with peak winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Ana turned east-northeastward, steadily weakening due to wind shear and an approaching cold front, and on April 24 it became an extratropical cyclone. The storm brushed Bermuda with light rain, and the remnants produced precipitation in the Azores and the United Kingdom. Swells generated by the storm capsized a boat along the Florida coastline, causing two fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the Conservancy worked to {{preserve}} the San Clemente Island goat, a rare Spanish-descended breed from California. In 1991, it added genetic material from the San Clemente to their genetic database, later transferred to the National Animal Germplasm Program. As of June 2010, the organization {{was working on the}} rescue of a group of feral Spanish goats from an island in South Carolina. There are less than 2,500 members of the breed in the United States, and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeastern US. Conservancy members first made trips to the island to document and photograph the herd of around 30 goats, then undertook action to remove some goats from the island to preserve the bloodlines from threatened extinction. A small flock was established in a nature preserve just south of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, and as of June 2010 plans were in place for satellite herds to be established.|$|E
