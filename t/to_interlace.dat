60|$|It may {{be argued}} that {{as a matter of}} fact {{humanity}} has until recently been segregated in pools; that in the great civilization of China, for example, humanity has pursued its own interlacing system of inheritances without admixture from other streams of blood. But such considerations only defer the conclusion; they do not stave it off indefinitely. It needs only that one philoprogenitive Chinaman should have wandered into those regions that are now Russia, about the time of Pericles, to link east and west in that matter; one Tartar chieftain in the Steppes may have given a daughter to a Roman soldier and sent his grandsons east and west <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> the branches of every family tree in the world. If any race stands apart it is such an isolated group as that of the now extinct Tasmanian primitives or the Australian black. But even here, in the remote dawn of navigation, may have come some shipwrecked Malays, or some half-breed woman kidnapped by wandering Phoenicians have carried this link of blood back to the western world. The more one lets one's imagination play upon the incalculable drift and soak of population, the more one realizes the true value of that spreading relation with the past.|$|E

[p.89]strip of {{pale blue}} sky above {{scarcely}} reveals three ells of breadth: {{in many places}} the interval is less: here the copings meet, and there the outriggings of the houses seem <b>to</b> <b>interlace.</b> Now they are parted by a pencil of snowy sheen, then by a flood of silvery splendour; while under the projecting cornices and the huge hanging balcony-windows of fantastic wood-work, supported by gigantic brackets and corbels, and under deep verandahs, and gateways, vast enough for Behemoth to pass through, and in blind wynds and long cul-de-sacs, lie patches of thick darkness, made visible by the dimmest of oil lamps. The arch is a favourite feature: in one place you see it a mere skeleton-rib opening into some huge deserted hall; in another the ogre is full of fretted stone and wood carved like lace-work. Not a line is straight, the tall dead walls of the Mosques slope over their massy buttresses, and the thin minarets seem about to fall across your path. The cornices project crookedly from the houses, while the great gables stand merely by force of cohesion. And that the Line of Beauty may not be wanting, the graceful bending form of the palm, on whose topmost feathers, quivering in the cool night breeze, the moonbeam glistens, springs from a gloomy mound, or from the darkness of a mass of houses almost level with the ground. Briefly, the whole view is so strange, so fantastic, so ghostly, that it seems preposterous to imagine that in such places human beings like ourselves can be born, and live through life, and carry out the command [...] "increase and multiply," [...] and die.|$|E
60|$|The Indians, {{along the}} lower Columbia {{as far as}} the Cascades and on the lower Willamette, died off very fast during the year I spent in that section; for besides {{acquiring}} the vices of the white people they had acquired also their diseases. The measles and the small-pox were both amazingly fatal. In their wild state, before the appearance of the white man among them, the principal complaints they were subject to were those produced by long involuntary fasting, violent exercise in pursuit of game, and over-eating. Instinct more than reason had taught them a remedy for these ills. It was the steam bath. Something like a bake-oven was built, large enough to admit a man lying down. Bushes were stuck in the ground in two rows, about six feet long and some two or three feet apart; other bushes connected the rows at one end. The tops of the bushes were drawn together <b>to</b> <b>interlace,</b> and confined in that position; the whole was then plastered over with wet clay until every opening was filled. Just inside the open end of the oven the floor was scooped out so as to make a hole that would hold a bucket or two of water. These ovens were always built on the banks of a stream, a big spring, or pool of water. When a patient required a bath, a fire was built near the oven and a pile of stones put upon it. The cavity at the front was then filled with water. When the stones were sufficiently heated, the patient would draw himself into the oven; a blanket would be thrown over the open end, and hot stones put into the water until the patient could stand it no longer. He was then withdrawn from his steam bath and doused into the cold stream near by. This treatment may have answered with the early ailments of the Indians. With the measles or small-pox it would kill every time.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} weaving can be {{simplified}} {{to a series}} of four steps: the shed is raised, the shuttle is passed through, the shed is closed, and the weft thread is beaten into place. These steps are then repeated, with a different set of threads being raised so as <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> the warp and weft.|$|E

50|$|In general, weaving {{involves}} using a loom <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> {{two sets}} of threads {{at right angles to}} each other: the warp which runs longitudinally and the weft (older woof) that crosses it. One warp thread is called an end and one weft thread is called a pick. The warp threads are held taut and in parallel to each other, typically in a loom. There are many types of looms.|$|E

50|$|The ATSC {{specification}} and MPEG-2 {{allow the}} use of progressive frames coded within an interlaced video sequence. For example, NBC stations transmit a 1080i60 video sequence, meaning the formal output of the MPEG-2 decoding process is sixty 540-line fields per second. However, for prime-time television shows, those 60 fields can be coded using 24 progressive frames as a base - actually, an 1080p24 video stream (a sequence of 24 progressive frames per second) is transmitted, and MPEG-2 metadata instructs the decoder <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> these fields and perform 3:2 pulldown before display, as in soft telecine.|$|E
50|$|For {{material}} that originates from a progressive scanned 24 frame/s source (such as film), MPEG-2 lets the video be coded as 1080p24, {{irrespective of the}} final output format. These progressively-coded frames are tagged with metadata (literally, fields of the PICTURE header) instructing a decoder how to perform a 3:2 pulldown <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> them. While the formal output of the MPEG-2 decoding process from such stations is 1080i60, the actual content is coded as 1080p24 and {{can be viewed as}} such (using a process known as inverse telecine) since no information is lost even when the broadcaster performs the 3:2 pulldown.|$|E

50|$|In weaving, {{the shed}} is the {{temporary}} separation between {{upper and lower}} warp yarns through which the weft is woven. The shed is created {{to make it easy}} <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> the weft into the warp and thus create woven fabric. Most types of looms have some sort of device which separates some of the warp threads from the others. This separation is called the shed, and allows for a shuttle carrying the weft thread to move through the shed perpendicular to the warp threads. Which threads are raised and which are lowered are changed after each pass of the shuttle.|$|E

50|$|The ATSC {{specification}} and MPEG-2 {{allow the}} use of progressive frames, even within an interlaced video sequence. For example, a station that transmits 1080i60 video sequence can use a coding method where those 60 fields are coded with 24 progressive frames and metadata instructs the decoder <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> them and perform 3:2 pulldown before display. This allows broadcasters to switch between 60 Hz interlaced (news, soap operas) and 24 Hz progressive (prime-time) content without ending the MPEG-2 sequence and introducing a several seconds of delay as the TV switches formats. This {{is the reason why}} 1080p30 and 1080p24 sequences allowed by the ATSC specification are not used in practice.|$|E

50|$|Moiré {{patterns}} are commonly {{seen on television}} screens {{when a person is}} wearing a shirt or jacket of a particular weave or pattern, such as a houndstooth jacket. This is due <b>to</b> <b>interlaced</b> scanning in televisions and non-film cameras, referred to as interline twitter. As the person moves about, the Moiré pattern is quite noticeable.

5000|$|Also {{covered by}} the term is the visual art of the Celtic Revival (on the whole more notable for literature) from the 18th century to the modern era, which began as a {{conscious}} effort by Modern Celts, mostly in the British Isles, to express self-identification and nationalism, and became popular well beyond the Celtic nations, and whose style is still current in various popular forms, from Celtic cross funerary monuments <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> tattoos. Coinciding with {{the beginnings of a}} coherent archaeological understanding of the earlier periods, the style self-consciously used motifs closely copied from works of the earlier periods, more often the Insular than the Iron Age. Another influence was that of late La Tène [...] "vegetal" [...] art on the Art Nouveau movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{crafting}} process incorporates {{three basic}} stages: spinning, weaving, and embellishing. Using a hand spindle, a weaver spins coton, camelid fiber, or sheep's wool into a thread and then twists or piles {{two or more}} spun threads together to strengthen the yarn. When she has spun and piled enough yarn, the weaver turns to her loom. Horizontal ground looms are particularly common in the southern Andes, {{where most of the}} chuspas are made. Once the weaver has wraped the loom by continuously wrapping a length of yarn in a figure-eight around the bars {{at each end of the}} loom, she can begin <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> the weft threads into the warp to create a structure. Although plain weave is the simplest and most common, weavers use a range of more complex weaving techniques in order to achieve the elaborate designs seen in chuspas and other Andean cloth.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also an}} additional, abrupt {{change at}} Leviticus 13:47, between {{discussion}} of leprosy, and of leprosy of clothing (mildew), only presenting part of a sentence, devoid of any verb clause — ... without the camp shall his habitation be. The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be of types of garment. And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment .... Thus, taking this as another border, in critical scholarship, Leviticus 13:1-46 represents a distinct text to Leviticus 13:47-59. This latter text, discussing mildew, noticeably appears to interrupt Leviticus 13:1-14:32, discussing leprosy, since prior to it is a law ordering that a leper be sent out of the camp to dwell alone, and after the mildew section is a law instructing priests {{to go out of}} the camp and inspect the leper to see if they are yet healed. Consequently, Leviticus 13:1-46 and 14:2-32 are viewed as one, original, text into which the mildew section was inserted at a later date. Another section of the priestly code which is considered, by critical scholars, <b>to</b> <b>interlace</b> two earlier sources, is Leviticus 16. The ritual of the two goats, one being a scapegoat sent to Azazel, as a ritual to atone for sin as a nation, is given before, rather than within, instructions laying out how to observe Yom Kippur, leading to arguments that there were originally two separate sources describing this event. Further study on this question lead to the suggestion, supported by a majority of critical scholars, that there were two originally separate rituals which have been intertwined, one involving the two goats, at Leviticus 16:5, 16:7-10, and 16:14-28, and the other involving bullocks, constituting the remainder of Leviticus 16.|$|E
5000|$|Sony adapted HDV, {{originally}} {{conceived as}} progressive-scan format by JVC, <b>to</b> <b>interlaced</b> video. Interlaced video {{has been a}} useful compromise for decades due to its ability to display motion smoothly while reducing recording and transmission bandwidth. Interlaced video is still being used in acquisition and broadcast, but interlaced display devices are being phased out. Modern flat-panel television sets that utilize plasma and LCD technology are inherently progressive. All modern computer monitors use progressive scanning as well.|$|R
