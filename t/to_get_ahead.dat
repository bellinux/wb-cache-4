5|$|During Q3, contested {{by the top}} ten, Hamilton just {{beat his}} {{teammate}} to pole position, with a time set during his first timed lap. Both Ferrari drivers ran their first lap on used tyres {{in order to save}} one set for the race. In their second outing, Vettel was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead</b> of the two Williams cars of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, while teammate Kimi Räikkönen struggled with the handling of his car {{in the first part of}} the track to finish sixth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark {{were behind}} on the series from the start. After several late issues, the team announced a four-month hiatus between issues 21 and 22 to allow Lark <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule. They {{said they would not}} solicit any additional issues until the next story arc was completed, and the hiatus actually lasted six months, in part because of miscommunication between Image Comics and Diamond Distribution. During the hiatus, they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five months passed between the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandatory}} pit stops, {{during which}} all drivers {{need to change}} into a second car, started on lap 17. Everyone came in at this point except the two NEXTEV TCR drivers Piquet and Charles Pic. D'Ambrosio managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead</b> of Buemi into second place thanks to swift work from his crew. Piquet benefited from his late stop by moving ahead into eighth after everyone had pitted and having more power left to use {{towards the end of}} the race. Heidfeld ran into additional trouble during the second half of the race, losing two positions during the final laps to both Loïc Duval (Dragon Racing) and the fast running Piquet, who managed to finish fifth from thirteenth on the grid, even closing on Duval on the final lap. Meanwhile, di Grassi won comfortably from d'Ambrosio, the gap being more than twelve seconds.|$|E

5|$|At {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead</b> of Bottas, who made pit stops {{simultaneously}} with Nico Rosberg on lap 29. Another two laps later, Vettel made a pit stop and emerged behind Rosberg, who claimed second, about ten seconds down on Hamilton, who made a pit stop on lap 32. Bottas was briefly challenged by the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, but Grosjean went off track on lap 33, while Will Stevens received a five-second penalty for speeding in the pit lane. On lap 43, Marcus Ericsson overtook Pérez for 12th and two laps later, Verstappen moved ahead of teammate Sainz for ninth. Pérez lost another position to Kvyat on lap 45. Another lap later, Stevens went into a spin while fighting for position with Alexander Rossi, who finished ahead of his more experienced teammate for the second race in a row. By lap 49, Kvyat moved ahead of Ericsson as well to claim 13th position. Two laps from the end, Felipe Nasr became the first retirement of the race, albeit he would be classified in last, four laps behind the winner. Lewis Hamilton took victory comfortably, finishing 18.9 seconds ahead of Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} in Prince Rainier III of Monaco's Royal box to collect their trophies {{and in the}} subsequent press conference. Coulthard was delighted as securing victory at the Grand Prix which he considered {{as one of the}} races he wanted to win during his career because of the challenges the drivers take on the circuit. He also commented that he wanted to wait until the pit stop stages <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead</b> of Michael Schumacher and Trulli to prevent unnecessary repairs to his car. Barrichello revealed that he was conserving his tyres and fuel, as well as being informed by Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn to reduce his pace towards the race's latter stages. Fisichella said that he was pleased at taking third place. He also revealed that he wanted to remain at Benetton for the 2001 season after his strong result.|$|E
5|$|Vandoorne {{remained}} with his intended strategy {{and led the}} field back up to speed at the lap-nine restart, ahead of Haryanto and Leal. He fended off an attempted overtake by Haryanto heading into the first corner, while Leal fell to fifth after he was passed by Matsushita and Visoiu. While in traffic, Lynn attempted to pass Rossi heading into the first turn, but made contact with the rear-end {{of his car and}} sustained front wing damage. Rossi pushed hard and moved ahead of Amberg by the twelfth lap. He caught up to Stanaway and quickly overtook him, and passed Berthon with the use of DRS two laps later. Rossi made further use of the system <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead</b> of de Jong and Markelov. It allowed him to build a large gap to Lynn who was struggling. Rossi overtook Leal to move into fifth on lap 15, and the drivers who were running {{in the middle of the}} field made their mandatory tyre pit stops. Evans overtook Lynn driving into turn one on the 18th lap. Lynn reported that his car had tyre degradation problems and dropped down the running order, while cars who conserved their tyres took advantage.|$|E

50|$|The Battle of Aldbourne Chase, in 1643, was {{a battle}} of the First English Civil War, in which a flying column of Royalist troops, led by Prince Rupert, {{attacked}} the dangerously extended Parliamentarian troops of Essex's army at Aldbourne Chase in Wiltshire. The action that followed was inconclusive, but allowed the Royalists <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Newbury <b>ahead</b> of the Parliamentarian army.|$|R
5|$|After {{the failed}} action, the Swedish fleet {{anchored}} off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies {{at least until}} they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead</b> of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail close-hauled faster {{than the rest of the}} force and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, taking up the crucial weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed in on each other and were soon within firing range.|$|E
5|$|De Ferran {{gained the}} lead and {{maintained}} it at the lap-104 restart. Bräck attempted to pass de Ferran around {{the outside of the}} first turn for first place but was unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead.</b> De Ferran pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Dixon drove into the pit lane and became the race's fifth (and final) retirement on the 106th lap. His pit crew claimed his car was damaged following contact with Servià during the caution period. Kanaan was closely following Andretti but was held up by the driver which allowed Paul Tracy to pass him. The move caused Kannan's car to develop understeer and Vasser got ahead of him. Carpentier set the race's fastest lap during the 134th lap, completing a circuit in 25.521 seconds. On lap 138, Bräck drafted off slower cars while de Ferran was slowed by Papis in turn four. Bräck got ahead of de Ferran around the outside driving into the first turn to take over the lead on the same lap. On the final lap, Bräck led de Ferran by two-tenths of a second. As the two drivers went onto the backstraight, De Ferran drafted up to the outside of Bräck and closed up to him in the second and third corners. De Ferran steered right and overtook Bräck for the lead in the fourth turn's entrance. Both drivers avoided making contact at the corner's edge and de Ferran drove defensively causing Bräck to reduce his speed to avoid colliding with him.|$|E
5|$|Franchitti {{gained the}} lead and held it at the lap-180 restart. Junqueira {{attempted}} to pass Servià around the inside for fourth position but was unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead.</b> Carpentier attempted to pressure da Matta {{towards the end of}} the race but it was difficult to overtake and he did not want to be very aggressive and run off the racing line. Vasser set the race's fastest lap during the 210th (and penultimate) lap, competing a circuit of 25.217 seconds. Franchitti maintained the lead for the remainder of the race and crossed the start-finish line after 211 laps to win the race. Da Matta was second, ahead of Carpentier in third, Servià was fourth and Junqueira fifth. Takagi, Vasser, Bräck, Manning, and Andretti rounded out the top ten finishers. Jourdain, Dixon, and Domínguez were the last of the classified finishers. It was Franchitti's third (and final) victory of the season, his first win on an oval track in CART, and the tenth (and final) of his career. There were nine lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Bräck's total of 134 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Franchitti led three times, for a total of 58 laps.|$|E

5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead</b> in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{began to}} {{gradually}} {{pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Fisichella to take 14th place on lap two. Barrichello overtook Häkkinen at the Ostkurve corner to move into third one lap later. Further down the field, Button lost 13th position when he was passed by Panis on the same lap. On lap five, Panis made up a further position as he overtook Zonta for twelfth, while Bernoldi passed Button to take 14th. Barrichello moved into second position after he overtook Michael Schumacher at the Senna chicane on lap six. On the same lap, Zonta went into the rear of Verstappen's car, causing Zonta to lose his front wing. Verstappen fell behind Panis after the collision. Zonta made a pit stop for repairs, but retired after driving one exploratory lap. Verstappen made his pit stop and rejoined {{at the back of}} the field. Alesi passed Burti to move into 15th position on lap nine, and Panis overtook teammate Villeneuve for tenth place one lap later. On the tenth lap, Panis attempted to overtake Trulli for ninth by taking the inside line, but was unable to complete the manoveure. Panis again tried to pass Trulli but by taking the outside line on the next lap, although he could not execute the pass because of a lack of straightline speed. During the twelfth lap, Panis made his third attempt at passing Trulli and managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead</b> of the Italian. Trulli pulled into the slipstream of Panis, and attempted to reclaim the position but spun at the Ostkurve corner, and fell to 17th.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel slowly {{moved up}} the field, running {{eleventh}} on lap 18, only to spin a lap later at turn seven, falling back to 16th. He subsequently complained about a flat spot on his tyre, but continued without pitting. On lap 20, Sergio Pérez made a pit stop for new tyres and a front wing adjustment. Since the stop took longer than expected, he rejoined just before Sainz, Jr., who used the momentum to pass Pérez into turn one. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Bottas were racing for sixth place. On lap 24, Bottas attacked around the outside into turn two, sticking to the inside line at the following corner, where Räikkönen did not back away {{and ran into the}} front-left of the Williams, breaking his own rear-right suspension and forcing him to retire on the spot, while Bottas was able to carry on. Rosberg came in for his scheduled pit stop on lap 27, while Hamilton waited two laps to follow suit, trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead.</b> This proved unsuccessful, as he rejoined behind Rosberg after his stop on lap 29. On lap 35, Sergio Pérez attempted to overtake Carlos Sainz Jr. for ninth, who ran wide and kept his position. After his team radio informed him that he had done so by going off track, he handed the position to Pérez. Sebastian Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 37 and rejoined in between the two Mercedes of Rosberg and Hamilton, albeit a lap down. He was told to let Hamilton go by as well some laps later.|$|E

5|$|The race {{started at}} 2:23 p.m. Kvapil {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{on the first}} lap, as the field ran three and four abreast during the lap. Mike Wallace led the cars on the outside lane and challenged Kvapil for the lead on lap four, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ahead.</b> Edwards and Vickers drove on the outside lane {{to move to the}} front on lap nine, and the two exchanged the lead on the backstretch, before Edwards pulled clear of Vickers. Kvapil fell to seventh place by the same lap. Vickers regained the first position on the next lap, after Edwards drove down the track. On the 14th lap, Almirola and his teammate Menard gave each other assistance, and Almirola passed Vickers on the backstretch to take over the lead. Ragan, with assistance from Kvapil, passed Almirola for first place by taking the outside lane three laps later. After falling down the field earlier in the race, Gordon had moved back up to seventh by lap 18. Earnhardt moved into the lead eight laps later, but Kvapil reclaimed the position on lap 30, after receiving assistance from Gordon. Earnhardt retook the lead two laps later, and Johnson had moved to fourth after dropping down the field earlier in the race. Mike Wallace claimed the lead on lap 33. The first caution was triggered on the next lap when debris was spotted on the track. Most of the leaders, including Mike Wallace, made pit stops for tires and car adjustments.|$|E

Michael Schumacher began to immediately {{pull away from}} Häkkinen as he set consecutive fastest laps. Further down the field, Wurz overtook Diniz and Mazzacane for tenth position. By the start of lap 13, Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen by 2.1 seconds. Further back, Zonta passed Heidfeld to take ninth. On lap 14, Zonta moved up into seventh position after passing Gené and Wurz. Villeneuve became the third retirement of the race when he pulled {{over to the side}} of the track with gearbox problems on the same lap. Meanwhile, Verstappen overtook Fisichella to take fourth position. Heidfeld retired after his engine failed and spun off at Variante della Roggia chicane on lap 15. One lap later, Ralf Schumacher lost two positions after being passed by Verstappen and Zonta. Salo passed Mazzacane to claim ninth position on lap 17. At the start of the 19th lap, Zonta tried to pass Verstappen heading into the Variante Goodyear chicane, but Verstappen moved onto an early defensive line to prevent Zonta from moving ahead. Zonta attempted to overtake Verstappen into the Variante della Rogia chicane to take third place four laps later, but was unable to complete it as he ran wide.
