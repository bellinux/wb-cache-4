5|$|At the Pfullendorf heights, {{the fight}} began anew. Charles sent two strong columns of eight battalions each across the Ostrach stream. The French poured {{fire on the}} Austrians, who took heavy losses, but did not give up <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> night, Fürstenberg broke through the French line to Einhard, {{flanking}} Jourdan's main force and cutting off Saint Cyr. Further south, Wallis threatened {{to do the same}} to Fontaine and Ferino. As darkness fell, so ended the first day of fighting.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's {{offense was}} led by quarterback Woodrow Dantzler, who {{finished}} the regular season having completed 58 percent of his passes for 1,691 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He also ran the ball extremely successfully, gaining 947 yards and 13 touchdowns on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> running game, Dantzler had the second-most yards on the team. No. 1 was running back Travis Zachery, who ran 201 times for 1,012 yards and 13 touchdowns. Zachery also was one of Dantzler's favorite passing targets. He caught 27 passes for 288 {{yards and four touchdowns}} during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Muntz Street was readily {{accessible}} by public transport. In the early years, horse-drawn buses {{ran along the}} Coventry Road, linking Small Heath with the city centre and with other nearby districts. In 1882, {{the building of a}} tramline along the Coventry Road to Small Heath Park was authorised, and four years later, the Coventry Road steam tramway route was opened to a terminus near Dora Road, a few yards past <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early years of the 20th century, this line was converted for use by electric trams.|$|E

25|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> League {{are quite}} small. This fact, {{combined}} with traditionally good groundkeeping and wickets prepared primarily for batting makes for an exciting blend of cricket popular with supporters.|$|R
50|$|Humphry Repton was {{commissioned}} {{to lay out}} <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classical English landscape fashion, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lee of the hill upon which the mansion stands. Repton dammed the River Misbourne to form a lake.|$|R
5|$|The Sooner defense played {{extremely}} well in Waco, limiting Baylor to 148total yards and -48yards of rushing. That was the fewest yards Baylor had produced all season and their worst performance on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> program's history; {{it was also}} the second-best performance by an Oklahoma defense ever. Defensive back Reggie Smith also pulled down two interceptions, returning the first one 42yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The four-headed god Brahma {{should be}} shown seated on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{foreground}} officiating as the wedding priest and making offerings to the homa (sacred fire) in the kunda (fire-altar). The four-armed god holds a sruka and sruva (sacrificial ladle and spoon) in his front arms and a kamandalu (water-pot) and akshamala (rosary) {{in his back}} arms. The presence of the fire also indicates another important ritual of the Hindu wedding, saptapadi ("seven steps") where {{the bride and groom}} go around the fire seven times.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of civil}} {{conflict}} continued, however, and Parliament {{decided that it}} was necessary to slight, or damage so as to put beyond military use, the castle in 1652, as it remained a surprisingly powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur. The castle was virtually razed to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> operation, although a brick building continued {{to be used as a}} prison into the 18th century. A large house was built in the bailey in 1700, followed by a gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837.|$|E
50|$|A large 10 m {{diameter}} {{satellite dish}} was erected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s. It was later painted green (rather than white) {{to reduce its}} obtrusiveness. Shortwave aerials <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> house were removed.|$|R
50|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of demolition in 1869 it was purchased by the City merchant Charles Magniac, who considerably curtailed <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear, and erected a row of buildings overlooking Chesterfield Street, named Chesterfield Gardens.|$|R
50|$|A large fire {{destroyed}} the White City stadium in 1938. Remaining parts of <b>the</b> pleasure <b>ground</b> were demolished <b>in</b> 1945, and East Ella house in around 1951. Temporary housing was constructed on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post Second World War period (Arcon Drive, demolished and redeveloped 1977).|$|R
5|$|With the Observer Corps {{passing a}} steady stream of reports {{regarding}} approaching German formations they soon realised a coordinated attack was under way. The two Squadrons approaching the high-altitude attack could not be diverted and no fighters had been asked to engage the 9 Staffel. The only Squadron on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area was No. 111 Squadron RAF that had 12 Hurricanes at RAF Croydon. Although usually the responsibility of Park, the controllers took the matter into their own hands and ordered all aircraft into the air. Even those that were not in combat condition were flown north-east, to avoid them being caught on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt altered {{his story}} later on, telling John H. Flood {{that he did}} not see Brocius's pistol on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark until afterward. The pistol {{contained}} one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. Virgil and Wyatt escorted Brocius to Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from a lynching. White, age 31, died of his wound two days after his shooting.|$|E
5|$|A {{concrete}} wall was {{built at the}} Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1959, costing £14,500, {{a substantial part of}} which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8–2 before a crowd of 9,414.|$|E

5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three days the Ottomans {{continued}} to launch incessant and ultimately unsuccessful counterattacks in an effort to recapture the ground they had lost. In total three regiments were dispatched. The Australians also brought up reinforcements, moving up men from two battalions from the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades—the 7th and 12th Battalions—to hold the 1st Brigade's gains. Throughout 7 August, the fighting devolved into a series of hand grenade duels. To keep up the supply, Australians put about 50 soldiers to work at Anzac Cove manufacturing makeshift grenades out of empty jam tins: over 1,000 were sent up to the 1st Infantry Brigade late on 7 August. The fighting continued throughout the night of 7/8 August as the 47th Regiment, launched a determined counterattack; suffering heavy casualties, including the regimental commander, Tewfik Bey, the attack was unsuccessful in retaking the main front-line trenches, but succeeded in regaining some of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north and also pushed the Australians back a little way from The Cup.|$|E
5|$|Ganguly {{scored a}} century on Test debut, against England in Lord's in June 1996. He became the tenth Indian player {{to perform the}} feat, and the third player to score a century on debut at <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next match at Trent Bridge, he made 136 and became the third batsman to make a century {{in each of his}} first two innings. He is eighth in the list of leading Test century makers for India. His highest score of 239his only double centurywas made against Pakistan in 2007 at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore. He made centuries against all the Test-cricket playing nations except South Africa and the West Indies. His centuries have been scored in {{fourteen}} cricket grounds, including eight outside India. He ended up in the nineties on four occasions, including two scores of 99.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, American {{soldiers}} were billeted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hall and <b>in</b> nissen huts dotted around <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{times of the}} occupation by the Americans and other troops the Hall fell into disrepair and was demolished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s {{to make way for}} Marlborough Primary School and the Tytherington housing estate.|$|R

5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase {{of the project and}} the beginning of the concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E
5|$|In Lancashire's first innings, King bowled 27 overs {{and took}} 5 wickets for 46 runs. The Philadelphians passed Lancashire's first innings score, but their lead was quickly {{overtaken}} in Lancashire's second innings. With the wind strong over King's left shoulder, {{the scene was}} set for him to dominate the opposition. In his first over after the lunch break on day two of the match, he yorked one of Lancashire's opening batsmen and his replacement with successive balls. He clean bowled two more batsmen in his second over, and bowled a stump out of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third. In 3 overs, he had taken 5 wickets for 7 runs. After this performance, King had to be rested in the field. One batsman was run out before King returned to take 4 more wickets, ending the innings with 9 for 62. The Philadelphians won next morning by nine wickets.|$|E
5|$|In the 22ndminute, a lofted through-pass from Carrick found Rooney on {{the left}} wing, but the Liverpudlian's cross was blocked by Touré and {{went out for a}} corner kick. The corner, taken by Giggs, found Ronaldo, but the Portuguese got too far under the ball and headed over. Precise passing from the Barcelona midfield got the Catalans moving upfield until a {{shoulder}} charge from Anderson sent Iniesta stumbling to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inside-left channel 30yards from goal. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who sent the ball just wide of the near post. Another free kick followed, as Messi was bundled over by a double-challenge from Vidić and Carrick, but it came to nothing.|$|E

5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor {{and appears to be}} absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
5|$|During his convalescence, he {{was visited}} by the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Generalleutnant Adolf Galland, who offered Graf command {{of his old}} unit, JG52. Graf {{accepted}} {{with the proviso that}} his Roten Jäger football team went with him. Once criticized for its low scoring rate early in the war, it was now the pre-eminent Geschwader, with over 10,000 victories. His return was celebrated with a welcome dinner at its headquarters in Kraków, southern Poland, on 20 September 1944. He was officially appointed on 1 October. Ongoing weakness in his left arm kept Graf on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> two years since he had left the Eastern Front, {{the quantity and quality of}} the Soviet pilots had greatly improved, as had their equipment. For the remainder of the war he oversaw his three separated fighter groups shuttled up and down the front, in emergency responses to each new Soviet offensive. Several times the crews had to evacuate as Soviet tanks and artillery were shelling their airfield. The German fuel crisis severely curtailed the amount of flight-time. Consequently, the November total for the wing of only 369 Soviet aircraft shot down was the lowest monthly total of the eastern campaign. As the winter weather got worse, the lull allowed Graf to organise a football match between his Roten Jäger and a local Kraków team, watched by 20,000 German soldiers.|$|E
