It constitutes a triad, a tale in three chapters where the new-born spirit of ages past acts as a protagonist." [...] Music critic Tom O'Boyle has described some of the album's central themes as being [...] "human nature {{in the face of}} mythological enormity; a <b>tranformation</b> of the flaws of body and soul; and a thirst for seeking knowledge of the unknown forces that evade us." [...] Jones also explains that [...] "I believe the present is in dire need of the hero figure - the inspiration; the igniter of emotions, of will and motivation and passion." [...] Structurally, the album is [...] "modelled after the nine-folded existential domain in Norse mythology. It revolves around a heroic cycle, and my idea was to bind this together in a conceptual valknut." [...] As a result, the album is [...] "a saga of six acts, full songs paired in threes with an intermission between." [...] The first, fifth, and final tracks represent [...] "beings from Norse mythology called Norns, the old Scandinavian equivalent of what are generally called Fates - female entities who spin the web of human fate. Each Norn is represented by a triangle on the thematic valknut. The three Fates predict what's happening to the hero throughout his life-span, from birth to death. Or rebirth to death rather, now that I'm working with Nietzschean principles again." ...|$|E
