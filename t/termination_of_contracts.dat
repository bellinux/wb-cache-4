40|$|RESUME The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to provide a}} general {{description}} of the purpose, functions and principles governing the right to unilaterally terminate a contract under Czech law. The main part of the thesis provides overview of the provisions of the new Civil Code regarding <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> describing the conditions for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract,</b> limitations on contractual freedom to agree upon grounds for the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract,</b> prerequisites <b>of</b> the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> and the legal consequences to the rights and obligations of the contractual parties following successful <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> The thesis differentiates between the following generally applicable grounds for the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the contract: (i) a material breach of contract; (ii) a breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> (whether material or immaterial) constituting delay within the meaning of the new Civil Code, (iii) fulfilment of specific obligation with defects and (iv) anticipatory breach <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> Each ground for termination is analysed in detail and the overlaps of the specific grounds for termination is identified. The thesis further introduces selected interpretation difficulties connected with the new Civil Code and suggests possible solutions to these issues, taking into account the purpose of the provisions [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The {{nationalisation}} of the {{lex mercatoria}} did not neglect the practises of merchants or their trans-border trade. Some institutions continued to function, and state judges also were appointed for their merchant expertise, just as modern commercial arbitrators. The {{laws of the}} merchants were not eradicated, but simply codified. National codes built on the principles laid down by trade commercial practise and {{to a large extent}} they embodied lex mercatoria substantial rules. This was for example the case in France. The Code Commercial was issued in 1807, where lex mercatoria rules were preserved to govern formation, performance and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> In effect, the nation states reconstituted the lex mercatoria in their image.|$|E

50|$|The 1996 Farm Bill did {{not make}} many changes to the CRP. The major change made was in {{relation}} to early termination of CRP contracts. This bill allowed the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> after five years, {{with the exception of}} filterstrips, waterways, strips adjacent to riparian areas; lands with an erodibility index of over 15; and other lands that the Secretary deems to be highly sensitive 7. Also, cropping history became a part of the eligibility system used to determine if a piece of land should be enrolled into the CRP. Land was deemed eligible for CRP if it was cropped two of the last five years and meets {{at least one of the}} following requirements: had an erodibility index of eight or higher; was considered a cropped wetland; was associated with or surrounds non-cropped wetlands; was devoted to a highly beneficial environmental practice (for example, filter strips); was subject to scour erosion; was located in national or state CRP conservation priority areas; or was marginal pastureland in riparian areas 7. Other changes came in the form of appropriation bills. The Appropriations Bill of 2001 provided an exception to the requirement that the owner plant vegetative cover when excessive rainfall or flooding made planting impossible and the Appropriations Bill of 2002 created a new pilot program for enrollment of wetland and buffer acreage in CRP 7.|$|E
5000|$|In 1918, {{after the}} end of World War I and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> for both the P14 and M1917, Remington was left with two {{factories}} (the main factory at Ilion and a subsidiary at Eddystone) tooled up to make the M1917, and was also left with a large inventory of stored spare parts. [...] It was decided to make a sporting version of the P14-M1917 model rifles at the Ilion plant. In 1921, Remington introduced the Model 30 High Power sporting rifle in caliber 30-06 Springfield. Early models differed from the military rifles by deleting the prominent rear sight protection ears and machining the receiver bridge to the same diameter as the receiver ring, and straightening the floorplate. These changes made for a better-looking rifle but magazine capacity was reduced from 6 to 5 rounds. The barrel was of the military profile but shortened slightly to 24". The barreled action was placed into a sporter type stock of plain American black walnut with a schnabel fore-end and a steel buttplate grooved to prevent slipping. A simple receiver aperture sight was fitted to the receiver bridge by a dovetail. This sight was soon discontinued and replaced with one mounted further forward on the barrel band. The Mauser-type cock-on-closing feature, and the double-stage military-type trigger were retained. In 1926, the stock was refined with a higher and thicker comb. A crossbolt was added, and checkering of the pistol grip and fore-end became standard. There was a deluxe Model 30S made 1930-32 with a better designed and chequered stock, a Lyman 48 receiver type sight called Model 30 Express.|$|E
