40|$|Rhabdomyolysis is {{a serious}} {{clinical}} state which may lead to electrolyte imbalance, compartment syndrome, disseminated intravasculer coagulation and peripheral neuropathy in addition to acute renal failure and hyperpotasemia due to joining intracelluler materials to systemic circulation {{as a result of}} muscle destruction.

40|$|Objective: To {{present an}} unusual case of {{spontaneous}} pneumomediastinum subsequent to recreational amphetamine use. Case report: A young African American adult male {{was admitted to}} internal medicine service for <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> secondary to methamphetamine use. On admission, he was complaining of chest pain in addition to nausea and generalized muscle aches. By his second hospital day, chest pain had resolved yet physical exam demonstrated crepitation of the anterior chest and left axilla. Portable chest x-ray revealed subcutaneous emphysema in addition to pneumomediastinum. Conclusion: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a rare complication of amphetamine use that {{is often associated with}} subcutaneous emphysema and can be diagnosed with chest x-ray.

40|$|Purpose. Fluid therapy {{aimed at}} {{increasing}} urine output is a commonly employed strategy to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients with rhabdomyolysis. Automated fluid management {{has the potential}} to optimise urine output while avoiding fluid accumulation in rhabdomyolysis patients. Methods. In a single centre clinical service evaluation we compared a convenience sample of critically ill adults with rhabdomyolysis treated with automated fluid management using the RenalGuard® device to patients managed with manual fluid adjustment following our standard rhabdomyolysis protocol. Primary outcome was number of hours with urine output > 2 [*]mL/kg during first 48 [*]h of therapy. Results. Eight patients treated with RenalGuard were compared to 28 patients treated with manual fluid management. Number of hours of target urine output was greater in the RenalGuard versus the Standard group (176 / 312 (56. 4 %) versus 534 / 1305 (40. 9 %); p< 0. 01). Urine output was significantly higher in the first 24 [*]h in the RenalGuard group (median (IQR) 4033 [*]mL (3682 – 7363) versus 2913 [*]mL (2263 – 4188 [*]mL); p< 0. 01). Fluid balance, electrolyte, diuretics, and bicarbonate use were comparable between groups. Conclusions. Automated fluid management resulted in a higher urine output more quickly in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Further research is needed to analyse the effect of diuresis-matched hydration for the prevention of AKI in rhabdomyolysis...|$|E

40|$|Review question/{{objective}}: The {{objective of}} this review is to identify effective treatment methods associated with exertional rhabdomyolysis in athletes. The review questions are: •Among athletes, is fluid resuscitation/replacement or nutritional intervention more effective in treating exertional rhabdomyolysis? •Does one specific method of fluid resuscitation/replacement lead to decreased time to return to physical activity when compared to another? •Does length of hospital stay influence time to return to activity? Inclusion criteria: Types of participants: The quantitative review will consider studies that include adolescent and adult patients (15 years and older), specifically athletes, diagnosed with exertional rhabdomyolysis. The minimum age of 15 has been selected due to {{the high number of}} adolescents participating in athletics. Types of interventions: The review will examine studies or case reports that include fluid resuscitation/replacement or other <b>treatment</b> methods <b>of</b> exertional <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Specifically, studies that utilized saline intravenous resuscitation will be sought.

40|$|Rhabdomyolysis is {{a common}} {{condition}} with potentially devastating complications, including acute renal failure, arrhythmias, and death. The standard of care is to use supportive measures such as aggressive fluid repletion to prevent kidney injury and attenuate clinical symptoms. Besides fluid management, few therapeutic options are available for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> acute <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> As a result, acute and refractory cases remain difficult to manage. We report a case <b>of</b> alcohol-induced <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> that responded dramatically to high-dose corticosteroids. A 55 -year-old man presented to the emergency department for evaluation of diffuse muscle pain, weakness, and darkening urine. On admission, his creatine kinase (CK) level was 50, 022 U/L. Despite aggressive fluid repletion, his CK level continued to increase, peaking at 401, 280 U/L with a concomitant increase in muscle pain and urine darkening. On administration of high-dose corticosteroids, clinical symptoms and CK levels improved dramatically, and the patient was discharged 36 hours later with complete resolution of muscle pain and weakness. Given their low toxicity profile, short-term high-dose corticosteroids may be a valid treatment option for recurrent rhabdomyolysis unresponsive to fluid repletion...|$|R

Hence, it may frequently occur that the acute management of NPS misusers will need to focus on decreasing levels of both self/outward-directed aggression and agitation.

Herein, 4 cases <b>of</b> <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> and {{a review of the}} literature are presented with respect to pathogenesis, <b>treatment,</b> and prevention <b>of</b> this dire complication. Methods: A retrospective review of over 600 laparoscopic renal operations over the past 8 years was performed. All cases <b>of</b> postoperative <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> were identified. A Medline search was performed to find articles related to the development <b>of</b> postoperative <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Cases <b>of</b> <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> developing after laparoscopic renal surgery and common risk factors between cases were identified. Results: The incidence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> in our series is 0. 67 %. It is similar to the rate reported in other series.

Although definite diagnosis depends on laboratory tests, imaging studies are usually the first modalities used to examine patients.

He developed rhabdomyolysis with hemoglobinuria after 2 weeks <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> Laboratory tests showed creatine kinase 144 600 IU/L (reference range 24 - 195), myoglobin > 3000 ng/mL (28 - 72), lactate dehydrogenase 7157 IU/L (230 - 460), aspartate aminotransferase 1115 IU/L (10 - 35), and alanine aminotransferase 205 IU/L (10 - 35).

40|$|Crush {{syndrome}} is a systemic disorder resulting from trauma-associated rhabdomyolysis that causes several medical and surgical complications. Pathogenesis of crush syndrome-related {{acute renal failure}} (ARF) can be studied under two headings: 1) Rhabdomyolysis, and 2) ARF on the basis <b>of</b> <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Compression <b>of</b> the muscles (baromyopathy) induces rhabdomyolysis. The term rhabdomyolysis points out to the disintegration of striated muscles, which results in the release of muscular cell contents into the circulation. On the other hand sodium, chloride, water and calcium diffuse into the muscle cell, and cellular swelling, “compartment syndrome”, occurs. Various factors {{contribute to the development}} of ARF on the basis <b>of</b> <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Among these the most important one is impairment of renal perfusion as a result of hypovolemia due to compartment syndrome. The crush syndrome and ARF do not necessarily develop in all cases who suffer from muscle trauma. This {{syndrome is}} observed relatively rarely in children. The most useful indicator <b>of</b> <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> is an increase in serum creatine phosphokinase level. On the other hand the most critical laboratory abnormality is hyperkalemia. Considering the medical interventions, prophylaxis of ARF is vital.
