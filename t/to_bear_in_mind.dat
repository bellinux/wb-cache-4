25|$|There are two {{principal}} reasons for concern about Ashton's {{translation of the}} title. Firstly, 'Judaism' in English carries the meaning of 'the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or the polity of the Jews', a topic on which Wagner does not touch. 'Judentum' however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning—roughly analogous to the nonce English word 'Jewdom' (cf. Christendom) and including {{the concept of the}} social practices of the Jews. In particular it carried the pejorative sense of 'haggling' or 'marketeering'—it was used in this sense for example by Karl Marx. Undoubtedly Wagner wished to refer to this sense, in effect using the word as a pun, as the commercialism implied forms the topic of the essay as a whole. It is therefore important <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the full range of implications of the title-word 'Judentum' in considering the essay as a whole. 'Jewishness', whilst not ideal, is perhaps a closer English approximation to 'Judentum' than 'Judaism'.|$|E
25|$|It is hard {{to clarify}} {{with any degree of}} {{certainty}} the exact concepts within kabbalah. There are several different schools of thought with very different outlooks; however, all are accepted as correct. Modern halakhic authorities have tried to narrow the scope and diversity within kabbalah, by restricting study to certain texts, notably Zohar and the teachings of Isaac Luria as passed down through Hayyim ben Joseph Vital. However, even this qualification does little to limit the scope of understanding and expression, as included in those works are commentaries on Abulafian writings, Sefer Yetzirah, Albotonian writings, and the Berit Menuhah, which is known to the kabbalistic elect and which, as described more recently by Gershom Scholem, combined ecstatic with theosophical mysticism. It is therefore important <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when discussing things such as the sephirot and their interactions that one is dealing with highly abstract concepts that at best can only be understood intuitively.|$|E

[...] The Daily Express opined that [...] "one cannot withhold a tribute to his daring resourcefulness and inflexible courage" [...] and called Lody [...] "one of the cleverest spies in Steinhauer's service", though it advised its readers <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that he was [...] "a most dangerous spy." ...|$|E

500|$|HeartGold and SoulSilver were {{released}} in 2009, {{ten years after}} Gold and Silvers release for the Game Boy Color. Shigeki Morimoto, the games' director, commented {{on the development of}} the remakes: [...] "The first thing that I knew I needed <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> was to respect the feelings of those people who'd played Gold and Silver ten years before. I think that players have very strong memories of the game, so they'd think things like 'Ah, this trainer is still strong' and 'If I do this here, this is going to happen'. I knew I needed to respect these feelings." [...] However, Morimoto also needed to make sure that the games would feel as new games to players who began playing Pokémon in recent years on the Game Boy Advance or the Nintendo DS. An in-game author surrogate of Game Freak's President in Celadon City states that the team strove to make a game that would appeal to players with fond memories without [...] "redoing the same thing". He also states that making the game was a [...] "rewarding challenge". HeartGold and SoulSilver introduced many new features that were absent in the original Gold and Silver. Several of these features came from the previously released Nintendo DS Pokémon games, such as Diamond (2006), Pearl (2006), and Platinum (2008).|$|E
500|$|As {{regards the}} second question, in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{identified}} {{three categories of}} legitimate expectations. Category (b) involves procedural legitimate expectations, and so are not discussed here because breaches of them are a form of procedural impropriety rather than illegality. Categories (a) and (c) relate to substantive legitimate expectations. Category (a) cases are those which lie [...] "in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field". The public authority [...] "is only required <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness. On the other hand, category (c) cases are usually those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation {{the character of a}} contract". When assessing such a case, the court decides whether for a public authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy. A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice John Laws. In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie (1999), he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not [...] "hermetically sealed", and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005), he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach: ...|$|E
500|$|However, the courts' role in {{protecting}} substantive legitimate expectations was clearly {{established by the}} Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999). The case involved an applicant who was promised by her local authority that a new nursing home would be her [...] "home for life". The Court granted the application for review {{on the ground that}} the applicant had a legitimate expectation to have the substantive benefit of staying in the nursing home as promised by the local authority. It also set out the approach to be taken in safeguarding procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. Where procedural legitimate expectations were concerned, courts would require an opportunity for consultation to be given unless there was an overriding reason to resile from it (such as the national security concern that arose in the GCHQ case). As regards substantive legitimate expectations, courts would decide whether cases lie [...] "... in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field", or are those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract". In the first situation, the public authority [...] "is only required <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness. On the other hand, when assessing a case in the second situation, the court decides whether for an authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy.|$|E

30|$|To sum up, {{one could}} say that, in general, foreign {{ownership}} tends to increase the wage rate, largely because of improved labour productivity, and {{that at least some}} studies have found that these wage increases spill over into other firms in the same sector. Nonetheless, it needs <b>to</b> be <b>borne</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that most of the previous studies have looked at labour markets considerably less unionised than Sweden’s. It also needs <b>to</b> be <b>borne</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that the type of firm acquired by foreign investors may be different from an average firm, in the country and even in the same sector.|$|R

2500|$|Chisel plows are {{becoming}} more popular as a primary tillage tool in row crop farming areas. Basically the chisel plow is a very heavy duty field cultivator intended to operate at depths from 15cm [...] {{to as much as}} 46cm [...] However some models may run much deeper. Each of the individual ploughs, or shanks, are typically set from nine inches (229mm) to twelve inches (305mm) apart. Such a plough can encounter significant soil drag, consequently a tractor of sufficient power and good traction is required. When planning to plough with a chisel plough it is important <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that 10 to 20 horsepower (7.5 to 15kW) per shank will be required, depending on depth.|$|E

2500|$|... "In {{considering}} the respective {{powers of the}} Commonwealth and of the States it is essential <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that each is, within the ambit of its authority, a sovereign State, subject only to the restrictions imposed by the Imperial connection and to {{the provisions of the}} Constitution, either expressed or necessarily implied... a right of sovereignty subject to extrinsic control is a contradiction in terms. It must, therefore, be taken to be of the essence of the Constitution that the Commonwealth is entitled, within the ambit of its authority, to exercise its legislative and executive powers in absolute freedom, and without any interference or control whatever except that prescribed by the Constitution itself... It follows that when a State attempts to give to its legislative or executive authority an operation which, if valid, would fetter, control, or interfere with, the free exercise of the legislative or executive power of the Commonwealth, the attempt, unless expressly authorized by the Constitution, is to that extent invalid and inoperative." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{initially}} {{consisted of}} 11 judges and 4 deputy judges, recommended by member {{states of the}} League of Nations to the Secretary General of the League of Nations, who would put them before the Council and Assembly for election. The Council and Assembly were <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that the elected panel of judges was to represent every major legal tradition in the League, along with [...] "every major civilization". Each member state was allowed to recommend 4 potential judges, with a maximum of 2 from its own nation. Judges were elected by a straight majority vote, held independently in the Council and Assembly. The judges served {{for a period of}} nine years, with their term limits all expiring at the same time, necessitating a completely new set of elections. The judges were independent and rid themselves of their nationality for the purposes of hearing cases, owing allegiance to no individual member state, but it was forbidden to have more than one judge from the same state. As a sign of their independence from national ties, judges were given full diplomatic immunity when engaged in Court business. The only requirements for judges were [...] "high moral character" [...] and [...] "the qualifications required in their respective countries [...] the highest judicial offices" [...] or to be [...] "jurisconsults of recognized competence in international law".|$|E
2500|$|The summary {{described}} above {{was provided to}} the defense along with a companion summary that defined a [...] "covert" [...] CIA employee as a “CIA employee whose employment is not publicly acknowledged by the CIA or the employee." [...] It is important <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that the IIPA defines “covert agent” differently. It states: [...] "The term 'covert agent' means— (A) a present or retired officer or employee of an intelligence agency ... (i) whose identity as such an officer, employee, or member is classified information, and (ii) who is serving outside the United States or has within {{the last five years}} served outside the United States." [...] The CIA summary of Ms. Wilson's employment history claims that she [...] "engaged in temporary duty (TDY) travel overseas on official business", though it does not say whether such travel in fact occurred within the last five years. Further, {{it is not clear that}} engaging in temporary duty travel overseas would make a CIA employee who is based in Washington eligible for protection under the IIPA. In fact, it seems more likely that the CIA employee would have to have been stationed outside the United States to trigger the protection of the statute. To our knowledge, the meaning of the phrase [...] "served outside the United States" [...] in the IIPA has never been litigated. Thus, whether Ms. Wilson was covered by the IIPA remains very much in doubt, especially given the sparse nature of the record.|$|E
