Problems related to the force transfer mechanisms between the external strengthening system and the concrete substrate were also investigated.

Investigations proved that relatively short bond lengths were sufficient for the anchorage of the strengthening.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple two-country model, where each country produces a consumption good {{from a single}} input. Production takes time, and the model is considered over two consecutive periods. There are three categories of economic agents, namely factor owners, entrepreneurs, and financial intermediaries. The latter offers credits to entrepreneurs and are funded by sale internationally <b>transferable</b> <b>bonds.</b> We assume that the national credit markets are monopolistic but that other markets are competitive. Exchange rate policy is introduced in two different ways, either as a market intervention by a government, sustained by intervention in the commodity market, and, more realistically, as a policy commitment by the monetary authorities, which in equilibrium is taken into consideration by the financial intermediary. The results of the simple model show that {{an increase in the}} value of the domestic currency from an equilibrium position will in most cases decrease aggregate welfare of the country, but it will improve welfare of the financial intermediaries. Thus, in the simple framework of our model, a specific sector – and one with a considerable influence on policy choices – stands to gain from this exchange rate policy. fear of floating; income distribution; financial intermediaries...|$|R

But the canon lawyers and the church preachers were declared that; one man’s gain in trading must always be another’s loss, so not everyone that sells at higher price than he bought as a trader, by this reason, all commercial gains must be equal to the exertions of the merchant. The church defended private wealth and allowed the merchant a fair return for his labour; but the immoderate quest for riches was sin. And to take usury for money lent is unjust in itself, because this is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently leads to inequality which is contrary to justice...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to combine bond order potentials with long-range nonbond interactions. This extended bond order potential consistently takes into account bond terms and nonbond terms. It not only captures {{the advantages of the}} bond order potentials (i. e. simulating bond forming and breaking), but also systematically includes the nonbond contributions to energy and forces in studying the structure and dynamics of covalently bonded systems such as graphite, diamond, nanotubes, fullerenes and hydrocarbons, in their crystal and melt forms. Using this modified bond order potential, we studied the structure and thermal properties (including thermal conductivity) of C 60 crystal, and the elastic properties and plastic deformation processes of the single-walled and double-walled nanotubes. This extended bond order potential enables us to simulate large deformations of a nanotube under tensile and compressive loads. The basic formulation in this paper is <b>transferable</b> to other <b>bond</b> order potentials and traditional valence force fields...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results of a parametric study carried out with a a mechanical model recently developed to simulate the shear strength contribution provided by a system of Near Surface Mounted (NSM) Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) strips applied to a Reinforced Concrete (RC) beam. That model, developed fulfilling equilibrium, kinematic compatibility and constitutive laws of both materials, concrete and FRP, and local bond between themselves, takes into consideration the possibility that the NSM strips may fail due to: loss of bond (debonding), concrete semi-conical tensile fracture or strip tensile rupture. The model also takes into consideration: a) interaction between progressive force transferred by bond to the surrounding concrete and its tensile fracture and b) bi-directional interaction among adjacent strips placed on {{the two sides of the}} strengthened beam cross-section web. In the first part of the paper attention is focused on the bond-based behavior of a single NSM FRP strip mounted on a concrete prism. The influence of each geometrical-mechanical parameter on the peak force <b>transferable</b> through <b>bond</b> stresses to the surrounding concrete, excluding the possibility of either concrete fracture and strip rupture, is analyzed. In the second part of the paper attention is focused on the comprehensive behavior of a single NSM FRP strip mounted on a concrete prism. The influence of each geometrical-mechanical parameter on the peak force transferable to the surrounding concrete, also including the possibility of both concrete fracture and strip rupture, is analyzed. The third part of the paper is devoted at assessing the influence of each geometrical-mechanical parameter on the maximum shear strength contribution provided by a system of NSM FRP strips applied to a RC beam.

40|$|The {{localized}} charge distributions defined previously {{are used}} to calculate INDO bond moments and energies {{of a variety of}} CH bonds in acyclic hydrocarbons. The polarity of all bonds discussed is c+H-. It is found that each basic type of CH bond (primary, vinyl, ethynyl) has an overflow of electron density (a 2 ̆ 2 tail 2 ̆ 2) out of the bond region which resides on and is characteristic of those atoms trans and coplanar to the bond. It is demonstrated that, since these tails are virtually independent of each other, the basic bond moments can be used to construct a model which predicts all calculated bond moments and orientations to a high degree of accuracy. While the total energies of the bonds ei (where the molecular energy E = iei) are not very <b>transferable,</b> the intra <b>bond</b> and interference energies can be predicted rather well using a similar model. The trends in the bond moments are discussed in terms of the point charge and polarization contributions, and the interference energies are shown to correlate well with the trends in experimental CH bond energies. The trends in both properties are principally determined by the loss of interference density within the bond due to the presence of overflow atoms...|$|R
25|$|The VOC was {{the driving}} force behind the rise of Amsterdam as the first modern model of (global) {{international}} financial centres that now dominate the global financial system. During the 17th century and most of the 18th century, Amsterdam had been the most influential and powerful financial centre of the world. The VOC also played a major role in the creation of the world's first fully functioning financial market, with the birth of a fully fledged capital market. The Dutch were also the first who effectively used a fully-fledged capital market (including the bond market and the stock market) to finance companies (such as the VOC and the WIC). It was in the 17th-century Dutch Republic that the global securities market began to take on its modern form. And it was in Amsterdam that the important institutional innovations such as publicly traded companies, transnational corporations, capital markets (including bond markets and stock markets), central banking system, investment banking system, and investment funds (mutual funds) were systematically operated for the first time in history. In 1602 the VOC established an exchange in Amsterdam where VOC stock and bonds could be traded in a secondary market. The VOC undertook the world's first recorded IPO in the same year. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (Amsterdamsche Beurs or Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser in Dutch) was also the world's first fully-fledged stock exchange. While the Italian city-states produced the first <b>transferable</b> government <b>bonds,</b> they didn't develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market: corporate shareholders. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first company to offer shares of stock. The dividend averaged around 18% of capital over the course of the company's 200-year existence. The launch of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange by the VOC in the early 1600s, has long been recognized as the origin of 'modern' stock exchanges that specialize in creating and sustaining secondary markets in the securities (such as bonds and shares of stock) issued by corporations. Dutch investors were the first to trade their shares at a regular stock exchange. The process of buying and selling these shares of stock in the VOC became the basis of the first official (formal) stock market in history. It was in the Dutch Republic that the early techniques of stock-market manipulation were developed. The Dutch pioneered stock futures, stock options, short selling, bear raids, debt-equity swaps, and other speculative instruments.
