5|$|New World Pictures {{produced}} a 95-minute English-dubbed {{adaptation of the}} film, titled Warriors of the Wind, and it was released theatrically in the United States in June 1985, with the VHS video release in December 1985. In the late 1980s, Vestron Video would release the film and First Independent Video would re-release it in 1993 with another minute cut from the film. The voice actors and actresses were not informed of the film's plotline and the film was heavily edited to market it as a children's action-adventure film. Consequently, part of the film's narrative meaning was lost: some of the environmentalist themes were diluted as was the main subplot of the Ohmu, altered <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> into aggressive enemies. Most of the characters' names were changed, including the titular character who became Princess Zandra. The United States cover for the VHS release featured a cadre of male characters {{who are not in}} the film, riding the resurrected God Warrior—including a still-living Warrior shown briefly in a flashback. Approximately 22 minutes of scenes were cut for the film's North American release.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins on}} Crater Planet and {{revolves}} around {{the story of an}} insane astrophysicist, Baron Aloha. Planning to make a large profit from his evil ingenuity, Aloha removes giant pieces of land from the planet using machines <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> into private resorts. Aloha also removes and hides the twelve jet pods that propel each world. Witnessing the destruction, the residents of Crater Planet call for help, and in response the Universal City Hall dispatches one of their agents, a mechanical rabbit named Robbit. Robbit is ordered to explore each world to retrieve the jet pods, stop Aloha, and save Crater Planet from destruction. At the end of the game, Aloha flees to his home, Little Muu, and vows revenge on Robbit.|$|E

25|$|The {{first draft}} of the DADVSI law criminalized {{peer-to-peer}} exchanges of copyrighted works (or, more precisely, copyrighted works whose licenses did not allow such exchanges). The case was made in Parliament that millions of French Internet users, especially among the young, currently traded files on computer networks {{and that it was}} thus unrealistic <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> into felons. Since subsequent reading coincided with the examination of a controversial youth workforce clause known as the CPE, the opposition argued that the government was at war with the youth.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} undertook extensive {{efforts to}} prevent the spread of any information about the famine by keeping state communications top secret and taking other measures to prevent word of the famine from spreading. When Ukrainian peasants traveled north to Russia seeking bread, Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov sent a secret telegram to the party and provincial police chiefs with instructions <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> back, alleging Polish agents were attempting to create a famine scare. OGPU chairman Genrikh Yagoda subsequently reported that over 200,000 peasants had been turned back.|$|E
25|$|With Yes {{in disarray}} again, Squire turned to Billy Sherwood (by now the band's engineer) for help. Both {{men had been}} working on a side project called Conspiracy and {{reworked}} existing demos and recordings from there <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> into Yes songs, and also worked on new material with Anderson and White. (Howe's involvement at this stage was minimal, mainly taking place {{towards the end of the}} sessions.) Sherwood's integral involvement with the writing, production, and performance of the music led to his finally joining Yes as a full member (taking on the role of harmony singer, keyboardist and second guitarist).|$|E

25|$|A local {{version of}} a legend of Saint Nicholas (D'Seeche vum Zinniklos) refers to the danger of being shut outside the {{fortress}} gates for the night. Three boys were playing outside, and were {{far away from the}} city when the curfew was sounded: {{it was too late for}} them to return home. They sought refuge with a butcher who lived outside the city. At night-time, however, the butcher killed them <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> into aspic. Luckily, a few days later, Saint Nicholas also found himself shut out of the city, and went to the same butcher's house. He found the children, and was able to bring them back to life.|$|E
25|$|Yoav Gelber {{claims that}} the Arab Liberation Army {{embarked}} on a systematic evacuation of non-combatants from several frontier villages in order <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> into military strongholds. Arab depopulation occurred most in villages close to Jewish settlements and in vulnerable neighborhoods in Haifa, Jaffa and West Jerusalem. The poorer inhabitants of these neighborhoods generally fled {{to other parts of}} the city. Those who could afford to fled further away, expecting to return when the troubles were over. By the end of March 1948 thirty villages were depopulated of their Palestinian Arab population. Approximately 100,000 Palestinian Arabs had fled to Arab parts of Palestine, such as Gaza, Beersheba, Haifa, Nazareth, Nablus, Jaffa and Bethlehem.|$|E
25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, that the White House was not required <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, she pointed to the senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the work}} De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7thcentury AD, however that claim is disputed and {{competing}} hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. According to Constantine VII, Christianization of Croats began in the 7th century, but the claim is disputed and is generally associated with the 9th century. Croats had first contact with the Holy See in year 641 when the papal envoy Abbot Martin came to {{them in order to}} redeem Christian captives and the bones of the martyrs that Croats were keeping, as well as to evangelize the Croats, and <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> from paganism.|$|E
25|$|The first Jews {{known to}} have lived in New Amsterdam arrived in 1654. First to arrive were Solomon Pietersen and Jacob Barsimson, who sailed {{during the summer of}} 1654 {{directly}} from Holland, with passports that gave them permission to trade in the colony. Then in early September, 23 Jewish refugees arrived from the formerly Dutch city of Recife, which had been conquered by the Portuguese in January 1654. The director of New Amsterdam, Peter Stuyvesant, sought <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> away but was ultimately overruled by the directors of the Dutch West India Company in Amsterdam. Asser Levy, an Ashkenazi Jew {{who was one of the}} 23 refugees, eventually prospered and in 1661 became the first Jew to own a house in New Amsterdam, which also made him the first Jew {{known to have}} owned a house anywhere in North America.|$|E
25|$|In 1638 the Dutch {{signed a}} treaty with King Rajasinha II of Kandy which assured the king {{assistance}} in his {{war against the}} Portuguese {{in exchange for a}} monopoly of the island's major trade goods. The Portuguese resisted the Dutch and the Kandyans but were gradually defeated in their strongholds beginning in 1639. The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 after an epic siege, {{at the end of which}} a mere 93 Portuguese survivors were given safe conduct out of the fort. Although the Dutch (e.g., Rijcklof van Goens) initially restored the captured area back to the Sinhalese kings, they later refused <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> over and gained control over the island's richest cinnamon lands including Colombo which then served as the capital of the Dutch maritime provinces under the control of the Dutch East India Company until 1796.|$|E

25|$|In cult leader-like fashion, Lore had {{manipulated}} {{them into}} following him {{by appealing to}} their restored emotions and exploiting their new-found senses of individuality and fear, hoping <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> on the Federation.

In the end, Data's ethical subroutines are restored (having been suppressed by Lore through use of the emotion chip) and he manages to deactivate Lore after a battle in which a renegade Borg faction led by Hugh attacks the main complex. Data reclaims the emotion chip, Lore is mentioned as needing to be dismantled (for safety) and the surviving Borg fall under the leadership of Hugh. The fate of these deassimilated Borg is not revealed, though non-canon material suggests that they remained on the planet and established a permanent colony.|$|E
25|$|Both {{airplanes}} {{were destroyed}} in the collision. All 248 passengers and crew aboard the KLM plane died, as did 335 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am plane, primarily due to the fire and explosions resulting from the fuel spilled and ignited in the impact. The other 61 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am aircraft survived, including the captain, first officer and flight engineer. Most of the survivors on the Pan Am walked out onto the intact left wing, the side away from the collision, through holes in the fuselage structure. The Pan Am's engines were still running {{for a few minutes}} after the accident despite first officer Bragg's intention <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> off. The top part of the cockpit, where the engine switches were located, had been {{destroyed in the}} collision, and all control lines were severed, leaving no method for the flight crew to control the aircraft's systems. Survivors waited for rescue, but it did not come promptly, as the firefighters were initially unaware that there were two aircraft involved and were concentrating on the KLM wreck hundreds of meters away in the thick fog and smoke. Eventually, most of the survivors on the wings dropped to the ground below.|$|E

500|$|Despite Hawks's work in {{a variety}} of Hollywood genres, he still {{retained}} an independent sensibility. Film critic David Thomson wrote of Hawks: [...] "Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> upside down. To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. Rio Bravo, apparently a Western – everyone wears a cowboy hat – is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women." [...] David Boxwell argues that the filmmaker's body of work [...] "has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks's fans rejoice in his oeuvre's remarkable avoidance of Hollywood's religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.|$|E
