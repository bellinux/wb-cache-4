40|$|Body fat {{distribution}} {{is an important}} predictor of the metabolic consequences of obesity, but the cellular mechanisms regulating regional fat accumulation are unknown. We assessed the changes in adipocyte size (photomicrographs) and number in response <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding</b> in upper- and lower-body s. c. fat depots of 28 healthy, normal weight adults (15 men) age 29 ± 2 y. We analyzed how these changes relate to regional fat gain (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography) and baseline preadipocyte proliferation, differentiation [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ 2 (PPARγ 2) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) mRNA]), and apoptotic response to TNF-α. Fat mass increased by 1. 9 ± 0. 2 kg in the upper body and 1. 6 ± 0. 1 kg in the lower body. Average abdominal s. c. adipocyte size increased by 0. 16 ± 0. 06 μg lipid per cell and correlated with relative upper-body fat gain (r = 0. 74, P < 0. 0001). However, lower-body fat responded <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding</b> by fat-cell hyperplasia, with adipocyte number increasing by 2. 6 ± 0. 9 × 109 cells (P < 0. 01). We found no depot-differences in preadipocyte replication or apoptosis that would explain lower-body adipocyte hyperplasia and abdominal s. c. adipocyte hypertrophy. However, baseline PPARγ 2 and C/EBPα mRNA were higher in abdominal than femoral s. c. preadipocytes (P < 0. 005 and P < 0. 03, respectively), consistent with the ability of abdominal s. c. adipocytes to achieve a larger size.

40|$|The current obesity {{literature}} places {{strong emphasis}} upon {{the influence that}} Diet-Induced Thermogenesis (DIT) has on weight regulation and the possible mediating role of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) in DIT. This focus arises from animal research which establishes the significance of DIT and BAT in the energy balance of rodents. Recent studies indicate differential postprandial DIT between lean and obese individuals. The contribution of resting state DIT to energy balance is equivocal, a situation {{in part due to}} disagreement regarding the extent of excess energy needed to trigger the response, and individual differences in responding. At present, only catechol-amine stimulation studies suggest the active presence of BAT in adults. This thesis addresses four research questions arising from the obesity literature: (i) Does the DIT response <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding</b> in either post-prandial or resting state conditions show any change over five days overfeeding? (ii) Is a subject's responsiveness to a standard test of thermogenic capacity (i. e. stimulation by the sympatheticomimetic drug ephedrine) predictive of their DIT response <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding?</b> (iii) Is BAT involved in mediating the DIT response during the postprandial period? and (iv) Can the DIT response <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding</b> be blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol? These questions were investigated in two studies. Experiment 1, testing seven subjects, examined questions (i) to (iii), Experiment 2 examined question (iv) with the three strongest responders from the first experiment. DIT and response to sympathetic stimulation were measured through metabolic rate (02 consumption and HR) increase. BAT activity was assessed via skin temperature change at sites of probable BAT deposits. The results suggest that in certain individuals resting state DIT can be achieved following a single day's overfeeding. The data also suggest that dietary history may underpin DIT response ability. As only a positive trend was found between MR stimulated by ephedrine and overfeeding respectively, the relationship between these responses remains equivocal. The BAT hypothesis was challenged by a failure to observe skin temperature increase following both ephedrine administration and overfeeding, and the failure of propanolol to inhibit DIT. The results are interpreted as clarifying the occurrence of resting state DIT in respect <b>to</b> short term <b>overfeeding,</b> and calling into question speculation regarding BAT's role in thermogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Animals, {{including}} insects, {{have the}} ability to self-select an optimal diet from a choice of two or more incomplete diets that lack an essential nutrient. This paper demonstrates that nymphs of the cockroach Rhyparobia madera also have this ability. The nymphs chose a protein:carbohydrate (P:C) ratio of approximately 25 : 75 when faced with a choice between one cube of protein (casein) and another of carbohydrate (sucrose). This self-selected ratio was shown to promote growth as well or better than other diets tested. When given a wide range of P:C choices, the R. madera nymphs consistently selected a P:C ratio of approximately 25 : 75, suggesting that they {{have the ability}} to diet-balance. Finally, injections of various serotonergic drugs into self-selecting nymphs influenced their choice of diets. Serotonin promoted a decrease in carbohydrate feeding, while injection of the antagonist α-methyltryptophan caused the nymphs <b>to</b> <b>overfeed</b> on carbohydrate.

40|$|ABSTRACT Susceptibility to liver {{steatosis}} was {{studied in}} Landes and Poland geese, which are hyper-and hyporesponsive, respectively, <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding.</b> Plasma lipoproteins were characterized {{at different stages}} of the overfeeding process, whereas fatty liver composition was determined after completion of over-feeding and slaughtering. Before overfeeding, plasma lipoprotein profile was typical of birds in both breeds, except that very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) were low in triglyceride (∼ 30 %). Moreover, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration was higher in the Poland geese (6. 44 vs 4. 97 g/L). During overfeeding, hepatic lipogenesis was increased, and fatty liver resulted from accumulation of primarily triglyceride (∼ 95 % of lipid content), but also of all other lipids. This accumulation was significantly greater in the Landes geese for all lipids but phospholipid. Thus, the liver weight was 100 % higher in this breed (1, 005 g vs 485 g), whereas lipid release during sterilization was twofold higher (26. 3 vs 7. 5 %). Parallely, plasma concentration and triglyceride content of hepatic lipoproteins, VLDL and HDL, increased about one- to twofold, this effect being greater in the Poland geese. Therefore, channeling of triglyceride towards secretion rather than in situ storage may be responsible for the hyporesponsiveness of this breed <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding.</b> In both breeds, and especially in the Landes geese, a relative deficiency in phospholipid synthesis together with an enhanced secretion may be limiting factors of hepatocyte hyper-trophia and, therefore, of steatosis.

40|$|A high-fat, high-calorie diet is {{associated}} with obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the relative contribution of metabolic defects {{to the development of}} hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes is controversial. Accumulation of excess fat in muscle and adipose tissue in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes may be linked with defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The aim of the current study was to investigate acute effects of short-term fat overfeeding on glucose and insulin metabolism in young men. We studied the effects of 5 days’ high-fat (60 % energy) overfeeding (+ 50 %) versus a control diet on hepatic and peripheral insulin action by a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp, muscle mitochondrial function by 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and gene expression by qrt-PCR and microarray in 26 young men. Hepatic glucose production and fasting glucose levels increased significantly in response <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding.</b> However, peripheral insulin action, muscle mitochondrial function, and general and specific oxidative phosphorylation gene expression were unaffected by high-fat feeding. Insulin secretion increased appropriately to compensate for hepatic, and not for peripheral, insulin resistance. High-fat feeding increased fasting levels of plasma adiponectin, leptin and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). High-fat overfeeding increases fasting glucose levels due to increased hepatic glucose production. The increased insulin secretion may compensate for hepatic insulin resistance possibly mediated by elevated GIP secretion. Increased insulin secretion precedes the development of peripheral insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity in response <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding,</b> suggesting a role for insulin per se as well GIP, in the development of peripheral insulin resistance and obesity...|$|R

5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group.

40|$|Background: Previous {{short-term}} studies (≤ 6 h) showed differ-ences {{in energy}} expenditure (EE) and macronutrient oxidation in response <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding</b> with {{different types of}} dietary carbohy-drate. This finding could have implications for obesity. Objective: We used 96 -h continuous whole-body calorimetry in 8 lean and 5 obese women to assess metabolic disposal (energy dissipation and glycogen or fat storage) of a controlled excess of dietary energy supplied as different carbohydrate sources or as fat. Design: Five dietary treatments were applied in random order: energy balance (control) and overfeeding by 50 % of energy requirements with fat (Ofat) or predominantly with glucose, fruc-tose, or sucrose (Ocho). Macronutrient oxidation rates were assessed from nonprotein gaseous exchanges. Net macronutrient balances were calculated as cumulative differences between intake and oxidation. Results: Increased EE in response <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding</b> dissipated 7. 9 % of the energy excess with a variation in EE of < 1. 7 % across over-feeding treatments (NS). EE during the Ofat treatment signifi-cantly exceeded that during the control treatment in the lean {{but not in the}} obese women. There {{were no significant differences between}} lean and obese women in macronutrient oxidation or balances, so data were pooled. Ocho induced glycogen storage on day 1 (100 g) but thereafter progressively stimulated carbohy-drate oxidation so that balance was reached on days 3 and 4.

During the ad libitum periods following the WM vs. OF diets, {{there was no significant}} difference in mean 3 -d EI (4061 ± 1084 vs. 3926 ± 1284 kcal/day, p =  0. 41), and there were also no differences either in core body temperature (37. 0 ± 0. 2 °C vs. 37. 1 ± 0. 2 °C, p =  0. 75) or sedentary time (70. 9 ± 12. 9 vs. 72. 0 ± 7. 4 %, p =  0. 88). However, during OF (but not WM), sedentary time was positively associated with weight gain (r =  0. 49, p =  0. 05, adjusted for age, sex, and initial weight). In conclusion, short term overfeeding did not result in a decrease in subsequent ad libitum food intake or overall change in sedentary time although in secondary analysis sedentary time was associated with weight gain during OF.

We also evaluated the adequacy of a measured RQ lower than 0. 85 to identify underfeeding, and an RQ higher than 1. 0 <b>to</b> identify <b>overfeeding.</b> Results: Ninety-eight children underwent 195 calorimetric measurements. Underfeeding, adequate feeding, and overfeeding occurred on 21 %, 10 %, and 69 % of days, respectively. An RQ lower than 0. 85 to identify underfeeding showed low sensitivity (63 %), high specificity (89 %), and high negative predictive value (90 %). An RQ higher than 1. 0 <b>to</b> indicate <b>overfeeding</b> showed poor sensitivity (21 %), but a high specificity (97 %) and a high positive predictive value (93 %). Food composition, notably high-carbohydrate intake, was responsible for an RQ exceeding 1. 0 in the overfed group. Conclusion: Children admitted to the intensive care unit receive adequate feeding on only 10 % of measurement days during the first 2 wk of admission. The usefulness of RQ to monitor feeding adequacy is limited <b>to</b> identifying (carbohydrate) <b>overfeeding</b> and excluding underfeeding...|$|R
3000|$|Another notable {{feature of}} Figs.  13 and 14 {{is the high}} {{concentration}} of K+ and Cl−. Given that muriate of potash (used as a nutrient) was the sole contributor of KCl to the system and that the changes in Cl− and K+ concentrations mirror one another, {{it is evident that}} the rather saline conditions observed in the reactor were due <b>to</b> <b>overfeeding</b> of this particular nutrient. However, this saline environment was evidently well tolerated by the algae. Also noteworthy is the rather low SO 4 2 − concentration, which averaged 25.1  ±  13.7  ppm during the period May–September (only data for August and September are shown) with occasional spikes as high as ~ 50  ppm. As highlighted above, this observation is consistent with SO 4 2 − uptake by the algae. Similarly, the concentration of NO 3 − in the system remained consistently low (with an average value of 12.1  ±  3.8  ppm), indicating that NO x [...] captured by the system as nitrate was utilized by the algae as a nitrogen source in addition to the added urea.|$|R
