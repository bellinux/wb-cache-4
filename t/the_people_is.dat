5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|Ray's {{last three}} films, made after his {{recovery}} and with medical strictures in place, were shot mostly indoors, {{and have a}} distinctive style. They have more dialogue than his earlier films and are often regarded as inferior to his earlier body of work. The first, Ganashatru (An Enemy of <b>the</b> <b>People)</b> <b>is</b> an adaptation of the famous Ibsen play, and considered the weakest of the three. Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree). In it, an old man, who has lived a life of honesty, comes to learn of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill. Ray's last film, Agantuk (The Stranger), is lighter in mood but not in theme. When a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. This provokes far-ranging questions in the film about civilisation.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the Roman term basterna, denoting a type of wagon or litter, is derived from the name of this people (or, if it is an exonym, the name of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> derived from it) which was known, like many Germanic tribes, to travel with a wagon-train for their families.|$|E

25|$|Statues of elephants, which symbolize {{independence}} and power, are seen {{all around the}} complex. As Thai kings fought wars mounted on elephants, it has become customary for parents to make their children circumambulate the elephant three times {{with the belief that}} it would bring them strength. The head of an elephant statue is also rubbed for good luck; this act of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> reflected in the smoothness of the surface of elephant statues here.|$|E
25|$|Their {{royal family}} {{is of an}} old dynasty (see House of Munsö), but the kings are {{dependent}} on {{the will of the}} people (the Thing).

During peacetime, they feel to be the king's equals but during wars they obey him blindly or whoever among them that he considers to be the most skillful. If the fortunes of war are against them they pray to one of their many gods (Æsir) and if they win they are grateful to him.|$|E

25|$|Probably Delacroix's best-known painting, Liberty Leading <b>the</b> <b>People</b> <b>is</b> {{an unforgettable}} image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward {{under the banner}} of the tricolour {{representing}} liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people, rather than glorifying the actual event, the 1830 revolution against Charles X, which did little other than bring a different king, Louis-Philippe, to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly, as if in a spotlight.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{portion of}} Britain is inhabited {{by those of}} whom they {{say that it is}} handed down by tradition that they were born in the island itself: the maritime portion by those who had passed over from the country of the Belgae for the purpose of plunder and making war; almost all of whom are called by the names of those states from which being sprung they went thither, and having waged war, continued there and began to cultivate the lands. The number of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> countless, and their buildings exceedingly numerous, for the most part very like those of the Gauls...

25|$|After his {{retirement}} from the bench, Innes was free {{once again to}} express his political views, and especially his staunch Cape liberal commitments. In 1929, when Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog was intensifying plans to strip black Africans of their rights, Innes founded the Non-Racial Franchise Association to protect the beleaguered Cape Qualified Franchise and extend it {{to the rest of}} the country. At the Association's opening function he said:"In a comparatively short time, we shall have to deal with a great body of Natives whose education has enabled them to appreciate the value of the political status denied them, and has stimulated their determination to obtain it, and they will be embittered by the grievances, economic and administrative which are bound to accumulate when one section of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> deprived of those voting rights which its fellow citizens enjoy.|$|E

500|$|Another {{hallmark}} of Achebe's style {{is the use}} of proverbs, which often illustrate the values of the rural Igbo tradition. He sprinkles them throughout the narratives, repeating points made in conversation. Critic Anjali Gera notes that the use of proverbs in Arrow of God [...] "serves to create through an echo effect the judgement of a community upon an individual violation." [...] The use of such repetition in Achebe's urban novels, No Longer at Ease and A Man of <b>the</b> <b>People,</b> <b>is</b> less pronounced.|$|E
