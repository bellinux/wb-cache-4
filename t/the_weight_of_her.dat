25|$|In sailing qualities Boreas was broadly {{comparable}} with French frigates of equivalent size, {{but with a}} shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her broadside guns. She was also comparatively broad-beamed with ample space for provisions and the ship's mess, and incorporating a large magazine for powder and round shot. Taken together, these characteristics would enable Boreas to remain at sea for long periods without resupply. She was also built with broad and heavy masts, which balanced <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull, improved stability in rough weather and made her capable of carrying a greater quantity of sail. The disadvantages of this comparatively heavy design were a decline in manoeuvrability and slower speed when sailing in light winds.|$|E
500|$|An {{auxiliary}} boiler {{was added to}} provide steam for the engines that powered the turrets, fans and steering and little to nothing was done to reinforce the hull to withstand <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> armor and turrets. The deck beneath each [...] turret was reinforced {{by a series of}} stanchions that transferred their weight to the ship's bottom, which was not reinforced to handle their weight. The stress caused Roanoke to leak around [...] per day {{by the end of the}} war. In her new configuration, her crew numbered 347 officers and men.|$|E

500|$|USS Roanoke was a wooden-hulled [...] screw frigate {{built for}} the United States Navy in the mid-1850s. She served as {{flagship}} of the Home Squadron in the late 1850s and captured several Confederate ships {{after the start of}} the American Civil War in 1861. The ship was converted into an ironclad monitor during 1862–63; the first ship with more than two gun turrets in history. Her conversion was not very successful as she rolled excessively and <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> armor and turrets strained her hull. Her deep draft meant that she could not operate off shallow Confederate ports and she was relegated to harbor defense at Hampton Roads, Virginia {{for the duration of the}} war.

500|$|The band {{relocated}} to London in June 1991 when Harvey applied to study sculpture at Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design, still undecided as to her future career. During this time, the band recorded {{a set of}} demo recordings and distributed them to record labels. Independent label Too Pure agreed to release the band's debut single [...] "Dress" [...] in October 1991, and later signed PJ Harvey. [...] "Dress" [...] received mass critical acclaim upon its release and was voted Single of the Week in Melody Maker by guest reviewer John Peel, who admired [...] "the way Polly Jean seems crushed by <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own songs and arrangements, as if the air is literally being sucked out of them... admirable if not always enjoyable." [...] However, Too Pure provided little promotion for the single and critics claim that [...] "Melody Maker {{had more to do}} with the success of the [...] "Dress" [...] single than Too Pure Records." [...] A week after its release, the band recorded a live radio session for Peel on BBC Radio 1 on 29 October featuring [...] "Oh, My Lover", [...] "Victory", [...] "Sheela-Na-Gig", and [...] "Water".|$|E

500|$|All of {{the ships}} had the same main armament, four quick-firing (QF) [...] Mark IX guns in single mounts, {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear.

The E- and F-class ships were fitted with two quadruple mounts for 21-inch (533mm) torpedo tubes. The ships, except for the minelayers, were also equipped with two throwers and one rack for 20 depth charges. The stern of the minelayers was fitted with a pair of sponsons that housed part of the mechanical chain-conveyor system and to ensure smooth delivery of her mines.

500|$|The {{vessel was}} named after the Levant, {{an area of the}} eastern Mediterranean. In {{selecting}} her name the Board of Admiralty continued a tradition, dating to 1644, of using geographic features. Overall, ten of the nineteen Coventry-class vessels, including Levant, [...] were named after well-known regions, rivers or towns. With few exceptions the remainder of the class were named after figures from classical antiquity, following a more modern trend initiated in 1748 by John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich in his capacity as First Lord of the Admiralty. In sailing qualities Levant was broadly comparable with French frigates of equivalent size, but with a shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her broadside guns. She was also comparatively broad-beamed which, when coupled with Adams' modifications, provided ample space for provisions, the ship's mess and a large magazine for powder and round shot. Taken together, these characteristics would enable Levant to remain at sea for long periods without resupply. She was also built with broad and heavy masts, which balanced <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull, improved stability in rough weather and made her capable of carrying a greater quantity of sail. The disadvantages of this comparatively heavy design were a decline in manoeuvrability and slower speed when sailing in light winds.|$|E
2500|$|The enemy {{ship was}} {{discovered}} {{to be the}} Furieuse, which had sailed from the Îles des Saintes on 1 April, carrying sugar and coffee to France. She was capable of carrying 48 guns, but she was armed en flute, only carrying 20 at the time. Even so, <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> broadside was considerable as she carried twelve 42-pounder carronades, two long 24-pounder guns, and six other guns of smaller caliber. She also had a much larger crew, with 200 sailors, 40 soldiers, and a detachment of troops from the 60th Regiment of the Line. Furieuse had suffered heavy damage; {{she had lost her}} masts, had five feet of water in the hold, and her casualties numbered 35 killed and 37 wounded. By contrast, Bonne Citoyenne had lost just one man killed and five wounded. Mounsey attributed the smallness of his losses to [...] "the Lowness of the Bonne Citoyenne's Hull, and being so close under the Enemy's Guns." ...|$|E

60|$|This was {{the first}} intimation Miss Oldbuck had {{received}} that the young stranger was to be their guest for the night; and such was the surprise with which she {{was struck by a}} proposal so uncommon, that, had <b>the</b> superincumbent <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head-dress, such as we before described, been less preponderant, her grey locks must have started up on end, and hurled it from its position.|$|R
2500|$|Taihō was {{the first}} Japanese {{aircraft}} carrier to feature an armored flight deck, designed to withstand multiple [...] bomb hits with minimal damage. The armor varied slightly in thickness between [...] and formed a protective lid over an enclosed upper hangar whose sides and ends were unarmored. The floor of the upper hangar was also unarmored but the lower hangar deck had [...] plating. Taihōs flight deck, measuring [...] long and [...] wide, had the largest total area of any Japanese carrier until the completion of [...] and was offset [...] to port to compensate for <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> island structure. Unlike all pre-war Japanese carriers, Taihōs flight deck was not wooden-planked. Rather, the steel deck {{was covered with a}} newly developed latex coating approximately [...] thick. This offered several advantages over wood: it was cheaper, it saved weight, it required fewer man-hours to apply and it was less likely to interfere with air operations in the event of minor damage. On the negative side, the material had only mediocre anti-skid qualities and tended to become brittle and crack over time.|$|E
2500|$|Various transformations were {{effected}} for {{the relatives}} of the Corsini pope in the Palazzo Riario alla Lungara, which had been modified for Christina, queen of Sweden in the previous century but became now the Palazzo Corsini alla Lungara, purchased on 27 July 1736 by Don Neri and Don Bartolomeo Corsini, for 70 thousand scudi from [...] Duke Riario. [...] After Christina's death in 1689, her sculpture gallery and her library were emptied. Fuga {{was called in to}} pull together the 15th and 16th-century amenagements for the Corsini brothers, works which took from 1736 to 1758 before all was finally completed. The Corsini retained Christina's bedroom just as she had left it, and the [...] "urban" [...] front in piazza Fiammetta had to be left untouched, but <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> library had produced cracks in the vaulting below it, and repairs to the existing structure were not finished until 1738 (Holste). Fuga worked on the garden front of the palazzo, beginning with work on the library wing for Neri Corsini. In 1751-53 he added an identical central block containing a theatrical divided staircase, lit with large windows that looked onto the garden parterres, which had been modified and brought up to date in 1741. Then the two were linked with a ground-floor portico. In the interiors, fuga managed in innovative ways to maintain a separation of the functional service circulation from the suites of parade rooms.|$|E
