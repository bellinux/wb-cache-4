40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} questions in epistemology and the philosophy of science is: what <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> theory and when is a theory better than another theory, given some observational data? The coherentist‟s answer would be the following twofold conjecture: (i) A theory <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> theory given some observational data iff that theory coheres with the observational data and (ii) a theory is better than another theory given some observational data iff the first theory coheres more with the observational data than the second theory. In this paper we show that <b>this</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> <b>answer.</b> More precisely, we argue that the coherence measures of Olsson (2002) and Shogenji (1999) <b>are</b> <b>good</b> measures for the purpose of comparing and evaluating theories, i. e. assessing theories. We do so by clarifying the sufficient and necessary conditions every assessment function must satisfy for being a good measure of the goodness of theories. Afterwards we will show that the coherence measures of Olsson and Shogenji <b>are</b> indeed <b>good</b> assessment functions for assessing theories. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a WEB-based didactical {{simulation}} system that can be integrated in distance training and learning systems. In particular, our system refers to real systems that can be modelled by a discrete event system. Simulation systems are addressed to the phase of learning process called interactive phase. Learner has to study the theory related to a specific system and then uses the simulation system to solve exercises. Both learners and tutors are {{deeply involved in the}} solution we discuss. Tutor defines the model to be simulated using an interface, specifies each entity, their proprieties and relationships between them and sends it to the learner. Moreover tutor establishes some parameters that the learner can change. Learner receives an “exercise” from the system and interacts with it changing the behaviour of the entities and running the simulation. In such a way the system we introduce in <b>this</b> paper <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> <b>answer</b> to the need of advanced training and learning systems, by integrating simulation techniques to build exercises that stimulate and increase learner insight and his facility in facing real problems. The simulation system we discuss is part of InTraSys project (Esprit programme EP 29082, partially funded by EC). It is important to underline that it has been identified an application domain inside which this simulation system has been introduced. Namely we refer to hi-tech employees in the field of computer network and we use a java library (the simjava library) to implement all needed modules as briefly described in the following...|$|R

The way of overcoming these resistances is to provide new antibacterial agent and/or, to provide combination of antimicrobial agent.

Contrary to most existing algorithms where perceptual correspondence setting and geometry evaluation are independent steps, the proposed algorithm is an all-in-one approach.
