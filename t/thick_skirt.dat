50|$|The Pomo Indian {{women were}} gatherers while men were hunters and fishers. They were {{somewhat}} nomadic people and liked to migrate around the California Great Plains. Wherever they found peaceful and well adapted, they began building homes. The Pomo people lived {{a very simple}} life.

5000|$|Women wear dark-colored {{panty hose}} and girls wear <b>thick</b> stockings, <b>skirts</b> with wide pleats to the ankles, and long vests {{to cover their}} {{waistline}} and hide their female shape. They are expected to wear at least three layers of clothing over their torsos.|$|R
60|$|Because she {{had nothing}} else to do, Carol went. But she was uncomfortable in the {{presence}} of the amused stares which Mrs. Flickerbaugh's raiment drew. Today, in reeking early August, she wore a man's cap, a skinny fur like a dead cat, a necklace of imitation pearls, a scabrous satin blouse, and a <b>thick</b> cloth <b>skirt</b> hiked up in front.|$|R
6000|$|APOLLO: Ay, {{when the}} strife was ended which made dim The orb I rule, {{and shook the}} solid stars, The terrors of his eye illumined heaven With {{sanguine}} light, through the <b>thick</b> ragged <b>skirts</b> [...] 5 Of the victorious darkness, as he fell: Like the last glare of day's red agony, Which, from a rent among the fiery clouds, Burns far along the tempest-wrinkled deep.|$|R
25|$|The armor {{was very}} thick {{compared}} to other tanks of the time, up to 12inches (305mm) thick on the front. This was considered heavy enough to provide protection from the German 88mm gun used as tank gun and anti-tank guns. The lower hull front had 5.25 in (130mm) of armor, and the sides 2.5 in (64mm). The suspension system and lower hull were covered with 4-in (100mm) <b>thick</b> steel <b>skirts.</b> The engine was a gasoline-powered Ford GAF V-8, delivering 500hp, at 2600 rpm though the Torqmatic transmission, which left the vehicle underpowered, geared down to {{a top speed of}} about 8mph (13km/h) and greatly limited its obstacle-climbing capability.|$|R
60|$|The {{search was}} all in vain. There were not even the traces of recent footsteps, to be seen. They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, {{commanding}} the open fields in every direction {{for three or four}} miles. There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time. A <b>thick</b> wood <b>skirted</b> the meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason.|$|R

50|$|The V8 engines {{offered on}} the {{previous}} generation were carried over, but not without major changes and improvements. Both the 4.6 and 5.4-liter Triton V8 engines received further refinements in design and overall efficiency. Expedition qualified as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) and was certified under the Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 regulations one year earlier than required. The 4.6-liter engine received an all-new redesigned cast aluminium engine block optimized for weight reduction and NVH improvements. The 5.4-liter engine received an all-new redesigned cast-iron engine block with computer designed ribbing and bracing, along with <b>thicker</b> side <b>skirts</b> and reinforcement at the oil pan flange. The new engine block helped reduce engine vibration and unwanted noise while providing refined performance.|$|R
2500|$|When Gen Posey came {{up about}} an hour by sun he sent a {{regiment}} in {{the direction in which}} the Indians had retired.

60|$|The hunter had {{no qualms}} about killing mountain-sheep, but he loved the lordly stags and would have lied to spare them. He rode on, with keen gaze {{shifting}} everywhere to catch a movement of something in this wilderness before him. If there was any living animal in sight it did not move. Wade crossed the hollow, wended a circuitous route through the upstanding forest of dead timber, and entered a <b>thick</b> woods that <b>skirted</b> {{the rim of the}} mountain. Presently he came out upon the open rim, from which the depths of green and gray yawned mightily. Far across, Old White Slides loomed up, higher now, with a dignity and majesty unheralded from below.|$|R
5000|$|Outside skirt steak: A steak {{made from}} the diaphragm. Very flavorful, but also rather tough. It {{is a part of}} the plate (situated at the cow's abdomen), the steak is long, <b>thick</b> and tender. <b>Skirt</b> steaks are not to be {{confused}} with flank steaks because they are near the sirloin and shank. Skirt steaks are used in many international cuisines: Mexican cuisine use this steak for fajitas and arrachera. In the United Kingdom it is often used as filling for Cornish pasties as well as vegetables such as carrot and potato. In Chinese cuisine it is used for stir-fries, in Spanish cuisine the steak is made for churrasco and Italian cuisine use skirt steak for making bolognese sauce as well as with tomatoes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design was}} based on the Spanish tree saddles in wide use in the United States at the time, and which had seen US Army use, {{although}} McClellan claimed that it {{was based on}} Hussar saddles he'd observed in use in the Crimean War. While McClellan did go overseas and observe the Crimean War for the US, the saddle does not closely duplicate any pattern in use by the armies in that conflict, but is very close to the widely used Spanish tree saddle, which was originally a saddle in common use in Mexico. The design underwent modifications over time, although in many ways it remained remarkably unchanged. The saddle was simple and less expensive than existing saddles, light enough not to burden the horse, but sturdy enough to give good support to the rider and his gear. It supported a rawhide-covered open seat, a <b>thick</b> leather <b>skirt,</b> wooden stirrups, and a girth strap of woolen yarn. Added accessories to the saddle sometimes included a nose bag for horse feed, a curry comb to groom the horse, a picket pin and lariat to tether the horse while grazing, saddlebags, and a [...] "thimble" [...] that held the muzzle of the cavalryman's carbine. The McClellan saddle was placed on top of a saddlecloth, shabrack, or saddle blanket.|$|R
60|$|Their route lay, for the {{distance}} of a mile, along {{the bed of the}} water-course. Though protected from any great danger of observation by the precipitous banks, and the <b>thick</b> shrubbery which <b>skirted</b> the stream, no precaution known to an Indian attack was neglected. A warrior rather crawled than walked on each flank, so as to catch occasional glimpses into the forest; and every few minutes the band came to a halt, and listened for hostile sounds, with an acuteness of organs that would be scarcely conceivable to a man in a less natural state. Their march was, however, unmolested, and they reached the point where the lesser stream was lost in the greater, without the smallest evidence that their progress had been noted. Here the scout again halted, to consult the signs of the forest.|$|R
500|$|In the pelvis, the ilium is {{long and}} low, with a convex upper profile. Its front blade is {{triangular}} and rather short; at the front end {{there is a small}} drooping point, separated by a notch from the pubic peduncle. The rear blade is roughly rectangular. The outer side of the ilium is concave, serving as an attachment surface for the Musculus iliofemoralis, the main thigh muscle. Above the hip joint, on this surface a low vertical ridge is present with conspicuous vertical grooves. The bottom of the rear blade is excavated by a narrow but deep trough forming a bony shelf for the attachment of the Musculus caudofemoralis brevis. The outer side of the rear blade does not match the inner side, which thus {{can be seen as a}} separate [...] "medial blade" [...] that in side view is visible in two places: in the corner between outer side and the ischial peduncle and as a small surface behind the extreme rear tip of the outer side of the rear blade. The pubic bone is straight. The pubic bones of both pelvis halves are connected via narrow bony skirts that originated at a rather high position on the rear side and continued downwards to a point low on the front side of the shaft. The ischium is S-shaped in side view, showing at the transition point between the two curvatures a rough boss on the outer side. On the front edge of the ischial shaft an obturator process is present in the form of a low ridge, at its top separated from the shaft by a notch. To below, this ridge continues into an exceptionally <b>thick</b> bony <b>skirt</b> at the inner rear side of the shaft, covering over half of its length. Towards the end of the shaft, this skirt gradually merges with it. The shaft eventually ends in a sizeable [...] "foot" [...] with a convex lower profile.|$|R
5000|$|I {{arrived here}} by day brake this morning 26th & found Gen. Posey's men encamped here The {{circumstances}} {{connected with the}} attack on Maj. Dement's Battalion.are as well as I can gather substantially these Yesterday morning the Maj. ordered out a small party {{for the purpose of}} examining a trail leading to the Mississippi The detachment had not proceeded more than half a mile when they discovered a few Indians at a small distance from them the men rushed on them in a disorderly manner till they came to the main body of Indians where they were secreted in a thicket on seeing the Indians the men wheeled & fled precipitately & all the efforts of Maj. Dement to rally them were unavailing (for at the time the men commenced retreating before the Indians Maj. Dement came up with a reinforcement from the garrison The Maj. stated to me that his force on the field was equal in numbers to that of the enemy After the men retreated to the fort the Indians surrounded the house & commenced killing the Horses, they kept up a constant fire on the House & Horses for 2 or 3 hours. Major Dement Lost 5 killed & several wounded but none mortally when the Indians left the ground they retreated toward their encampment on the 4 lakesWhen Gen Posey came up about an hour by sun he sent a regiment in the direction in which the Indians had retired.

5000|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals {{about half of the}} total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The ulna is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large olecranon, the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.In the pelvis, the ilium is long and low, with a convex upper profile. Its front blade is triangular and rather short; at the front end there is a small drooping point, separated by a notch from the pubic peduncle. The rear blade is roughly rectangular. The outer side of the ilium is concave, serving as an attachment surface for the Musculus iliofemoralis, the main thigh muscle. Above the hip joint, on this surface a low vertical ridge is present with conspicuous vertical grooves. The bottom of the rear blade is excavated by a narrow but deep trough forming a bony shelf for the attachment of the Musculus caudofemoralis brevis. The outer side of the rear blade does not match the inner side, which thus {{can be seen as a}} separate [...] "medial blade" [...] that in side view is visible in two places: in the corner between outer side and the ischial peduncle and as a small surface behind the extreme rear tip of the outer side of the rear blade. The pubic bone is straight. The pubic bones of both pelvis halves are connected via narrow bony skirts that originated at a rather high position on the rear side and continued downwards to a point low on the front side of the shaft. The ischium is S-shaped in side view, showing at the transition point between the two curvatures a rough boss on the outer side. On the front edge of the ischial shaft an obturator process is present in the form of a low ridge, at its top separated from the shaft by a notch. To below, this ridge continues into an exceptionally <b>thick</b> bony <b>skirt</b> at the inner rear side of the shaft, covering over half of its length. Towards the end of the shaft, this skirt gradually merges with it. The shaft eventually ends in a sizeable [...] "foot" [...] with a convex lower profile.The thighbone is straight in front view. Seen from the same direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At the lower end of the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|R
