5|$|Ambulance {{services}} that have historical origins {{such as the}} Order of St John, the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and Malteser International often use the Maltese cross to identify their ambulances. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> {{in countries such as}} Australia, where St. John Ambulance operate one state and one territory ambulance service, and all of Australia's other ambulance services use variations on a red Maltese cross.|$|E
5|$|Tail lift or ramp – Ambulances can {{be fitted}} with a tail lift or ramp in order to {{facilitate}} loading a patient without having to undertake any lifting. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> where the patient is obese or specialty care transports that require large, bulky equipment such as a neonatal incubator or hospital beds. There may also be equipment linked to this such as winches which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy in the long-term. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).|$|E
5000|$|That is, {{the voltage}} {{difference}} between the positive and floating electrodes {{is proportional to the}} electron temperature. (<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in the sixties and seventies before sophisticated data processing became widely available.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Artuzov was {{promoted}} to head the INO in 1931. Among his priorities was the development of training courses for operatives; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> because the organization was moving away from operations conducted under diplomatic cover, in favor of [...] "illegal" [...] operations.|$|R
50|$|Although {{power was}} {{shared in the}} tetrarchic system, the public image of the four {{emperors}} in the imperial college was carefully managed to {{give the appearance of}} a united empire (patrimonium indivisum). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> after the numerous civil wars of the 3rd century.|$|R
5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Stimulating the {{synthesis}} of SAMe, which aids in membrane stabilization and reduces levels of arachidonic acid. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> after an ischemia, when arachidonic acid levels are elevated.|$|E
25|$|Chaff-based filters {{have been}} {{reported}} to reduce the arsenic content of water to 3 microgram/litre. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from the underground aquifer.|$|E
50|$|By {{monitoring}} variances, {{or lack of}} variances, in underwater {{temperature or}} pressure layers, while submerged, the submarine commander could adjust and compensate for temperature layers that could affect sonar accuracy. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> when firing torpedoes at a target based strictly on a sonar fix.|$|R
25|$|With the WHA {{having already}} {{operated}} {{for a full}} season, NHL teams realized {{they would have to}} fight to sign their top picks. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in a year when the draft was considered extremely deep and the WHA was scheduled to draft players just three days after the NHL.|$|R
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{insurance}} commissioner, Shaw was primarily noted {{for his ability to}} speak to the common man, as he enjoyed traveling throughout the state to meet personally with industry workers and hear their concerns. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> during a period in which West Virginia was experiencing one of the worst economic crises in the state’s history.|$|R
25|$|Scouting or {{examining}} the rapids before running them {{is crucial to}} familiarize oneself with the stream and anticipate the challenges. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> during flood conditions when the highly increased flow have altered the normal conditions drastically.|$|E
25|$|Media {{campaigns are}} a viable means of {{spreading}} {{knowledge to the}} public of {{the health effects of}} smoking. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in relation to narghile smoking, as its positive cultural perception is a large factor in its increasing popularity.|$|E
25|$|Fission {{products}} left in {{the reactor}} absorb neutrons and thus reduce the production of new fissile fuel. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in the thorium fuel cycle with few spare neutrons and a thermal neutron spectrum, where absorption is strong.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> because Malaysia <b>is</b> usually {{covered by}} the {{equatorial}} cloud bands. Normal sun-synchronous optical satellites, which may re-visit an area only once every 7 days, will almost {{never be able to}} see the ground during their pass. As a result, much optical satellite imagery of Malaysia have more than 50% cloud cover within the image's footprint.|$|R
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the final school year, some subjects, of both practical and theoretical nature, were taught in German, and qualified graduates received dual commissions as officers in both forces. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for the combined Hussar Corps, because this arrangement provided for, in a cycle of 2 to 3 years, a fresh assignment of Hungarian-speaking officers to command Hungarian-speaking troops.|$|R
3000|$|R distribution. <b>This</b> should <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for samples {{with high}} quantum {{efficiency}} of Si-NCs emission (where k [...]...|$|R
25|$|UV-C LEDs are {{relatively}} {{new to the}} commercial market and are gaining in popularity. Due to their monochromatic nature (± 5nm) these LEDs can target a specific wavelength needed for disinfection. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> knowing that pathogens vary in their sensitivity to specific UV wavelengths. LEDs are mercury free, instant on/off, and have unlimited cycling throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|Operation {{at higher}} {{frequencies}} also helps minimizing {{the amount of}} hydrogen and oxygen generated by electrolysis of water. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> consideration for applications in liquid medium in closed compartments, where generation of gas bubbles may interfere with the procedure. For example, bubbles produced during an operation inside an eye may obscure a field of view.|$|E
25|$|Storage – Water from rivers {{may also}} be stored in {{bankside}} reservoirs for periods between {{a few days and}} many months to allow natural biological purification to take place. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> if treatment is by slow sand filters. Storage reservoirs also provide a buffer against short periods of drought or to allow water supply to be maintained during transitory pollution incidents in the source river.|$|E
50|$|The {{reduction}} in the westbound ruling grades allowed the Canadian Pacific Railway to remove the pusher locomotives that had been required on the Connaught Tunnel route. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for the unit coal trains from the Crowsnest Pass area destined for Asian markets through the port of Vancouver, British Columbia. Trains now predominantly travel east through the Connaught Tunnel and west through the Mount Macdonald Tunnel.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} some {{biochemical}} poisons that {{are made up of}} large molecules that are too big to pass through the blood–brain barrier. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in more primitive times when people often ate contaminated food. Neurotoxins such as botulinum in the food might affect peripheral nerves, but the blood–brain barrier can often prevent such toxins from reaching the central nervous system, where they could cause serious or fatal damage.|$|R
50|$|For good chromatography, {{there must}} be no {{interaction}} with the column other than that produced by size. As the demands on polymer properties increased, the necessity of getting absolute information on the molar mass and size also increased. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in pharmaceutical applications where slight changes in molar mass (e.g. aggregation) or shape may result in different biological activity. These changes can actually have a harmful effect instead of a beneficial one.|$|R
25|$|Cut {{also affects}} {{the color of}} a diamond. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> when {{considering}} fancy colored diamonds, where the slightest shift in color could vastly affect the price of the diamond. Most fancy colored diamonds are not cut in to round brilliants, because whereas the round brilliant is prized for its ability to reflect white light, the most important characteristic in a fancy colored diamond is its color, not its ability to reflect white light.|$|E
25|$|Special Operations Teams deploy to multi-casualty {{incidents}} and disasters. While other agencies may {{be trained to}} do similar, the very important distinction is the staff of NSW Ambulance also provide life saving medical intervention {{to those who are}} lost, trapped or in a precarious situation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> as Fire and Rescue NSW personnel are generally Basic Life Support (BLS) trained hence not being trained to provide acceptable levels of professional clinical care.|$|E
25|$|Medical hand hygiene {{pertains}} to the hygiene practices related to the administration of medicine and medical care that prevents or minimizes disease and the spreading of disease. The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (including bacteria or viruses) and chemicals which can cause personal harm or disease. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for people who handle food or work in the medical field, {{but it is also}} an important practice for the general public.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a decade}} of {{droughts}} in the 1930s, Federal and state governments joined with private interest group to saving North America’s rapidly disappearing wetlands. The result {{was the creation of}} many federal and state wildlife refuges. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> along the migratory bird flyways. The Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937 (also known as the Pittman-Robertson Act) helped finance land acquisition, habitat development, and refuge infrastructure at the Summer Lake Wildlife Area.|$|R
50|$|As maximum {{aperture}} {{continued to}} increase, the Double Gauss's greater symmetry promised easier aberration correction. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for SLRs because, without the parallax error of RFs, they also began offering much closer focusing distances (typically a half meter instead a whole meter). The Double Gauss became the preferred normal lens {{design in the}} 1950s with the availability of antireflection coating and new generation extra high refractive index rare earth optical glasses.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{primarily}} used {{to prevent}} the light from being extinguished, their equally important function was {{to reduce the risk}} of fire should a spark leap from the flame or the light <b>be</b> dropped. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> below deck on ships, not only because of the common presence of gunpowder but because fire in a warehouse on land would cost money but fire aboard a ship was far more likely to cost lives too.|$|R
25|$|For {{simulating}} {{molecules in}} a solvent, a choice {{should be made}} between explicit and implicit solvent. Explicit solvent particles (such as the TIP3P, SPC/E and SPC-f water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach. Using an explicit solvent is computationally expensive, requiring inclusion of roughly ten times more particles in the simulation. But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> to reproduce chemical kinetics.|$|E
25|$|Acro dancers {{commonly}} wear flexible, form-fitting {{clothing for}} both safety and aesthetic reasons. Form-fitting clothing is preferred over loose clothing because the latter {{does not move}} synchronously with the body and thus may interfere with a dancer's ability to maintain control. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> when a dancer is performing tricks, as loss of control can lead to serious injury. Aside from the safety aspect, form-fitting clothing also helps to expose a dancer's body lines, which can add significantly to the visual impact of an acro dance performance.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies in}} 2003 {{discovered}} that the immune system supports bio-film development in the large intestine. This was supported mainly {{with the fact that}} the two most abundantly produced molecules by the immune system also support bio-film production and are associated with the bio-films developed in the gut. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> because the appendix holds a mass amount of these bacterial bio-films. This discovery helps to distinguish the possible function of the appendix and the idea that the appendix can help reinoculate the gut with good gut flora.|$|E
2500|$|World Hypertension Day {{is a day}} {{designated}} {{and initiated}} by The World Hypertension League (WHL), which is itself an umbrella to organizations of 85 national hypertension societies and leagues. The day was initiated to increase the awareness of hypertension. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> {{because of the lack}} of appropriate knowledge among hypertensive patients. [...] The WHL launched its first WHD on May 14, 2005. Since 2006, the WHL has been dedicating May 17 of every year as WHD.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{a decade}} of {{droughts}} in the 1930s, Federal and state governments joined with private interest group to saving North America’s rapidly disappearing wetlands. [...] The result {{was the creation of}} many federal and state wildlife refuges. [...] <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> along the migratory bird flyways.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this constructivist {{research}} {{study was to examine}} the idea of returning to the orphanage system, as a placement option for children who have been removed from their homes. The authors felt that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> since lawmakers have <b>been</b> discussing <b>this</b> option as an answer to the question of welfare reform, and further felt that decisions such as these should not be made without the input of professionals in the social work field...|$|R
