30|$|In practice, {{the design}} of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> among {{companies}} is not homogeneous (Shastri and Stout 2008). Companies can choose from {{a broad spectrum of}} design possibilities for <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> two generic design possibilities, top-down and participative, represent the two ends of this spectrum. Lately, <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and <b>the</b> associated reporting behavior of managers has attracted considerable attention by experimental research (see Shields and Young 1993; Evans III et al. 2001; Fisher et al. 2002; Hannan et al. 2006; Matuszewski 2010; Rankin et al. 2008; Altenburger 2017). A significant part of this research has focused on the consequences of participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and not its antecedents (a comprehensive literature review is provided by Shields and Shields 1998). However, the reasons for the use of participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> have often been neglected. This paper studies the role of participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> if company’s divisions are confronted with interdependence. In particular, the company’s preference for implementing a top-down or a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is examined.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature in three ways. First, it complements the insights generated by the analytical literature on managers’ participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Given a budget-based bonus scheme, Magee (1980) establishes that a manager’s participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is detrimental for the company, because the manager maximally misreports. Baiman and Evans III (1983) highlight that the company prefers <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> only when <b>the</b> manager is induced to report the private decision-relevant information truthfully. Contrary to Magee (1980) and Baiman and Evans III (1983), the present paper illustrates that <b>the</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> might be preferred by the company due to lower incentive costs, although the managers report truthfully in <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Penno (1990) finds that the company solely prefers a manager’s participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> when <b>the</b> compensation contract can be based on the reported private information. Despite basing the compensation contract on the reported private information in <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> <b>the</b> present paper shows that <b>the</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is preferred for a low importance of coordinating the divisions’ interdependence. Kirby et al. (1991) study participation in a setting where the manager is induced to set unbiased hurdles by a compensation scheme belonging to a class of budget-based performance evaluation schemes. Participation can reduce the manager’s informational rents and, therefore, be preferred by the company. The present paper’s finding complements this result by highlighting that <b>the</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> might be preferred because of lower informational rents. Heinle et al. (2014) illustrate that the company prefers a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> whenever <b>the</b> level of information asymmetry between the manager and her superior is small. The present paper adds to this finding by showing the impact of the importance of coordinating the divisions’ operations on the design of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R

30|$|Second, {{this paper}} {{adds to the}} {{analytical}} literature on choosing an information system and the manager’s participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Christensen (1982) provides an example in which the company is better off when a risk-averse manager neither obtains private decision-relevant information nor participates in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> compared to obtaining the information and participating in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> This {{is in line with}} the present paper’s findings. While Christensen ’s finding stems from a shift in the trade-off of risk sharing and inducing effort, the present paper illustrates the impact of the importance of coordination on the design of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Penno (1984) highlights that enabling a manager to obtain private decision-relevant information is beneficial for the company when the company can design the information system’s characteristics. This result holds whether the manager participates in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> or not. In the present paper, the company cannot choose the information system’s characteristics. Thus, in line with Penno (1984), the company does not want the managers to obtain private information in <b>the</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> This is discussed in more detail in Sect. 6. In addition, the present paper shows that participation is preferred for a high importance of coordinating the interdependent divisions’ operations, although the managers are informed in <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Given a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> Rajan and Saouma (2006) examine the merits of different levels of information asymmetry between the company and the manager ranging from perfectly informative, to somewhat informative, to not informative at all. They find that the company prefers an uninformed manager when the possible levels of the manager’s productivity are similar. Otherwise, a fully informed manager is preferred. The uninformed manager’s report does not convey any information, and therefore, this setting is comparable to the present paper’s top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> This means that Rajan and Saouma (2006) show that the similarity of the productivity levels determine whether the manager participates in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Holding <b>the</b> productivity levels’ similarity constant, the present paper depicts the effect of the importance of coordination on the design of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
30|$|This article {{studies the}} role of {{participation}} in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> when <b>the</b> company has to coordinate two interdependent divisions. The focus lies {{on the design of}} <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> (top-down vs. participative <b>budgets)</b> and <b>the</b> underlying supply of information. This is studied in a principal agent model where two divisions (agents) jointly generate earnings. With <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> <b>the</b> company (principal) implements an information system that provides the division managers with private information. Two economic effects occur. First, the company can benefit from the division managers’ private information by perfectly coordinating the divisions’ operations. Second, the company has to induce the managers to provide productive effort and with participation, to additionally report truthfully. Thus, the company incurs incentive costs. <b>The</b> two considered <b>budgeting</b> <b>processes</b> trade off these effects diametrically. For a low importance of coordination, the company prefers <b>the</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and not installing an information system that allows the managers to obtain private information. Otherwise, <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is used. In contrast to the company, managers always prefer <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> model predicts that a higher earnings potential increases the attractiveness of participative budgets.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} alternative ways of controlling costs that are more reliable, updated and useful than traditional <b>budgeting.</b> To identify <b>the</b> advantages and disadvantages of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> To determine whether a South African company combines different planning methods to suit its specific planning needs. To determine how key performance drivers for planning purposes are chosen in the event that the company makes use of key performance drivers. Finally, to determine the relevance of traditional budgeting when combined with alternative planning methods for a South African company. This study should contribute greatly to how unique <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> has become in the modern economy.

30|$|Using Proposition 3, {{the model}} {{predicts that the}} {{importance}} of coordination is positively associated with the managers’ participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> For a high (low) importance of coordination, (no) participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is expected to be observed in practice. Neither the importance of coordination nor the design of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is usually disclosed in the annual report or other public sources. Thus, a case study or a survey seems appropriate for testing the model’s empirical implication regarding the impact of the importance of coordination on the design of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> When archival data are used for testing the model’s empirical implication, proxies for the importance of coordination and the design of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> need to be used. A proxy for the use of <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> can be a cooperative management style which is sometimes referred to in annual reports. Next, two possible proxies for the importance of coordination are discussed. First, the importance of coordination is presumably positively associated with the divisions’ level of interdependence. For example, the divisions of a conglomerate might be less interdependent than the divisions of a company operating in a single industry. Then, the model predicts that conglomerates use a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> at <b>the</b> division manager level less than companies operating in a single industry. That is, operating in a single industry might be a proxy for a high importance of coordinating the interdependent divisions. Second, both a high relevance of R&D and a large proportion of new products in the company’s sales mix suggest a large interdependence of the R&D and the marketing division, and thus, a high importance of coordination. The relevance of R&D can be captured by the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue. This proxy presumes that no survivor bias occurs.|$|R
