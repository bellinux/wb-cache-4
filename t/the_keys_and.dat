5|$|A {{key action}} which {{physically}} connects <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> the windchests is a mechanical or tracker action. Connection is achieved {{through a series}} of rods called trackers. When the organist depresses a key, the corresponding tracker pulls open its pallet, allowing wind to enter the pipe.|$|E

50|$|Forward {{chaining}} {{would teach}} the subject first to insert <b>the</b> <b>key.</b> Once that task is mastered, {{they are told}} to insert <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> <b>and</b> taught to turn it. Once that task is mastered, they are told to perform the first two, then taught to open the door. Backwards chaining would involve the teacher first inserting <b>and</b> turning <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subject then being taught to open the door. Once that is learned, the teacher inserts <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subject is taught to turn it, then opens the door as the next step. Finally, the subject is taught to insert <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> <b>and</b> they turn and open the door. Once {{the first step is}} mastered, the entire task has been taught. Total task chaining would involve teaching the entire task as a single series, prompting through all steps. Prompts are faded (reduced) at each step as they are mastered.|$|R

50|$|Blowfish {{is notable}} among block ciphers for its {{expensive}} key setup phase. It starts off with subkeys {{in a standard}} state, then uses this state to perform a block encryption using part of <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> <b>and</b> uses <b>the</b> result of that encryption (really, a hashing) to replace some of the subkeys. Then it uses this modified state to encrypt another part of <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> <b>and</b> uses <b>the</b> result to replace more of the subkeys. It proceeds in this fashion, using a progressively modified state to hash <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>and</b> replace bits of state, until all subkeys have been set.|$|R

A critical edition was published in 2004 by Bärenreiter, edited by Heide Volckmar-Waschk, who uses modern clefs, but shows the original clefs and retains <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> note values.|$|E
