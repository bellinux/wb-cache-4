5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|Some of them, such as Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris, were heralded in {{the popular}} press as the tenth planet, failing to receive {{widespread}} scientific recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> of as 27% more massive than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Achanduin Castle west of Achnacroish is also thought to {{date back to}} the 13th century. Built by the MacDougalls around 1290, who held it {{throughout}} the 14th century, the castle is <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> to have been held by the Bishops of Argyll until the mid 16th century. The castle overlooks the island of Bernera.|$|E

5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Christian Hendrik Persoon {{published}} the first description of Geastrum pectinatum in 1801. In 1860, Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis described the species Geastrum biplicatum (originally named Geaster biplicatus), based on specimens sent {{to them by}} Charles Wright that he obtained from the Bonin Islands during the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition. Japanese mycologist Sanshi Imai considered this identical with G.pectinatum in a 1936 publication. In 1959, mycologist J.T. Palmer reported comparing the original specimen collected by Persoon with fresh samples of what were <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> to be the distinct species G.plicatum and G.tenuipes (named by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1838 and 1848, respectively) and concluded the three specimens were synonymous; the original Persoon specimen was then designated as the neotype.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September 1987, the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles {{performed}} The Rite {{based on}} a reconstruction of Nijinsky's 1913 choreography, until <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> lost beyond recall. The performance resulted from years of research, primarily by Millicent Hodson, who pieced the choreography together from the original prompt books, contemporary sketches and photographs, and the recollections of Marie Rambert and other survivors. Hodson's version has since been performed by the Kirov Ballet, at the Mariinsky Theatre in 2003 and later that year at Covent Garden. In its 2012–13 season the Joffrey Ballet gave centennial performances at numerous venues, including the University of Texas on 5–6 March 2013, the University of Massachusetts on 14 March 2013, and with The Cleveland Orchestra on 17–18 August 2013.|$|E

5|$|Reid {{considered}} the genus allied to Leucogyrophana, <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> {{to belong to}} the family Coniophoraceae. Marinus Anton Donk, in a monograph published the next year, agreed and placed it close to Serpula and Coniophora; these genera are now known to represent early-diverging lineages in the Boletales order. However, the white spore print and small, smooth, and hyaline spores are not characteristic of species in the Coniophoraceae. In a large-scale phylogenetic analysis published in 2006, Podoserpula nested far from them in the Plicaturopsis clade, an evolutionarily related group of early-diverging members of the Agaricales order. Other taxa in this clade include Plicaturopsis and Sclerotium rolfsii. The entire clade was later separated into three smaller orders, Podoserpula becoming a member of the Amylocorticiales along with mostly corticioid genera such as Amylocorticium and Serpulomyces.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a case}} of {{shingles}} in February 1981, Bobbi Campbell {{suffered a}} succession of unusual illnesses, including leukopenia later that summer. After hiking the Pinnacles National Monument with his boyfriend in September that year, he noticed on his feet lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> of as a rare cancer of elderly Jewish men but with alarming numbers of cases appearing in California and New York and now known to be closely associated with AIDS. He was formally diagnosed as having KS by dermatologist Marcus Conant on October 8, 1981. This would become Conant's first diagnosis of a patient with what would become known as AIDS; Campbell brought Conant a rose every year to commemorate the anniversary of his diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving as}} a county judge, Truman wanted to run for Governor or Congress, but Pendergast {{rejected}} these ideas. Truman <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> he might serve out his career in some well-paying county sinecure, but circumstances changed when Pendergast reluctantly backed him in the 1934 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate after four other potential candidates turned him down. In the primary, Truman defeated Congressmen John J. Cochran and Jacob L. Milligan with the solid support of Jackson County, which was crucial to his candidacy, as were the contacts he had made statewide as a county official, Mason, military reservist, {{and member of the}} American Legion. In the general election, Truman defeated incumbent Republican Roscoe C. Patterson by nearly 20 percentage points as part of a continuing wave of pro-New Deal Democrats elected in response to the Great Depression.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, Sullivan, ageing and unwell, {{resigned}} as {{conductor of the}} Leeds triennial music festival, a post which he had held since 1880. He believed that Stanford's motive for accepting the conductorship of the Leeds Philharmonic Society the previous year was to position himself {{to take over the}} festival. Stanford later felt obliged to write to The Times, denying that he had been party to a conspiracy to oust Sullivan. Sullivan was by <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> to be a dull conductor of other composers' music, and although Stanford's work as a conductor was not without its critics, he was appointed in Sullivan's place. He remained in charge until 1910. His compositions for the festival included Songs of the Sea (1904), Stabat Mater (1907) and Songs of the Fleet (1910). New works by other composers presented at Leeds during Stanford's years in charge included pieces by Parry, Mackenzie, and seven of Stanford's former pupils. The best-known new work from Stanford's time is probably Vaughan Williams's A Sea Symphony, premiered in 1910.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{himself had}} {{high hopes for}} his new project. He lacked the {{technical}} skills to program it alone, so instead came up with concepts and consulted technicians {{to see if they}} were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different manners and react in various ways. Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too complex, though he had some difficult suggestions himself, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen (eventually found too hard to program, though a similar concept would appear in the aforementioned Popeye arcade game). Miyamoto <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> of using sloped platforms, barrels and ladders. When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make the game repeatedly. Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto's design, creating a total of approximately 20kilobytes of content. Yukio Kaneoka composed a simple soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.|$|E

5|$|United played {{cup holders}} Arsenal in the semi-final at Villa Park on 11 April. Neither team {{was able to}} score even after extra time had been played, {{therefore}} the match was decided in a replay four days later. Beckham opened the scoring for United with a long range effort, but Dennis Bergkamp drew Arsenal level with a shot that deflected off United's centre back Jaap Stam. Arsenal <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> they had taken the lead when Nicolas Anelka put {{the ball in the}} back of United's net, but the goal was ruled out for offside. United's captain Roy Keane was red-carded for two bookable offences and United played the last thirty minutes of normal time with ten men. In injury time {{at the end of the}} second half, Phil Neville fouled Ray Parlour in the penalty area. Peter Schmeichel parried away Bergkamp's resultant spot kick and the game went into extra time.|$|E
5|$|The first {{potential}} {{evidence for}} herding or flocking as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups {{in addition to}} birds was the 1878 discovery of 31Iguanodon bernissartensis, ornithischians that were <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> to have perished together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned. Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-bills (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the American bison or the African Springbok. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in Oxfordshire, England, {{although there is no}} evidence for specific herd structures. Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in Inner Mongolia that has yielded the remains of over 20 Sinornithomimus, from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down large prey. However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the taphonomic evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as Deinonychus and Allosaurus can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Newport secured {{what was}} <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> to be Europe's largest-ever inward {{investment}} when the LG Group announced a £1.7 billion project creating 6,100 jobs, {{and supported by}} public sector grants. Facilities were built on the Celtic Lakes business and science park, but market conditions led to the semiconductor plant never opening, and the CRT plant eventually closed in 2003. In 2005 Irish radiator manufacturer Quinn Group bought the former LG Phillips building, which became its European base.|$|E

25|$|In {{the study}} of certain social forms of initiation, such as hazing in college fraternities and sororities, {{laboratory}} experiments in psychology suggest that severe initiations produce cognitive dissonance. Dissonance is <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> to produce feelings of strong group attraction among initiates after the experience, {{because they want to}} justify the effort used. Rewards during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity. As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce conformity among new members. Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of affiliation.|$|E
25|$|After Eric Schlosser {{finished}} writing Fast Food Nation, reporters {{kept asking}} him about Upton Sinclair, {{and although he}} had read Sinclair's The Jungle, {{he did not know}} about his other works or anything about Sinclair himself. He decided to read most of Sinclair's works, and eventually read the novel Oil!, which he loved. Schlosser, who found the book to be exciting and thought it would make a great film, sought out the Sinclair estate and purchased the film rights. He <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> that he would try to find a director that was as passionate about the book as he was, but Paul Thomas Anderson approached him first.|$|E
25|$|The {{road haulage}} operators, {{who had no}} such restrictions, could privately {{negotiate}} any rate they wished to undercut the railways' published price lists, and take away their business while offering door-to-door delivery. The train companies had previously relied on horse-drawn trailers for local goods deliveries from the station; to compete they bought in motorised local delivery vehicles such as the Karrier 'Cob' and Scammell 'Mechanical Horse'. It was <b>then</b> <b>thought</b> that no large railway could operate at a profit unless {{more than half of}} its traffic was freight, and thus any reduction in the freight business would also affect the viability of the passenger business.|$|E
