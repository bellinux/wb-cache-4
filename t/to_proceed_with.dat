5|$|In August 1947, Chadwick {{was killed}} in the crash of the Avro Tudor 2 {{prototype}} and was succeeded by Sir William Farren. Reductions in wing thickness made it impossible to incorporate the split bomb bays and stacked engines, thus the engines were placed side-by-side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft's centreline. Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Though considered the best option, contract placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established. Instructions <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> their Type 660 which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more conventional design would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.|$|E

Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> the Architectural Review scheme once legal matters had been dealt with.|$|E

He later added that no changes were made in the script when Mohanlal agreed.|$|E

At the same time, it must be understood that the period of computational time to complete the simulation run would also be longer. This is due to the significantly increased calculation workload and solving of the governing equations in the model at each time step.|$|R
