5|$|In <b>that</b> <b>situation,</b> Levski's {{assistant}} Dimitar Obshti robbed an Ottoman postal convoy in the Arabakonak pass on 22 September 1872, without {{approval from}} Levski or {{the leadership of}} the movement. While the robbery was successful and provided IRO with 125,000 groschen, Obshti and the other perpetrators were soon arrested. The preliminary investigation and trial revealed the revolutionary organisation's size and its close relations with BRCC. Obshti and other prisoners made a full confession and revealed Levski's leading role.|$|E

Only 32% issued bills and only 10% used metering. In 2005, the government defined guidelines for basic water supply and sanitation policy in rural areas to increase coverage and improve quality in those areas.|$|E
5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in <b>that</b> <b>situation</b> would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E
5|$|He was accepted, and {{although}} his appointment delighted Murray, {{the government was}} very concerned {{at the loss of}} a good Attorney General. In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in <b>that</b> <b>situation</b> he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in <b>that</b> <b>situation</b> that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to collect the daily {{stressful}} situations and its coping strategies in elderly home residents. Sixty-two residents aged over 63 were interviewed.

Therefore, the interpersonal differences may be in the frequencies of encountering the daily stressful situations...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Furr and Funder (2004) made a {{distinction}} between objectively similar situations and subjectively similar <b>situations.</b> They noted <b>that</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> are objectively similar are identical and can be experimentally manipulated or defined. Conversely, <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> are subjectively similar are based on perceptions or experiences that lead an individual to believe <b>that</b> the two <b>situations</b> are similar. In {{the context of the}} present study, the two situations of interest (work roles and parenting roles) can be seen as subjectively similar and, therefore, likely to foster transference of leadership qualities from parenting experiences.|$|R

Danny does; and when he becomes a hit at the King Creole, Maxie tries to hire him. Danny declines his offer out of loyalty to Charlie.|$|E
5|$|On signing for Roma, Marquinhos {{described}} himself as a quick player with a good sense of position who knew how to impose himself on a game. He named Thiago Silva as his role model. In March 2015, Marquinhos told FourFourTwo that despite his average height for a defender, he compensated with honing his strength and timing, attributes he learnt from PSG assistant manager Claude Makélélé. He praised manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in set pieces and teaching them the correct positioning in <b>that</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a double play or triple play. An error is not charged in <b>that</b> <b>situation</b> if a wild throw allows the runner to reach safely. If a wild throw allows the runner to advance an additional base, an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a double play or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E

5|$|The coif was {{the main}} symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most {{recognisable}} name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif was white and made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, {{not even in the}} presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In <b>that</b> <b>situation</b> he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white cloth to the top of the wig, representing the coif.|$|E
5|$|The {{part of the}} Sierra Nevada {{where the}} park is located was long {{considered}} to be a physical barrier to European American settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. <b>That</b> <b>situation</b> changed in 1848 after gold was discovered in the foothills west of the range. Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area during the ensuing California Gold Rush. Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed, and disease brought by the newcomers spread rapidly through indigenous populations. Extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government.|$|E
