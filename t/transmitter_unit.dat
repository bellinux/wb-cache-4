40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{user-centric}} position sensing system {{that is based on}} asynchronous, independent ultrasonic beacons. These stationary <b>transmitter</b> <b>units</b> are small, cheap to manufacture, and have power requirements low enough to run each from a small solar cell and a nearby light source. Each beacon is programmed to emit a short, 40 kHz ultrasonic signal with a unique transmission period. The mobile receiver unit first associates a received signal with a beacon based on the observed periodicity, then measures the Doppler shift in the periodicity that results from movements of the receiver. Using Doppler shifts from a number of different beacons, the receiver is able to estimate both its position and velocity by employing a particle filter. In this paper, we describe our positioning algorithm, the hardware, and proof-of-concept results. ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{increase}} {{space for}} a radio operator the rotating turret of the PzKpfw IB was eliminated and replaced with a larger fixed [...] "box" [...] superstructure. This allowed room for map boards, paperwork and a more powerful FuG6 radio transmitter {{in addition to the}} earlier FuG2 radio (Panzer I's had only FuG2 radio receivers). Despite these modifications the vehicle's interior remained small, a factor leading to its rapid replacement by conversions of larger tanks. The cramped quarters also made operation of the vehicle's single ball-mounted MG13 or MG34 machine gun virtually impossible. Because of this, most SdKfz 265 were also equipped with pistol ports, and many had their machine guns removed entirely. A large frame antenna was mounted to the hull of many early version SdKfz 265s. The antenna gave the upgraded radio <b>transmitter</b> <b>units</b> better range and reception.|$|R
50|$|At modern {{transmitters}} or at {{low power}} transmitters situated in very small transmitter buildings the <b>transmitter,</b> matching <b>unit</b> and mast radiator {{can be very}} close together {{and even in the}} same building. This measure saves on feeders, land area and increases the efficiency of the transmitter if only one mast radiator is in use.|$|R
50|$|Wherever {{there are}} two polarizations of radio signals (Horizontal and Vertical), the {{transmitted}} and received radio signal {{to and from the}} antenna are said to be “orthogonal”. This means that the modulation planes of the two radio signal waves are at 90 degrees angles to each other. The OMT device is used to separate two equal frequency signals, of high and low signal power.Protective separation is essential as the <b>transmitter</b> <b>unit</b> would seriously damage the very sensitive low micro-voltage (µV), front-end receiver amplifier unit at the antenna.|$|E
50|$|Latest {{generation}} transmissometer technology {{makes use}} of a co-located forward scatter visibility sensor on the <b>transmitter</b> <b>unit</b> to allow for higher accuracies over an Extended Meteorological Optical Range or EMOR. After 10,000 meters the accuracy of transmissometer technology diminishes, and at higher visibilities forward scatter visibility sensor technology is more accurate. The co-location of the two sensors allows for the most accurate technology to be used when reporting current visibility. The forward scatter sensor also enables auto-alignment and auto-calibration of the transmissometer device.Hence it is very useful for oceanography and water optics study.|$|E

40|$|Millimeter wave {{frequencies}} {{are proposed}} as carriers of microcell future mobile systems. High frequencies {{in the region}} of 60 - 62 Ghz are suggested. A serious difficulty in this context is the lack of sufficient gain in active devices. Both on receiver and <b>transmitter</b> <b>units</b> this difficulty is faced. Mixing, amplification, carrier recovery and modulation / demodulation subsytems are required to be operational at these higher frequencies. Presently the MMIC 's show also limited performance. In this report an alternative approach active processing technique is examined based on an injection locking in Gunn oscillator. A non-linear analysis is applied to determine the fundamental properties of injection locking in Gunn oscillator performance under the influence of an external signal. Details of waveguide action is taken into account by solving the corresponding boundary condition problem. Finally experimental results are presented for a 30 GHz oscillator. © 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a single frequency multitransmitter telemetry system that will deliver {{a substantial amount of}} data at low cost. The invention consists essentially of a plurality of sensor <b>transmitter</b> <b>units</b> at different locations, with individual signal conditioning and logic, which send sampled data signals {{to a single}} receiver. The transmitters operate independently on the same frequency in a frequency shift keying modulation system and are not synchronized to the receiver. The problem of reception of data from more than one transmitter simultaneously is solved by discarding the data - when there is overlap of data from two or more transmitters, the data is discarded and when there is no overlap the data is retained. The invention utilizes a unique overlap detection technique to determine if data should be retained or discarded. When data is received from a transmitter, it goes into a shift register...|$|R
5000|$|Some complex {{scale models}} use a {{fly-by-wire}} approach {{to allow a}} multitude of extra working features. A radio-control <b>transmitter's</b> encoder <b>unit</b> can be adapted, with no RF signal board present, to send its control signals along insulated control lines, instead of broadcasting them using radio frequencies. If signals are sent down the lines, the normal serial multiplexing of the control signals by such an adapted RC <b>transmitter's</b> encoder <b>unit,</b> solely sending those signals along the usual duo or trio of control lines, gets picked up by decoding gear in the model - usually adapted from an RC receiver, without an RF [...] "front end" [...] section - and permits many functions to be controlled {{without the use of}} additional lines. Standard servos can then be used in the model. From 2013, in the USA, the radio control [...] "over the airwaves" [...] of any moveable feature of control-line Scale or Carrier models (except the elevator) is permitted - this may spread to Europe and beyond in time.|$|R
50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} wave {{sent in the}} atmosphere is an EM wave of the form shown in figure on page 10 of. Such wave is generated by an oscillator in the <b>transmitter</b> <b>unit</b> and then transferred through wave guides to the antenna, which radiates it in the atmosphere. The theory of propagating waves in rectangular shaped waveguides having a vertical axis of symmetry shows that by setting appropriate dimensions of the waveguide, the resulting electric field is propagating parallel to the interior space of the waveguide in the vertical direction, having a y sinusoidal in time component (transverse wave).|$|E
50|$|A baby monitor, {{also known}} as a baby alarm, is a radio system used to {{remotely}} listen to sounds made by an infant.

Some baby monitors provide two-way communication which allows the parent to speak back to the baby (parent talk-back). Some allow music to be played to the child. A monitor with a video camera and receiver is often called a baby cam.|$|E
50|$|Rezence (pronounced reh-zense) is an {{interface}} standard {{developed by the}} Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP) for wireless electrical power transfer based {{on the principles of}} magnetic resonance.

5000|$|The Ampliphase design, {{originally}} {{proposed by}} H.

Unlike most other commercial designs of AM broadcast <b>transmitters</b> Ampliphase <b>units</b> do not require modulation transformers nor modulation reactors, thereby saving initial cost. The down-side is the units require more maintenance. Essentially, the Ampliphase concept trades lower [...] "capital" [...] cost for higher [...] "expense" [...] cost, while achieving a modest improvement in efficiency. KFBK still maintains an RCA BTA-50H (the [...] "last gasp" [...] of the Ampliphase concept) as an auxiliary transmitter, but its main transmitter is a solid-state Harris unit, a prototype for which later became the DX-50.

50|$|Because the KW-26 sent a {{continuous}} stream of bits, it offered traffic-flow security. Someone intercepting the ciphertext stream {{had no way}} to judge how many real messages were being sent, making traffic analysis impossible. One problem with the KW-26 was the need to keep the receiver and <b>transmitter</b> <b>units</b> synchronized. The crystal controlled clock in the KW-26 was capable of keeping both ends of the circuit in sync for many hours, even when physical contact was lost between the sending and receiving units. This capability made the KW-26 ideally suited for use on unreliable HF radio circuits. However, when the units did get out of sync, a new key card had to be inserted at each end. The benefit of traffic-flow security was lost each time new cards were inserted. In practice, operational protocol led to the cards being replaced more often than was desirable to maintain maximum security of the circuit. This was especially so on radio circuits, where operators often changed the cards many times each day in response to a loss of radio connectivity. In any case, it was necessary to change the cards at least once per day to prevent the cypher pattern from repeating.|$|R
