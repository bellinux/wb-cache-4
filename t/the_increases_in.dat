30|$|From {{the results}} of the linear elastic analyses, it appears that <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> {{performance}} of each design does not always match <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> weight of <b>the</b> joint piece volume.

The joint designs J 3 s and J 3 r showing approximately the same performance and the same weight (although both are lightly higher for J 3 r), the results from the linear elastic analyses suggest that both designs can be applied in trusses with equal performances.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{economic}} ramifications of such restrictions, there are those, including the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, who argue that the negative economic effects of emission controls outweigh the environmental benefits.

In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single personal allowance, marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased. These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969–70 and 1970–71. Increases in the age exemption and dependant relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly. In 1967, new tax concessions were introduced for widows.|$|E
