Two of the diets were naturally contaminated and {{were obtained by}} collecting mayflies from Lake Erie (ON, Canada) and emerald shiners from the Detroit River (MI, USA). The remaining diets consisted of commercial fish pellets (lipid contents from 6. 7 to 24 %) that were contaminated by spiking with a PCB mixture. Experimental fish were held individually to quantify {{the amount of food}} consumed per fish and, following a 48 -h fasting period to facilitate food digestion and assimilation; AEs were determined by mass balance. Fish fed the benthic invertebrate food exhibited the highest PCB AEs (70 - 101 %) and were significantly elevated compared to the other diet treatments (AEs ranging from 23 to 87 %). The PCB AEs for fish fed emerald shiners did not differ from those fed pellet formulations. Variation among PCB AEs was not related to diet lipid content. For all diet treatments, PCB AEs were significantly related to chemical hydrophobicity. The relationship between chemical AE and n-octanol/water partition coefficient (KOW) was best explained by a linear model compared to a two-phase resistance model. Overall, PCB AEs were observed to be dependent on both diet type and chemical hydrophobicity, with both factors contributing nearly equally to the variation measured in this <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameter.</b> © 2009 SETAC...|$|E
40|$|There is {{discussion}} {{concerning the}} cardiac safety of citalopram in an overdose. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the toxic effects and toxicokinetic parameters of citalopram in an overdose as a single drug and in combination with other drugs. Cases observed between 1997 and 2006 were evaluated. Patient demographics, ingested doses, serum concentrations of citalopram, coingested drugs, and clinical parameters were acquired. Outcomes were observed symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, central nervous system, and cardiovascular system. Poisoning Severity Score was used to evaluate severity of every intoxicated patient. Individual <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> values were calculated. Twenty-nine cases of citalopram overdose were observed; three cases had incomplete data so that 26 cases were evaluable. The ingested amount ranged from 200 to 4960 mg. Blood concentrations ranged from 0. 21 to 7. 5 mg/L with 20 minutes to 8 hours between suggested time of ingestion and blood sampling. Most frequently reported symptoms were drowsiness (seven cases), tachycardia (15 cases), QTc prolongation (eight cases), decrease of consciousness (eight cases), and seizures (four cases). Median length of hospital stay was 3 days (range, 1 - 8 days). Of the 26 evaluated cases, two fatalities occurred, one because of a cardiac arrest and one as a result of a respiratory arrest. According to Poisoning Severity Score, severity of intoxication was minor in three patients (11 %), moderate in nine patients (35 %), and severe in 14 patients (54 %). Severity was mainly caused by neurologic and respiratory effects. Elimination half-life was prolonged but did not correlate with the amount of ingestion. Citalopram intoxications seem to proceed more severely than is known for other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor intoxications, causing drowsiness, coma, and seizures in overdose. Cardiac toxicity is generally mild. Therefore, we recommend seizure precautions and intensive care unit admission with cardiac monitoring for citalopram-intoxicated patients.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is in {{developing}} biology–based tools for environmental monitoring and risk assessment associated with diesel oil contamination in tropical coastal habitats. Prediction of impacts is generally conducted via environmental monitoring, in which environmental quality over time and space is assessed by repeated observations. Prediction of risk is included within the risk assessment process, which is the procedure that estimates the likelihood or the actual adverse effects caused by anthropogenic activities on ecosystems. During the past decades, oil production has increased, and so has the risk of oil pollution, either through produced water discharges, accidents, or other diffuse sources. This risk is notably high in tropical and subtropical areas, which represent around 60 % of total global oil production. Petroleum is composed of a mixture of various mono– and polycyclic–aromatic hydrocarbons, toxic chemicals consisting {{of two or more}} fused benzene rings. The mode of action of PAHs is classified as narcotic, meaning that PAHs are expected to penetrate cell membranes and alter the lipid bilayer, ultimately disturbing the normal function of cells. On average, nearly 85 % of the total petrogenic PAH input to the marine environment origins from petroleum consumption or diffuse sources. Among marine coastal habitats, tropical and subtropical coastal regions are home to speciose and highly productive ecosystems. Estuaries are among the most productive of marine ecosystems and are areas with high economic and ecological importance. Being economic centers for coastal communities that harvest biotic resources, tropical and subtropical estuarine intertidal environments (i. e. mangroves, salt marshes, and unvegetated tidal flats) are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance. Specifically, chronic diesel oil contamination that leaks from marine vessels poses a real risk to the species inhabiting the Paranaguá Estuarine System (PES) in southern Brazil, which host the third largest harbor of Brazil, and receives around 200 ships per month. Oil contamination from such diffuse sources, is an untraceable chronic source of contamination that can occur anywhere a ship travels and may have different effects, depending on the physical–chemical characteristics of the environment into which the oil is released. Therefore, tools for biomonitoring the effects of short and long–term exposure to diffuse oil contamination are much needed. The general objectives of this work are to validate the use of antioxidant biomarkers as tools for biomonitoring coastal estuarine habitats in Brazil, as also to compare the sensitivity and risk assessment metrics from species distributed from subtropical, temperate and Arctic regions exposed to a toxic PAH. Biomarkers are defined as measures of exposure or effect expressed at the sub–organism level (i. e. biochemical, cellular, physiological or behavioral) in taxa under environmental stress. We proposed the use of antioxidant biomarkers as sub-lethal measures of exposure at the sub-organism level. Before implementing antioxidant biomarkers in biomonitoring programs, several conceptual and methodological issues needed to be addressed. Namely, it is important to determine their basal levels of activity, to select an appropriate sentinel species for their measurement, and to determine the best group of biomarkers for a multi–biomarker approach. Also, it is necessary to establish a correlation between the presence of diesel oil contamination and the activity of selected biomarkers. This work addresses these points, first by conducting a seasonal baseline of biomarker values, and then by performing experimental manipulations both in the lab and the field. Because the activity of antioxidant enzymes is involved in cell homeostasis, they are expected to vary in relation to reproductive cycles, food availability, and environmental drivers. Thus an initial screening in the activity of 5 different subtropical species was conducted at two seasons (austral winter and austral summer) at two different locations that have different levels of organic and PAH contamination. Then, experimental manipulations that tested the correlation between the antioxidant response and diesel oil exposure were conducted. The first experiment characterized the antioxidant biomarker response in two common species under laboratory conditions; while in the second experiment, the antioxidant biomarker response in the clam species Anomalocardia flexuosa was evaluated after chronic exposure to diesel oil in situ. The significant changes in the biomarkers activities following exposure suggested a causal relationship between biomarkers and diesel oil contamination, with the activities of GST and SOD being the most sensitive to experimental manipulations. These cause–effect relationships indicate {{that it is possible to}} use these biomarkers as tools in biomonitoring programs at PES. However, it was noticeable that natural variability is a major confounding source of variation, which in our experiments was handled by including appropriate control treatments for comparing the response from the experimental treatment with that from natural conditions. As part of the outcomes of this work, a guiding framework for selecting biomarkers and testing their causal relationship to contamination and specific recommendations for designing experiments for biomonitoring purposes are provided. Briefly, well–designed experiments have a clear hypothesis to test, for which the measurement of environmental parameters at an adequate sampling intensity is feasible, given financial and logistic constraints. The statistical power of the design must be considered before starting sampling and the design should include spatial and temporal variability. Regarding differences in risk assessment metrics following the exposure to 2 – Methylnaphthalene, our results indicate that No–Effect Concentration (NEC) values — concentration thresholds use to assess species sensitivity to toxic exposure— were not significantly different among the studied species and differences among regions were not identified. However, when defining sensitivity as the time to observe an effect —a metric that includes the NEC and a <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> like the elimination rate— differences in sensitivity among regions were detected. In summary, species from Arctic to subtropical regions have similar NEC thresholds, but the time they need to reach that threshold varies, and this variation is related to taxonomy and trophic level. Arctic species had on average shorter times for starting to show an effect, followed by subtropical and finally temperate species. Our results suggest that assuming that species sensitivities from Arctic, and temperate regions is sufficiently similar to those from subtropical regions might be incorrect. We suggest that in in the search for metrics for safeguarding the marine ecosystem, attention should not be given only to concentration thresholds. Concentration thresholds might be providing assessors an inaccurate metric for species sensitivity, which is ultimately underestimating the risk to marine and estuarine ecosystems...|$|E

Ketoconazole plasma concen-trations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. <b>Toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> were determined from the plasma concentration-time data with the 3 P 97 software package. Activities of serum glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase and glutamate-oxalate-transaminase and hepatic histopathological changes were observed at 36 h after administration.

40|$|In risk {{assessment}} of risk chemicals, variability in susceptibility in the population is an important aspect. The health hazard of a pollutant {{is related to the}} internal exposure to the chemical, i. e. the target dose, rather than the external exposure.

Furthermore, variability in target dose may be estimated by introducing variability in the physiological, anatomical, and biochemical parameters of the model. Data on these <b>toxicokinetic</b> model <b>parameters</b> may be found in the scientific literature. Since the early seventies, a large number of experimental inhalation studies of the kinetics of several volatiles in human volunteers have been performed at the National Institute for Working Life in Solna. To this day, only very limited analyses of these extensive data have been performed. A Bayesian analysis makes it possible to merge a priori knowledge from the literature with the information in experimental data. If combined with population PBPK modeling, the Bayesian approach may yield posterior estimates of the <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> for each subject, {{as well as for the}} population. One way of producing these estimates is by so-called Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The aim of the thesis was to apply the MCMC technique on previously published experimental data. Another objective was to assess the reliability of PBPK models in general by the combination of the extensive data and Bayesian population techniques.

Plasma concentration-time curves were best described by an open three-compartment model, and the <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> of the two enantiomers were significantly different. Different metabolism behaviors were observed in the degradations of FE and FA in the plasma and liver microsomes in vitro, which were helpful for understanding the stereoselective mechanism.

It 2 ̆ 019 s a first step to analyse the processes which {{are involved in the}} development of DNA adducts and might therefore lead to the development of cancer. The complete research depends on investigations with animals in vivo and in vitro, so that a critical step is the extrapolation from experimental animals to the human organism. Besides the investigation of the interspecific differences, the intraspecific and the interoccasion variability have to be analysed to avoid serious errors in the {{determination of}} the human risk. The aim of extrapolation from one species to an other requires a characterisation of the interesting processes which is valid for the whole species, i. e. population mean parameters instead of sets of parameters for different individuals, occasions and concentrations of the interesting chemical. The theory of hierarchical models, basically the work of Racine-Poon et al. (1985, 1986, 1990), provides a procedure, which incorporates both, modelling of the variability structure and reduction of complexity in terms of estimates of population mean parameter vectors.

40|$|KEY WORDS norfloxacin; {{neurotoxicity}}; electroencephalogram; toxicokinetics; rats AIM: To {{study the}} neurotoxicity and toxicokinetics of norfloxacin (NFLX) in freely moving rats. METHODS: Rats were assigned randomly to four treatment groups that received a single iv dose of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg of NFLX and 0. 9 % saline, respectively. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was continuously recorded with a computer-ized system in freely moving rats. Venous blood {{samples were collected}} for determination of the NFLX concentra-tion by microbioassay method with Escherichia coli 441102 as the test strain. <b>Toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> were determined from serum concentration-time data with the 3 p 97 program. RESULTS: (1) The epileptiform dis-charges appeared in all NFLX groups with different latent periods, accompanied with limb twitching and clonic-tonic seizures. The relative total power of the EEG increased. (2) Drug serum concentration-time curves of different doses conformed to a two-compartmental model. The values of clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal half-life were dose-independent, while maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) and the areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0 ®¥) of NFLX increased with dosage. (3) The relative total powers of EEG were closely correlated with the administered dose, Cmax as well as AUC 0 ®¥. CONCLUSION: The present study estab-lished a suitable approach to quantitatively determine central nervous system (CNS) stimulant effect of NFLX. There is a significant correlation between AUC 0 ® ¥ and the changes of relative total power, which may serve as the index for judgement and prediction of the CNS toxic effect induced by NFLX...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To predict {{internal}} metal {{concentrations in}} animals under specific environmental exposures, the rela-tionship between the exposure concentrations {{and values of}} <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> must be known. At high exposure levels, the availability of carriers transporting metal ions through cellular membranes may become limited, thereby decreasing the assimilation rates (kA). Furthermore, increased metal concentrations in food may result in greater damage to the gut and reduce the assimilation efficiency and/or increase the elimination rate (kE). Therefore, kA should decrease and kE should increase with increasing metal concentrations. In fact, our study on Tri-bolium castaneum exposed to Cu at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg kg- 1 of dry flour showed that with increasing Cu concentrations, kA decreased from 0. 0042 day- 1 at 500 mg kg- 1 to 0. 0026 day- 1 at 4000 mg kg- 1 in females and from 0. 0029 to 0. 001 day- 1 in males and kE increased from 0. 027 to 0. 064 day- 1 and from 0. 018 to 0. 04 day- 1 in females and males, respectively. Significant differences in kA between the sexes were observed at 2000 and 4000 mg kg- 1, whereas significant differences between treatments were found for kA in males.

It involved an extraction of 3, 4 -DAP and phenylephrine, used as internal standard (IS), from plasma with solid-phase extraction (SPE) on C 18 cartridges. This analytical method is a hyphenated technique based on high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC) whose purpose is to obtain first a sensitive method and second a satisfying separation between 3, 4 -DAP and phenylephrine. The analytical method is accurate, specific, and linear between 10 and 500 μg of 3, 4 -DAP per litre. The recovery of 3, 4 -DAP is estimated at 70. 8 % with a 95 % confidence interval of (66. 0 - 75. 6 %). Intermediate precision was evaluated on three quality control samples; the intra-day precision was estimated at 13. 5, 9. 1, 7. 8 % and the inter-day precision at 17. 9, 8. 4, 9. 3 %.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the toxicokinetics of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in birds under low repeated dosing, equivalent to 0. 085. μg/kg per day, representing environmentally realistic exposure conditions. The best fitting was provided by a simple pseudo monocompartmental first-order kinetics model, regulated by two rates, with a pseudo first-order dissipation half-life of 230 days, accounting for real elimination as well as binding of PFOS to non-exchangeable structures. The calculated assimilation efficiency was 0. 66 with confidence intervals of 0. 64 and 0. 68. The model calculations confirmed that the measured maximum concentrations were still far from the steady state situation, which for this dose regime, was estimated at a value of about 65. μg PFOS/L serum achieved after a theoretical 210 weeks continuous exposure. The results confirm a very different kinetics than that observed in single-dose experiments confirming clear dose-related differences in apparent elimination rates in birds, as described for humans and monkeys; suggesting that a capacity-limited saturable process should also {{be considered in the}} kinetic behavior of PFOS in birds. Pseudo first-order kinetic models are highly convenient and frequently used for predicting bioaccumulation of chemicals in livestock and wildlife; the study suggests that previous bioaccumulation models using half-lives obtained at high doses are expected to underestimate the biomagnification potential of PFOS. The <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> presented here can be used for higher-tier bioaccumulation estimations of PFOS in chickens and as surrogate values for modeling PFOS kinetics in wild bird species.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of bisphenol A (BPA) {{were investigated}} in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to 100 [mu]g BPA/l. BPA uptake was measured during a 7 -day period {{followed by an}} elimination phase of similar duration. After 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168 h of uptake/elimination, fish were analysed for their content of BPA, bisphenol A glucuronic acid (BPAGA) and bisphenol A sulfate (BPAS). Within the first 24 h steady state levels of BPA, BPAGA and BPAS were reached and the total body concentrations were calculated to be 569, 12 600 and 39. 9 ng/g fish, respectively. Elimination rates of the three compounds in zebrafish were estimated by fitting the data to a compartment model. An initial rapid elimination phase was observed for BPA and BPAS with total body half lives (T 1 / 2) of < 1. 1 h and 30 min, followed by a slower second elimination phase with T 1 / 2 values of 139 and 71 h, respectively. Excretion of BPAGA occurred from a single compartment with a T 1 / 2 of 35 h. The steady state concentration of BPA and its metabolites were investigated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to 100 [mu]g BPA/l.

40|$|International audienceTrichloroethylene (TRI) and {{tetrachloroethylene}} (TETRA) are solvents {{that have}} been widely used in a variety of industries, and both are widespread environmental contaminants. In order to provide a better basis for understanding their toxicokinetics at environmental exposures, seven human volunteers were exposed by inhalation to 1 ppm of TRI or TETRA for 6 h, with biological samples collected for analysis during exposure and up to 6 -days postexposure. Concentrations of TRI, TETRA, free trichloroethanol (TCOH), total TCOH (free TCOH plus glucuronidated TCOH), and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) were determined in blood and urine; TRI and TETRA concentrations were measured in alveolar breath. Toxicokinetic time courses and empirical analyses of classical <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> were compared with those reported in previous human volunteer studies, most of which involved exposures that were at least 10 -fold higher. Qualitatively, TRI and TETRA toxicokinetics were consistent with previous human studies. Quantitatively, alveolar retention and clearance by exhalation were similar to those found previously but blood and urine data suggest a number of possible toxicokinetic differences. For TRI, data from the current study support lower apparent blood-air partition coefficients, greater apparent metabolic clearance, less TCA production, and greater glucuronidation of TCOH as compared to previous studies. For TETRA, the current data suggest TCA formation that is similar or slightly lower than that of previous studies. Variability and uncertainty in empirical estimates of total TETRA metabolism are substantial, with confidence intervals among different studies substantially overlapping.

The <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> were determined by least-square fitting of a one-compartment first-order toxicokinetic model, followed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation. The parameter estimation methods used here account for decreasing aqueous concentrations during the exposure phase or increasing aqueous concentrations during the elimination phase of bioaccumulation experiments. It is not necessary to keep exposure concentrations constant or zero during uptake and elimination, respectively. Neither is it required to achieve steady state during the exposure phase; hence, tests can be shorter. Prediction intervals, which take the between-parameter correlation into account, were calculated for bioaccumulation factors and simulations of internal concentrations under variable exposure. The lipid content of Gammarus index was 1. 3 % of wet weight, consisting of 25 % phospholipids and 75 % triglycerides. Size-dependent bioaccumulation was observed for eight compounds, although the magnitudes of the relationships were too small to be of practical relevance. Elimination times ranged from 0. 45 to 20 d, and bioaccumulation factors ranged from 1. 7 to 4, 449 L/kg.

40|$|The {{potential}} of 14 / 15 membered macrolides to cause phospholipidosis has been prospectively assessed, and structure-effects examined, using combined experimental and conformational approaches. Biochemical studies demonstrated drug binding to phosphatidylinositol-containing liposomes and inhibition {{of the activity}} of lysosomal phospholipase A 1 toward phosphatidylcholine included in the bilayer, in close correlation {{with the number of}} cationic groups carried by the drugs (erythromycin A </= roxithromycin < erythromycylamine </= azithromycin). In cultured cells (fibroblasts), phospholipidosis (affecting all major phospholipids except sphingomyelin) was observed after 3 days with the following ranking: erythromycin A </= roxithromycin < erythromycylamine < azithromycin (roxithromycin could, however, not be studied in detail due to intrinsic toxicity). The difference between erythromycylamine and azithromycin was accounted for by the lower cellular accumulation of erythromycylamine. In parallel, based on a methodology developed and validated to study drug-membrane interactions, the conformational analyses revealed that erythromycin A, roxithromycin, erythromycylamine, and azithromycin penetrate into the hydrophobic domain of a phosphatidylinositol monolayer through their desosamine and cladinose moieties, whereas their macrocycle is found close to the interface. This position allows the aminogroups carried by the macrocycle of the diaminated macrolides (erythromycylamine and azithromycin) to come into close contact with the negatively charged phosphogroup of phosphatidylinositol, whereas the amine located on the C- 3 of the desosamine, common to all four drugs, is located at a greater distance from this phosphogroup. Our study suggests that all macrolides have the potential to cause phospholipidosis but that this effect is modulated by toxicodynamic and <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> related to the drug structure and mainly to their cationic character.

A species of freshwater mussel, Elliptio complanata was calibrated to determine polychlorinated biphenyl elimination rates under both laboratory and field conditions. Elimination rate constants for non-Aroclor PCBs were investigated and compared with a previously published relationship for Aroclor PCBs in the same species. The investigation found that mussels allowed to depurate under an array of environmental conditions and deployment times exhibited similar elimination kinetics.

40|$|AbstractTetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is the {{brominated}} {{flame retardant}} with the largest production volume worldwide. NTP 2 -year bioassays found TBBPA dose-dependent increases in uterine tumors in female Wistar Han rats; evidence of reproductive tissues carcinogenicity was equivocal in male rats. To explain this apparent sex-dependence, the disposition and toxicokinetic profile of TBBPA were investigated using female Wistar Han rats, as no data were available for female rats. In these studies, the primary route of elimination following [14 C]-TBBPA administration (25, 250 or 1000 mg/kg) was in feces; recoveries in 72 h were 95. 7 ± 3. 5 %, 94. 3 ± 3. 6 % and 98. 8 ± 2. 2 %, respectively (urine: 0. 2 – 2 %; tissues: < 0. 1). TBBPA was conjugated to mono-glucuronide and -sulfate metabolites and eliminated in the bile. Plasma <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> for a 250 mg/kg dose were estimated based on free TBBPA, as determined by UV/radiometric-HPLC analyses. Oral dosing by gavage (250 mg/kg) resulted in a rapid absorption of compound into the systemic circulation with an observed Cmax at 1. 5 h post-dose followed by a prolonged terminal phase. TBBPA concentrations in plasma decreased rapidly after an IV dose (25 mg/kg) followed by a long elimination phase. These results indicate low systemic bioavailability (F < 0. 05), similar to previous reports using male rats. Elimination pathways appeared to become saturated leading to delayed excretion after a single oral administration of the highest dose (1000 mg/kg); no such saturation or delay was detected at lower doses. Chronic high exposures to TBBPA may result in competition for metabolism with endogenous substrates in extrahepatic tissues (e. g., SULT 1 E 1 estrogen sulfation) resulting in endocrine disruption...|$|R
