30|$|<b>Thyroid</b> <b>scanning</b> with technetium- 99  m (Tc 99 m) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in detecting orthotopic and ectopic thyroid tissue. Both CT scans and US can help detect ectopic tissue when a lesion demonstrates imaging and enhancement characteristics of thyroid tissue. The absence of normally sited thyroid gland in US and CT scans also supports the diagnosis. In addition, US can guide FNA for cytological confirmation of a thyroid lesion [46]. Ectopic thyroid tissue appears as a well-circumscribed, homogeneous, highly attenuating mass relative to adjacent muscles. Normally, it enhances avidly following the administration of iodinated contrast [1, 45, 47].|$|E

Numerous imaging modalities including flu clear medicine, ultrasonography, x-ray fluorescent scan ning, x-ray transmission computed tomography (CT) and, more recently, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) {{have been used in}} an attempt to provide a diagnosis in patients with diseases of the thyroid and parathyroid glands.

These techniques utilize the physio logical processes of the glands and radiolabeling of chemicals taken up by the glands in order to perform the evaluations.

40|$|Molecular imaging {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the evaluation and management of thyroid cancer. The routine use of <b>thyroid</b> <b>scanning</b> in all thyroid nodules is no longer recommended by many authorities. In the initial work-up of a thyroid nodule, radioiodine imaging can be particularly helpful when the thyroid stimulating hormone level is low and an autonomously functioning nodule is suspected. Radioiodine imaging can also be helpful in the 10 – 15 % of cases for which fine-needle aspiration biopsy is indeterminate. Therapy of confirmed thyroid cancer frequently involves administration of iodine- 131 after surgery to ablate remnant tissue. In the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients, increased thyroglobulin levels will often prompt the empiric administration of 131 I followed by whole body radioiodine imaging in the search for recurrent or metastatic disease. 131 I imaging of the whole body and blood pharmacokinetics can be used to determine if higher doses of 131 I can be given in thyroid cancer. The utility of [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is steadily increasing. FDG is primarily taken up by dedifferentiated thyroid cancer cells, which are poorly iodine avid. Thus, it is particularly helpful in the patient with an increased thyroglobulin but negative radioiodine scan. FDG PET is also useful in the patient with a neck mass but unknown primary, in patients with aggressive (dedifferentiated) thyroid cancer, and in patients with differentiated cancer where histologic transformation to dedifferentiation is suspected. In rarer types of thyroid cancer, such as medullary thyroid cancer, FDG and other tracers such as 99 mTc sestamibi, [11 C]methionine, [111 In]octreotide, and [68 Ga]somatostatin receptor binding reagents have been utilized. 124 I is not widely available, but has been used for PET imaging of thyroid cancer and will likely see broader applicability due to the advantages of PET methodology...|$|E

This study tries to find optimal method of thyroid evaluation in this group. Methods and patients: In a recall program using mass media in Khorasan, all patients with childhood irradiation were invited for thyroid evaluation. One hundred and eighty patients with previous history of radiation for Tinea Capitis were studied using thyroid examination, thyroid sonography and thyroid scintigraphy. FNAB was performed in all patients with palpable nodules and surgery was recommended. Results: Eighty two cases out of 179 patients (45. 8 %) had nodules in thyroid examination. The number were 85 from 166 (51. 2 %) in sonography and 75 from 165 (45. 5 %) in thyroid scintigraphy. Using Chi-square tests, no significant difference was noted in detection of thyroid nodules in different methods (P= 0. 78) {{as well as between}} the methods (P> 0. 5). Sonographically detected nodules which were not palpated or were not seen in scintigraphy, were < 10 mm in size in most of cases. FNAB were performed in 60 patients which revealed benign pathology in 89. 9 % inadequate in 5 % and suspicious for malignancy in other 5 % of cases. Also 27 patients underwent surgery and pathological studies showed 3 cases (11. 1 %) of papillary carcinoma. Conclution: This study revealed that sonography detects small nonpalpable nodules which are not clinically significant. Very high correlation between the results of thyroid examination and thyroid scintigraphy indicates adequacy of thyroid examination in these patients.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of low-energy gamma emitters in radioisotope scanning, {{particularly those}} gamma emitters emitting photons below 200 keY, has created an interest in collimators designed for such energies. At least until quite recently, available commercial collimators were designed for higher energies and did not allow optimum use of the lower-energy emitting nuclides. Special collimators have been reported by Harper, et a! (1), Beck (2), and by Harris, et al (3), but, to date, these designs have not been generally available. To carry out some scanning studies at the Brookhaven Medical Research Center involving the use of 9 omTc, {{it was felt that}} a thin-septum collimator was needed that would more fully take advantage of the properties of the radioiso tope. As a number of different applications were to be involved, a collimator system was needed that was sufficiently versatile to encompass a number of different scanning requirements.

A relatively high counting rate is achieved by having the crystal intercept the maximum solid angle that was considered acceptable from the standpoint of res olution loss above and below the focal point.

Patients and Methods: Among all the patients with hyperthyroidism who referred to nuclear medicine ward of Shiraz University of medical sciences, 50 patients were randomly selected. we asked the patients who were on Methimazole, to discontinue the usage of all drugs (not Methimazole) and foods which are effective on thyroid gland for 1 week, after that <b>thyroid</b> <b>scan</b> was performed for these patients. In The other episode, we asked them to discontinue the usage of all drugs (also Methimazole) and foods which are effective on thyroid gland for 1 week and then <b>thyroid</b> <b>scan</b> was performed again. Revealed data was analyzed under supervision of statistical specialist with descriptive methods on SPSS. Results: 34 patients were males (68 %) and other was females. Mean age of the patients was 53. 5 years. (Min: 39 years and max: 75 years) Although The ROI (Region of Interest) of thyroid was increased in the patients who used methimazole before scan 398. 72 (SD: 191. 73) than the patients who discontinued for one week 380. 15 (SD: 112. 49), but the difference wasn’t statistically significant.

Results: From 37 patients (27 female, 10 male, mean age= 35. 5 years+/- 13. 6) 16 malignant and 21 benign nodules were detected. In another classification, we had 26 neoplastic and 11 non-neoplastic nodules. MIBI uptake score 3 - 4 was noted in 11 out of 16 malignant nodules and 13 out of 21 benign nodules(P= 0. 73). Sensitivity and specificity of high MIBI uptake (score 3 - 4) for diagnosis of malignancy was 68. 7 % and 38 % respectively. The values for sensitivity and specificity were 69. 2 % and 30. 7 % in diagnosis of neoplasm respectively. Washout index (considered as difference in uptake scores of late and early phases) was 0. 45 in benign and 0. 09 in malignant nodules (P= 0. 07). The values were 0. 26 and 0. 37 in neoplastic and non-neoplastic nodules respectively (P= 0. 65). Conclusion: <b>Thyroid</b> MIBI <b>scan</b> has a low specificity for differentiating malignant from benign or neoplastic from non-neoplastic nodules in patients who are candidates for thyroid surgery according to clinical evaluation. Analysis of wash out index may increase specificity...|$|R

However, the proportion of AFTN presenting with a normal TSH is unknown. Our objective was therefore to determine the proportion of AFTNs with a normal TSH level to ascertain whether a normal TSH really rules out an AFTN.
