5|$|As {{part of the}} United Kingdom, {{the basic}} {{political}} system in England is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707, putting into effect {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England. Today England is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments. In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster, there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.|$|E

Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships. However, the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country.|$|E

25|$|A common {{criticism}} of full cutoff lighting fixtures {{is that they}} are sometimes not as aesthetically pleasing to look at. This is most likely because historically <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> large market specifically for full cutoff fixtures, and because people typically like to see the source of illumination. Due to the specificity with their direction of light, full cutoff fixtures sometimes also require expertise to install for maximum effect.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately {{the purpose}} of the {{campaign}} was to get grocery stores to donate the food they would otherwise throw away.

25|$|Female {{religious}} scholars {{were relatively}} common from early Islamic history throughout the 16th century. Mohammad Akram Nadwi, a Sunni religious scholar, has listed 8,000 female jurists, and orientalist Ignaz Goldziher estimates 15 percent of medieval hadith scholars were women. Women, during {{early history of}} Islam, primarily obtained their knowledge through community study groups, ribat retreats and during hajj when the usual restrictions imposed on female education were more lenient. After the 16th century, however, female scholars became fewer. In the modern era, while female activists and writers are relatively common, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> significant female jurist in over 200 years. Opportunities for women's religious education exist, but cultural barriers often keep women from pursuing such a vocation.|$|E

25|$|Saudi Arabia is {{a glaring}} example of {{religious}} apartheid. The religious institutions from government clerics to judges, to religious curricula, and all religious instructions in media {{are restricted to}} the Wahhabi understanding of Islam, adhered to by less than 40% of the population. The Saudi government communized Islam, through its monopoly of both religious thoughts and practice. Wahhabi Islam is imposed and enforced on all Saudis regardless of their religious orientations. The Wahhabi sect does not tolerate other religious or ideological beliefs, Muslim or not. Religious symbols by Muslims, Christians, Jews and other believers are all banned. The Saudi embassy in Washington is a living example of religious apartheid. In its 50 years, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> single non-Sunni Muslim diplomat in the embassy. The branch of Imam Mohamed Bin Saud University in Fairfax, Virginia instructs its students that Shia Islam is a Jewish conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Sambalpur lies on {{the bank}} of the river Mahanadi. The river flows to the west of the city and {{separates}} Burla from Sambalpur and Hirakud. The Hirakud Dam lies upstream of Sambalpur. Budharaja is a small reserve forest located within the city. Sambalpur experiences an extreme type of climate with hot and dry summers followed by humid monsoons and cold winters. The hot season commences from the first week of March and lasts until the second half of June. In May, the temperature rises to 47°. In December, the temperature comes down to 5°C. Sambalpur gets rainfall from the south western monsoon. The most pleasant months in Sambalpur are from October to February, during which time the humidity and heat are at their lowest. During this period, temperatures during the day stay below 30°C (86°F) and drop to about 20°C (68°F) at night. This season is followed by a hot summer, from March to May. The summer gives way to the monsoon season. Since 1982 as per the data available with District Emergency section, Sambalpur, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> single occurrence of cyclone in Sambalpur. There are possibilities of strong winds with the speed of 53km/ph before the onset of monsoon.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Steve Davis {{won his first}} world title in 1981, there had been just ten world champions since 1927, with Davis {{becoming}} the eleventh, including {{the winner of the}} boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. Stephen Hendry became the fourteenth in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999). O'Sullivan is the closest to dominance in the modern era, having won the title on five occasions in the 21st century (2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013). Mark Williams has won twice (2000 and 2003) and John Higgins four times (1998, 2007, 2009, 2011) but {{since the beginning of the}} century, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> dominant force like in previous decades, and the modern era has seen many players playing to a similar standard, instead of one player raising the bar. Davis for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985 and still holds the record for most tournament wins overall, at a time when there were far fewer tournaments than today. By retaining his title in 2013, O'Sullivan became the first player to successfully defend the world championship since 1996 when Hendry won the sixth of his seven titles, his fifth in a row.|$|E

However, the presence of classical, folk and jazz recordings has been cited by some as anomalous, arguing that comparisons with the other nominees can be invidious.
