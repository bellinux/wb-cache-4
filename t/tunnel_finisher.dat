Then wrinkles are removed by a strong hot air flow alongside the garments. Finally the garment is dried by cooler air before it leaves the <b>tunnel</b> <b>finisher.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>tunnel</b> <b>finisher</b> is {{a machine}} to remove {{wrinkles}} from garments. Most garments are shipped by sea freight {{from the country}} of production. They get very wrinkled because of the box packing being used. In the receiving country they are unpacked {{and put on a}} clothes hanger. Those hangers are sent via automated transport through the tunnel with a speed up to 3000 garments per hour. It is also being used in laundries and dry cleaners to remove wrinkles from garments after washing or dry cleaning.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tunnel</b> <b>finishers</b> can {{be grouped}} into two {{different}} classifications, [...] "wide body" [...] or [...] "narrow body." [...] "Wide body" [...] machines {{are designed for}} high production finishing of blended garments wet-to-dry, damp-to-dry and or dry-to-dry. [...] "Narrow body" [...] machines are designed for shoulder-to-shoulder processing and are best suited for the dry-to-dry finishing of garments. However; {{they are capable of}} damp-to-dry finishing at slower production speeds. These units are ideal for dry cleaners, hotel laundries, institutional laundries and other on-premises laundry applications.|$|R
