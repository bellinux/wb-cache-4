40|$|High {{throughput}} DNA sequencing {{has been}} performed {{by using a}} microfabricated 96 -channel radial capillary array electrophoresis (μCAE) microchannel plate detected by a 4 -color rotary confocal fluorescence scanner. The microchannel plate features a novel injector for uniform sieving matrix loading as well as high resolution, <b>tapered</b> <b>turns</b> that provide an effective separation length of 15. 9 cm on a compact 150 -mm diameter wafer. Expanded common buffer chambers for the cathode, anode, and waste reservoirs are used to simplify electrode addressing and to counteract buffering capacity depletion arising from the high electrophoretic current. DNA sequencing data from 95 successful lanes out of 96 lanes run in parallel were batch-processed with basefinder, producing an average read length of 430 bp (phred q ≥ 20). Phred quality values were found to exceed 40 (0. 01 % probability of incorrectly calling a base) for over 80 % of the read length. The μCAE system demonstrated here produces sequencing data {{at a rate of}} 1. 7 kbp/min, a 5 -fold increase over current commercial capillary array electrophoresis technology. Additionally, this system permits lower reagent volumes and lower sample concentrations, and it presents numerous possibilities for integrated sample preparation and handling.

A 2 D tool post {{is made with}} a new structure with three leaf springs for each axis and its mounting platform positions at a corner, which makes it convenient for mounting the cutter. A control technique, “Forecasting Compensatory Control” (FCC), is implemented to perform an on-line prediction of the machining errors encountered.

The cutting forces, mechanical vibration and emission acoustic signals obtained using dynamometer, accelerometer, and acoustic emission sensors respectively have been extensively used to monitor several aspects of the cutting processes in automated machining operations. Notwithstanding, determining the optimum selection of on-line signals is crucial to enhancing system optimization requiring a low computational load yet effective prediction of cutting process parameters. This study assess the contribution of three types of signals for the on-line monitoring and diagnosis of the surface finish (Ra) in automated <b>taper</b> <b>turning</b> operations.

50|$|The {{compound}} rest (or top slide) (2) is usually where {{the tool post}} is mounted. It provides a smaller amount of movement (less than the cross-slide) along its axis via another feedscrew. The {{compound rest}} axis can be adjusted independently of the carriage or cross-slide. It is used for <b>turning</b> <b>tapers,</b> to control depth of cut when screwcutting or precision facing, or to obtain finer feeds (under manual control) than the feed shaft permits.

40|$|AbstractMachining process {{models can}} be used to predict cutting force/power and further {{optimize}} the process parameters. In this work, a mechanistic cutting force model for turning processes is developed. In order to accurately predict cutting forces, the cutting tool edge is discretized and an approach for calculating the chip load corresponding to each discretized edge segment is developed. Approach for calculating effective tool angles is also developed considering effects of the tool corner radius and the change of feed direction. By using the yield shear stress of the work material, the friction angle between work and tool material, the chip load and the effective tool angles for each tool edge segment, the distributions of the turning forces and force intensity along the tool edge can be predicted. Turning cases of straight turning, contour turning, <b>taper</b> <b>turning</b> and facing are tested and the model outputs include the distributions of the instantaneous effective tool angles, chip load, cutting force coefficients and force intensity. Test results for straight turning and contour turning operations are analyzed to demonstrate the model capability. The distributions of force and force intensity on tool edge provide useful information for prediction of turning forces/power and potential further prediction of tool wear/life...|$|E
40|$|Morphogenesis is an {{important}} and complicated process in controlling the final shape of different structures in an organism. To uncover the general molecular mechanism in this developmental process, the male sensory ray of C. elegans is chosen {{as a model for}} study. Nine ram (R̲A̲y M̲orphology abnormal) genes required for normal ray morphogenesis have so far been identified. The <b>tapered</b> rays <b>turn</b> into lumpy rays when any of these genes is mutated. Among these ram genes, ram- 5 encodes a novel transmembrane protein while mab- 7 encodes a novel protein with a hydrophobic region (HR) at its N-terminus. The property of HR of MAB- 7 was shown to be a type II transmembrane domain by domain swapping analysis and protein localization examination. Ectopic expression of mab- 7 in a subset of neurons in the male tail could rescue Mab- 7 phenotype suggesting that mab- 7 is acting non-autonomously during ray morphogenesis. Although the identities of the nine ram genes were known, the details of the mechanism guiding ray morphogenesis have not been worked out. To identify the missing components, three approaches were initiated including an EMS screen, a yeast two-hybrid screen and a target specific RNAi knock down screen. Twelve new ram alleles and newly defined loci were isolated in our EMS screen. GFI- 1 was identified to be a MAB- 7 interacting partner from the yeast two-hybrid screen. Expression pattern and RNAi analyses of this gfi- 1 gene were performed to determine its biological relevance with mab- 7 function. Target specific RNAi treatment had uncovered noah- 2 to be a new ram component. The requirement of this gene in ray morphogenesis was studied by dominant negative approach. Furthermore, ram- 5 was shown to genetically interact with the three RAM collagen-encoding genes, suggesting that the gene product of these genes might associate together during ray morphogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{affected}} with systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) display poor-long term prognosis and increased mortality in respect of general population. This {{may be due to}} continuous organ damage accrual which is fostered both by persistent disease activity (mainly in the short term) and prolonged corticosteroid exposure (mainly in the long term). The effort of defining novel therapeutic goals to which patients should be treated in order to have their prognosis improved is named treat-to-target. Remission in SLE was shown to be associated with better outcome and prolonged survival; in clinical practice, patients may experience either complete or clinical remission, which are defined as complete clinical/serological healing or no clinical signs of lupus with active serology, respectively. The main treat-to-target in SLE is complete remission, however since longitudinal observations suggest that clinical remission or low disease activity even with minimal corticosteroid intake do improve patients prognosis and survival as well, they may be assumed as acceptable alternative targets. Suitable therapeutic strategies have to be defined in order for these goals to be achieved including early diagnosis, effective treatment and proper corticosteroid <b>tapering</b> which in <b>turn</b> require development of more reliable serum biomarkers for early disease detection and less toxic targeted therapies with a steroid-sparing potential...|$|R

6000|$|Ding, Clash, Dong, BANG, Boom, Rattle, Clash, BANG, Clink, BANG, Dong, BANG, Clatter, BANG BANG BANG! What {{on earth}} is this! This is, or soon will be, the Achilles, iron armour-plated ship. Twelve hundred men are working at her now; twelve hundred men working on stages over her sides, over her bows, over her stern, under her keel, between her decks, down in her hold, within her and without, {{crawling}} and creeping into the finest curves of her lines wherever {{it is possible for}} men to twist. Twelve hundred hammerers, measurers, caulkers, armourers, forgers, smiths, shipwrights; twelve hundred dingers, clashers, dongers, rattlers, clinkers, bangers bangers bangers! Yet all this stupendous uproar around the rising Achilles is as nothing to the reverberations with which the perfected Achilles shall resound upon the dreadful day when the full work is in hand for which this is but note of preparation--the day when the scuppers that are now fitting like great, dry, thirsty conduit-pipes, shall run red. All these busy figures between decks, dimly seen bending at their work in smoke and fire, are as nothing to the figures that shall do work here of another kind in smoke and fire, that day. These steam-worked engines alongside, helping the ship by travelling to and fro, and wafting tons of iron plates about, as though they were so many leaves of trees, would be rent limb from limb if they stood by her for a minute then. To think that this Achilles, monstrous compound of iron tank and oaken chest, can ever swim or roll! To think that any force of wind and wave could ever break her! To think that wherever I see a glowing red-hot iron point thrust out of her side from within--as I do now, there, and there, and there!--and two watching men on a stage without, with bared arms and sledge-hammers, strike at it fiercely, and repeat their blows until it is black and flat, I see a rivet being driven home, of which there are many in every iron plate, and thousands upon thousands in the ship! To think that the difficulty I experience in appreciating the ship's size when I am on board, arises from her being a series of iron tanks and oaken chests, so that internally she is ever finishing and ever beginning, and half of her might be smashed, and yet the remaining half suffice and be sound. Then, to go over the side again and down among the ooze and wet {{to the bottom of the}} dock, in the depths of the subterranean forest of dog-shores and stays that hold her up, and to see the immense mass bulging out against the upper light, and tapering down towards me, is, with great pains and much clambering, to arrive at an impossibility of realising that this is a ship at all, and to become possessed by the fancy that it is an enormous immovable edifice set up in an ancient amphitheatre (say, that at Verona), and almost filling it! Yet what would even these things be, without the tributary workshops and the mechanical powers for piercing the iron plates--four inches and a half thick--for rivets, shaping them under hydraulic pressure to the finest <b>tapering</b> <b>turns</b> of the ship's lines, and paring them away, with knives shaped like the beaks of strong and cruel birds, to the nicest requirements of the design! These machines of tremendous force, so easily directed by one attentive face and presiding hand, seem to me to have in them something of the retiring character of the Yard. 'Obedient monster, please to bite this mass of iron through and through, at equal distances, where these regular chalk-marks are, all round.' Monster looks at its work, and lifting its ponderous head, replies, 'I don't particularly want to do it; but if it must be done--!' The solid metal wriggles out, hot from the monster's crunching tooth, and it IS done. 'Dutiful monster, observe this other mass of iron. It is required to be pared away, according to this delicately lessening and arbitrary line, which please to look at.' Monster (who has been in a reverie) brings down its blunt head, and, much in the manner of Doctor Johnson, closely looks along the line--very closely, being somewhat near-sighted. 'I don't particularly want to do it; but if it must be done--!' Monster takes another near-sighted look, takes aim, and the tortured piece writhes off, and falls, a hot, tight-twisted snake, among the ashes. The making of the rivets is merely a pretty round game, played by a man and a boy, who put red-hot barley sugar in a Pope Joan board, and immediately rivets fall out of window; but the tone of the great machines is the tone of the great Yard and the great country: 'We don't particularly want to do it; but if it must be done--!' ...|$|R

50|$|The Sutton Hoo longship, {{sometimes}} referred to as the ghost ship of the Wulflings, is about 27 x 4.5 m maximum beam and built about 625 AD. It is associated with the Saxons. The ship was crushed by the weight of soil when buried but most details have been reconstructed. The ship was similar in hull section to the Nydam ship with flared topsides. Compared to later longships, the oak planks are wide—about 250 mm including laps, with less taper at bow and stern. Planks were 25 mm thick. The 26 heavy frames are spaced at 850 mm in the centre. Each frame <b>tapers</b> from the <b>turn</b> of the bilge to the inwale. This suggests that knees were used to brace the upper two or three topside planks but have rotted away. The hull had a distinctive leaf shape with the bow sections much narrower than the stern quarters. There were nine wide planks per side. The ship had a light keel plank but pronounced stem and stern deadwood. The reconstruction suggests the stern was much lower than the bow. It had a steering oar to starboard braced by an extra frame. The raised prow extended about 3.7 m above the keel and the hull was estimated to draw 750 mm when lightly laden. Between each futtock the planks were lapped in normal clinker style and fastened with six iron rivets per plank. There is no evidence of a mast, sail, or strengthening of the keel amidships but a half-sized replica, the Soe Wylfing, sailed very well with a modest sail area.|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} torque {{required}} to either further tighten or loosen the connection under tension and pressure was determined from the threaded {{model and the}} same method of summing thread forces x radii. Using 0. 021 friction coef-ficient, the torques were: Nominal <b>tapers</b> at three <b>turns,</b> torque = 5 5 3 8 ft • lb Addition of 500 kips tension = 5628 ft*lb Addition of 11, 220 psi pressure = 10, 480 ft-lb Therefore, tension has negligible effect and pressure has a significant effect. The lack of effect by tension is due to loss of preload force on the stab flanks being equal to the increase of force on the load flanks, thereby producing no change on total torque. This behavior was also recognized by Clinedinst. Effect of Yielding on Torque Part II of this paper discusses elastic and plastic solutions with the threaded finite element model that used to determine maximum strain for 5. 4 turns, 9350 psi and 660 kips tension. The assembly interference was for a fast pin and slow box, with interferences of 0. 0079 in. at the pin end and 0. 0231 in. at the box end. Stresses were compared in Fig. 12 of Part II and showed significant reductions due to yielding of the P-l 10 material with the stress/strain relationship shown in Fig. 11 of Part II. The same solutions were {{used to compare the}} effects of load and yielding on torque with results given in Table 7. Torque reduction due to yielding when assembled was 11 percent and the reduction at full load was 16 percent. The reductions are not particularly high but do show a source of variation in the torque/turn relationship that can occur for makeup.
