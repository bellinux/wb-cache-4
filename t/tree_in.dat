The specific epithet aurea was applied by English botanist Thomas Nuttall who described the species in 1846.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} {{spanning}} <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> a (di-) graph (network) is an important, well-studied quantity. Most research {{about the number}} of spanning trees is devoted to determining exact formulae for the number of spanning <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> many kinds of special graphs. In this thesis, we start by stating the general methods for counting the number of spanning <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> (di-) graphs. We then discuss our new results. We show that the number of spanning <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> the circulant graph CnS 1,S 2, [...] .,Sk always satisfies a recurrence relation and describe how to derive this relation. The asymptotic behavior of these quantities are also derived. Boesch and Prodinger have shown how to use Chebyshev polynomials to derive closed formulae for the number of spanning <b>trees</b> of graphs <b>in</b> certain classes. This work has been extended to develop new techniques for the evaluation of the number of spanning <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> circulant graphs and graphs related to circulant graphs. We end by describing a method of counting the number of spanning <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> one class of double fixed-step loop networks...|$|R
