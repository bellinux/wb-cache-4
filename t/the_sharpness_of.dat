5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. <b>The</b> <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, {{replacing}} the original loop station. The loop station could only accommodate {{the first five}} cars of a train and required the use of gap fillers because of <b>the</b> <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the loop curve. The new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The newer station {{does not have a}} connection to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and is underneath the loop station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station. This was the first new station to open since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. <b>The</b> <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

25|$|Visual acuity (VA) {{commonly}} {{refers to}} the clarity of vision.

25|$|The {{reason that}} cats {{are seen as}} yōkai in Japanese mythology is {{attributed}} {{to many of the}} characteristics that they possess: for example, the way the irises of their eyes change shape depending on the time of day, the way their fur seems to cause sparks due to static electricity when they are petted (especially in winter), the way they sometimes lick blood, the way they can walk without making a sound, their wild nature that remains despite the gentleness they can show at times, the way they are difficult to control (unlike dogs), <b>the</b> <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> their claws and teeth, their nocturnal habits, and their speed and agility.|$|E
25|$|The Mk. II also {{included}} a new transmitter, which had increased in power three times from 50 to 150kW. This extra power offered somewhat better range, but more importantly it allowed the pulse width to be significantly reduced while offering the same range. <b>The</b> <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the echo {{is a function of}} the pulse width, so by reducing it the system became more accurate. The Mk. II could offer bearing measurements as accurate as ½ degree, about twice as accurate as the Mk. I*, and just within the range needed to directly aim the guns. The Mk. II had largely replaced the Mk. I* by mid-1942 and remained in service until 1943. An analysis demonstrated that the Mk. II improved the rounds-per-kill to 2,750, another significant advance. 1,679 GL Mark II sets were produced between June 1940 and August 1943.|$|E
25|$|A {{challenge}} for any diving bird {{is the change}} in refraction between air and water. The eyes of many birds have two foveae (the fovea is {{the area of the}} retina the greatest density of light receptors), and a kingfisher is able to switch from the main central fovea to the auxiliary fovea when it enters water; a retinal streak of high receptor density which connects the two foveae allows the image to swing temporally as the bird drops onto the prey. The egg-shaped lens of the eye points towards the auxiliary fovea, enabling the bird to maintain visual acuity underwater. Because of the positions of the foveae, the kingfisher has monocular vision in air, and binocular vision in water. The underwater vision is not as a sharp as in air, but the ability to judge the distance of moving prey is more important than <b>the</b> <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the image.|$|E

30|$|The {{problem with}} the dynamic {{reference}} method relates to content-specific normalization. Observers use content-specific anchors when quality values are given. The worst image from the content set functions as a low-quality anchor (quality value = 0), and the best image functions as a high-quality anchor (quality value = 100). We can expect that <b>the</b> same <b>sharpness</b> values for images of different contents would not be identical within Dataset II because some contents are more difficult for cameras to detect than others. For example, <b>the</b> <b>sharpness</b> value <b>of</b> 50 for Content 3 {{is not the same}} as <b>the</b> <b>sharpness</b> value <b>of</b> 50 for the other contents. This effect should be considered when data are used for metric validation. Before Dataset II can be used, the objective metric should be normalized in a content-specific manner.|$|R
500|$|One of {{the more}} unusual {{sections}} of the US131 freeway in the Grand Rapids area is the S-Curve. This section of freeway carries US131 over the Grand River with two sharp turns in the road, resembling the letter S.

500|$|The first {{generation}} of Zenbooks was announced on October11,2011, one day before release, although they were first demonstrated at Computex 2011 in May that year. Two models were released in 2011 to positive reviews: the 11inch UX21E and the 13inch UX31E, also frequently known as the UX21 and UX31 respectively. The design of the UX21 drew comparisons to the Macbook Air and it was regarded as an [...] "excellent rival" [...] by CNET reviewer Andrew Hoyle. Other aspects of the laptops that reviewers liked were the Bang and Olufsen speakers, fast boot times due to Asus' BIOS design and the speed of general tasks within the operating system resulting from the SSD and Sandy Bridge processors. However, the screens drew criticism for their poor contrast ratio, colour accuracy and less than perfect viewing angle, although they were praised for their brightness and <b>the</b> <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the UX31's screen.

500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was {{the most}} {{cultivated}} violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ...

500|$|Wired’s Michael Calore {{praised the}} HTC One’s [...] "truly gorgeous" [...] and [...] "seamless" [...] design, and {{considered}} {{the quality of its}} internal speakers to be the best of any smartphone thus far.

The HTC One’s user interface was considered cleaner and closer to the stock Android design than previous releases, while BlinkFeed was considered to be [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "useful", yet [...] "far from original". Some of HTC’s changes to the Android UI were criticized, including its [...] "cramped" [...] on-screen keyboard, and its deviation from the common three-key button layout used by other manufacturers. Calore also criticized HTC for shipping the phone with Android 4.1.2 when Android 4.2 had been released three months prior to its official announcement. These factors, along with unsatisfactory battery life experienced by Calore, prompted him to give the HTC One a rating of 7.0 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Numerous reviewers {{commented on}} Morgan's writing and story. In The Seattle Times, {{journalist}} and science fiction author Nisi Shawl tied the writing {{quality to the}} action scenes, [...] "Morgan's talent for tension-building is matched by the clarity with which he describes the sideswiping, rubber-burning, rear-end-ramming, full-contact racing scenes. And both these skills are quietly eclipsed by his word-for-word writing ability. Apt metaphors and similes abound." [...] However, science fiction critic Robert K. J. Killheffer, in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, wrote [...] "it's not his best – it lacks the dense and evocative background of his Takeshi Kovacs books, and Morgan is not as sure-handed with near-future situations and characters – but it takes chances and largely succeeds." [...] Likewise, in the San Francisco Chronicle the reviewer wrote [...] "In its present form, the novel feels bloated and obvious, despite <b>the</b> <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the descriptive writing {{and a couple of}} first-rate fight sequences. With the right artist, Market Forces might still make a compelling—and necessarily shorter—graphic novel." [...] The Library Journal review ended with a recommendation: [...] "Morgan's sf suspense belongs in most sf collections." [...] The reviewer in Booklist concluded [...] "It's not a particularly pleasant future, but Morgan paints it in broad strokes, drawing us into his future world and making it feel like a natural outgrowth of today's corporate chicanery. The novel might have been unremittingly bleak if it weren't for the moral center provided by Faulkner, who is a genuinely likable guy. Fans of Morgan's gritty, noirish brand of sf will ﬂock to this one." ...|$|E
