The United States encouraged India to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) immediately and without condition. The United States also called for restraint in missile and nuclear testing and deployment by both India and Pakistan. The non-proliferation dialogue initiated after the 1998 nuclear tests has bridged many of the gaps in understanding between the countries.|$|E

25|$|After the secession of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia in 1991 and 1992, SR Montenegro {{held the}} Montenegrin {{referendum}} in 1992 which {{ended with a}} 95.96% of votes in favour for a state union with Serbia and with {{the changing of the}} socialist political system towards a multi-party one. The country was renamed Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In this period between 1990 and 1998 Montenegro was ruled by Momir Bulatović who had close relations with the Serbian president Slobodan Milošević and who was very supportive to keep close ties between the two republics within the state union. Montenegro was also included by <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> imposed to Serbia during the 1990s. During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia both Serbia and Montenegro suffered the attacks of the NATO forces and several targets inside Montenegro were also bombarded. All this contributed to the rise in power in Montenegro of Milo Đukanović who was known to be much less sympathetic towards the Serbo-Montenegrin ties and would become an open supporter of the independence of Montenegro. In 2006, six years after the fall of Milošević in 2000, and after insisting on international diplomacy, the former Yugoslavia became known as the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. The process of becoming a single state union ironically lead to the separation of the two states - a change which was officiated by the referendum on Montenegrin independence on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the total electorate. Of them, 230,661 votes or 55.5% were in favour of independence and 185,002 votes or 44.5% were against.|$|E
40|$|Countries {{often use}} <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> to coerce other {{countries}} to change certain policies of which they do not approve. However, if sanctioned countries smuggle goods over the border, use informal financial intermediaries, and develop black markets to trade sanctioned goods, sanctions end up having a smaller impact, sanctioned countries {{have little incentive to}} modify their policies, and sanctions are more likely to fail. This paper is the first study to test empirically whether sanctions affect informality. I compile data from different studies {{about the size of the}} informal market for 147 countries over 46 years. I use these data to analyze the relationship between the size of the informal market adjusted by the size of <b>the</b> population and <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions.</b> I also estimate at <b>the</b> impact of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> on other activities associated with informal activities. I find that informal markets increase when a country is being sanctioned and the effects are larger when <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> has strong international support. I also find that the type of sanction, trade or financial, is not an important determinant of the informal market size and that sanctions also lead to increases in robbery rates and corruption...|$|R

500|$|Ostensibly, the Staatsbewind did {{its part}} by prohibiting {{the import of}} all enemy goods on 5 July 1803. Later it banned cheese exports and butter. These {{gestures}} were, however, of little practical effect: in 1804 the volume of general exports to Britain was nearly equal {{to that in the}} last year of peace: 1802. British goods reached Dutch destinations via neutral German ports, or disguised as [...] "American cargo." [...] The republic was therefore an important [...] "keyhole into Europe" [...] that undermined <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Britain. As the members of the Staatsbewind, and their friends, often profited from this clandestine trade directly, the patience of the French was wearing thin. Matters came to a head when the French commander in the Republic, Auguste de Marmont, ordered in November 1804 that French naval patrols and customs officials were to take over the responsibility for the surveillance of cargoes in Dutch ports, with powers of confiscation without reference to Dutch authorities. This was the last straw for the Staatsbewind. On 23 November 1804, they forbade any Batavian official to take orders from the French.|$|E

2500|$|In 1935, {{following}} the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the League of Nations imposed trade sanctions on Italy.

In particular, Italy imposed a severe ban on most imports, and the government sought to persuade consumers to buy Italian-made products. For instance, it launched the slogan [...] "Preferite il Prodotto Italiano" [...] (Buy Italian).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the effect of sanctions on mortality among Iraqi children. METHODS: <b>The</b> effects of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> on health are not well known. Past studies on <b>the</b> effect of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> on mortality have suffered from unreliable data sources and the collinearity of sanctions with other negative economic events. We overcame these weaknesses by using individual child records from a retrospective survey of mothers conducted after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to {{examine the effect of}} sanctions on mortality among Iraqi children. Multivariate proportional hazards analysis was used to assess <b>the</b> effect of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> prior to war (from August through December 1990). RESULTS: We found that after controlling for child and maternal characteristics, when <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> were entered into the proportional hazards equation, the risk of dying increased dramatically. This increase was highly significant statistically.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{ethics of}} <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> {{is an issue}} that has been curiously {{neglected}} by philosophers and political theorists. Only a handful of philosophical journal articles and book chapters have ever been published on <b>the</b> subject; yet <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions,</b> as I will show, are significantly morally problematic and their use stands in need of moral justification. The aim of this thesis then is to consider how <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> might be morally justified. Of the few writers who have considered this issue, the majority point to <b>the</b> analogies between <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> and war and use the just war principles (just cause, proportionality etc.) as a framework within which to assess their moral permissibility. I argue that this is a mistake. The just war principles are derived from a set of complex and detailed arguments all planted firmly within the context of war. These arguments contain premises that, whilst they may hold true in the case of war, do not always hold true in <b>the</b> case of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the</b> rich just war tradition does offer a valuable starting point for theorising about <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> and in <b>the</b> thesis I consider how the wider just war tradition might be brought to bear on <b>the</b> case of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions,</b> beginning, not with the just war principles, but with the underlying arguments for those principles. In particular, I consider whether <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be justified {{on the grounds that they}} are a form of self- or other-defence, that they are the ‘lesser evil’ and that they are a form of punishment. I argue that certain types of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be justified on the grounds that they are a form of self- or other- defence and that, in extreme circumstances, certain types of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> can be justified as the ‘lesser evil’. However, I argue that <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> cannot be justified on the grounds of punishment. I also develop a ‘clean hands’ argument for <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> that is unavailable to the just war theorist; I argue that where the goods and services to be supplied would contribute to human rights violations or other wrongful acts, there is a duty to impose <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> to avoid complicity in this wrongdoing...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} when <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> should {{be imposed on}} liberal democracies that violate democratic norms. The argument is made from the social-liberal standpoint, which recognises the moral status of political communities. While social liberals rarely refer to <b>the</b> use of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> as a pressure tool, by examining why they restrict military intervention and economic aid to cases of massive human rights violations or acute humanitarian need, the article is able to show why {{they are likely to}} impose strong restrictions on <b>the</b> use of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> as well. After reconstructing <b>the</b> social-liberalcase against <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions,</b> <b>the</b> article develops the argument that liberal democracies have reasons to support sanctions on other liberal democracies, even when they perpetrate injustices on a smaller scale. Liberal democracies share especially strong ideological, cultural and institutional bonds, and these peer group relations open them to mutual influence. When one liberal democracy commits serious injustices while still proclaiming allegiance to the democratic ethos, it can adversely affect the vitality of the democratic culture in those other liberal democracies with which it maintains close relations. Other liberal democracies therefore have the right and the obligation to condemn this behaviour, in order to preserve their allegiance to their values. The article defends <b>the</b> use of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> in light of some recent critiques, and concludes by providing an overall assessment of the factors which liberal democracies ought to take into account when they consider imposing <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> on other liberal democracies...|$|R
