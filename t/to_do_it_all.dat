Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E
25|$|However, the Sotenos {{are best}} known for Tree of Life sculptures. The {{time it takes to}} {{complete}} a Tree depends on size and complexity, anywhere from a day to two months of 15-hour workdays. Sizes can range from twenty centimeters to over a meter in height. The sculptures are made from the reddish and yellow clays found in a nearby community called Ocotitlán. The mined clay is left out to dry and the clumps broken up, sometimes but putting them out into the street for cars to roll over. As needed, the powdered clay is mixed with water and a flower called “tule” to soften and whiten the clay. The small details may be made with molds, but a number of artisans in the family, including Oscar, prefer <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> by hand. Details and branches may be attached or reinforced by wire, but both Oscar and Tiburcio avoid the use of wire as it can break over time. The piece is carefully dried and fired. The largest trees may be fired in separate parts and in stages. Then they painted with anilines, natural pigments, acrylics and sometimes enamel.|$|E

HBO had earlier said that it had put [...] "probably 160 lawyers" [...] onto the task of reviewing the film in anticipation of challenges from the notoriously litigious church. Sheila Nevins of HBO commented {{that she could not}} believe how aggressive the church had been. Not only did it effectively provide free advertising for the film, but its hostility had made HBO Documentary Films even more determined to produce the film: [...] "I thought, 'They really don't want us <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> the reason more to do it.'" ...|$|E

In particular, {{the lyrics}} detail the {{personal}} life of Katie Morosky, the character she portrays in the film. Specifically, her troubling relationship with Robert Redford's Hubbell Gardiner is explained, [...] "Memories light {{the corners of}} my mind / Misty watercolor memories {{of the way we}} were" [...] and [...] "Memories may be beautiful and yet". Streisand sings, [...] "What's too painful to remember / We quickly choose to forget", where she longs for nostalgia, which Rolling Stones Stephen Holden described as an implication that [...] "resonate in the current social malaise".

500|$|... "Cut Man" [...] {{ends with}} a long action {{sequence}} filmed in a single take. DeKnight called it the [...] "most complicated action scene" [...] in the series, due to the technical difficulty in filming it, and credited Goddard, episodic director Phil Abraham, stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera, and series cinematographer Matt Lloyd with realizing it. He also named [...] films as inspiration for the sequence. There {{were only a few}} days to plan and set up the fight, as opposed to a film which would allow [...] "at least a couple of weeks", and it took 7 or 8 takes to get the shot right. Silvera explained that the scene was always scripted to be a one-shot, and that he had intended to work around it with wipes, but Abraham challenged the team <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> for real, which allowed the fight to feel more grounded by having them [...] "slow down the fight, and just have this raw, animalistic feeling happening." [...] The final shot does include some 'Texas Switches' between actors and stunt doubles, but was ultimately filmed with no cuts.|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{suggested}} an alternative cover. He instructed the Polydor art department to design artwork using four statues from the Guards Memorial, from a photo session the band had recently done {{in front of}} the monument which commemorates the war dead of the First World War. Four of the soldier statues were cut out from the shot of the band. Siouxsie found the sleeve a workable solution, as she was drawn in by the imagery conjured up by the words for [...] "In Flanders Fields", which inspired [...] "Poppy Day". For her, it was the linchpin for the album. The poppy reproduced on the album cover is a symbol of Remembrance Day. The designer, Rob O'Connor, said about the layout: [...] "The wreath of poppies was devised to help add colour and create a graphic device". An embossed sleeve was planned, with the four soldiers inked in the card, but was not used because the band did not receive the proofs in time. Morris and McKay blamed Stevenson, Siouxsie and Severin, although it was Polydor that refused the extra expense at the last minute. Nevertheless, Severin succeeded in pushing for a gatefold cover: [...] "We wanted it all white because you were supposed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> black, and you were supposed to have blackmail lettering on it and so we had it nice and classic", he stated. Maybury's drawings of the band were used on the inner spread; it was {{the only part of the}} original design that survived.|$|E

500|$|Soon I Will Be Invincible takes characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} {{associated with}} the comic book format and re-casts them using the novel's prose format. This use of superhero fiction in an alternate format was compared to other similar, successful attempts, like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and the TV serial No Heroics. Several reviewers contrasted the novel's elements of realism with Alan Moore's Watchmen and Rick Veitch's Bratpack which portrayed a darker side of more realistic superheroes. Novels cited as being similar included Donald Barthelme's Snow White, Robert Coover's Stepmother, and the works of Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem. The novel format allowed for more character development, which Grossman took advantage of by portraying them as [...] "real, human characters, {{with all of the}} foibles that come with the territory" [...] in what one reviewer called a [...] "hybridization of character and genre". Grossman described it as [...] "a book about real people who happen to be [...] or supervillains" [...] and that if it were a comic, it would be [...] "page after page of thought balloons". Compared to comic stories, the reviewer for the Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote [...] "The common denominator for most superhero comic books is that they don't make fun of themselves - the believability of their stories is never called into question. They take the heroes seriously. Not so in literature. When a novel appears with comic books as its focus, its author will undoubtedly believe that his or her theme is far more important - far more serious - than the comic books that inspired them. ... tries <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> combining humor and comic-book adventure with a literary sense of character. ...The result is a postmodern, inventive, comic-book plot with literary aspirations, and its only problem is that it isn't entirely successful as either humor or as straight adventure." ...|$|E
