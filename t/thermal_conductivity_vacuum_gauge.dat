However, {{there is still a}} lack of knowledge about their performance when actually applied in buildings. In fact, the thermal bridging effects that occur in VIP junctions are not easily evaluable while produce a reduction of the global thermal performance. In this paper, the linear thermal transmittances related to VIP junctions considering different joint materials between VIPs panels and different wall configurations were assessed through a 2 D numerical analysis. Finally, through a quasi-steady state simulation, a parametric building case study was analysed, with the aim to evaluate the influence of the thermal bridging effects on the overall building energy need. The results shows that the thermal bridging effect due to VIPs assemblies have not a negligible influence on the overall building energy performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} anode heating from energetic electrons produced by field emission. Large electric fields accelerate emitted electrons as they traverse the vacuum gap toward the anode. Electron energy is transferred to the anode by collisions with the lattice. The nonequilibrium transfer of electron kinetic energy to anode thermal energy is examined quantitatively. Results demonstrate that the energy distribution of impinging electrons affects the transmission and dissipation of thermal energy. A Monte Carlo technique is used to resolve the thermalization of electrons and accounts for electron beam strength and spatial distribution. The results indicate that local heat fluxes of the order 10 kW cm 2 occur at the anode surface and that heating is a strong function of field strength because of the exponential relationship between applied voltage and current. Under practical conditions, temperature increases of 10 C are predicted from a single point emission source. Index Terms—Anode heating, electron field emission, Monte Carlo.

40|$|The steel-jacketed {{steam heating}} {{pipeline}} employs vacuum insulation {{to improve the}} insulating effect and reduce the corrosion, and hence increases the heat transfer efficiency of the heating network and building energy efficiency. It is important in improving the thermal insulation to investigate the impact of factors that insulate the effects and thermal properties of the pipeline. The thermal insulation of this pipeline comprises the vacuum layer and the insulating material layer. Experiments were performed to measure the combined heat transfer and equivalent <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of the insulating material in the vacuum and rarefied air employed in the pipeline's insulation. The thermal properties {{of this type of}} insulation at vacuum pressures of 0. 5 ~ 1013 mbar, employing thermal media temperatures of 343 ~ 573 K and with different thicknesses of vacuum layer, are discussed for this pipeline, for which diameters of inner steel pipe/steel jacket are DN 50 /DN 250, DN 100 /DN 300, DN 200 /DN 500 and DN 500 /DN 850, respectively. The results show that reduction in vacuum pressure reduces the heat loss in the pipeline. The equivalent <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of the insulating material layer is distinctively lower than the vacuum layer, but decreasing the vacuum pressure improves the insulating effect of vacuum layer substantially more than insulating the material layer. As the vacuum pressure decreases from 1013 mbar (atmospheric pressure) to 10 mbar at the thermal media temperature of 523 K e. g., the reduction of equivalent <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of <b>vacuum</b> layer is approximately three times greater than that of insulating material layer. The equivalent <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of the <b>vacuum</b> layer are lower and decease faster as the vacuum pressure is lower than 100 mbar, but the equivalent <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of insulating material layer are lower and decease faster as the vacuum pressure is lower than 50 mbar. The pressure in vacuum insulation should be controlled lower than 20 mbar to achieve desirable insulating effects.

40|$|The paper “Transient {{plane source}} {{techniques}} for <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> and <b>thermal</b> diffusivity measurements of solid materials” by Silas E. Gustafsson, 1991, presents the following method to measure <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity.</b> A small, thin circular disc {{is placed in}} the center between two slabs of the studied material. The disc is heated electrically. The mean temperature over the disc area is measured as function of time. The <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> and <b>thermal</b> diffusivity is determined by fitting an analytical solution to the measured temperature curve. The analytical solution for a constant heat source in a circular thin plate imbedded in an infinite surrounding volume of the material is presented by Gustafsson in the paper and preceding publications in the reference list of the paper. In {{the first part of this}} study, this analytical solution is derived in a different way that gives somewhat more concise formulas, which require less computer time.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In architecture, the outstandingly low <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of <b>vacuum</b> {{insulation}} panels (VIPs) of 4 103 W/(mK) allows {{to realize}} thin thermal insulation layers. Typical U-values are 0. 2 W/(m 2 K) for a 2 cm-thick VIP. On the other hand, with vacuum-insulated façades the relative effect of thermal bridges is {{much stronger than}} that for conventionally insulated buildings. In this work, different thermal bridges are investigated. Especially with VIPs with laminated Al foils (here the aluminum foil is 8 mm thick and laminated {{on both sides with}} plastic foils of 15 mm PET and 50 mm PE), strong thermal bridges {{around the perimeter of the}} VIPs occur. Also the mounting system can have a strong negative effect on the thermal performance of VIP-insulated walls. As our calculations show, the effect of the thermal bridge depends strongly on the thermal contact of the VIPs with the wall. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize every vacuum-insulated construction in order to make the best use of the low <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of VIPs. As an example, we describe how VIPs were effectively integrated into a renovated gable façade and into a new ultra-low energy timber building.

No research has been performed previously on determining the anisotropic effective <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of dry granular beds under compressive uniaxial pressure. The objectives of this study were to examine the validity of the isotropic property assumption and to develop a fundamental understanding of the effective <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of a dry, noncohesive granular bed under uniaxial compression. Two experiments were developed to simultaneously measure the effective vertical and horizontal <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of particle beds. One measured effective <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> in an atmosphere of air. The second measured effective <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> in a <b>vacuum</b> environment. Measurements were made as compressive vertical pressure was increased to show the relationship between increasing pressure and effective vertical and horizontal <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity.</b> The results of this experiment show quantitatively the conductivity anisotropy for different materials. Based on the effective <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> models in the literature and results of the two experiments, a simple model was derived to predict the increase in effective vertical and horizontal <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> with increasing compressive vertical applied pressure of a granular bed immersed in a static fluid.
