5|$|Nokian <b>Tyres</b> {{concentrates}} on the consumer car and vehicle tyre replacement and premium snow tyre markets; they do not supply automobile manufacturers <b>tyres</b> for new car production. The greater prices consistently found in those markets result in higher profitability compared {{to the rest of}} the tyre industry. The company also produces retreading materials and tyre pressure monitors. It also previously manufactured bicycle <b>tyres</b> but currently licenses the Nokian name on bicycles <b>tyres</b> to another Finnish company. The Vianor retail tyre store chain, which services cars in addition to selling <b>tyres,</b> is owned by Nokian <b>Tyres</b> PLC.|$|E
5|$|Nokian <b>Tyres</b> {{licenses}} {{production of}} its <b>tyres</b> to {{companies in the}} United States (Bridgestone, LaVergne, Tennessee plant), Slovakia (Matador, Puchov plant), Indonesia (PT Gajah Tunggal Tbk company), and the People's Republic of China (Giti Tire), as well as contracts manufacture of agriculture and industrial <b>tyres</b> in Spain and India. In the past, some United States contract manufacturing was done by Cooper Tire's Findlay, Ohio plant. Contract manufacture by Giti Tire includes production of up to 500,000 Nokian summer <b>tyres</b> with expansion up to 1.5 million <b>tyres</b> per year. Some Nokian agricultural and industrial <b>tyres</b> were made under contract by the Tofan Grup in Romania for two years until December 1999, when Nokian <b>Tyres</b> withdrew, citing quality standards. Contract manufacture {{of these types of}} heavy <b>tyres</b> was then undertaken by Michelin at its Polish plant in Stomil-Olsztyn from 2000 until 2005, when Nokian began to shift contract manufacture of industrial <b>tyres</b> to Bridgestone's factory in Bilbao, Spain and agricultural <b>tyres</b> to Balkrishna <b>Tyres</b> in Bhiwadi, India. With an increase in tyre demand as a result of improving economies, Nokian is considering increasing production as well as outsouring additional tyre manufacture in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Nokian <b>Tyres</b> {{manufactures}} {{truck and}} bus <b>tyres</b> sold under the Nokian Hakkapeliitta brand. Steer, traction, and trailer <b>tyres</b> are marketed. Nokian Heavy <b>Tyres</b> Ltd is {{a manufacturer of}} special <b>tyres</b> for forestry, industrial machinery, and agriculture. Its products are sold as original equipment as well on the replacement tyre market. Nokian <b>Tyres</b> produces a number of product lines, including the Tractor Industrial 2 and Country King. Nokian <b>Tyres</b> is a world market leader in forestry <b>tyres,</b> which are a key product of the Nokian Heavy <b>Tyres</b> subsidiary. Nokian forestry <b>tyres</b> include the Skidder and Cut-To-Length model lines. The Skidder <b>tyres</b> have a 25 degree bar angle and the Cut-To-Length <b>tyres</b> have a 35 degree bar angle. Bar angle is a tyre tread measurement. Smaller bar angles are associated with higher traction {{at the expense of}} increased mud accumulation.|$|E

5|$|Nokian <b>Tyres</b> {{produces}} <b>tyres</b> {{for passenger}} cars, SUVs, and vans. Nokian branded <b>tyres</b> {{are sold in}} over 60 countries. Nokian <b>Tyres</b> designed the first winter <b>tyres</b> in 1934 and has more winter tyre patents than any other manufacturer. Nokian <b>Tyres</b> {{is known for its}} winter <b>tyres,</b> {{not to be confused with}} all-season <b>tyres.</b> Nokian winter <b>tyres</b> have been described as a favourite of critics and have been well received in winter test results by several publications. Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance, offering lower fuel consumption. Nokian was the first company to produce a tyre that allowed for year-round use by having different tread patterns on the lateral and medial aspect of the tread. One pattern is optimised for winter and another pattern is designed as an all-season pattern.|$|E
5|$|Production of bicycle <b>tyres</b> {{and inner}} tubes started in 1974 in Lieksa, Finland. In 2004, Nokian <b>Tyres</b> sold its bicycle tyre {{business}} to Suomen Rengastehdas Oy for â‚¬3.6 million. This successor company {{remains one of}} the few manufacturers of tungsten carbide-studded snow <b>tyres</b> for bicycles. Suomen Rengastehdas continues to produce bicycle <b>tyres,</b> including all Nokian-branded bicycle <b>tyres.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nokian <b>Tyres</b> (which had {{manufactured}} <b>tyres</b> {{under the}} Nokia brand; Nokian is the genitive) was split from the Nokia Corporation when Nokian <b>Tyres</b> Limited {{was created in}} 1988 as a joint venture company. Nokian <b>Tyres</b> PLC shares were floated on the Helsinki Stock Exchange (OMX Helsinki) in 1995. Nokia, which became the largest mobile telephone manufacturer in 1998, ended its ownership interest in Nokian <b>Tyres</b> in 2003, selling its holding of 2 million shares to Bridgestone Europe NV/SA, {{a subsidiary of the}} Japanese tyre manufacturer Bridgestone, for U.S. $73.2 million. This made Bridgestone the largest shareholder, with an 18.9% stake, later diluted to 16.8%. Bridgestone announced that Nokian <b>Tyres</b> would be operated independently, but it would consider complementing the company's product development, testing, and distribution.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Australian Grand Prix, <b>tyre</b> {{supplier}} Pirelli brought its white-banded medium compound <b>tyre</b> as {{the harder}} [...] "prime" [...] <b>tyre</b> and the yellow-banded soft compound <b>tyre</b> as the softer [...] "option" [...] <b>tyre,</b> whereas in 2011, the [...] "prime" [...] compound was the silver-banded hard compound <b>tyre.</b>|$|R

5|$|Nokian <b>Tyres</b> also {{produces}} materials for retreading and refurbishing used <b>tyres.</b> Nokian Noktop and Kraiburg, an industry competitor, produce {{most of the}} retreading materials for the European market. The RoadSnoop Pressure Watch, a tyre pressure monitor for race cars, is also produced by Nokian <b>Tyres.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nokian <b>Tyres</b> {{produces}} 23,000 <b>tyres</b> per day at {{a factory}} in Nokia, Finland, and 200,000 <b>tyres</b> a year under the Bridgestone brand name. The original factory was built in 1904, the current one in 1945; it has expanded several times since then. Nokian <b>Tyres</b> has 27 assembly lines at its Finnish plant. The plant uses radio frequency devices to monitor the inventory of materials used to manufacture <b>tyres,</b> such as the 100-metre long strips of rubber tread. Shortages of rubber tread can halt production and so keeping an adequate supply of materials increases efficiency. Despite trade journals discussing this technique, Nokian declines to confirm its production methods.|$|E

5|$|The {{demand for}} Nokian <b>tyres</b> is seasonal, {{as a high}} {{percentage}} of the company's sales are of winter <b>tyres,</b> but it has reduced seasonal fluctuations by its development of summer and all weather <b>tyres.</b> According to the company, more than 80% of its passenger car and van tyre sales are winter <b>tyres.</b> Winter tyre sales have a strong seasonal characteristic with 30% of retail sales occurring in the ten days after the first snowfall, thus presenting challenges in production and delivery.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} resumed on lap 13 and Button, who had changed to {{intermediate}} <b>tyres</b> before the safety car period, {{was given a}} drive-through penalty for speeding behind the safety car, emerging in 15th place. Vettel began to enlarge his lead over Alonso and Massa in second and third. Alonso and the Mercedes pitted for intermediate <b>tyres,</b> leaving Massa in second and Kobayashi in third by lap 17. Barrichello, who switched for intermediates as the safety car came in, began setting times at the same pace as the leaders, and gained 15th position as the drivers in front changed <b>tyres.</b> On lap 19, a rain storm arrived at the circuit, forcing the drivers on intermediate <b>tyres</b> to switch back to full wets. Alonso and Button, who were in fifth and eighth respectively, fell to ninth and eleventh, while the drivers on the full wet <b>tyres</b> began pitting for fresh wet <b>tyres.</b> The safety car was brought out on lap 20 due to {{the intensity of the}} rain, and Vettel, Webber, Massa and Buemi, who had not changed <b>tyres,</b> went to the pitlane for fresh full wets. After six laps under the safety car, the conditions were getting worse, and the race was suspended.|$|E
5|$|Vianor sells twomillion <b>tyres</b> annually, {{including}} Michelin and Bridgestone brands {{as well as}} Nokian <b>tyres.</b> Car servicing and a tyre hotel, {{facilities for}} customers to store summer or winter <b>tyres</b> during the off-season, are also offered.|$|E
5000|$|As for the 2012 Malaysian Grand Prix, <b>tyre</b> {{supplier}} Pirelli brought its two hardest compounds, {{with the}} orange-banded hard compound <b>tyre</b> being the harder [...] "prime" [...] <b>tyre,</b> and the white-banded medium compound <b>tyre</b> as the softer [...] "option" [...] <b>tyre.</b> This {{was the first}} time the hard compound <b>tyre</b> was used during the 2013 season.|$|R

40|$|The {{pneumatic}} <b>tyre</b> is {{a difficult}} component to model accurately in all natural vehicle environments. Proposed <b>tyre</b> models should be validated with real test data collected on the specific <b>tyre</b> being modelled under the specified application conditions. The rubber in a <b>tyre</b> oxidises with the oxygen in the air used to inflate {{it as well as}} the oxygen in the air surrounding it. The effects of a <b>tyreâ€˜s</b> age on the performance characteristics of a <b>tyre</b> such as vertical, longitudinal and lateral stiffness, are not well researched. In this study, the effects of a <b>tyreâ€™s</b> age on stiffness parameters were determined. A <b>tyre</b> was artifically aged and tested periodically during the aging process. Simplified methods of quantifying the age of the <b>tyre</b> were investigated and used to update a validated FTire model. The results indicate that the vertical and longitudinal stiffnesses of the <b>tyre</b> have convincing dependencies on the age of the <b>tyre.</b> The use of the Shore A hardness of the <b>tyre</b> tread to update the FTire model was found to have good potential in accounting for the age of the <b>tyre...</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet <b>tyres.</b> The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate <b>tyres.</b> Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and getting stuck in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed <b>tyres.</b> The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio PÃ©rez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate <b>tyres.</b> Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick <b>tyres,</b> while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{was first}} to finish the race, having {{cautiously}} driven his car to the line in very wet conditions, followed by Massa and Heidfeld. Heidfeld rose from ninth position during the final laps due to the superior grip of the intermediate <b>tyres</b> put on during a pit stop two laps prior {{to the end of}} the race. Fernando Alonso and Timo Glock similarly benefited from intermediate <b>tyres,</b> Alonso finishing fourth and Glock eighth, having passed Webber on the final corner. Conversely, Toro Rosso drivers Bourdais and Vettel, who were third and fourth with one lap to go, were pushed down to seventh and fifthpositions due to the lack of grip of their dry-weather <b>tyres.</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into the relationships between the <b>tyre</b> strain feature and <b>tyre</b> operating conditions based on finite element analysis and experiments {{for the development of a}} strain-based intelligent <b>tyre</b> system, which could estimate the <b>tyre</b> operating characteristics for optimising vehicle dynamics control and improving vehicle safety. A 175 / 505 R 13 <b>tyre</b> is adopted as the subject of this study. An efficient and effective material property determination procedure is developed for investigating the rubber and reinforcement material properties by experiment. Considering the possibility of the absence of <b>tyre</b> composite profile due to proprietary protection by <b>tyre</b> manufacturer, a novel imagebased method is developed to capture the <b>tyre</b> geometry feature from the <b>tyre</b> product cut cross-section. Both the 2 D and 3 D finite element <b>tyre</b> models are created in the commercial finite element code ABAQUS. The generated finite element <b>tyre</b> models are validated with experimental data and then adopted to construct the comprehensive relationship between <b>tyre</b> strain feature and <b>tyre</b> operating characteristics. Experimental validation of these estimation models are implemented based on a custom designed test system. Finally, some recommendations are presented for improving the capability of the finite element <b>tyre</b> model and the strain-based intelligent <b>tyre</b> test system.

5|$|In 2009, the North American market {{accounted}} for over 10% of the company's net sales. Nokian <b>Tyres</b> has a tyre subsidiary based in LaVergne, Tennessee (USA). In that market, Nokian <b>Tyres</b> sell only to independent dealers, {{some of whom}} use the tyre products to fill in gaps in their product lines instead of an exclusive or majority share. This results in some dealers being knowledgeable about specific <b>tyres</b> but not Nokian Tyre's full tyre product range.|$|E
5|$|In {{a second}} letter, also dated June 18, Dupasquier and Shorrock {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} not permit their teams to race on the Michelin <b>tyres</b> used during qualification without changes to the circuit, and reiterated their request to slow down Turn 13. Whiting's brief reply maintained that no such change would be permitted, and gave the teams the choice of limiting speeds through Turn 13, using <b>tyres</b> of a different specification to those used in qualifying, subject to a penalty, or changing <b>tyres</b> repeatedly, which would have been permitted if a driver's safety were at issue.|$|E
5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched <b>tyres</b> {{at the front of}} the car during the first stint, meaning that the <b>tyres</b> spun in the opposite direction to which they were designed, causing his understeer.

40|$|Future {{active safety}} systems for {{vehicles}} will need accurate information {{about the state of}} the vehicle. <b>Tyre</b> sensors certainly offer an interesting option to evaluate the operating state of an individual <b>tyre.</b> On the other hand, <b>tyre</b> behaviour in some driving conditions is not completely understood and <b>tyre</b> sensor measurements can contribute to the fundamentals of <b>tyre</b> research as well. This thesis discusses a method to measure the carcass deflection of a rolling <b>tyre.</b> <b>Tyre</b> force estimation algorithms are proposed and tested in real time with a low-cost micro-controller unit. The <b>tyre</b> force information is then exploited to estimate the lateral state of a car. In addition, the <b>tyre</b> sensor signals in aquaplaning are carefully studied and the hydrodynamic and viscous aquaplaning zones were separated from the data in post-processing. Another method was developed to estimate partial and full aquaplaning in real time. The results obtained support the development of more production-friendly <b>tyre</b> sensor concepts. The relations between carcass deflections and <b>tyre</b> forces that were obtained can be useful for completely different types of sensors. In addition, <b>tyre</b> behaviour in complex conditions can be measured and the results can validate <b>tyre</b> models...|$|R
