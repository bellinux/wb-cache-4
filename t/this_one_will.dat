2500|$|From around 1985 {{until the}} late 1990s, several {{companies}} replicated the Countach {{with varying degrees of}} success. In 1985, Gary Thompson and Pete Jackson rented a real Countach from an up-market Manchester car-rental company and made a glass-fiber mold of it. This mold resulted in a number of UK-based manufacturers producing their own Countach replicas. A few were able to produce remarkably good replicas, including Paul Lawrenson of Prova Cars, Alan Booth of Sienna Cars, Phil Cheetham of Mirage Replicas, and Ken Cook of Brightwheel/Classic Replicas.'Which Kit' said in their March 1988 write-up on the CR6 Stinger; [...] "Brightwheel Replicas CR6 Stinger is unquestionably the best Countach Replica we've driven" [...] Steve Cropley said in [...] "Car" [...] Feb 1989, {{is said to be the}} best available and it does set a high standard, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>will</b> really fool them" [...] Many other praises were made about the Stinger during the time it was made (1988–1989)and all but one of the factory cars went to Japan.(Ken Cook. 2015)At the end of Brightwheel as a company, as the kit and fully built cars only sold in small numbers due to their complexity and build price, the moulds were sold to a company in Dallas. It is not known how they went with their sales or what they called their version. I went to their factory to show them how to make the bodies. (Ken Cook owner of Brightwheel. 2017) DC Supercars now has Phil Cheetham moulds and is producing Countach replicas.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{reception}} {{for the movie}} was mostly mixed. The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stars saying that,"Emraan Hashmi & Kangana bring the Gangster magic again....they have {{done a good job}} whereas Adhyayan Suman shows promise." [...] Bollywood Hungama gave a good review saying [...] "On the whole, Raaz – The Mystery Continues is rich in the horror quotient {{and that is one of}} its major USPs, besides the highly competent performances by its principal cast and a lilting musical score. At the box-office, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>will</b> continue the winning streak of Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt's Vishesh Films. The 4-day weekend [...] will only cement its status further. Go for it!". The lead actors were praised for their performance. In the review, [...] "On the acting front, both Emraan and Kangana vie for top honours. Emraan is excellent. He conveys a lot through facial expressions and that's the sign of a proficient actor. He's just getting better and better with every film. Kangana is top notch. After Fashion, this one's another power-packed performance from the actress. Adhyayan Suman is super-confident and registers a strong impact, especially towards the climax. He shows promise. Jackie Shroff is quite okay in a brief role." [...] NDTV gave negative reviews for the movie saying [...] "The first Raaz, which married the Hollywood film What Lies Beneath with the myth of Savitri who pursued Yamraj until her husband came back to life, had a cheesy appeal. This Raaz is a big bore. The scares are tired and Suri doesn't know how to pace them out. So, every minute, something awful is happening, from a bull attack to mutilation and murder. Was I scared? Not once. This mystery was better left discontinued." [...] AOL reviewer Noyon Jyoti Parasara too rated the film low. He gave the film a mere 2 out of 5 and said, [...] "Raaz – The Mystery Continues, which with all its hype was supposed scare the lights out of you, could not make me bat an eyelid out of fear.
