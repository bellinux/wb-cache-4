The primary purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power generation and it supports a 160 MW power station. Construction on the 146.30 m tall dam began in 2009 and its reservoir began to fill in November 2013.

In particular, this thesis presents modeling and fabrication of quantum dot channel field effect transistors (QDC-FETs) using cladded Ge quantum dots on poly-Si thin films grown on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. HfAlO 2 high-k dielectric layers {{are used for}} the gate dielectric. QDC-FETs exhibit multi-state I-V characteristics which enable 2 -bit processing, and reduce FET count and power dissipation, {{and are expected to}} make {{a significant impact on the}} digital circuit design. Germanium quantum dot QDC-FETs provide higher electron mobility than conventional polysilicon FETs, which is comparable to crystalline silicon. Quantum dot channel FETs are also configured as floating gate quantum dot nonvolatile memories (QDC-QDNVMs). In NVMs, we use floating gate comprising of GeOx-Ge quantum dots. QD nonvolatile memories (QD-NVMs) are fabricated on crystalline silicon substrates. HfAlO 2 high-k insulator layers are used for both <b>tunnel</b> <b>gate</b> oxide as well as control gate dielectric. QDC-NVMs not only provide significantly higher drain current ID, but also higher threshold voltage shifts (DVTH), and exhibit potential for fabricating multi-bit nonvolatile memories...|$|E
30|$|A novel radar-based {{system for}} {{longwall}} coal mine machine localisation is described. The system, {{based on a}} radar-ranging sensor and designed to localise mining equipment {{with respect to the}} mine <b>tunnel</b> <b>gate</b> road infrastructure, is developed and trialled in an underground coal mine. The challenges of reliable sensing in the mine environment are considered, and the use of a radar sensor for localisation is justified. The difficulties of achieving reliable positioning using only the radar sensor are examined. Several probabilistic data processing techniques are explored in order to estimate two key localisation parameters from a single radar signal, namely along-track position and across-track position, with respect to the gate road structures. For the case of across-track position, a conventional Kalman filter approach is sufficient to achieve a reliable estimate. However for along-track position estimation, specific infrastructure elements on the gate road rib-wall must be identified by a tracking algorithm. Due to complexities associated with this data processing problem, a novel visual analytics approach was explored in a 3 D interactive display to facilitate identification of significant features for use in a classifier algorithm. Based on the classifier output, identified elements are used as location waypoints to provide a robust and accurate mining equipment localisation estimate.|$|E

40|$|The Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) Asp-tRNAAsn/Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase (AdT) plays {{important}} roles in indirect aminoacylation and translational fidelity; however, its inter-domain communication and ammonia delivery mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the three activities of H. pylori AdT (glutaminase, kinase and transamidase) and used these reactions as probes to examine the inter-domain communication and ammonia delivery mechanisms between this enzyme 2 ̆ 7 s two isolated active sites. We adapted and optimized an assay to kinetically characterize a series of mutations at conserved positions throughout the putative AdT ammonia tunnel. The kinase assay enabled us to identify mutations within AdT, specifically T 149 and K 89, for further enzymatic characterization and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and correlation analyses to unveil a set of 59 residues that may form the interdomain communication pathway between AdT 2 ̆ 7 s two active sites. The glutaminase and transamidase assays identified another residue, D 185, in the GatA subunit. Kinetic and computational characterizations of D 185 AdT mutants suggest that D 185 serves as a general acid or base in ammonia delivery. These results are the first demonstration of acid/base chemistry within an ammonia tunnel. Finally, preliminary characterization of the predicted ammonia <b>tunnel</b> <b>gate</b> residues (K 89 and E 126 in the GatB subunit) suggest that proper positioning of the appropriate charge states in the tunnel are important for AdT catalysis.

The approach {{has been applied to}} study the gate leakage fluctuations due to the combined effect of oxide thickness variation (OTV) and discrete random dopants (RD) in an example 25 nm gate length MOSFET. OTV is the primary source of gate leakage fluctuations at high gate voltage, while RD are the main factor at high drain voltage. Both OTV and RD contribute to an average increase in the magnitude of the gate leakage with respect to that of a uniform device.

40|$|AbstractThe role of {{residues}} of the ornithine activator site is probed by mutagenesis in Escherichia coli carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS).

None of the mutations inactivates CPS. E 783 mutations hamper carbamate phosphorylation and increase K+ and MgATP requirements, possibly by perturbing the K+-loop near the carbamate phosphorylation site. Mutation E 892 A activates the enzyme similarly to ornithine, possibly by altering the position of K 891 {{at the opening of}} the tunnel that delivers the carbamate to its phosphorylation site. T 1042 V also influences modulation by IMP and UMP, supporting signal transmission from the nucleotide effector to the ornithine site mediated by a hydrogen bond network involving T 1042.

5000|$|During the 1960s {{the use of}} tunnel diodes in logic {{circuits}} was an active research topic. When compared to transistor logic gates of the time, the tunnel diode offered much higher speeds. Unlike other diode types, the tunnel diode offered the possibility of amplification of signals at each stage. The operating principles of a tunnel diode logic rely on biasing of the tunnel diode and supply of current from inputs over a threshold current, to switch the diode between two states. Consequently, tunnel diode {{logic circuits}} required a means to reset the diode after each logical operation. A simple <b>tunnel</b> diode <b>gate</b> offered little isolation between inputs and outputs and had low fan in and fan out. More complex <b>gates,</b> with additional <b>tunnel</b> diodes and bias power supplies, overcame some of these limitations.
