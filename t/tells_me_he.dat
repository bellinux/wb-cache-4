500|$|This {{aspect of}} the {{basement}} recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound {{came as a shock}} to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, [...] "Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [...] do? He comes to Nashville and <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar." [...] Dylan summed up the gap: [...] "At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads." ...|$|E
2500|$|The journalists also {{provided}} first-hand {{accounts of the}} discovery of the bodies. One of them, the BBC's reporter Jacky Rowland, reported that the dead [...] "were all ordinary men; farmers, labourers, villagers. They had all been shot in the head." [...] The dead were aged from 14 to 99 years old. ITN's correspondent Bill Neely was also present and described how other KVM monitors reacted at the scene: [...] "A Swedish monitor notes that the dead are all in civilian clothes and unarmed and that there are no signs of a battle... After working for two hours one monitor, a London police officer, <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> believes many of the victims have been shot at close range." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{clean-up}} {{order was}} placed on the mansion and Bryant's father took long service leave to assist in cleaning the interior. Harvey now invited Bryant to live with her in the mansion and they began spending large amounts of money, which included the purchase of more than thirty new cars in less than three years. The couple began to spend most days shopping, usually after having lunch in a local restaurant. Around this time, Bryant was reassessed for his pension and a note was attached to the paperwork: [...] "Father protects him from any occasion which might upset him as he continually threatens violence ... Martin <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> would like to go around shooting people. It would be unsafe to allow Martin out of his parents' control".|$|E

2500|$|The wider U.S. {{economy was}} soon {{hit by the}} effects of the Trent crisis. On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock {{exchange}} fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent. On December 20, Salmon P. Chase's broker refused to sell some of the secretary's holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community [...] "trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough". A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25-15 to suspend specie payments. Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin. This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers. Though the crisis was resolved soon afterwards, these difficulties were not: on January 10, Lincoln asked Quartermaster General Meigs [...] "General, what shall I do? The people are impatient; Chase has no money, and he <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> can raise no more; the General of the Armies has typhoid fever. The bottom is out of the tub. What shall I do?" [...] The Treasury was eventually forced to issue fiat money in the form of [...] "greenbacks" [...] to meet its obligations.|$|E
