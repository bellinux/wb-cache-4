40|$|According to International Air Transport Association‘s (IATA) Airline Industry Forecast 2012 - 2016, India's {{domestic}} {{air travel}} market would be {{among the top five}} globally, experiencing the second highest growth rate at CAGR of 13. 1 %. India has the potential to become the third largest aviation market by 2020 and the largest by 2030. There is large untapped potential for growth {{due to the fact that}} access to aviation is still a dream for nearly 99. 5 per cent of its population. Financial year 2012 - 2013 shows an increase of revenue by 30, 164. 3 million in comparison to the base year. All these borrowings are part of Turnaround Plan to ease Air India out of the debt burden of Rs 40, 000 Crores. It would be wrong, however to say that such capital infusion has yielded no results. After the implementation of the financial restructuring plan as approved by the UPA in 2012, the operating losses have halved from Rs 5, 138. 69 Crores in FY 2012 to Rs. 2, 171. 40 Crores in FY 2015 while net loss has climbed down from Rs. 7, 559. 74 Crores in FY 2012 to Rs. 5, 547. 47 Crores in FY 2015. The airline had demanded around Rs 1, 777 Crores more than the budgeted from the current government. This unexplained cut means that the airline is distressed and might lead to deficit of government guaranteed loans which in turn will lead to compulsory borrowings from banks. If the banks are restricted to lend to the Company that is functioning at a loss of Rs 21. 71 Billion, then Air India might have to raise funds from the market at higher cost further putting stress on its already besieged. At a time when the Aviation Sector seems on a high, it is demotivating that Air India‘s prospects to raise capital from the public seems shaky at best. The National Carrier had also approached the FinMin to allow it to raise Rs 10, 000 Crore as capital in the form of <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> <b>Bonds.</b> The Government turned sour on the proposal and was reluctant to act as a guarantor in such a deal...|$|R
