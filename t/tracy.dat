5|$|After {{discovering}} that <b>Tracy</b> {{is still in}} contact with NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Jack realizes that their relationship {{is the key to}} bringing <b>Tracy</b> back to TGS. Jack, therefore, orders Kenneth to break off all contact with <b>Tracy,</b> although this fails because of Kenneth's relationship with <b>Tracy.</b> Seeing an opportunity, Jack states that since Kenneth's duties were primarily taking care of <b>Tracy,</b> and <b>Tracy</b> no longer works at NBC, Kenneth is no longer needed. Not wanting Kenneth to lose his job, <b>Tracy</b> agrees to return on the stipulation that Kenneth keeps his job.|$|E

Jack and <b>Tracy</b> meet with an NBC shrink, and Jack role-plays Tracy's father, <b>Tracy,</b> and Tracy's mom, among several other people from Tracy's childhood, conveying the message that even though Tracy's parents may have divorced, they still loved him. This comforts <b>Tracy,</b> and affirms that while he loves his family, they are crazy, {{and he needs to}} stay away from them. <b>Tracy</b> hugs Jack, and tells him that he is the only family he needs.|$|E

50|$|The filming {{schedule}} was altered to accommodate <b>Tracy's</b> failing health.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). In this paper, we {{consider}} <b>Tracy's</b> proposal for universal criteria to judge the goodness of qualitative studies, and we explore her criteria by applying them to our own work. As a test of <b>Tracy's</b> claim to universality, we situate her ideas within a womanist caring framework, using it as an exemplar to theorize deliberately <b>Tracy's</b> criteria. We do this to evaluate just how theoretically limber <b>Tracy's</b> criteria actually are. We conclude that <b>Tracy's</b> criteria are useful because they are universal but not fixed and we build on her thinking to foreground ethics as an overarching framework for criteria rather than a standalone category. We highlight the urgency of returning the debate about criteria for qualitative work to the qualitative research community during a period when the legitimacy of qualitative work is under assault...|$|R
