5|$|In March 2016, an NGO, Justice Centre, {{reported}} {{its findings}} that deemed one domestic worker in six in Hong Kong {{to have been}} forced into labour. It criticised the government for being in denial <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> is a source, destination and transit area for human trafficking and forced labour, and said Hong Kong lags behind other countries in having a comprehensive set of laws and policies to tackle forced labour or trafficking.|$|E
50|$|The Tamar Development Project was {{restarted}} when <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> {{chief executive}} Donald Tsang announced in his policy address {{for the financial}} year 2006 <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong's</b> Central Government Offices, Legislative Council Building and the Office of the Chief Executive would be relocated to Tamar site, Admiralty.|$|R
50|$|The Government argued <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong's</b> {{tax base}} was narrow; thus, a single-rate GST was {{a viable option}} for <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> in order to broaden the tax base and secure the {{sustainability}} of tax revenues base {{and the capacity to}} meet public expenditure needs in the long run.|$|R

5|$|It stipulated <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> {{would retain}} its laws and be {{guaranteed}} {{a high degree}} of autonomy for at least 50 years after the transfer. The Hong Kong Basic Law, based on English law, would serve as the constitutional document after the transfer. It was ratified in 1990. The expiry of the 1898 lease on the New Territories in 1997 created problems for business contracts, property leases and confidence among foreign investors.|$|E
5|$|Internet {{censorship}} in Hong Kong operates {{under different}} principles and regulations {{from those of}} mainland China. In November 2015, the newly established Innovation and Technology Bureau pushed for the legislation of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2014, more popularly known as the Internet Article 23, which would severely limit the legality of derivative works and other activities previously permitted on the Internet. Supporters of the bill {{point to the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> is lagging behind in the protection of intellectual property rights, but detractors state that creative work on the Internet should be exempt from legislation, and the ordinance would severely violate human rights.|$|E
5|$|Oshii based {{the setting}} for Ghost in the Shell on Hong Kong. Oshii commented that his first thought to find {{an image of the}} future setting was an Asian city, but finding a {{suitable}} cityscape of the future would be impossible. Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model. He also said <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E

5|$|Following the Hong Kong {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and the Hong Kong blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in Hong Kong, the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the current flag of Hong Kong. In the 2010s, the former flag of Hong Kong was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between Hong Kong and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in Hong Kong, as well as perceived Chinese breaches of Hong Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration). The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse Hong Kong independence or the return of Hong Kong to British control, but rather because they felt <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said that they used the flag to express the contrasting values of China and Hong Kong. Advocates of the Hong Kong Independence Movement and the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for Hong Kong (香港) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Hong Kong Basic Law as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol of colonialism and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E

25|$|The HK {{government}} retorted <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> {{enjoyed a}} high degree of autonomy under one country, two systems enshrined in the Basic Law, adding that the eight “University Grants Committee-funded institutions were all independent and autonomous statutory bodies”.

25|$|As the Communists {{drew near}} to {{a victory in}} early 1949, there were fears <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> {{was going to be}} invaded by the Communists.

The garrison was reinforced and plans of emergency evacuation to Australia were made. However, the People's Liberation Army were ordered to stop advancing at the Shenzhen-Hong Kong border and Hong Kong remained a British colony.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Typhoon Nuri hit Hong Kong. The Observatory was criticised for {{hoisting}} a Typhoon Signal No. 8, {{which some}} considered unnecessary, and hoisting it too late.

In response to claims that Typhoon Signal No. 8, Lam stated that at least two people had been killed by the typhoon.

40|$|In this chapter, I {{would argue}} <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong’s</b> recent {{inflation}} {{is of the}} “cost-push” category, that it is to a degree self-inflicted, and moreover, that it is triggering a structural adjustment that will have long-term implications on the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> society.

25|$|Many {{political}} commentators claimed <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> {{would experience}} {{a surge in}} people claiming the right of abode from mainland China, possibly disrupting the economy of Hong Kong. The fear of massive influx of mainlanders soon raised widespread public concern. As a response, the Hong Kong Government asked the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to reinterpret Articles 22(4) and 24(2)(3) of Hong Kong's Basic Law, which effectively overturned the court decision. This move sparked large protests and debate {{over whether or not}} the judiciary of Hong Kong remained independent from the government of mainland China. On 3 December 1999, the Court of Final Appeal ruled that the NPC's interpretation of the Basic Law was constitutional. The Court's decision denied almost all people listed as plaintiffs, including those already in Hong Kong since the first week of 1997, the right of abode.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the {{competing}} claims for sovereignty, China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping recognised <b>that</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong,</b> with its free market economy, {{could not be}} assimilated into the People's Republic overnight and that any attempt {{to do so would}} not be in the interests of either. He advocated a more pragmatic approach known as the one country, two systems policy, in which Hong Kong (as well as Macau, and potentially also Taiwan) would be able to retain their economic systems within the PRC. On 19 December 1984, the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong (The Joint Declaration) was signed between the PRC and UK governments. Under this agreement, Hong Kong would cease to be a British Dependent Territory on 1 July 1997 and would thenceforth be a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC. Citizens opposed to the handover led to the first wave of emigration.|$|E
