5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt.</b> Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2006, {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} to explore <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt,</b> New Horizons, was launched, which flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015. Beyond the Pluto flyby, the mission's {{goal was to}} locate and investigate other, farther objects in <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the source of the Solar System's ecliptic comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> are relatively stable, and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are generally less stable.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt,</b> but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> proper.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (<b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|Although Pluto is {{currently}} the largest known KBO, {{there is at least}} one known larger object currently outside <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> that probably originated in it: Neptune's moon Triton (which, as explained above, is probably a captured KBO).|$|E

5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. <b>The</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E

40|$|We present new optical {{broadband}} colors, {{obtained with}} the Keck 1 and Vatican Advanced Technology telescopes, for six objects in <b>the</b> inner classical <b>Kuiper</b> <b>Belt.</b> Objects in <b>the</b> inner classical <b>Kuiper</b> <b>Belt</b> {{are of interest}} as they may represent the surviving members of <b>the</b> primordial <b>Kuiper</b> <b>Belt</b> that formed interior to the current position of the 3 : 2 resonance with Neptune, the current position of the plutinos, or, alternatively, they may be objects formed at a different heliocentric distance that were then moved to their present locations. The six new colors, combined with four previously published, show that the 10 inner belt objects with known colors form a neutral clump and a reddish clump in B-R color. Nonparametric statistical tests show {{no significant difference between}} the B-R color distribution of the inner disk objects compared to the color distributions of Centaurs, plutinos, or scattered disk objects. However, the B-R color distribution of <b>the</b> inner classical <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> objects does differ significantly from the distribution of colors in the cold (low inclination) main classical <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt.</b> <b>The</b> cold main classical objects are predominately red, while the inner classical belt objects are a mixture of neutral and red. The color difference may reveal the existence of a gradient in the composition and /or surface processing history in <b>the</b> primordial <b>Kuiper</b> <b>Belt,</b> or indicate that the inner disk objects are not dynamically analogous to the cold main classical belt objects.

5|$|The overall {{structure}} of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets.

If the Sun were replaced with U Orionis, its radius would extend beyond Mars's orbital zone (about 1.7 astronomical units), and, to be habitable with water at liquid state and a comfortable temperature, a planet would have to be located within 85 AU, within <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt's</b> orbital zone.|$|R
5|$|Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute {{believes}} the outer planets {{show signs of}} collisions with plutoids 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in diameter: Uranus could have been tipped off its axis by a plutoid, and Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, is probably a captured plutoid from <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E
5|$|The centaurs, {{which are}} not {{normally}} considered part of <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt,</b> are also thought to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than outward. The Minor Planet Center groups the centaurs and the SDOs together as scattered objects.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{scattered}} {{the majority}} of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards. This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed <b>the</b> current <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> and scattered disc. This scenario explains <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt's</b> and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances. Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.|$|R

5|$|The {{migration}} {{of the outer}} planets is also necessary {{to account for the}} existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt,</b> the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. <b>The</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> lies between 30 and 55AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000AU. Originally, however, <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30AU. Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.|$|E
