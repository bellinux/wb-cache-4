In this paper the relationship between the US unemployment rate and <b>the</b> welfare <b>participation</b> rate is examined in a structural VAR. It is found that the unemployment rate does not Granger-cause <b>the</b> welfare <b>participation</b> rate, while <b>the</b> converse is true. Moreover, a negative shock to <b>the</b> welfare <b>participation</b> rate predicts a reduction in the unemployment rate. The conclusion is that the decline in <b>the</b> welfare <b>participation</b> rate in <b>the</b> 1990 s should be attributed to restrictive welfare reforms, not to the fall in the unemployment rate. Further, the political choice to reduce <b>the</b> welfare <b>participation</b> rate may have inflated the reduction in the unemployment rate, by increasing the number of people willing to accept peripheral jobs, for instance in the Eating and drinking place.
