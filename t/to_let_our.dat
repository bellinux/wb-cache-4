2500|$|Alain Leroy Locke (September 13, 1885 – June 9, 1954) was an American writer, philosopher, educator, and {{patron of}} the arts. Distinguished as the first African-American Rhodes Scholar in 1907, Locke was the {{philosophical}} architect —the acknowledged [...] "Dean"— of the Harlem Renaissance. As a result, popular listings of influential African Americans have repeatedly included him. On March 19, 1968, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. proclaimed: [...] "We're going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> children know that the only philosophers that lived were not Plato and Aristotle, but W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke came through the universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among Paulding's {{government}} {{positions were}} those of secretary to the Board of Navy Commissioners in 1815–23 and Naval Agent in New York in 1824–38. President Martin Van Buren appointed him Secretary of the Navy in June 1838. As Secretary, he was a conservative figure, whose extensive knowledge of naval affairs was balanced by notable lack of enthusiasm for new technology. He opposed the introduction of steam propelled warships declaring that he would [...] "never consent <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> old ships perish, and transform our Navy into a fleet of (steam) sea monsters." [...] Nevertheless, his tenure was marked by advances in steam engineering, wide-ranging exploration efforts, enlargement of the fleet and {{an expansion of the}} Navy's apprenticeship program.|$|E
2500|$|Kairos Palestine {{publicly}} denounced Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren {{after he}} wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed, published on March 9, 2012, implying that Palestinian Muslims were at fault for much Palestinian Christian suffering. Calling the op-ed “inaccurate and manipulative text,” the group insisted that the suffering Palestinian Christians “is caused mainly by the occupation that systematically degrades all Palestinians, restricts our movement, confiscates our land, devastates our economy, and violates our rights.” The group also insisted that Palestinian Christians “refuse to be pitted against our Palestinian Muslim neighbours and friends” and “refuse <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> collective oppression be manipulated {{in a way that}} fragments us, obscures us, or masks the oppression’s true cause.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Sure, I mean it," [...] Charley went on. [...] "All {{we had to}} do, any time, was <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go <b>our</b> end--as I {{am going}} to do now, so that those Greeks can untangle their nets." ...|$|R
2500|$|As I've been a {{governor}} {{and seen the}} impact {{that the federal government}} can have holding down the interest of the teachers' unions and instead putting the interests of the kids and the parents and the teachers first, I see that the Department of Education can actually make a difference. So I supported No Child Left Behind. I still do. I know there are a lot in my party that don't like it, but I like testing in our schools. I think it allows us to get better schools, better teachers; allows us <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> kids have the kind of hope that they ought to have." [...] However, during a presidential primary debate in 2011 he said, [...] "education has to be held at the local and state level, not at the federal level. We need to get the federal government out of education." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Boers {{are only}} half-civilised," [...] remarked Soames; [...] "they {{stand in the}} way of progress. It will never do <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> {{suzerainty}} go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's later," [...] said Miss Walshingham. [...] "We're {{stopping}} {{until my}} brother's holiday begins and we're trying <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> house. Where {{are you staying}} in Folkestone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had <b>to.</b> I couldn't <b>let</b> <b>our</b> first citizen build {{a modern}} Rhine castle, could I? I have some public spirit left. And besides, I expect {{to build on}} Grant Avenue myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And one {{as little}} dreaded by the 60th, as any corps who wear the royal livery," [...] cried Henry Wharton, fiercely. [...] "Give {{but the word}} <b>to</b> charge, and <b>let</b> <b>our</b> actions speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like the}} berth {{as little as}} yourself, Mr. Barnstable," [...] {{returned}} the veteran seaman, in his calm manner, in which anxiety was, however, beginning to grow evident. [...] "We are short; but are afraid <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go <b>our</b> hold of the bottom, lest the sea cast us ashore. How make you out the wind?" ...|$|R
60|$|So {{we shall}} come back of course, if we live; indeed, we leave this house {{ready to come}} back to, meaning, if we can, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> rooms simply.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{we shall}} {{find it hard}} <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> little Rose {{go out of the}} family. How would Archie do? He has been well brought up and is a {{thoroughly}} excellent lad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was in {{hope that}} you would agree <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> {{marriage}} be known,' said Swithin, with some disappointment. 'I thought that these circumstances would make the reason for doing so doubly strong.' ...|$|E

50|$|During the 2005 Caribbean Week of Agriculture, the Surinamese Minister of Agriculture stated: We {{know that}} we have {{problems}} with fertile soil. We know that our food import bill is too high. So when we talk about marijuana, personally, for Suriname, I do not agree at this moment <b>to</b> say <b>let</b> <b>our</b> farmers start producing marijuana. What we are stimulating is produce food for our people.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{it is late}} in {{the year}} to sit long out of doors: we ought to be off this ledge before it gets too dark <b>to</b> <b>let</b> us see <b>our</b> footing. I daresay the horse is impatient.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not--well, {{you left}} me, in order <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> friends know where I was, {{that they might}} cast about for the means of getting me free. All this I understand; what next?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{too much}} bad Anguissola blood in you," [...] he said. [...] "Be careful lest out of our solicitude for you, we should find it well <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> leech attend you." ...|$|E
6000|$|She laughed again. [...] "So help me! if you haven't. Well, {{you asked}} me to run away with you--that's all, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> two souls unite. Damned lucky I took a day to think it over! Good-night." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{assisted}} our visitor {{into the}} mess-room, {{which was also}} our principal council-chamber, and there left him to talk business with Mr Strang while we returned to Bachelors' Hall <b>to</b> <b>let</b> off <b>our</b> effervescing spirits by indulging in a running commentary on the unexpected visit, and a minute analysis of the characters of Macnab and Big Otter, which, I must add, was decidedly favourable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Great heavens!" [...] exclaimed Mary, [...] "imagine {{a man who}} can want <b>to</b> <b>let</b> loose upon <b>our</b> {{poor little}} world every horrible noise that happens in the stars. Why, what under heaven would be the use of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather {{think it}} would be better <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him out, <b>our</b> chances on the high seas being at least as good as his own. I am no friend to blockades, which strike me as an un-English mode of {{carrying}} on a war." ...|$|R
60|$|We had {{determined}} to accept of three oxen from the chief, and to ride these when we felt fatigued; {{but we thought}} it best <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> native porters carry our baggage on their shoulders, as they had hitherto done.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll try {{it again}} to-morrow morning," [...] said Little Joe. [...] "I'll keep watch, {{and as soon as}} I see him coming, I'll drive out all the fish, just as I did to-day. I guess that'll teach him <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> fish alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sir,' said Berenger, the heart-sinking quelled by {{the effort}} of resistance, 'Madame de Selinville has my answer--I must take the consequences.

6000|$|... "Simply," [...] {{replied the}} Zingaro, [...] "that {{those who know}} aught of the Most Christian King, are aware that the purpose about which he is most anxious, is always that which he is least willing <b>to</b> declare. <b>Let</b> <b>our</b> gracious Louis send twelve embassies, and I will forfeit my neck to the gallows a year before it is due, if in eleven of them there is not {{something}} {{at the bottom of}} the ink horn more than the pen has written in the letters of credence." ...|$|R
6000|$|At length Cleopatra spoke. [...] "This {{is a heavy}} matter," [...] she said, [...] "and therefore, noble Dellius, we {{must have}} time <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> {{judgment}} ripen.

60|$|The British Government at this time, with a {{becoming}} spirit, gave {{orders that}} any port in the Mediterranean {{should be considered}} as hostile where the governor or chief magistrate should refuse <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>our</b> ships of war procure supplies of provisions, or of any article which they might require.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, my lord bishop," [...] called he {{from the}} other end of the table.

6000|$|When {{he came up}} to the stake, he gave {{a formal}} account of what he pretended to have done. [...] "I climbed in," [...] he said, [...] "at the window of your mosque at night, and found a narrow passage round to the image, where nobody could expect to meet me.
