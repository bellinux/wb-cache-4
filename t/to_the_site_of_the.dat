5|$|The town {{is close}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Radstock rail accident, a rail crash {{that took place}} on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, on 7 August 1876. Two trains {{collided}} on a single track section, resulting in the deaths of 15passengers.|$|E
5|$|By 1721, the Baptist {{community}} in Taunton had grown large, and reasonably affluent. They {{built a new}} chapel, funded entirely by the congregation, very near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Meeting House. The pastor of the church {{at the time was}} Joseph Jeffries, and during his ministry the church transitioned from a Baptist church to Unitarianism.|$|E
5|$|In medieval times, {{the wool}} trade was {{important}} in the town's economy, although this declined in the 18th century {{to be replaced by}} other industries such as brewing; the town continues to be a major centre for the production of cider. Shepton Mallet is the closest town <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glastonbury Festival, the largest music festival in Europe. Also nearby is the Royal Bath and West of England Society showground which hosts the Royal Bath and West Show, and other major shows and festivals.|$|E

50|$|Bro1 {{contains}} a Bro1 amino-terminal domain that binds to Snf7 of ESCRT-III. This binding brings Bro1 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> membrane abscission. Bro1 also binds the catalytic domain of Doa4, an ubiquitin hydrolase (deubiquitinase), bringing it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> abscission. Doa4 removes ubiquitin from cargo proteins being targeted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lysosome.|$|R
5|$|Orange Bowl {{organizers}} {{predicted that}} Virginia Tech fans, who were located closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, would be attracted by its proximity {{and the warm}} weather offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to boost {{the economic impact of}} the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American workers return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E
5|$|Originally various {{buildings}} were {{built around the}} curtain wall. Moving clockwise from {{the entrance to the}} Inner Court, the shape of the 12th-century castle chapel can still be made out on the curtain wall. Convention at the time required a chapel to point along a north-east/south-east axis; in order to achieve this, the chapel had to extend out considerably into the bailey, similar to the design at White Castle. The chapel is adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first stone hall in the castle, built around 1160; in the 16th and 17th centuries the chapel tower was probably also used as a cannon emplacement.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two {{armored personnel carriers}} were brought into Yerevan, positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building. An anti-terrorist squad from Russia also participated in the operation. Meanwhile, ambulance vehicles rushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shooting. President Robert Kocharyan was directing {{the operation of the}} security forces around the parliament building. While holding around 50 hostages inside the building, the men demanded a helicopter and airtime on national television for a political statement.|$|E

5|$|That {{night the}} {{regiment}} bivouacked at Katib Gannit and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle the next day, 6 August, but the Turkish army had withdrawn eastwards. The brigade {{was ordered to}} advance until contact was regained with the Turkish force, which they located around 12:00, {{to the east of}} Oghratina. The regiment remained in contact all day, without suffering any casualties. They also located a telephone wire that the withdrawing Turks had failed to disconnect, enabling them to monitor the German and Turkish command issuing orders.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The Medway long barrows all {{conformed}} {{to the same}} general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monument to be erected.|$|E

5|$|The hospital's {{design was}} criticised for not {{providing}} {{space for the}} storage of medical files. It was expected that all files would be stored electronically within five years. In the meantime, the paper medical files were transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Falkirk Royal Infirmary. An old X-ray department at the hospital was decontaminated and converted into a storage department {{at a cost of}} £40,000, and a taxi company was contracted to move the records between sites.|$|E
5|$|The name Gallox is {{believed}} to be derived from gallows as the village gallows were nearby, when it was called Gallocksbrigge. The bridge is close to Dunster Working Watermill and the base of the hill on which Dunster Castle sits and povides access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deer park. It also falls within the Dunster Conservation Area. It has been in the guardianship of English Heritage since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The railroad's Purdy's {{station is}} a short {{distance}} west of the next junction, NY116, after which NY22 crosses under I-684, remaining {{between it and the}} railroad tracks. Turning left onto Hardscrabble Road, it follows the tracks away from the interstate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next station, North Salem's hamlet of Croton Falls. Just north of the hamlet, Route22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by US202. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters Putnam County, following the Croton River north past the spillway of East Branch Reservoir.|$|E

5|$|The six {{survivors}} {{buried the}} bodies {{found on the}} beach, then travelled east along the beach, expecting to reach Cape Town. However, after {{four and a half}} days, they realised their error and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wreck. Here they subsisted off a cask of oatmeal, while trying to effect repairs to the ship's pinnace, which had been washed ashore. They were discovered six days later on 14 June by a farmer's son, who was out hunting.|$|E
5|$|By 8:30 am {{a request}} went out {{summoning}} all available tugs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grounding {{with the hope}} that {{they would be able to}} free the leviathan before any further damage occurred. An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the grounding met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats. Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound her problem she had run aground during an unusually high tide. To add insult to injury, she had become the butt of a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's grounding as material for the naval publication Red Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the {{managerial}} change from Burley to Freedman, the club announced plans to relocate the club back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, built on the club's original home, redeveloping it into a 25,000-seater, purpose-built football stadium. The following season started well, with a League Cup run that saw Palace beat Crawley Town, Wigan Athletic and Middlesbrough, and by late October the club were third in the league. A League Cup victory over Southampton set up a quarter final tie away at Manchester United. However league form began to slip and Palace went six games without scoring immediately prior to the match at Old Trafford. Entering the tie as the underdogs, a 35-yard free-kick from Darren Ambrose and an extra time header from Glenn Murray saw Palace win at Old Trafford {{for the first time in}} 22 years. The club then announced potential plans to update the image of the club through a new badge. On the pitch, league form remained patchy, and the semi-final of the League Cup ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Cardiff. Palace finished the season in seventeenth place, an improvement on the previous season.|$|E

5|$|On June 22, 2015, {{the sixth}} {{anniversary of the}} accident, the Legacy Memorial Park {{in honor of the}} victims was opened; ground was broken exactly one year {{previously}} by Mayor Vincent C. Gray. The park features a memorial wall and nine inscribed sculptures, one in honor of each person killed in the crash. The sculptures were created by sculptor Barbara Liotta, and the memorial was designed by the firm of Hunt Laudi; the design is titled A Sacred Grove. Representatives of victims' families and city government officials attended the dedication, but Metro officials did not. The park is located at the entrance to Blair Memorial Gardens, which is close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collision.|$|E
5|$|Passenger train services, using Class 150 diesel {{multiple}} units, were {{restored to}} the line after a gap of 46 years, on 6February 2008; between a new station at Ebbw Vale Parkway (close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Victoria station) and Cardiff Central. The first train of the restored service left Cardiff Central for Ebbw Vale Parkway at 06:35 on Wednesday 6 February 2008. The first train {{to run in the}} opposite direction left five minutes later, packed with dignitaries for the official opening. Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones opened the line along with Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council's former Labour leader Hedley McCarthy. The first train from Ebbw Vale Parkway was waved off by local residents, who welcomed the link as a positive contribution to the valley's long term regeneration.|$|E
5|$|Reports were {{received}} in January 1849 that some Aboriginal {{people had been}} killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse arrived in the district to investigate. He began his inquiries, assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that he and a white man named Parker were walking along a road when they heard shots. He went {{to see what was}} happening, and from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, who he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present, Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had a gun in his hand.|$|E
