5|$|Chandler feared Laffoon, who {{controlled}} the State Democratic Central Committee, {{would attempt to}} hand-select the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a primary election, and he used a bold move to circumvent Laffoon's ability to carry out such an action. Under the Kentucky Constitution, Chandler became acting governor any time Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, D. C. on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill requiring that each party's gubernatorial candidates be chosen by a primary rather than a nominating convention. Laffoon returned to the state {{the next day and}} challenged Chandler's authority <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call,</b> but Chandler's actions were validated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on February 26.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the railway}} sector {{accident}} investigation {{had been carried}} out by the Norwegian State Railways and its successors, the Norwegian National Rail Administration and the Norwegian State Railways. Major accidents were thereby investigated by in-house commissions with the potential for conflict of interest, or through ad hoc committees appointed by the government. Similar to marine accidents, it was ultimately a subjective call by the Ministry of Transport and Communications <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> for if a committee was needed.|$|E
25|$|Ball {{boys and}} girls may be {{employed}} to retrieve balls, pass them to the players, and hand players their towels. They have no adjudicative role. In rare events (e.g., if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance), the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened. The umpire may consider their statements when making a decision. In some leagues, especially junior leagues, players make their own calls, trusting each other to be honest. This {{is the case for}} many school and university level matches. The referee or referee's assistant, however, can be called on court at a player's request, and the referee or assistant may change a player's call. In unofficiated matches, a ball is out only if the player entitled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> is sure that the ball is out.|$|E

At first, the forces encircled the compound without attacking, believing that Diệm would comply with their demands. Đông attempted to call on US ambassador Elbridge Durbrow {{to put pressure on}} Diệm. Durbrow, although a persistent critic of Diệm, maintained his government's position of supporting Diệm, stating [...] "We support this government until it fails". Durbrow later recalled receiving a telephone call from an aide to Diệm who insisted that he call Diệm and tell him to surrender or face a howitzer attack on the palace. [...] Durbrow refused and no attack took place. [...] He consequently learned that the aide was forced <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

Intelligent screening is only possible if <b>the</b> <b>called</b> party has knowledge of who the caller is and, more important, knowledge of the callers intentions. We propose an agent-based solution that allows the caller to present both identity and intentions. The scheme uses a metaphor of business cards <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> and screening procedures easy to understand. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Museo de Historia de Tlalpan (Museum of the History of Tlalpan, {{is housed}} in a {{building}} known as “La Casona” (The Mansion), which dates to 1874. In addition to its age, one of its claims to fame {{is that it is}} the site of the first long distance telephone call in Mexico, calling a telephone in the then-separate Mexico City. This call was made on 20 March 1878 and the telephone used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> is on display here. The mansion was classified as a historic monument by 1986, and it was converted into the current museum in 2003 after extensive remodeling, which included restoration of the original murals.

[...] It also has a permanent collection of art work by Gilberto Aceves Navarro, Alberto Castro Leñero, Isabel Leñero, Javier Anzure Joëlle Rapp and Jorge Hernandez.|$|E

60|$|In the {{universal}} good-will of her triumph, Albinia having read her precious letter to every one, resolved {{to let the}} Drurys hear it, before forwarding it to Fairmead. Lucy's neglect of that family was becoming flagrant, and Albinia was resolved to take her <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>call.</b> Therefore, after promulgating her intentions too decidedly for Algernon to oppose them, she set out with Lucy in the most virtuous state of mind. Maurice was to ride out with his father, and Sophy {{was taking care of}} grandmamma, so she made her expedition with an easy mind, and absolutely enjoyed the change of scenery.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} {{maintenance}} rehearsal would be remembering {{a phone number}} {{only long enough to}} make the phone call.
