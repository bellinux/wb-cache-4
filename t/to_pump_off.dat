50|$|The Chief Mate, who was {{the watch}} officer, then ordered the {{assistant}} engineer to pump water for 15 minutes into the #18 starboard ballast tank, which corrected the port list. At 19:30 the captain, who was by then the watch officer, ordered the chief engineer to pump out the #18 starboard ballast tank. The ballast tanks were now all empty again, which left Valour with a slight starboard list. The weather continued to deteriorate, and by 21:30 the winds were south at 50 - 60 kn, gusting to 70 kn, with 10 ft seas. At 22:00 the chief mate went to the wheelhouse and told the captain {{that there was a}} slight starboard list (which was consistent with the stability letter). The wind and seas were also pushing the barge to the north, and that strain on the tow wire may have increased the list. At 22:15 the Captain ordered the chief engineer to pump water for 15 minutes into the #18 port ballast tank to correct for the starboard list. Because of poor communications and a lack of established ballasting procedures, water continued to be pumped into that tank for over one hour, at least 45 minutes longer than ordered. At around 23:00-23:15 Valour leveled off and began to list to port. At 23:16 Valour was listing to port and also began rolling to port, alarming the Captain, who then ordered the chief engineer <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>off</b> all ballast. Twenty minutes later, that operation was stopped, and they then began transferring from the #18 port ballast tank to the #18 starboard ballast tank.|$|E

On pump CABG is the more traditional method of performing bypass surgery.

Luckily the water had not <b>to</b> be <b>pumped</b> <b>off,</b> but it ran in a stream into the vessel that was placed to receive it.

At length the last of the casks was filled, when Paul rushed on deck, for, by this time, the cries of the barbarians proclaimed their presence near the ship. When he reached the rail, he found the reef covered with them, some hailing the vessel, others menacing, hundreds still busied with their floating bridge, while a few endeavoured to frighten those on board by discharging their muskets over their heads. Happily, aim was impossible, so long as care was taken not to expose the body above the bulwarks.|$|R
50|$|With {{improper}} ballast operations {{causing a}} substantial port list, fuel inadvertently began to flow by gravity (hydrostatic balancing) from starboard to port, thereby increasing {{the severity of}} the list and eventually causing the aft deck to become awash. An unknown amount of sea water is likely to have entered the #19 & 20 aft ballast tanks through their deck vents, reducing reserve buoyancy further and adding more free surface effect. To counteract this the Captain ordered all ballast <b>to</b> be <b>pumped</b> <b>off,</b> then agreed 20 minutes later <b>to</b> stop <b>pumping</b> ballast water out of the #18 port ballast tank and start pumping ballast water into the #18 starboard ballast tank from the sea (the vessel was not configured to allow internal ballast transfers), causing even more loss of reserve buoyancy. All the while, the barge had been creeping up on them and was now just off the port quarter, with the weight of the tow wire hanging off the port side of the tug. All of this was greatly compounded by the chief mate suffering a fatal fall down the ladder from the wheelhouse and then the loss of an able seaman overboard. Shortly after midnight on the 18th the crew finally released the tow to avoid being tripped. Valour continued to list and roll further to port until it was on its side, then sea water began entering the vessel through the engine room vents on the stack deck.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Off</b> <b>pump</b> {{coronary}} artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) is gaining world wide acceptance as the preformed choice for myocardial revascularization. However, no definite data exist {{as to whether it}} is better than conventional {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting (CABG). Objective: We aimed to compare the incidence of complications and early outcomes between the conventional CABG and OPCABG. Methods: Between October 2007 and April 2008, 40 patients underwent CABG, 30 pts had been subjected to OPCABG (group I) and 10 pts underwent pump surgery (group II). Analysis of in hospital mortality, perioperative and postoperative courses and clinical outcomes were performed. Results: The perioperative data showed that on pump group exhibited significant higher number of grafts/pt (2. 6  ±  0. 9 vs 1. 5  ±  0. 6, P: 0. 05), higher incidence of arterial grafts (73 % vs 10 %, P  6  h), was also higher in on <b>pump</b> as compared <b>to</b> <b>off</b> <b>pump</b> group (50 % vs 3. 3 %, P <  0. 001).

Water applications to the vines were terminated on August 24 th for 9 days and again on September 14 th for 22 days. Daily water use of the vines in the lysimeter (ETLYS) was approximately 40 L vine− 1 (5. 3 mm) prior <b>to</b> turning the <b>pump</b> <b>off,</b> and it decreased to 22. 3 L vine− 1 by September 2 nd. Pre-dawn leaf water potential (ΨPD) and midday Ψl on August 24 th were − 0. 075 and − 0. 76 MPa, respectively, with midday Ψl decreasing to − 1. 28 MPa on September 2 nd.

Midday measurements of g s and Ψl were significantly correlated with one another (r = 0. 96) and both with ETLYS/ETo (r = ~ 0. 9). The decreases in Ψl, g s, and ETLYS/ETo in this study were also a linear function of the decrease in volumetric soil water content.

Methods: After IRB approval, a review of 151 patients who underwent orthotopic lung transplant with either CPB or <b>off</b> <b>pump</b> sequential placement was compared. Demographic data, bypass times, total surgery, intubation times and ICU stay were recorded. Biopsy determined rejection was compared, along with FEV 1 changes from immediate post-transplant values.

40|$|We reconsider an old idea: a three-stage {{compound}} cryopump {{for use in}} fusion reactors such as DEMO. The helium "ash" is adsorbed on a 4. 5 K charcoal-coated surface, while deuterium and tritium are adsorbed at 15 - 22 K on {{a second}} charcoal-coated surface. The helium is released by raising the first surface to ~ 30 K. In a separate regeneration step, deuterium and tritium are released at ~ 110 K. In this way, the helium can be pre-separated from other species. In the simplest design, all three stages {{are in the same}} vessel, with a single valve <b>to</b> close the <b>pump</b> <b>off</b> from the tokamak during regeneration. In an alternative design, the three stages are in separate vessels, connected by valves, allowing the stages to regenerate without interfering with each other. The inclusion of the intermediate stage would not affect the overall pumping speed significantly. The downstream exhaust processing system could be scaled down, as much of the deuterium and tritium could be returned directly to the reactor. This could reduce the required tritium reserve by almost 90 %. We used a well-established free Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code, DS 2 V. At very high upstream densities (~ 1020 molecules/m 3 and above) the flow into the pump is choked.
