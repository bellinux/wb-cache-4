5|$|The Bradford Coalfield is crossed by {{a number}} of fault lines, principally the Bradford Fault. The {{extraction}} of coal caused that fault <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> in the 1960s, resulting in a scarp that seriously damaged Crompton Hall, a residential complex built in the early 20th century. The building was subsequently demolished.|$|E
5|$|The line started {{construction}} in 1884, and rapid transit {{service on the}} line started on February 23, 1886. Passenger service ended on March 31, 1953, and freight service ended by 1989.

5|$|In 1996 John Sykes decided <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> Thin Lizzy, {{presenting}} the band {{as a tribute}} to Phil Lynott's life and work. He decided to take on the role of lead vocals himself in the absence of Lynott, and persuaded Scott Gorham, Brian Downey and Darren Wharton to return to the fold. To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott's role as bass player. They received criticism for using the Thin Lizzy name without Lynott being present, but the band only played hits from Thin Lizzy's back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.|$|E
5|$|In 2506, {{during the}} End War, the Daelaam {{under the command}} of Hierarch Artanis came to Cybros <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> the purifiers. Clolarion acted as their {{spokesman}} and leader during the mission, and ordered the Purifiers to engage the zerg on the station, and then purified the surface of Endion, the forest moon Cybros orbited. With the battle over, Artanis asked the purifiers to join the Daelaam in the war against Amon. Clolarion questioned his sincerity and only accepted an alliance on the condition of Talandar being their ambassador.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Kappa Kappa Psi {{began an}} ambitious {{expansion}} program <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> old chapters and install new ones. The fraternity had been divided into 11 districts since 1941, which {{were led by}} a Grand Counselor (now called Governors). With the revitalization of the fraternity, these districts were reorganized and pamphlets were printed detailing the fraternity's purposes and history. District governors were charged with giving information to potential chapters. The expansion program was quite successful—in the ten years following the fraternity's reorganization in 1947, Kappa Kappa Psi more than doubled the number of installed chapters, growing from 45 chapters installed before the war to 98 {{by the end of}} 1957.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, both of {{them leave}} the planetarium, as Yumemi insists on escorting {{him back to his}} vehicle outside the city walls. The protagonist plans to {{transport}} Yumemi out of the city after her battery runs out and find a way <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> her. A machine the protagonist calls a fiddler crab, due to its design, is guarding the entrance to the city in which he came from, and he devises a plan to destroy it armed with only a grenade launcher. After his initial plan fails and he is forced to face the machine front on, Yumemi tries to protect the protagonist, but is blown in half by the war machine's machine guns.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} mission to steal a Zero Point Module is a success, Dr. McKay (David Hewlett) proposes to use Dr. Weir (Torri Higginson) and her nanites to access the Asuran {{collective}} and guide them; should the Asurans take her over, McKay would activate a kill switch on the nanites, which would also effectively kill Weir. With their experimental jumper ready, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) leaves Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) in command of Atlantis. The jumper's hyperdrive works and they arrive over the Asuran homeworld (M7R-227). With Weir's access, Sheppard and Ronon (Jason Momoa) easily steal the Zero Point Module. McKay then finds a code that will cause the Asurans to attack the Wraith and convinces Sheppard to upload a programme <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> this dormant code.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{decipher}} Nedry's code <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold opt to reboot the entire park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats {{to an emergency}} bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the raptors. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Meanwhile, Muldoon is caught off-guard and killed by the other two raptors.|$|E

5|$|While it was {{intended}} to sell the Chinooks after they were withdrawn from service, experience soon demonstrated that the Black Hawks were unable to fully replace them. In particular, it was found that heavy-lift helicopters were needed to transport fuel supplies for the Black Hawks during exercises and operations. As a result, plans to sell the Chinooks were put on hold in late 1989, and the Army and RAAF began investigating options <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> them. The 1991 Force Structure Review recommended that between four and six Chinooks—preferably upgraded to CH-47D standard—be reactivated to support the Black Hawks.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns {{geared up}} <b>to</b> <b>reactivate,</b> the Browns Trust {{set up a}} {{countdown}} clock for the team's return and used Hall of Famers such as Lou Groza and Jim Brown extensively to promote the team, alongside celebrity fans including Drew Carey. Lerner and Policy hired Dwight Clark, a former 49ers wide receiver, as the team's operations director in December 1998. The owners then signed Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Chris Palmer in January 1999 as the reactivated team's first head coach. The NFL then conducted an expansion draft the following month to stock the new Browns team with players. The team added to its roster through free agency, and was also given the first {{pick in the draft}} in April 1999, which it used to draft quarterback Tim Couch.|$|E
5|$|As the Soviet Army {{pushed the}} Wehrmacht {{back on the}} Eastern Front, it became {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> Prinz Eugen as a gunnery support vessel; on 1 October 1943, the ship was reassigned to combat duty. In June 1944, Prinz Eugen, the heavy cruiser Lützow, and the 6th Destroyer Flotilla formed the Second Task Force, later renamed Task Force Thiele after its commander, Vizeadmiral August Thiele. Prinz Eugen was at this time {{under the command of}} KzS Hans-Jürgen Reinicke; throughout June she steamed in the eastern Baltic, northwest of the island of Utö as a show of force during the German withdrawal from Finland. On 19–20 August, the ship steamed into the Gulf of Riga and bombarded Tukums. Four destroyers and two torpedo boats supported the action, along with Prinz Eugens Ar 196 floatplanes; the cruiser fired a total of 265 shells from her main battery. Prinz Eugens bombardment was instrumental in the successful repulse of the Soviet attack.|$|E

40|$|Rhesus monkeys {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} the lentivirus SIV/Delta become immunodeficient and often die of opportunistic infections. The most frequent of these is cytomegalovirus (CMV). The lesions due <b>to</b> <b>reactivated</b> CMV infection in 14 SIV-infected monkeys were reviewed. Changes due to CMV were observed in the brain, lung, lymph node, liver, spleen, small intestine, testicle, nerves, and arteries. Disseminated CMV infection in immunodeficient rhesus monkeys is a useful model for studying the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of similar infections in immunodeficient human beings...|$|R
5|$|Because New Jersey {{had been}} {{recalled}} for {{service in the}} Vietnam War her modernization differed from her sisters {{for a number of}} reasons. When reactivated in 1967 New Jersey had her 20mm Oerlikon and 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improved electronic warfare capabilities. This alteration helped reduce the time it took get New Jersey recommissioned: since she was not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to New Jersey involved the removal of four of her ten 5inch gun mounts {{to make room for the}} Armored Box Launchers. In addition to saving time, this also made New Jersey cheaper <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> since the cost needed to modernize the battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts, electronic warfare suites, and improved radar and gun spotter technology.|$|E

Chakotay and the away team are beamed back to Voyager as the Co-operative trigger the cube's self-destruct before it can endanger the Federation ship. The planet's inhabitants thank Voyager, but {{as a result of their}} actions, Chakotay later questions the morality of the Co-operative's motives with Janeway, as it connected many of the former Borg together in a new hive mind without consulting them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E
40|$|Although {{rates of}} {{reported}} cases of active tuberculosis have been declining in Manitoba and throughout Canada {{over the past two}} decades, the percentage of active cases due <b>to</b> <b>reactivated</b> tuberculosis has remained relatively constant. From 1976 to 1981, 113 cases of reactivated tuberculosis were listed in the Manitoba tuberculosis registry. We found that 36 cases did not meet our criteria for reactivation, primarily because there was no 6 -month period of inactivity; another 5 cases could not be verified. In {{more than half of the}} remaining 72 the initial episode had occurred before 1960. We also randomly selected from the registry as controls 118 age- and sex-matched cases of nonreactivated tuberculosis. We found that registered Indian status was significantly associated with risk of reactivation, especially when the initial disease had been extensive. Awareness of high-risk groups, earlier diagnosis and adequate treatment are needed <b>to</b> prevent <b>reactivated</b> tuberculosis...|$|R

5|$|In 2805, Earth is an {{abandoned}} planet covered in trash, with its people evacuated by megacorporation Buy-N-Large on giant starliners. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot trash compactors to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained sentience {{and is able}} to stay active using parts from other units. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy seedling, which he returns to his home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to scan the planet. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant and goes into standby mode. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.|$|E
5|$|Megatron sends Starscream, and {{his twin}} {{brothers}} Thundercracker and Skywarp <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> an Energon bridge which will feed the station with raw Energon, allowing the manufacturing of more Dark Energon. Once they succeed, Megatron then develops {{a plan to}} infect the core of Cybertron with Dark Energon, feeling that he can {{gain control of the}} planet once it is infected. He launches a full-scale assault on the Autobot capital city of Iacon, looking for an item called the Omega Key, which he will use to enter Cybertron's core and infect it. The Decepticons learn that Zeta Prime has placed the key under his personal guard. Megatron's forces enter the chambers of Zeta Prime and defeat him in battle. Zeta Prime tells Megatron that the Omega Key is not actually what unlocks access to the core, but is the means to activate the true key, a colossal Transformer known as Omega Supreme. After hearing this, Megatron presumably kills Zeta Prime.|$|E

They defeated The Blackjacks (Blackjack Mulligan and Blackjack Lanza) to win the belts and held them for over six months. They eventually dropped the title in a match against The Executioners (a team composed of Killer Kowalski and Big John Studd, who wore masks to hide their identities) on May 11, 1976. Also in 1976, Parisi teamed with champion Bruno Sammartino in Madison Square Garden to defeat Ivan Koloff and Superstar Billy Graham.When the promotion (which had since been renamed the World Wrestling Federation) decided <b>to</b> <b>reactivate</b> the WWF International Heavyweight Championship in 1982, Parisi became the new champion.
