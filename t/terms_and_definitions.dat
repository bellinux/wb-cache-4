2500|$|There is no exact {{definition}} for bullying behaviours in workplace, {{which is why}} different <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> are common. For example, mobbing is a commonly used term in France and Germany, where it refers to a [...] "mob" [...] of bullies, rather than a single bully; this phenomenon is not often seen in other countries.

2500|$|Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ, in his Introduction, codified the {{terminology}} established by those scholars before him based upon his reading of their works. He {{did so by}} citing some of those scholarly statements in the earlier works and deducing from them common <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> {{in the manner of}} a scholar authoring a book of [...] fiqh (jurisprudence). In this manner, his book was based upon those principles established by the earlier hadith specialists combined with some elements of fiqh. An example of this would be the inclusion of the division of hadith into mutawātir and āḥād. He therefore only mentioned the statements of the earlier scholars as appropriate and mostly sufficed with conclusions drawn from them and then specifying or clarifying a definition.|$|E
2500|$|In 1827, he {{published}} Definitions in Political Economy, preceded by {{an inquiry into}} the rules which ought to guide political economists in the definition and use of their terms; with remarks on the deviation from these rules in their writings.

In chapter 10, the penultimate chapter, he presented 60 numbered paragraphs putting forth terms and their definitions that he proposed, following those rules, {{should be used in}} discussing political economy. This collection of <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> is remarkable for two reasons: first, Malthus was the first economist to explicitly organize, define, and publish his terms as a coherent glossary of defined terms; and second, his definitions were, for the most part, well-formed definitional statements.|$|E
