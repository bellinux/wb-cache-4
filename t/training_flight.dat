5|$|Approximately 8 {{minutes after}} the DC-7 had {{departed}} Los Angeles, a U.S. Air Force F-100F-5-NA Super Sabre jet fighter, serial number 56-3755, took off from Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas at 7:45a.m. on a <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> with two pilots on board. In {{the front seat of}} the tandem cockpit was flight instructor and safety pilot Capt. Thomas N. Coryell, 29, and behind him sat his student, 1st Lt. Gerald D. Moran, 24, who as part of his training would spend the flight under a hood that blocked his view outside the aircraft, but allowed him to see his instrument panel.|$|E
5|$|The {{co-pilot}} was 27-year-old First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid. He joined Malaysia Airlines as a cadet {{pilot in}} 2007 {{and became a}} Second Officer on Boeing 737-400 aircraft. He was promoted to First Officer of Boeing 737-400 aircraft in 2010 and later transitioned to Airbus A330-300 aircraft in 2012. In November 2013, he began training as First Officer on Boeing 777-200 aircraft. Flight 370 was his final <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> and {{he was scheduled to}} be examined on his next flight. Fariq had 2,763 hours of flying experience.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} on the mountain in over thirty years, six climbers—two guides, and four clients—last heard from on May28, 2014, were presumed dead on May31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers. Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown. The bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on August7, 2014, during a <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> and subsequently recovered on August19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located.|$|E

5|$|No. 77 Squadron {{returned}} to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageIII supersonic fighters, undertaking its initial flights on 7July. The Mirages {{were charged with}} interception, high- and low-angle bombing, close air support, and photo reconnaissance; their armament included 30mm cannon, Sidewinder missiles and conventional bombs. No.77 Squadron's prime role was ground attack, although none of the RAAF's Mirages ever saw combat. No.481 Squadron was responsible for day-to-day servicing, {{as well as most}} heavy maintenance. No.77 Squadron suffered its first fatal Mirage accident on 3April 1973, when an aircraft crashed during a <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> at low altitude. Another pilot was killed when his Mirage hit the water during formation flying at night on 24June 1976.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 1982, {{while on}} a <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> outside Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, USAF Captain Ted Harduvel died when he crashed {{inverted}} into a mountain ridge. In 1985, Harduvel's widow {{filed a lawsuit against}} General Dynamics claiming an electrical malfunction, not pilot error, as the cause; a jury awarded the plaintiff $3.4 million in damages. However, in 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled the contractor had immunity to lawsuits, overturning the previous judgment. The court did remand the plaintiff's claim of electrical malfunction as the cause, noting that General Dynamics and the USAF knew about chafing of instrumentation wiring, which they had not initially disclosed. The accident and subsequent trial was the subject of the 1992 film Afterburn.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan (Republic of China) {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the U.S. to purchase 30 AH-64Es with weapons, and associated equipment in June 2011. On 5 November 2013, Taiwan received the first 6 AH-64s. On 25 April 2014, a Taiwanese AH-64E crashed into a three-story building during a <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> in bad weather conditions, the first airframe loss of an AH-64E. An investigation ruled out mechanical failure and concluded human error as responsible, that the pilots descended too fast through clouds at low altitude without checking flight panels to maintain adequate height; the Army responded by stepping up simulator training for pilots. In October 2014, the fifth and final batch of AH-64Es was delivered to Taiwan, completing the order.|$|E

5|$|Born in Lottah, Tasmania, on 17September 1903, Alan Charlesworth {{was the son}} of a storeman, Edwin Charlesworth, and {{his wife}} Louisa. The youth {{attended}} Lottah Public School and St Virgil's College, Hobart, before entering the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1920. He won the Silver Boomerang trophy, awarded to the college's champion athlete, three years running in 1921–23. In 1923 he was appointed company sergeant major at Duntroon, and received the Sword of Honour upon graduating as a lieutenant later that year. Following service as adjutant and quartermaster with the 2nd Light Horse Regiment in Queensland, Charlesworth transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a flying officer on 27January 1925. Among his classmates on the 1925 pilots' course at Point Cook, Victoria, was fellow Duntroon graduate Frederick Scherger. During a <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> on 25March, Charlesworth's Avro 504K stalled and spun into a field, injuring him and killing his instructor. Recovering, he was subsequently involved in an accident with future lieutenant general and Governor of New South Wales Eric Woodward, when their plane flipped on landing and came to rest upside down on a fence; neither man was badly hurt.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the planned refit of HMS Eagle {{to allow her to}} operate the Phantom, a total of 20 airframes that had originally been ordered for the Fleet Air Arm were diverted to the Royal Air Force to serve in the air defence role. At the time, the RAF's primary interceptor was the English Electric Lightning, which suffered badly both in terms of range, loiter time and weapons fit, all of which hampered its effectiveness, especially in long interceptions of Soviet Air Forces and Soviet Naval Aviation bombers and reconnaissance aircraft over the North Sea and North Atlantic. So a new Phantom squadron was formed at RAF Leuchars, the UK's most northerly air defence base at the time, {{to take advantage of the}} improvements that the Phantom provided over the Lightning – it could carry more fuel, and could thus fly further for longer; it was fitted with a more powerful radar; and it could carry more missiles (up to 8, compared to 2 for the Lightning). On 1 September 1969, 43 Squadron was formed at Leuchars, operating as part of the UK's northern QRA zone alongside the Lightnings of 11 Squadron and 23 Squadron until, in 1972, 11Squadron was redeployed to join 5 Squadron at RAF Binbrook and was replaced by the Royal Navy Phantoms of the Phantom <b>Training</b> <b>Flight</b> (PTF) and 892 Naval Air Squadron.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, {{one of the}} 707s transported 300 Australian Army {{personnel}} in two flights to Namibia {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to UNTAG, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country's transition to independence. Later that year, the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of Compass Airlines. On 29October 1991, one of the transport-configured 707s crashed into the sea during a <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> out of East Sale, Victoria; all five crew members were killed. The coronial inquest into this accident found that training in the asymmetric handling manoeuvre that caused the crash was deficient, and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the handling characteristics of its 707s. The Coroner's first recommendation related to the need for appropriate simulation for this type of training, an area not properly recognised or addressed by the RAAF at the time. No.33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace in 1993.|$|E
50|$|In early 1945, Vernam Field {{became the}} {{destination}} for many B-29 Superfortress aircraft from Second Air Force <b>training</b> <b>flights</b> originating from <b>training</b> bases in Kansas and Nebraska (approximately 2,000 miles distant). The B-29s would fly on cross-country <b>training</b> <b>flights</b> to Vernam and {{land at the}} airfield for refueling and maintenance {{before returning to the}} Midwest.

5|$|To prepare aircrew {{for their}} {{rotation}} through No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, No.1OCU {{students participated in}} exercises such as Combat Skyspot in August 1968, which utilised radar controlled by No.30 Squadron, and Strait Kris in September–October 1969, {{in conjunction with the}} Australian Army. The unit lost two more aircrew when a Canberra M.21 on a <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> crashed near Amberley on 23March 1970. From 21March to 25April 1971, four of the unit's aircraft flew 10,000 miles around Australia to conduct seven flying displays as part of the RAAF's Golden Jubilee celebrations. Having completed thirty-six conversion courses in its twelve years of operation, No.1OCU was disbanded on 9June 1971, following the withdrawal of No.2 Squadron from Vietnam. Unit staff were transferred to No.2 Squadron, which continued to operate the Canberra and carry out its own operational conversion until disbanding in June 1982. Ten of No.1 OCU's fifteen Canberras were put into storage and the remainder, including surviving Mk.21 trainers, were taken on by No.2 Squadron. When the F-111C eventually entered service with No.82 Wing in 1973, No.6 Squadron again took responsibility for conversion training, while No.1 Squadron acted as the lead strike unit. Canberra A84-236, which was allocated to No.1OCU in 1968 and 1970 when not in service with No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, went on display at RAAF Museum, Point Cook, Victoria, in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{the introduction of the}} F/A-18 Hornet, No.2 OCU temporarily ceased flying operations on 1January 1985 and transferred Macchi and Mirage training to No.77 Squadron, which assumed responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses. Beginning on 17May, the first fourteen Australian Hornets—seven single-seat F/A-18As and seven two-seat F/A-18Bs—and a Hornet simulator were delivered to No.2 OCU. Conversion courses on the type commenced on 19August with four F/A-18Bs and three students. No.2 OCU has remained the prime user of the two-seat Hornet, though some are operated by the fighter squadrons, Nos.3, 75 and 77. The first year of Hornet service saw No.2 OCU, as the then-only RAAF operator, undertake demonstration flights around the country to unveil the new fighter to the Australian public. All of the Hornet units came under the control of a newly re-formed No.81 Wing on 2February 1987. An intense training program that year resulted in 21 pilots converting to the type. In June 1987, Macchi training courses again became the responsibility of No.2 OCU; this role was taken over by No.76 Squadron in January 1989. No.2 OCU suffered its only Hornet loss to date when an F/A-18B crashed at Great Palm Island, Queensland, during a night-time <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> on 18November 1987, killing the pilot. Two Hornets collided during an air-to-air combat training exercise the previous year, but both managed to return to base. The unit temporarily relocated to RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in July 1990, while Williamtown's runway was resurfaced.|$|E
5|$|No.81 Wing re-formed at Williamtown on 2February 1987. Along with No.75 Squadron at Tindal, its flying units {{consisted}} of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons based at Williamtown with No.2 OCU, {{all of which}} had converted from the Mirage to the Hornet between 1985 and 1987, the last-mentioned being the prime operator of the two-seat F/A-18B trainers. Having continued to perform fighter maintenance through the 1960s and '70s, No.481 Squadron disbanded on 31January 1987. It re-formed the next day as No.481 Wing under No.81 Wing's parent organisation, Tactical Fighter Group (TFG), and {{consisted of}} two squadrons, Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Williamtown (AMSWLM) and Aircraft Equipment Maintenance Squadron Williamtown (AEMSWLM). By 1996, No.81 Wing had been augmented by Nos.25 and 76 Squadrons, operating Macchi MB-326 lead-in fighters, the former based at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, and the latter at Williamtown, where it also employed Pilatus PC-9s for forward air control (FAC). On 1July 1996, No.481 Wing was reorganised as No.402 Wing, incorporating a newly re-formed No.481 Squadron as well as Weapon Systems Support Flight and Field <b>Training</b> <b>Flight.</b> No.402 Wing transferred its functions to No.81 Wing's flying squadrons on 31July 1998 before disbanding in October. The same year, No.25 Squadron was split, its Macchis now being operated by a re-formed No.79 Squadron. No.78 Wing was re-established in 2000 as an operational training formation, taking over Nos.76 and 79 Squadrons, and No.2 OCU. By 2007, No.2 OCU {{had returned to the}} control of No.81 Wing.|$|E

5|$|On 31 August 1937, three Hawker Demon {{aircraft}} of No.1 Squadron {{were on a}} <b>training</b> <b>flight,</b> {{during which}} they landed at an air base in Hamilton, Victoria. The exercise coincided with the local agricultural show, and the planes briefly provided a stationary display for the public. Recommencing their journey, the first aircraft had already taken off when the second was seen to have difficulties. The pilot, Pilot Officer Kenneth McKenzie, had attempted a climbing turn when the aircraft's engine stalled, sending the machine into a dive. McAloney—who was a passenger in the third aircraft—witnessed the incident and signalled for his pilot to stop. On doing this, McAloney immediately leapt out of his plane and ran across the airfield. Out of control, the second aircraft struck the ground and rapidly became engulfed in flames. The first on scene, McAloney dashed into the wreckage {{in an effort to}} extradite the two crew members, and was able to grab hold of McKenzie who was sprawled over the flaming main fuel tank. McAloney pulled McKenzie free of the cockpit and down on to the aircraft's wing, though McKenzie's leg became trapped in the wreckage. Despite this, McAloney continued his efforts to free McKenzie, burning his hands on the pilot's smouldering clothes. At this point, one of the wing tanks burst, rendering McAloney unconscious. He was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns, and spent the next four weeks in hospital undergoing treatment. Both McKenzie and his observer-gunner, Sergeant Norman Torrens-Witherow, perished and it was later ascertained that, owing to the injuries sustained on impact, they would not have survived even if the rescue attempt had been successful.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the {{delivery}} of Australia's first C-17s, RAAF personnel received training on the aircraft in the United States. From May 2006 a group of pilots and loadmasters led by Wing Commander Linda Corbould, the commanding officer designate of No. 36 Squadron, undertook conversion training with the USAF's C-17 units at Altus Air Force Base and Charleston Air Force Base. A group of 48 technical personnel also received training at Charleston and McChord Air Force Base from September that year. No. 36 Squadron began a period of intensive training once Corbould delivered A41-206 to Amberley on 7 December 2006, and the unit achieved initial operating capability status in September 2007. Also in 2007, the RAAF's No. 1 Air Operations Support Squadron was expanded by 80 personnel to provide air load teams to support the Globemasters. A project to acquire the equipment needed to allow the RAAF's C-17s {{to be used in}} the aeromedical evacuation role and develop associated crew procedures began in late 2007. The first Globemaster aeromedical evacuation sortie was flown on 5 September 2008, the day after the type was certified to operate in this role. On 8 December 2008, Corbould led the RAAF's first all-female aircrew during a <b>training</b> <b>flight</b> over South East Queensland to mark the second anniversary of the entry of the Globemaster into service. A team of USAF trainers was posted to Amberley until the RAAF had sufficient C-17 pilots who were qualified to instruct others. The RAAF began training new C-17 pilots in early 2010 after the flight simulator was delivered, and the first Australian-trained pilots graduated in early May that year. No. 36 Squadron achieved final operating capability status in December 2011. The components for a simulated C-17 cargo compartment were delivered to Amberley in early 2013, and this facility was commissioned in November that year. The simulator is used to train air movements and medical staff as well as to develop and trial new cargo carrying techniques for the C-17s. The first Australian-trained Globemaster loadmasters graduated in mid-2014. The final element of C-17 aircrew training to be routinely conducted in the United States was the course to qualify co-pilots as aircraft captains. This course was relocated to Australia in mid-2017.|$|E
