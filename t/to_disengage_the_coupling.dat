50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. <b>To</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in <b>the</b> <b>disengaged</b> position until <b>the</b> user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the engaged position. Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly is all it takes <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> safety.|$|R
50|$|The safety/decocking lever, {{located on}} {{the rear of the}} slide, must be pushed forward <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> safety.|$|R

5000|$|The {{rotor drive}} train in {{helicopters}} uses a freewheeling clutch <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> rotors {{from the engine}} {{in the event of}} engine failure, allowing the craft to safely descend by autorotation.|$|R
5000|$|Earlier, and by many manufacturers, an {{arrangement}} <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> clutch (via a ratchet-like device) during coasting was tried to ease shifting. Called [...] "freewheeling", it was bedeviled {{by the absence}} of adequate brakes.|$|R

50|$|Also, in {{the heat}} of combat, the M1 carbine's {{magazine}} release button was often mistaken for the safety. This caused soldiers to accidentally release the magazine when they meant <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> safety. As a result, the push-button safety was redesigned into a rotating lever-type safety.|$|R

25|$|Sumerians {{harvested}} {{during the}} spring in three-person teams consisting of a reaper, a binder, and a sheaf handler. The farmers would use threshing wagons, driven by oxen, to separate the cereal heads from the stalks and then use threshing sleds <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> grain. They then winnowed the grain/chaff mixture.|$|R
50|$|Operational {{accidents}} {{were relatively}} rare, and mostly related to cable wear. If the cable broke it would wind around the grip, preventing the cars from stopping and {{causing them to}} overturn or run into those that had managed <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> grip in time. This could cause havoc in the streets.|$|R

50|$|The {{chain brake}} is principally {{operated}} by the top-hand guard being pushed forward to engage the brake, and pulled back <b>to</b> <b>disengage.</b> <b>The</b> spring-loaded action allows powerful braking under emergency conditions and can halt a chain under full power in {{a fraction of a}} second. Correspondingly, it may require considerable force to reset.|$|R
50|$|Rear Release or Crimp and poke style {{contacts}} may {{be removed}} from the connector for maintenance using a special hand-held tool. In rear release designs, the toolis inserted into the rear (cable side) of <b>the</b> connector <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> contact from its retaining clip. <b>The</b> <b>disengaged</b> contact is then removed from the connector by lightly pulling on the attached wire.|$|R
50|$|In 1891, naturalist Paul Le Cointe {{provides}} a rare first-hand {{account of a}} candiru entering a human body, and like Lacerda's account, it involved the fish being lodged in the vaginal canal, not the urethra. Le Cointe actually removed the fish himself, by pushing it forward <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> spines, turning it around and removing it head-first.|$|R

60|$|He {{determined}} <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> wing clutch. He did so. The lever resisted {{his strength}} for a time, then over it came, and instantly {{the tail of}} the machine cocked up and the wings became rigidly spread.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} a locking mechanism designed by ProTeqt Technologies. More specifically, the analysis considers the mechanism after {{the implementation of a}} resonantly coupled circuit used to receive and transmit wireless energy. Ultimately, the wireless energy is used to generate heat, which in turn causes a polymeric material to expand, thereby creating a mechanical force <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> locking mechanism. The analysis considers the force generated through wireless transmission, as well as <b>the</b> forces required <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> locking mechanism. The general physics of wireless energy transmission through resonant coupling is presented, as well as design specifications and manufacturing techniques used to produce the secondary circuit. Force requirements and design specifications that drive the success of the locking mechanism are then discussed before the presentation of coinciding results. by Mitchell S. Krogman. Thesis: M.

50|$|Single-revolution {{clutches}} {{were developed}} in the 19th century to power machinery such as shears or presses where a single pull of the operating lever or (later) press of a button would trip the mechanism, engaging the clutch between the power source and the machine's crankshaft for exactly one revolution before <b>disengaging</b> <b>the</b> clutch. When <b>the</b> clutch is <b>disengaged</b> and <b>the</b> driven member is stationary. Early designs were typically dog clutches with a cam on the driven member used <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> <b>the</b> dogs at the appropriate point.|$|R
