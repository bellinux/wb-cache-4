40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} duplicate medication (DM) alerts, their management by community pharmacists, and potential characteristics of DM alerts that lead to interventions by pharmacists. METHODS: Observational study in 53 community pharmacies. Each pharmacist registered the nature and management of 24 DM alerts on a structured form. RESULTS: On average, the clinical decision support systems generated 20. 4 DM alerts per 100 dispensed drugs. In half of <b>the</b> 1272 registered <b>alerts,</b> <b>the</b> pharmacists judged {{that there was no}} risk for concurrent use of both prescriptions. In 32 % of <b>the</b> <b>alerts,</b> <b>the</b> DM <b>alert</b> was generated for an intentional combination. In 17 % of <b>the</b> <b>alerts,</b> there was a risk for unintentional concurrent use. In 32 % of <b>the</b> <b>alerts</b> <b>the</b> pharmacists decided that one or more actions were needed: the electronic patient record was updated in 15 % of <b>the</b> <b>alerts</b> and in 19 % of <b>the</b> <b>alerts</b> <b>the</b> pharmacists performed an external action-for example, informing the patient or modifying the prescription (including 5 therapeutic prescription modifications and 22 logistic prescription modifications). Alerts concerning first dispensing {{were more likely to be}} followed by an external action than alerts concerning refills (40 % vs 14 %, P <. 001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In community pharmacy, prescription modifications based on DM alerts are rare, but DM alerts lead with some regularity to other actions-for example, patient instruction and update of the electronic patient record. As <b>the</b> current DM <b>alerts</b> are diverse and nonspecific in detecting situations where external action is considered relevant, other ways of alerting should therefore be considered...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the effects of increasing the number of collision avoidance system alerts presented through a haptic driver seat on drivers’ response performance. Twenty-four participants performed specific driving maneuvers in response to one, three, or seven haptic seat alerts while they drove an instrumented vehicle. Participants verbally identified <b>the</b> <b>alerts</b> after executing a maneuver. Results show that drivers made the correct driving maneuver in response to <b>the</b> <b>alerts.</b> This was likely because of the strong stimulusresponse compatibility designed into the haptic seat. As predicted by Information Theory, drivers’ mean manual response time to <b>the</b> <b>alerts</b> significantly increased, and their verbal response accuracy significantly degraded, as <b>the</b> number of <b>alerts</b> increased. A three-alert haptic seat approach is recommended providing specific design requirements are met...|$|R
5|$|Poor Luftwaffe {{administration}} {{meant the}} German defence {{took time to}} get the information from their radar sites. Major Harry von Bülow-Bothkamp—commanding II./JG 77—stated that it was the naval Freya, rather than Luftwaffe early warning sites that gave <b>the</b> <b>alert.</b> Owing to this, the RAF made landfall without interception.

5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} no threat to any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss of life or structural damage was reported.

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} the field of intrusion detection is <b>the</b> management of <b>alerts.</b> Intrusion Detection Systems tend to produce a high number of alerts, most of them being false positives. But producing a high number of alerts {{does not mean that the}} attack detection rate is high. In order to increase the detection rate, the use of multiple IDSs based on heterogeneous detection techniques is a solution but in return it increases <b>the</b> number of <b>alerts</b> to process. Aggregating <b>the</b> <b>alerts</b> coming from multiple heterogeneous IDSs and fusing them is a necessary step before processing the content and the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>alerts.</b> We propose in this paper to define a similarity operator that takes two IDMEF alerts and outputs a similarity value between 0 and 1. We then propose some algorithms to process <b>the</b> <b>alerts</b> in a on-line or off-line approach using this operator.

5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in <b>the</b> <b>alert</b> position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
