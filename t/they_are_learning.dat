Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E

For example, the Danish secondary school Østerskov Efterskole uses LARP to teach {{most of its}} classes. Language classes can be taught by immersing students in a role-playing scenario {{in which they are}} forced to improvise speech or writing in the language <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>learning.</b> Politically themed LARP events may attempt to awaken or shape political thinking within a culture.|$|E

25|$|Stuttering {{can also}} have its roots in development. Many {{toddlers}} and preschool age children stutter as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter as adults, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as pseudo-stuttering or as a normal disfluency. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Children with a normal disfluency usually have brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, the stuttering usually comes and goes and is most noticeable {{when a child is}} excited, stressed or overly tired. Stuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.|$|E
