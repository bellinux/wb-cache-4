5|$|Its {{main body}} is solid {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its plinth {{is made of}} malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E
5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for <b>the</b> <b>handles.</b> At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E
5|$|The Seri Rambai is a 28-pounder, 127.5 inches (3.25m) {{long with}} a calibre of 6.1 inches; (15cm); the barrel {{measures}} 118.75 inches; (3.02 m). It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring three pairs of heraldic lions with long, spiralling tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> and the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's signature and date of manufacture.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>handle,</b> used to {{grip and}} {{manipulate}} the blade safely, may include a tang, {{a portion of}} the blade that extends into <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> Knives are made with partial tangs (extending part way into <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> known as [...] "stick tangs") or full tangs (extending the full length of <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> often visible on top and bottom). <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> may include a bolster, a piece of heavy material (usually metal) situated at the front or rear of <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>The</b> bolster, as its name suggests, is used to mechanically strengthen the knife.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIndustrial {{grippers}} play {{an important}} role within automated production and assembly processes. In most cases their selection and dimensioning is done experience-based. This article presents an approach to dimension grippers automatically based on the properties of <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> object, <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> environment, <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> device and <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> process. Special attention is paid to the adaption of the operational elements, which interact with <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> object, like suction cups or jaws...|$|R
5|$|A 1947 fire {{destroyed}} the clubhouse of the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and damaged the Grey Cup. Many other trophies and artifacts {{in the clubhouse}} melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton's Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, when the trophy broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 when one of <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 when trophy broke from its base again by the Calgary Stampeders after their win. The CFL commissioned {{a replica of the}} trophy in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} touch <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>the</b> robot {{has to decide}} the height and the moving {{direction}} of the tool first. A statistical analysis [15] of the most frequent size of <b>handles</b> shows that <b>the</b> height of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> is in a range from 99  cm to 103  cm. Based on this acknowledgement, the robot keeps the vertical rod of the tool in this range. Then the robot chooses right as its target direction to touch <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> If <b>the</b> robot confirms that <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> {{is not in the}} current direction, it changes its direction to left and performs the process of locating <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> again. Here we present the process of the localization and confirmation of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> in <b>the</b> direction of right, and it is similar for left.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>handle</b> {{is made of}} {{the ivory}} of an {{elephant}} tusk, and not from a hippopotamus canine tooth as was first thought. <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> was carved along the axis of the tusk, as evidenced by a dark spot located above {{the head of the}} [...] "Master of Animals", which is the tip of pulp cavity of the tusk. Once extracted from <b>the</b> tusk, <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> was polished on both sides and hollowed out to receive the blade. The thickness of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> around <b>the</b> tang of the blade varies from 2 to 3 mm, which explains that the ivory is cracked there, with some pieces lost. At the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>the</b> edge was beveled, and probably received a crimp of precious metal that would have reinforced the assemblage of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> with <b>the</b> blade. At the time of the purchase, Bénédite reported that he could see traces of gold leaf on the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> now gone. <b>The</b> assemblage supports the hypothesis that the knife was not functional: the tang of the blade is too short and <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> too thin for the knife to have been practical.|$|R
50|$|The {{coping saw}} blade is {{installed}} with the teeth pointing towards <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> Unlike a hacksaw, {{which has the}} teeth pointed away from <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>the</b> coping saw cuts on the pull stroke. The coping saw blade is removable by partially unscrewing <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>The</b> blade is prevented from rotating {{by means of the}} short, steady bar provided where the blade is attached. Loosening <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> also allows <b>the</b> blade to be rotated relative to the frame as desired. Carefully aligning the finger with the steady bars at {{the top and bottom of}} the blade ensures that the thin blade is straight and not twisted along its length. Retightening <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> tensions <b>the</b> blade and locks it at the desired angle relative to the frame. The short steady bar nearest <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> is held securely between finger and thumb while <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> is tightened to ensure the blade remains at the desired angle. Unlike the fretsaw the coping saw blade has holding pins which lock securely into the angled slots of the rotatable blade holders.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the configurations outlined below, there are also upright and long cut configurations. The upright snip has the blades rotated 90° from <b>the</b> <b>handles.</b> This configuration is more ergonomic and commonly used in tight spaces. The long cut snip has long blades that {{make it easier to}} make long straight cuts. These snips are commonly used on vinyl or aluminium siding.|$|E
25|$|The {{operator}} applies minimal, then most, then least {{force on}} <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> from centre {{toward the end}} grain. The work stock is reversed and same method repeated this time commencing a tiny distance away from centre so as to leave a coarse raised section. The coarse raised section where the two concave curves meet can be finished with a rasp, file, spokeshave or other tool.|$|E
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Table  7, the maximum range along X and Y {{negative}} direction is greater than that along the positive direction. X negative direction represents moving <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> to <b>the</b> left and positive direction represents moving <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> to <b>the</b> right. Similarly, Y negative direction represents moving <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> close to <b>the</b> operator and the positive direction represents moving <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> away from <b>the</b> operator. It can be concluded that the motion of <b>the</b> operator’s <b>handle</b> toward himself/herself is greater than moving away from himself/herself. This means that asymmetric control interval is necessary for a haptic device-based system.|$|R
