SEM, EDS, Tafel and EIS were adopted and spot test was carried out to investigate the influence of pH value, phytic acid concentration, temperature,conversion time on corrosion resistance of conversion coatings. Result shows that process of phytic acid forming is the controlled metal corrosion process and the uneven surface pattern reflects the different chemical properties of <b>two-phase</b> <b>current</b> on magnesium alloy surface, which is implied by the conversion surface. It is proved by the test that pH value is committed the most to the corrosion resistance of the conversion coating, and the next is the phytic acid concentration. It is found that the corrosion resistance of the conversion coating is the best when pH value of the conversion solution is 4. 5; The conversion coating has little influence on the cathode reaction dynamics, however, more importantly, it changes {{the dynamics of the}} alloy electrode anode solution reaction, therefore, the alloy’s anode current density decreases while the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloy is enhanced...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} model {{describing}} the buoyancy-driven propagation of <b>two-phase</b> gravity <b>currents,</b> motivated by problems in groundwater hydrology and geological storage {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2). In these settings, fluid invades a porous medium saturated with an immiscible second fluid of different density and viscosity. The action of capillary forces in the porous medium results in spatial variations of the saturation of the two fluids. Here, we consider the propagation of fluid in a semi-infinite porous medium across a horizontal, impermeable boundary. In such systems, once the aspect ratio is large, fluid flow is mainly horizontal and the local saturation {{is determined by the}} vertical balance between capillary and gravitational forces. Gradients in the hydrostatic pressure along the current drive fluid flow in proportion to the saturation-dependent relative permeabilities, thus determining the shape and dynamics of <b>two-phase</b> <b>currents.</b> The resulting <b>two-phase</b> gravity <b>current</b> model is attractive because the formalism captures the essential macroscopic physics of multiphase flow in porous media. Residual trapping of CO 2 by capillary forces {{is one of the key}} mechanisms that can permanently immobilize CO 2 in the societally important example of geological CO 2 sequestration. The magnitude of residual trapping is set by the areal extent and saturation distribution within the current, both of which are predicted by the <b>two-phase</b> gravity <b>current</b> model. Hence the magnitude of residual trapping during the post-injection buoyant rise of CO 2 can be estimated quantitatively.

Success of the strategy is contingent upon effectiveness of natural circulation in removing the decay heat generated by the porous debris bed. Geometrical configuration of the bed {{is one of the}} factors which affect coolability of the bed. Boiling and two-phase turbulent flows in the pool serve as a source of mechanical energy which can affect the initial geometry as well as dynamically change the shape of already formed debris bed. The main goal of this work is to provide experimental data on spreading of solid particles in the pool by large scale two-phase flow structures induced by gas injection from the bottom. These data are necessary for development and validation of predictive capabilities of computer codes allowing numerical modeling of the debris bed formation at prototypic severe accident conditions.   Results of a new series of PDS-P (Particulate Debris Spreading in the Pool) tests reported in this paper are for two types of tests: (i) the pure two-phase flows without particles and (ii) tests with particles. In both tests series, vapor flows in saturated water are simulated by air injection {{at the bottom of the}} facility. Experimental conditions such as gas-phase flow rate and particle properties (density, size etc.) are scaled to maintain relevancy to the prototypic accident conditions. The water pool is constructed as a rectangular tank. It has close to 2 D geometry with fixed width (72  mm), variable length (up to 1. 6  m) and allows water filling depth of up to 1  m. The variable pool length and depth allows formation of the different in size and pattern two-phase circulating flows.

Improving the <b>current</b> <b>two-phase</b> flow models should therfore focus on incorporating more flow phenomena into the models. In this work, two-phase flow patterns of horizontal evaporating refrigerant flow in smooth round macro-scale tubes are investigated. A macro-scale test facility for two-phase flow and heat transfer studies of HFCs was designed and constructed. Secondly, a capacitive void fraction sensor was developed to study the dynamic behavior of two-phase flows. The capacitance transducer can measure dynamic signals of fluids with the capacitance of the liquid smaller than 1 pF and still achieve a SNR greater than 300. Capacitance signals of HFCs can thus be investigated. The dynamic capacitance signals in combination with high speed camera images were used to characterize horizontal two-phase flows in an 7. 91 mm ID smooth tube. Two datasets were gathered using R 410 A and R 134 a respectively.

These include increase in the rate of penetration and reduction of lost circulation and formation damage. Drilling of deviated and horizontal wells also increased since recovery can be improved from a horizontal or a deviated well. The drilling of deviated wells using UBD method will reduce several drilling related problems such as hole cleaning and formation damage. Prediction of flow and pressure profiles while drilling underbalanced in such wells will help in designing and planning of the well.
