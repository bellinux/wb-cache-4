5|$|Despite his {{commitment}} to discipline the army and serve the Republic which attracted <b>the</b> <b>admiration</b> of people, his temper caused some to abhor him. His efforts were not without recognition during his time, for {{he was awarded the}} Philippine Republic Medal in 1899. He was {{also a member of the}} Malolos Congress. Besides his military studies, Luna also studied pharmacy, literature and chemistry.|$|E
5|$|An often {{overlooked}} influence upon Benchley's early professional career was <b>the</b> <b>admiration</b> and friendship of the Canadian economist, academic, and humorist Dr. Stephen Leacock. From Toronto Leacock closely followed the increasing body of Benchley's published humor and wit, and opened correspondence between them. He admitted to occasional borrowing of a Benchley topic {{for his own}} reflection and writings. Eventually, he began lobbying gently for Benchley to compile his columns into book form, and in 1922 was delighted with {{the result of his}} nagging. For his part – in a tribute to Leacock – Benchley later said he wrote everything Leacock ever wrote. They had a marvelous friendship.|$|E
6000|$|O! {{the long}} evenings of duets and trios! [...] <b>The</b> <b>admirations</b> and <b>the</b> speculations; [...] The 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!' [...] The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions: [...] The 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!' [...] Amongst our own most musical of nations; [...] With 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale, [...] To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.|$|R

5|$|Like most Austrian generals of the French Revolutionary Wars, {{he joined}} the {{military}} as a young man, and served in the War of Bavarian Succession, in which he took part in its first action by successfully repelling a Prussian border raid, which earned him <b>the</b> <b>admiration</b> of the Empress Maria Theresa's son, Joseph. His continued success in the Habsburg border wars with the Ottoman Empire added to {{his reputation as a}} commander.|$|E
5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew <b>the</b> <b>admiration</b> of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the UNSC warship Spirit of Fire is Captain James Cutter (Gregg Berger), a strong leader who has earned <b>the</b> <b>admiration</b> of his subordinates. Cutter's lack of political ambition prevents him from climbing the ranks further. Serving under Cutter is Sergeant John Forge (Nolan North), a gruff Marine whose devotion to men has caused him to be jailed twice for disobeying orders and engaging in disorderly conduct. Joining the Spirit of Fires military expedition is Professor Ellen Anders (Kim Mai Guest), a scientist interested in ancient ruins of the mysterious Forerunners. The Spirit of Fire is operated with help from Serina (Courtenay Taylor), a super-intelligent artificial intelligence (AI) with a sardonic sense of humor; it has been noted that she demonstrates a level of contempt for the humans she assists. Leading the Covenant search for Forerunner technology is a holy warrior known as the Arbiter (David Sobolov), who the Covenant leaders, the Prophet Hierarchs, have tasked with the oversight of humanity's destruction.|$|E

5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him <b>the</b> <b>admiration</b> of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E

25|$|Machiavelli's use of Borgia {{is subject}} to controversy. Some {{scholars}} see in Machiavelli's Borgia the precursor of state crimes in the 20th century. Others, including Macaulay and Lord Acton, have historicized Machiavelli's Borgia, explaining <b>the</b> <b>admiration</b> for such violence as an effect of the general criminality and corruption of the time.|$|E
