5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced pilots. In mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%. Many of the pilots were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Only {{two days}} later, on Sunday 18 June, the Duke of Wellington {{positioned}} his Anglo-allied army along a ridge {{near the village}} of Waterloo, in order to block Napoleon's advance along the road to Brussels. The Brunswick Corps formed part of Wellington's reserve corps, under his personal command. In that capacity, they were kept well behind the crest of the ridge and avoided casualties during the opening French bombardment. In {{the early part of the}} afternoon, the British Foot Guards moved down the slope to reinforce the Château d'Hougoumont, which was under fierce French attack; the Brunswick Corps was brought forward to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had {{a profound}} effect on the evolution of life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place,</b> spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse the rugged mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville. These rugged and rocky trails were used steadily until 1895, when Pennsylvania Route154 was constructed to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> Part of these old horse trails are still in use and known as Pioneer Road and Double Run Road, and form part {{of two of the}} seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and Pioneer Road meet at the Worlds End Vista, which is thought to be a possible inspiration for the park's name.|$|E

The material for the clues covers {{a wide variety of}} topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.

5|$|At State {{funerals}} the heralds {{once again}} <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place</b> {{at the front}} of the royal procession as it enters the place of worship. Historically during the procession of royal funerals (usually of the Sovereign) the heralds would carry a piece of armour, representing the various marks of chivalry. These included the helm and crest, spurs, gauntlet, target (shield of arms), sword and a literal 'coat of arms' (a heraldic surcoat). This procession of chivalry was an integral part of the heraldic royal funeral. One of the most solemn role for the heralds during a royal funeral is the reading of the full list of the styles and titles of the deceased. On 9 April 2002, Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn-Jones read out the full styles and 437 titles of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother at the end of her funeral service at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Leopold viewed {{a strong}} {{military}} {{as the key}} to maintaining Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting the defense budget in the 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to increase the size of the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot could pay for a substitute to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per family would be liable for military service regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same.|$|E
5|$|On {{the episode}} of Nitro after Fall Brawl, Riggs and Bagwell won the World Tag Team Championship after {{defeating}} then-champions Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) in an upset win in an impromptu match. The American Males {{had been scheduled}} to face The Blue Bloods, but Harlem Heat attacked both members of the Blue Bloods prior to the match and volunteered to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> As champions, the pair defeated Harlem Heat and the team of Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. However, Bagwell and Riggs lost the titles back to Harlem Heat one week later on Saturday Night. The American Males remained top challengers for the title belts for the rest of 1995 but were unable to regain the championship from Harlem Heat.|$|E

5|$|An {{arrangement}} was negotiated whereby al-Adil was to administer Aleppo {{in the name}} of Saladin's son al-Afdal, while Egypt would be governed by al-Muzaffar Umar {{in the name of}} Saladin's other son Uthman. When the two sons were to come of age they would assume power in the two territories, but if any died, one of Saladin's brothers would <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> In the summer of 1183, after ravaging eastern Galilee, Saladin's raids there culminated in the Battle of al-Fule in the Jezreel Valley between him and the Crusaders under Guy of Lusignan. The mostly hand-to-hand fighting ended indecisively. The two armies withdrew to a mile from each other and while the Crusaders discussed internal matters, Saladin captured the Golan Plateau, cutting the Crusaders off from their main supplies source. In October 1183 and then on 13 August 1184, Saladin and al-Adil besieged Crusader-held Karak, but were unable to capture it. Afterward, the Ayyubids raided Samaria, burning down Nablus. Saladin returned to Damascus in September 1184 and a relative peace between the Crusader states and the Ayyubid empire subsequently ensued in 1184–1185.|$|E

25|$|As {{the bison}} {{disappeared}} from the Canadian west, cattle ranches moved in to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> Ranchers {{were among the most}} successful early settlers. The arid prairies and foothills were well suited to American-style, dry-land, open-range ranching. Black American cowboy John Ware brought the first cattle into the province in 1876. Like most hired hands, Ware was American, but the industry was dominated by powerful British- and Ontario-born magnates such as Patrick Burns.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} reforms were mainly intended {{to rescue the}} capitalist system by providing a more rational framework in which it could operate. The banking system was made less vulnerable. The regulation {{of the stock market}} and the prevention of some corporate abuses relating to the sale of securities and corporate reporting addressed the worst excesses. Roosevelt allowed trade unions to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place</b> in labor relations and created the triangular partnership between employers, employees and government.|$|E
