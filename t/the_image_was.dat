5|$|After its rediscovery, {{observers}} often {{assumed that}} <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> always {{used as a}} call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 1968, the 150th {{anniversary of}} her birth, the U.S. Postal Service honored Stone with a 50¢ postage stamp in the Prominent Americans series. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> {{adapted from a}} {{photograph}} included in Alice Stone Blackwell's biography of Stone.|$|E
5|$|When the Internet arose as {{a popular}} and {{important}} medium and the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling on the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), Moore's image {{was described as a}} sort of litmus test to determine if the law could be reasonably applied in the current environment by the trial court. When John Paul Stevens' rendered an opinion over a year later, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> still on the minds of legal scholars.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} compose these two <b>images,</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>are</b> stacked {{together}}.

50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>image</b> {{illustrated}} below, {{if only a}} {{small portion}} of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> shown, it is very difficult to tell what <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> about.|$|R
5|$|According to the Dalai Lama, {{among the}} many images in the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was {{believed}} to have entered the small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.|$|E
5|$|According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, Look Mickey {{was based}} on the Little Golden Book series. The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is {{entitled}} Donald Duck Lost and Found, written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and published through Disney Enterprises. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten. An alternative theory suggests that Look Mickey and Popeye were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers. This image marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein cropped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>are</b> {{of differing}} sizes, {{range from about}} nine to {{eighteen}} inches tall.

30|$|The {{denoising}} {{process of}} computer video electromagnetic leakage emission reduction <b>image</b> <b>is</b> of great significance {{for improving the}} video reproduction and reception capability. From the effect and evaluation after the denoising process, the signal-to-noise ratio of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> improved, <b>the</b> contrast of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> enhanced, and to some extent, the recognizability of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> improved.|$|R
50|$|By convention, if the {{resulting}} magnification <b>is</b> positive, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> upright. If <b>the</b> magnification <b>is</b> negative, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> inverted (upside down).|$|R
5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is {{an image}} of a small region in the {{constellation}} Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. It covers an area about 2.6 arcminutes on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100metres. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 over ten consecutive days between December 18 and December 28, 1995.|$|E
5|$|The creators likened {{themes of}} the episode to the Star Wars trilogy, {{referring}} to the revelations about Fox Mulder's father, and Sophie's Choice, referring to how the Mulders were forced to choose Fox or Samantha to be taken. Carter included the motif of the white buffalo after reading a news story about {{the birth of a}} white buffalo calf, feeling that <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> so potent he did not mind that it did not entirely fit with the Navajo beliefs used elsewhere in the episode.|$|E
40|$|A hybrid <b>image</b> {{compression}} method <b>is</b> proposed {{by which the}} Nuclei-Cytoplasm of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> completely restorable and the background part of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> restorable with insignificant loss. In Hybrid Compression of Cervical Images by Segmenting Nuclei-Cytoplasm, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> subjected to binary segmentation to detect Background and Nuclei-Cytoplasm. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> compressed by standard lossy {{compression method}}. The difference between <b>the</b> lossy <b>image</b> and <b>the</b> original <b>image</b> <b>is</b> computed as residue. The residue at the Nuclei-Cytoplasm area is compressed by standard lossless compression method by which the Nuclei-Cytoplasm area is completely restorable. This method gives a low bit rate than the lossless compression methods...|$|R
30|$|In {{the second}} step, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> further {{processed}} {{by increasing the}} color performance, where <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> first converted into hue-saturation-value (HSV) color model.

5|$|The {{photograph}} {{used for}} {{the cover of the}} album depicts a man rowing a boat made out of strung-together washbasins. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> captured by Margaret Bourke-White as part of a series taken to document the Ohio River flood of 1937. The cover, which was designed by band member John Flansburgh with Elizabeth van Itallie, originally featured only the photo; however, an emblem including the band's name, inked by Flansburgh's former coworker Barbara Lipp, was later added. The emblem resembles the logo of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.|$|E
5|$|When the manga {{moved from}} weekly to monthly {{serialization}} in 2009, Hoshino heard concerns from readers about its possible cancellation and reassured {{them that the}} series would continue. She set up Kanda's backstory by introducing the Third Exorcists, characters related to him and Alma Karma. In Hoshino's original drafts, Kanda's past {{had a number of}} plot holes. A rewritten, published version had a young Kanda walking along a path surrounded by dead people who had cared for him. Due to its violence, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> replaced with one in which Kanda learns that Alma Karma had killed them all. When the chapters were collected into a volume, Hoshino added a small chapter which included the corpses.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
5000|$|For concave mirrors, whether <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> virtual or real {{depends on}} how large the object {{distance}} is compared to the focal length. If the [...] term {{is larger than the}} [...] term, [...] <b>is</b> positive and <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> real. Otherwise, <b>the</b> term <b>is</b> negative and <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> virtual. Again, this validates the behavior described above.|$|R

5|$|In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller and his co-authors {{tried to}} explain through an artificial-intelligence {{computational}} perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained behavior as a set or sequence of stimulus-response actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling such actions. They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman's cognitive map. The TOTE strategy, in its initial test phase, compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to reduce it. This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would be invoked, passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson's boasting and exaggerated claims {{concerning}} his war experiences, {{together with his}} depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the USA and Britain. Roger Fry of the Bloomsbury Group was a particularly virulent critic. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind observed in his catalogue introduction to an exhibition of Nevinson's recent work: 'It is something, {{at the age of}} thirty one, to be among the most discussed, most successful, most promising, most admired and most hated British artists.' In September 1920, Nevinson designed a poster for a production, by Viola Tree, of The Unknown by Somerset Maughan which showed bombs exploding around a crucifix. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> deemed to be offensive and was banned from display on the London Underground. Nevinson distributed the poster outside the theatre and gained a great deal of press coverage in the process.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>was</b> reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E
