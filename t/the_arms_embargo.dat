5|$|Mitchell {{proved to}} be an {{energetic}} and effective constituency member. He also served for a year as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland. However, it became apparent that he was not likely to progress as a minister. His main political interest was the British Army and he was frequently critical of the Army’s leadership.

The ship cost 248,538 pounds, excluding Admiralty supplied equipment such as armaments and communications sets. Fury was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sister ships, during the Abyssinian crisis in June. On 11 December 1936, {{the day after his}} abdication broadcast to the nation, Fury embarked HRH The Duke of Windsor for passage to Boulogne-sur-Mer.

5|$|The Battle of Kupres was {{the first}} {{concrete}} result of the renewed BosniakCroat alliance in the Bosnian War, and the advance to Kupres {{was the first}} military effort coordinated between the ARBiH and the HVO since the Washington Agreement. Following the victory, morale of the ARBiH and the HVO soared. Further advantages for them were the recapture of initiative from the VRS and full control of the Split–Livno–Kupres–Bugojno road, allowing improved logistics of the ARBiH and the HVO in the area, as well as greater volume of transport of arms and ammunition, especially after the United States unilaterally ended <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>embargo</b> against Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1994. The move in effect allowed the HV to supply itself as the arms shipments flowed through Croatia. Finally, {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Kupres secured the right flank of the Livanjsko field, which became especially significant later that month when Operation Winter '94 was launched by the HV and the HVO northwest of Livno in order to draw off a part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent capture of Bihać by the VRS. The battle {{is considered to be a}} significant contribution to subsequent success of the HV in the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War.|$|E
5|$|Foxhound, {{the seventh}} ship {{of that name}} in the Royal Navy, was laid down by John Brown & Company at their Clydebank {{shipyard}} on 15 August 1933.

Foxhound was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but often detached to the Mediterranean Fleet to enforce <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>embargo</b> imposed on {{both sides in the}} Spanish Civil War by the Non-Intervention Committee. Between November 1936 and 13 February 1937, the ship was based in Gibraltar except for a brief refit at Sheerness Dockyard in January. She patrolled the Spanish ports on the Bay of Biscay in May–June and August–October before returning home for a refit at Chatham Dockyard from 27 October to 30 December. During her service in northern Spanish waters, Foxhound was accidentally engaged and straddled by the Spanish nationalist minelayer Jupiter while on station off Gijon in August. She then returned to the Mediterranean to patrol the area between Gibraltar and Oran, French Algeria from January to March 1938. On 22 September, the ship collided with the submarine , damaging one of her propellers. She was repaired at Sheerness from 10 November to 12 December. Foxhound remained in home waters for the rest of 1938–39. The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II.|$|E

40|$|<b>Arms</b> <b>embargoes</b> {{are often}} {{said to be}} {{ineffective}} but mandated fairly often. A sample of 74 <b>arms</b> <b>embargo</b> cases between 1990 and 2005 is analysed {{in order to assess}} effectiveness. The analysis shows that such embargoes had notable effects on arms import patterns in about 30 percent of all cases. However, effects on targeted policies are much more limited. <b>The</b> link between <b>arms</b> <b>embargoes</b> and targeted policy change grows stronger over <b>the</b> lifetime of <b>arms</b> <b>embargoes.</b> <b>The</b> paper also uses a third measure of <b>arms</b> <b>embargo</b> success, initiator satisfaction. <b>Arms</b> <b>embargoes</b> are comparatively cheap for senders, and thus even only partially enforced embargoes may be seen as a success by the initiators of such a sanction. The analysis confirms the hypothesis that multilateral <b>arms</b> <b>embargoes</b> are more successful than unilateral ones. Multilateralization increases supplier satisfaction with an embargo, it raises the likelihood that there are significant changes in arms import patterns and even increases the possibility that there is policy change in the target. Related to multilateralization is <b>arms</b> <b>embargo</b> implementation. A higher degree of participation of countries and a stronger effort at implementation by participants increase <b>the</b> effectiveness. <b>Arms</b> <b>embargoes</b> are more effective when they are embedded in consistent policy packages. <b>Arms</b> <b>embargoes</b> in and of themselves will rarely affect target policies. ...|$|R
