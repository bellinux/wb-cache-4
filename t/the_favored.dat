5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> method in many countries.|$|E

Furthermore, several of the world's largest investment banks have offices in Amman including Standard Chartered, Société Générale, and Citibank.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half, <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> Bearcats {{managed to find}} success on offense. Behind All-American Roger Stephens, the Bearcats tallied threetouchdowns to Virginia Tech's one. The Hokies managed to block all three Cincinnati extra point kicks, but without touchdowns of their own, the Hokies had no chance to win. Cincinnati emerged victorious as time ran out, 18–6.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hooke, Ole Borch, Mikhail Lomonosov, and Pierre Bayen all {{produced}} {{oxygen in}} {{experiments in the}} 17th and the 18th century {{but none of them}} recognized it as a chemical element.

5|$|The Seminoles, like Virginia Tech, {{were picked}} as {{pre-season}} favorites {{to win their}} division.

5|$|After {{his victory}} in the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco's plans for the Spanish Navy {{included}} the acquisition of four modern battleships, and {{a variation on the}} Italian s was <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> candidate to fill the requirement. In late 1939, a Spanish mission to Italy received assurances of technical support for the construction of ships of the class in Spanish yards, and a slipway of sufficient size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the limited resources of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E

5|$|Although the mosque-school was {{the leading}} {{university}} in the Islamic world and had regained royal patronage, it did not overtake the madrasas as <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> place of education among Cairo's elite. Al-Azhar maintained its reputation as an independent place of learning, whereas the madrasas that had first been constructed during Saladin's rule were fully integrated into the state educational system. Al-Azhar did continue to attract students from other areas in Egypt and the Middle East, far surpassing the numbers attending the madrasas. Al-Azhar's student body was organized in riwaqs (fraternities) along national lines, and the branches of Islamic law were studied. The average degree required six years of study.|$|E

One of his major projects with the Predators was taking the team a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In 1998, Youngblood's final year with the team, the club won its first Arena League championship, defeating <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> Tampa Bay Storm. In 1999, he began to work for the AFL office as a liaison to the National Football League and served as a special consultant to the Arena Football League and arenafootball2.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E

Her mother was Raj Kunwar– a courtesan who {{migrated}} from Rajputana, and father was Bahadur Khan, {{who served as}} a Mansabdar (military official) at Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah's court. Khan migrated from Delhi to Hyderabad Deccan where he met and married Raj Kunwar. Chanda Bibi was adopted by Kunwar's childless sister Mehtaab Ma who was <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> courtesan - almost a regular consort - of Nawab Rukn-ud-Daula, a Prime Minister of Nizam of Hyderabad.|$|E
5|$|Representations of America as {{a female}} Native American, or Indian princess, dated back to the 16thcentury; cartographers would place a native woman, often wearing a {{feathered}} headdress, upon their version of the North American continent. This evolved into an image of an Indian queen, then an Indian princess, and although Columbia eventually came to be <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> female embodiment of the United States, {{the image of the}} Indian princess survives in the popular view of such figures as Pocahontas and Sacagawea.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{provided}} a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was {{in position to}} provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, {{as opposed to the}} smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. <b>The</b> <b>favored</b> gun was a rifle designed by the head of his Office of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
50|$|Pertinax {{was a great}} {{contrast}} to Commodus. He was disciplined but lost <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of <b>the</b> troops early since he took away all of <b>the</b> <b>favors</b> that Commodus gave them. This led to a plot to assassinate Pertinax by the Praetorian Guard. The plot was carried out on March 28 and Pertinax was killed {{trying to stop the}} coup. Didius Julianus was his successor as Caesar.|$|R

5|$|The First Chicago Marathon was run on September 23, 1905. That {{first race}} began in Evanston and {{finished}} {{in front of}} a standing-room-only paying crowd at Washington Park race track. In a stunning upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> Louis Marks. With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s on a revised course that largely resembles today's marathon route. Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions, world records were continually sought, and the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>favored</b> {{temperature}} {{range of the}} roughtail stingray is , {{which is the most}} important factor determining its distribution. It conducts seasonal migrations off the eastern United States: from December to May, this ray is found over the middle and outer parts of the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Florida, with larger rays occurring further south than smaller ones. In the spring, the population moves north of the Cape and towards the coast into bays, inlets, and saltier estuaries, though preserving the north-south gradient of body sizes. A similar migration, from shallow coastal waters in summer to deeper offshore waters in winter, apparently occurs in the Mediterranean. Pregnant females tend to be found apart from other individuals.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{predicted}} {{to be the}} key player for <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an offense that earned 610rushing yards in the final two games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also was a point of interest. At the time, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was ranked third. Beamer had never defeated Bowden in a game. Before the game, Beamer was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.|$|E
