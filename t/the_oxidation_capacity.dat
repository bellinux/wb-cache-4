A laboratory column {{study was conducted in}} order to derive design criteria that enable construction of an effective methane oxidising cover from the range of soils that are available to the landfill operator. Therefore, <b>the</b> methane <b>oxidation</b> <b>capacity</b> of different soils was assessed under simulated landfill conditions. Five sandy potential landfill top cover materials with varying contents of silt and clay were investigated with respect to methane oxidation and corresponding soil gas composition over a period of four months. The soils were compacted to 95 % of their specific proctor density, resulting in bulk densities of 1. 4 - 1. 7 g cm(- 3), reflecting considerably unfavourable conditions for methane oxidation due to reduced air-filled porosity. The soil water content was adjusted to field capacity, resulting in water contents ranging from 16. 2 to 48. 5 vol. %. The investigated inlet fluxes ranged from 25 to about 100 g CH(4) m(- 2) d(- 1), covering the methane load proposed to allow for complete oxidation in landfill covers under Western European climate conditions and hence being suggested as a criterion for release from aftercare. The vertical distribution of gas concentrations, methane flux balances as well as stable carbon isotope studies allowed for clear process identifications. Higher inlet fluxes led to a reduction of the aerated zone, an increase in <b>the</b> absolute methane <b>oxidation</b> rate and a decline of the relative proportion of oxidized methane. For each material, a specific maximum oxidation rate was determined, which varied between 20 and 95 g CH(4) m(- 2) d(- 1) and which was positively correlated to the air-filled porosity of <b>the</b> soil. Methane <b>oxidation</b> efficiencies and gas profile data imply a strong link between <b>oxidation</b> <b>capacity</b> and diffusive ingress of atmospheric air.

We consider the following sources: short-lived bromocarbons (CHBr 3, CH 2 BrCl, CHBr 2 Cl, CHBrCl 2, andCH 2 Br 2) and CH 3 Br, bromine from airborne sea salt particles, and frost flowers and sea salt on or in the snowpack in polar regions. The total bromine emissions in our simulations add up to 31. 7 Gmol(Br) /yr: 63 % from polar sources, 24. 6 % from short-lived bromocarbons and 12. 4 % from airborne sea salt particles.

Analysis based on the Langmuir adsorption model showed that the partitioning of peroxynitric acid to ice is orders of magnitude lower than of nitric acid and similar to nitrous acid partitioning behavior. The partition coefficient (KLinC) and its temperature dependency can be described by 3. 74 × 10 &minus; 12 × e(7098 /T) [cm]. Atmospheric implications are discussed and show that the uptake to cirrus clouds or to snow-packs in polar areas is an important sink for peroxynitric acid in the environment...|$|R
40|$|In applied statistics, tools from machine {{learning}} are popular for analyzing complex and high-dimensional data. However, few theoretical results are available that could {{guide to the}} appropriate {{machine learning}} tool in a new application. Initial development of an overall strategy thus often implies that multiple methods are tested and compared on {{the same set of}} data. This is particularly difficult in situations that are prone to over-fitting where the number of subjects is low compared to the number of potential predictors. The article presents a game which provides some grounds for conducting a fair model comparison. Each player selects a modeling strategy for predicting individual response from potential predictors. A strictly proper scoring rule, bootstrap cross-validation, and a set of rules are used to make the results obtained with different strategies comparable. To illustrate the ideas, the game is applied to data from the Nugenob Study where the aim is to predict <b>the</b> fat <b>oxidation</b> <b>capacity</b> based on conventional factors and high-dimensional metabolomics data.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{trickling}} filters used on commercial eel farms differs considerably {{with respect to}} dimensions, hydraulic and substrate loads and filter medium applied. In this paper, a model, developed for ammonium removal in a pilot-scale trickling filter, has been validated {{for a range of}} full-scale trickling filters, incorporating the above mentioned aspects. The performance of trickling filters was assessed at 14 commercial eel farms in The Netherlands. Analysis of the data obtained has shown that the model sufficiently explains and predicts the ammonium removal rate {{of a wide range of}} commercial trickling filters. The model is used to optimise performance of existing biofilters in terms of ammonium levels achieved and pumping costs. Observations have also been made on nitrite in recirculation systems. Concentrations of nitrite and the ratio between nitrite and ammonium vary widely in and between systems. <b>The</b> nitrite <b>oxidation</b> <b>capacity</b> in biofilms seems to be variable and sensitive to environmental disturbances...|$|R

The hydroxyl (OH) radical budget was evaluated em-ploying a simple quasi-photostationary-state model (PSS) constrained with simultaneous measurements of HONO, HCHO, O 3, NO, NO 2, j (O 1 D), j (NO 2), 13 alkenes and me-teorological parameters. In addition, a zero dimensional pho-tochemical box model based on the Master Chemical Mecha-nism (MCMv 3. 1) {{has been used to}} estimate production rates and total free radical budgets, including OH, HO 2 and RO 2. Besides the above parameters, the MCM model has been constrained by the measured CO and volatile organic com-pounds (VOCs) including alkanes and aromatics. Both mod-els simulate the same OH concentration during daytime indi...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (TCP) by ferrous-catalyzed {{hydrogen peroxide}} was quantified and modeled in the study. TCP was effectively degraded by hydroxyl radicals that were generated by Fe(II) /H 2 O 2 in the oxidation process. <b>The</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>capacity</b> (OC) {{of the process}} depends on the concentrations of oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and oxidative catalyst (ferrous ion). Up to 99. 6 % of TCP removal can be achieved in the process, provided the doses of Fe(II) and H 2 O 2 are selected correctly. The OC of the process was successfully predicted through a kinetic approach in a two-stage model with some simple and measurable parameters, which makes the model useful for predicting, controlling and optimizing the catalyzed oxidation process in the degradation of TCP.

40|$|Abstract. Peroxyacetic acid (PAA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} atmospheric organic peroxides, which have received increasing attention for their potential contribution to <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>capacity</b> of the troposphere and the formation of secondary aerosols. We report here, for the first time, a series of data for atmospheric PAA concentrations at urban and rural sites, from five field campaigns carried out in China in summer 2006, 2007 and 2008. For these five measurements, daytime mean (08 : 00 – 20 : 00 LT) PAA concentrations on sunlit days were 21. 4 – 148. 0 pptv with a maximum level of ∼ 1 ppbv. The various meteorological and chemical parameters influencing PAA concentrations were examined using Principal Factor Analysis. This statistical analysis shows that the local photochemical production was the major source of PAA, and its concentration increased with increasing temperature,...|$|E

40|$|International @ AIR+CGO:BNO:KAE:LTI:SRSInternational audienceTraditionally, {{the driving}} forces for {{particle}} growth {{are attributed to}} condensation of condensable species following atmospheric oxidation of volatile species by gaseous oxidants. The present study presents experimental evidence of an unaccounted-for new photo-induced pathway for particles growth {{in the absence of}} a gas phase. In the present work, we investigated how photosensitized processes may also contribute to organic aerosol growth in the troposphere. Condensed phase chemistry of glyoxal contributes to the formation of light absorbing compounds, such imidazol carboxaldehyde (IC) which is demonstrated to be an efficient photosensitizer. Its triplet state chemistry is shown to favour the fast uptake of non-condensable VOCs. Growth rates measured by means of an aerosol flow tube, combined with high resolution MS analytics performed with an Orbitrap and finally triplet-state quenching kinetics (Laser photolysis) will be presented. These measurements enable us to present a reaction mechanism that in addition of favouring condensed phase chemistry may also have feedbacks into <b>the</b> gaseous <b>oxidation</b> <b>capacity</b> through <b>the</b> production of radicals. Current data will be presented and discussed...|$|R

HRTEM results and DFT calculations mutually validate each other to indicate the reasonable existence of g-C 3 N 4 (001) -ZnWO 4 (010) and g-C 3 N 4 (001) -ZnWO 4 (011) interfaces. The g-C 3 N 4 -ZnWO 4 heterojunctions show higher photocatalytic activity for degradation of MB than pure g-C 3 N 4 and ZnWO 4 under visible-light irradiation. Moreover, the heterojunctions significantly enhance <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> of phenol in contrast to pure g-C 3 N 4, <b>the</b> phenol <b>oxidation</b> <b>capacity</b> of which is weak, clearly demonstrating a synergistic effect between g-C 3 N 4 and ZnWO 4. Interestingly, based on the theoretical calculations, we find that electrons in the upper valence band can be directly excited from g-C 3 N 4 to the conduction band, that is, the W 5 d orbital of ZnWO 4, under visible-light irradiation, which should yield well-separated electron-hole pairs, with high photocatalytic performance in g-C 3 N 4 -ZnWO 4 heterojunctions as shown by our experiment. The microcosmic mechanisms of interface interaction and charge transfer in this system can be helpful for fabricating other effective heterostructured photocatalysts...|$|R
