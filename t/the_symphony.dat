5|$|At some {{stage in}} that summer the formal copying of <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent {{a bill for}} making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius {{informed}} him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times {{as long as this}} excerpt, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> might be on a larger scale than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.|$|E
5|$|Dmitri Shostakovich had {{intended}} the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, {{but because of}} the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> all the way through only once before the concert.|$|E
5|$|For decades, Nielsen's music {{did not win}} {{recognition}} outside Denmark. The first recording was in 1933: Georg Høeberg {{with the}} Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra for Dancord. The first live recording was produced in 1950 with Erik Tuxen conducting the same orchestra at the Edinburgh Festival. An international breakthrough was made only when Leonard Bernstein recorded <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1962 for CBS. This recording helped Nielsen's music to achieve appreciation beyond his home country, and {{is considered one of}} the finest recorded accounts of <b>the</b> <b>symphony.</b>|$|E

5|$|His {{greatest}} {{and most}} famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer {{wrote the first}} three movements in Leningrad and completed the work in Kuibyshev (now Samara) {{where he and his}} family had been evacuated. It remains unclear whether Shostakovich really conceived the idea of <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> with the siege of Leningrad in mind, it was officially claimed as a representation of the people of Leningrad’s brave resistance to the German invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed boosting. <b>The</b> <b>symphony</b> was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States. The most compelling performance was the Leningrad premiere by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city. The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play a musical instrument to perform <b>the</b> <b>symphony.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the {{orchestra}} released its first record through Koch, with works by Gian Carlo Menotti, Ronald Lo Presti and Norman Dello Joio. DePreist and <b>the</b> <b>Symphony</b> then issued two special edition albums not available commercially: Romeo and Juliet (1992), featuring Tchaikovsky's Fantasy Overture Romeo and Juliet, and Roman Festivals (1993), a re-issue {{of the performance}} of Respighi's Feste Romane from Bravura. On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 1995, <b>the</b> <b>Symphony</b> released its second album through Koch, with works by Joseph Schwantner and Nicolas Flagello; more than 30 United States radio stations broadcast Schwantner's piece on the holiday to commemorate the civil rights leader. The album reached a peak position of number three on Billboard Classical Albums chart and remains the Symphony's best-selling album to date. Later that year, to commemorate its centenary, <b>the</b> <b>Symphony</b> released its first compilation album, Centennial Collection, which contained material from previously released recordings. Erich Wolfgang Korngold: The Sea Hawk; Symphony in F-Sharp followed in 1998.|$|E

5|$|The {{publication}} of the Pravda editorials coincided with the composition of Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony. The work marked a great shift in style for the composer, owing to the substantial influence of Gustav Mahler {{and a number of}} Western-style elements. <b>The</b> <b>symphony</b> gave Shostakovich compositional trouble, as he attempted to reform his style into a new idiom. The composer was well into the work when the fatal articles appeared. Despite this, Shostakovich continued to compose <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> and planned a premiere at the end of 1936. Rehearsals began that December, but after a number of rehearsals Shostakovich, for reasons still debated today, decided to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> from the public. A number of his friends and colleagues, such as Isaak Glikman, have suggested that it was in fact an official ban which Shostakovich was persuaded to present as a voluntary withdrawal. Whatever the case, it seems possible that this action saved the composer's life: during this time Shostakovich feared for himself and his family. Yet Shostakovich did not repudiate the work; it retained its designation as his Fourth Symphony. A piano reduction was published in 1946, and the work was finally premiered in 1961, well after Stalin's death.|$|E
5|$|Walton's {{first major}} {{composition}} after Belshazzar's Feast was his First Symphony. It was not written to a commission, and Walton worked slowly on the score from late 1931 until he completed it in 1935. He had composed {{the first three}} of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor Hamilton Harty. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work. The end of his affair with Imma von Doernberg coincided with, and may have contributed to, a sudden and persistent writer's block. Harty persuaded Walton to let him perform the three existing movements, which he premiered in December 1934 with the London Symphony Orchestra. During 1934 Walton interrupted work on <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> to compose his first film music, for Paul Czinner's Escape Me Never (1934), for which he was paid £300. After a break of eight months, Walton resumed work on <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> and completed it in 1935. Harty and the BBC Symphony Orchestra gave the premiere of the completed piece in November of that year. <b>The</b> <b>symphony</b> aroused international interest. The leading continental conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler and Willem Mengelberg sent for copies of the score, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra premiered the work in the US under Harty, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra gave the New York premiere, and the young George Szell conducted <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> in Australia.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} three years, {{according}} to the calculations of Mahler's friend Guido Adler the Eighth Symphony received a further 20 performances across Europe. These included the Dutch premiere, in Amsterdam under Willem Mengelberg on 12March 1912, and the first Prague performance, given on 20March 1912 under Mahler's former Vienna Hofoper colleague, Alexander von Zemlinsky. Vienna itself {{had to wait until}} 1918 before <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> was heard there. In the US, Leopold Stokowski persuaded an initially reluctant board of the Philadelphia Orchestra to finance the American premiere, which took place on 2March 1916. The occasion was a great success; <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> was played several more times in Philadelphia before the orchestra and choruses travelled to New York, for a series of equally well-received performances at the Metropolitan Opera House.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, {{notwithstanding}} his revolutionary sentiments, Smetana {{accepted the}} post of Court Pianist in Ferdinand's establishment in Prague Castle. He continued teaching in the Piano Institute, and devoted himself increasingly to composition. His works, mainly for the piano, included the three-part Wedding Scenes, some of the music of which was later used in The Bartered Bride. He also wrote numerous short experimental pieces collected under the name Album Leaves, {{and a series of}} polkas. During 1853–54 he worked on a major orchestral piece, the Triumphal Symphony, composed to commemorate the wedding of Emperor Franz Joseph. <b>The</b> <b>symphony</b> was rejected by the Imperial Court, possibly {{on the grounds that the}} brief musical references to the Austrian national anthem were not sufficiently prominent. Undeterred, Smetana hired an orchestra at his own expense to perform <b>the</b> <b>symphony</b> at the Konvikt Hall in Prague on 26February 1855. The work was coolly received, and the concert was a financial failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Shostakovich {{appeared}} {{on stage in}} Moscow {{at the end of}} a concert performance of his Fifth Symphony, congratulating Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for their performance (part of a concert tour of the Soviet Union).
