40|$|Purpose: Determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> values <b>of</b> quality {{attributes}} is {{very important}} to integrate the Kano model with QFD.

To evaluate the effectiveness of ASC, a case study of modern TV sets is conducted, and the performance of ASC is compared with direct importance evaluation and AHP pairwise comparisons. Results: The result of ASC application is similar with those <b>of</b> direct <b>importance</b> evaluation and AHP pairwise comparison. Conclusion: ASC is an effective instrument to determine <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> values <b>of</b> quality attributes.
