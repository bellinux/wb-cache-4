5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> artifact of the potential field {{in the same way}} that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
