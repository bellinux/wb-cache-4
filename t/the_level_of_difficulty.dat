40|$|Abstract. Infrastructure {{projects}} have been requested to consider sustainability in recent years. However, many engineers have little idea how to start with this new issue. It would help engineers to incorporate sustainability if the difficulties and their reasons can be identified. This research investigated <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> for sustainable design, by taking roadways as an example. It first collected 14 roadway design work disciplines such as drainage from a large engineering consulting company. Then it reviewed literature and practice to identify 60 sustainable items, and categorized them into 14 disciplines to establish a checklist. Finally, the checklist was used to interview designers to indicate <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> adopting these sustainable items. The difficulties to achieve sustainability into design are classified into three levels compared with traditional work: equal, medium and high. Twenty eight of the 60 sustainable items were evaluated at <b>the</b> same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> as traditional design. Approximately half of the items would not increase the difficulty when incorporated into design. The average difficulty would be between equal and medium level. Compared with traditional design work, incorporating sustainability into roadway design would increase certain difficulty...|$|R

5|$|Many critics saw A Link Between Worlds as {{a worthy}} {{successor}} to A Link to the Past, but also remarked {{that the game}} was outstanding in its own right. The game was commended for making enhancements to core and traditional elements of the series. New additions and changes to the established formula were also welcomed. Polygon reviewer Arthur Gies called it the best Zelda game in past twenty years, and GamesRadar writer Lorenzo Veloria {{said that it was}} an essential title for every Nintendo 3DS owner. Reception towards the game's puzzles was overwhelmingly positive; praise was directed towards how well the wall-merging mechanic had been incorporated into dungeon puzzles and integrated into every area of the game. Keza MacDonald of IGN thought A Link Between Worlds was the best puzzle game that Nintendo had ever created. Game Informer writer Dan Ryckert noted that some of the game's dungeons and boss encounters were {{among the best in the}} franchise's history. <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> present in the puzzles and dungeons was met with approval; the challenge was described as a perplexing experience rather than a frustrating one by GameSpot editor Martin Gaston.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis and DeMar playtested {{the game}} themselves, and {{continually}} tweaked the designs {{as the project}} progressed. Though games at the time began to use scrolling to have larger levels, the developers chose a single screen to confine the action. To instill panic in the player, the character was initially placed {{in the center of}} the game's action, and had to deal with projectiles coming from multiple directions, as opposed previous shooting games such as Space Invaders and Galaxian, where the enemies attacked from a single direction. This made for more challenging gameplay, an aspect Jarvis took pride in. Enemies were assigned to stages in different groups to create themes. Early stages were designed to be relatively simple compared to later ones. <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> was designed to increase quickly so players would struggle to complete later stages. In retrospect, Jarvis attributes his and DeMar's average player skills to the game's balanced design. Though they made the game as difficult as they could, the high end of their skills ended up being a good challenge for expert players. The graphics were given a simple appearance to avoid a cluttered game screen, and object designs were made distinct from each other to avoid confusion. Black was chosen as the background color to help characters stand out and reduce clutter.|$|E
