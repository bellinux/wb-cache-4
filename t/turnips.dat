5|$|Carrots {{are one of}} the ten most {{economically}} important vegetable {{crops in}} the world. In 2014, world production of carrots (combined with <b>turnips)</b> was 38.8 million tonnes, with China producing 45% of the world total (17.3 million tonnes, table). Other major producers were Uzbekistan and Russia (5% and 4% of world total, respectively), the United States (4%) and Ukraine (2%).|$|E
5|$|Exploration and {{colonisation}} of North and South America {{resulted in}} the introduction into Europe of such crops as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc, while the principal Old World livestock – cattle, horses, sheep and goats – were introduced into the New World {{for the first time}} along with wheat, barley, rice and <b>turnips.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 20th century {{saw many}} {{changes in farming}} on Shapinsay. Mechanised {{implements}} came to the island, particularly after the Second World War. In common {{with the rest of}} Orkney, the amount of land given over to growing grass increased. The growing of grain (with the exception of barley) and <b>turnips</b> steadily declined as these were replaced as winter fodder for livestock by silage, usually harvested by mechanical forage harvesters.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) {{reports that}} world {{production}} of carrots and <b>turnips</b> (these plants are combined by the FAO) for the calendar year 2013 was 37.2 million tonnes; almost half (~45%) were grown in China. Carrots {{are widely used}} in many cuisines, especially {{in the preparation of}} salads, and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation and the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as <b>turnips,</b> carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, <b>turnips,</b> spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E

500|$|While folk {{etymology}} sometimes {{assumes the}} name is a portmanteau of parsley and <b>turnip,</b> it actually comes from Middle English pasnepe, alteration (influenced by nep, <b>turnip)</b> of Old French pasnaie (now [...] ) from Latin , a kind of fork. The word's ending was changed to -nip by analogy with <b>turnip</b> because it was mistakenly {{assumed to be a}} kind of <b>turnip.</b>|$|R
50|$|The carrot used to {{make the}} Changzhou dried <b>turnip</b> is the one grown up in the Changzhou Xinzha {{district}} which skin is red and smooth, the fruit is crumbly, the taste is sweet and delicious, and the size is shapely and suited. This kind of <b>turnip</b> used to be called the small <b>turnip</b> is even more delicious than the pear(小小萝卜赛鸭梨). By using this kind of <b>turnip</b> as the raw material and via the special salted process, Changzhou dried <b>turnip</b> has the feature of fine chewing no residue.|$|R
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{both in the}} Islamic {{world and}} in Europe, {{agriculture}} was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to Europe by way of Al-Andalus. After 1492, the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and manioc to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, and <b>turnips,</b> and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats to the Americas.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and <b>turnips</b> and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E
5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, <b>turnips,</b> barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
40|$|In Galicia (northwestern Spain), Brassica rapa var. rapa L. {{includes}} <b>turnip</b> {{greens and}} <b>turnip</b> tops as vegetable products. They {{are characterized by}} a particular sulfurous aroma, pungent flavor, and a bitter taste. In this work twelve local varieties grown as <b>turnip</b> greens and <b>turnip</b> tops were evaluated to define the sensory attributes, to relate them with secondary metabolites, and to select those sensorial traits that better describe these crops. Results showed differences in the sensory profiles of B. rapa varieties. <b>Turnip</b> greens were significantly differed for aroma intensity, leaf color, and salty taste, while <b>turnip</b> tops were for color and firmness of leaves, moistness and fibrosity in mouth, sharpness, and bitter taste. Secondary metabolites as glucosinolates in <b>turnip</b> greens and phenolic compounds in <b>turnip</b> tops were highly correlated with texture and flavor. Glucosinolates especially progoitrin (in <b>turnip</b> greens) and gluconapin (in <b>turnip</b> tops) showed correlation with bitter taste and aftertaste persistence. Correlation between sensory traits showed highest values between leaf firmness and stalk firmness (0. 94 **), leaf firmness and fibrosity (R= 0. 92 **), aftertaste persistence and bitterness (R= 0. 91 **) and between bitterness and moistness (R=- 0. 89 **).

5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and <b>turnips</b> traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|Spanish conquistadors brought {{potatoes}} and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced <b>turnips</b> in borscht recipes, and tomatoes – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour {{as the source}} of tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|At the Union of 1707 England {{had about}} five times the {{population}} of Scotland, and about 36 times as much wealth, however, Scotland began to experience the beginnings of economic expansion that would begin {{to allow it to}} close this gap. Contacts with England led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. <b>Turnips</b> and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep. However, although some estate holders improved {{the quality of life of}} their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad.|$|E

New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters.
