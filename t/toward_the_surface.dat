5|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism that}} causes differential rotation is turbulent convection inside a star. Convective motion carries energy <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> through the mass movement of plasma. This mass of plasma carries {{a portion of}} the angular velocity of the star. When turbulence occurs through shear and rotation, the angular momentum can become redistributed to different latitudes through meridional flow.|$|E
5|$|Geyser activity, {{like all}} hot spring activity, {{is caused by}} surface water {{gradually}} seeping down through the ground until it meets rock heated by magma. The geothermally heated water then rises back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> by convection through porous and fractured rocks. Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected {{to one or more}} narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas. However, {{research has shown that}} economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers.|$|E

5|$|Klaus {{continued}} tracking {{just north}} of the Lesser Antilles, and after continuing to deteriorate from the wind shear, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression on October 8 to the north of Puerto Rico. Later that day, convection redeveloped over the center, and Klaus re-attained tropical storm status as it accelerated toward the northeast Bahamas; it briefly reached winds of 50mph (85km/h). A low pressure area to its west over Cuba had been steadily intensifying and building <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> and on October 9 it developed into a tropical depression; the cyclone became the dominant system, eventually becoming Marco, and Klaus dissipated {{under the influence of the}} system late on October 9. The remnant moisture continued to the northwest, reaching the coast of South Carolina by October 11.|$|E
5|$|The entire star is {{undergoing}} convection, whereby the energy generated {{at the core}} is being transported <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> by the convective motion of plasma, rather than by transmission through radiation. This circulation redistributes any accumulation of helium that is generated through stellar nucleosynthesis at the core throughout the star. This process will allow the star {{to remain on the}} main sequence as a hydrogen fusing star proportionately longer than a star such as the Sun where helium steadily accumulates at the core. In combination with a lower rate of hydrogen consumption due to its low mass, the convection will allow Wolf 359 to remain a main-sequence star for about eight trillion years.|$|E
5|$|Diamond-bearing rock {{is carried}} from the mantle to the Earth's surface by deep-origin {{volcanic}} eruptions. The magma {{for such a}} volcano must originate at a depth where diamonds can be formed— or more (three times or more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes). This is a relatively rare occurrence. These typically small surface volcanic craters extend downward in formations known as volcanic pipes. The pipes contain material that was transported <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> by volcanic action, but was not ejected before the volcanic activity ceased. During eruption these pipes {{are open to the}} surface, resulting in open circulation; many xenoliths of surface rock and even wood and fossils are found in volcanic pipes. Diamond-bearing volcanic pipes are closely related to the oldest, coolest regions of continental crust (cratons). This is because cratons are very thick, and their lithospheric mantle extends to great enough depth that diamonds are stable. Not all pipes contain diamonds, and even fewer contain enough diamonds to make mining economically viable.|$|E

25|$|A {{wind speed}} {{gradient}} of 4 (m/s)/km can produce refraction equal to a typical {{temperature lapse rate}} of 7.5°C/km. Higher values of wind gradient will refract sound downward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> in the downwind direction, eliminating the acoustic shadow on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind. This downwind refraction effect occurs {{because there is a}} wind gradient; the sound is not being carried along by the wind.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico slope {{includes a}} stratigraphic section more than 10km (6mi) thick {{and has been}} profoundly influenced by salt movement. Mesozoic source rocks from Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous generate oil {{in most of the}} Gulf slope fields (Sassen et al., 1993a and b). Migration conduits supply fresh hydrocarbon materials through a vertical scale of 6–8km (4–5mi) <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The surface expressions of hydrocarbon migration are referred to as seeps.

25|$|Sand{{blasting}} or {{bead blasting}} is a generic {{term for the}} process of smoothing, shaping, and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds. Sandblasting equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> or workpiece. Nozzles {{come in a variety}} of shapes, sizes, and materials. Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles because it resists abrasive wear well. In 1870, the sandblasting process was invented and patented by Benjamin Chew Tilghman.|$|E
25|$|The geology of Duluth {{demonstrates}} the Midcontinent Rift, formed as the North American continent (Laurentia) began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. Continental rifting is a recurring {{process in the}} history of the earth that leads to break-up of continents and the formation of ocean basins. In the Lake Superior region, the upwelling of molten rock may have been the result of a hot spot that produced a dome over the Lake Superior area. As the earth's crust thinned, magma rose <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> When insulated by overlying roof rock, the upwelling magma cooled slowly, and is therefore coarse-grained. These intrusions formed a sill some 16km thick, primarily of gabbro, which is known as the Duluth Complex. In the areas where the rising magma erupted to the surface and cooled rapidly, basalt, the extrusive equivalent of gabbro, was formed.|$|E
40|$|The flow {{exiting the}} {{combustor}} and entering the turbine {{of a gas}} turbine engine is known to contain both spatial and temporal variations in total temperature. Although historically it has been presumed that the turbine rotor responded to the average temperature, recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that the rotor actually separated the hotter and cooler streams of fluid so that the hotter fluid migrated <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pressure <b>surface</b> and <b>the</b> cooler fluid migrated <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> suction <b>surface.</b> In <b>the</b> present study a time-accurate, two-dimensional, thin-layer, Navier-Stokes analysis of a turbine stage was used to analyze this phenomenon.

25|$|The cell {{achieves}} {{its height}} {{in the water}} column by synthesising gas vesicles. As the cell rises up, it is able to increase its carbohydrate load through increased photosynthesis. Too high and the cell will suffer photobleaching and possible death, however, the carbohydrate produced during photosynthesis increases the cell's density, causing it to sink. The daily cycle of carbohydrate build-up from photosynthesis and carbohydrate catabolism during dark hours is enough to fine-tune the cell's position {{in the water column}}, bring it up <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> when its carbohydrate levels are low and it needs to photosynthesis, and allowing it to sink away from the harmful UV radiation when the cell's carbohydrate levels have been replenished. An extreme excess of carbohydrate causes a significant change in the internal pressure of the cell, which causes the gas vesicles to buckle and collapse and the cell to sink out.|$|E
25|$|Krill {{typically}} {{follow a}} diurnal vertical migration. It has been assumed that they {{spend the day}} at greater depths and rise during the night <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Swimming activity in krill varies with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefore sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce feces which implies {{a role in the}} Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. Vertical migration may be a 2–3 times daily occurrence. Some species (e.g., Euphausia superba, E. pacifica, E. hanseni, Pseudeuphausia latifrons, and Thysanoessa spinifera) form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{has several}} isoforms, {{including}} C16:0, which is found {{primarily in the}} secretory granules and <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the membrane of β cells. Secretory granules and β cells {{are found in the}} islet of Langerhans and in rat β TC3 cells. Research has shown that in the pancreases of type II diabetic mouse models, there is a deficiency of C16:0. Additional research has shown that C16:0 {{plays an important role in}} assisting to improve insulin crystal preservation, and as the β cells in the pancreas secrete insulin, sulfatide aids in the monomerization of insulin, which is the breakdown of insulin into its basics components or monomers. Consequently, sulfatide is needed in order to maintain normal insulin secretion, which sulfatide is capable of mediating through stimulation of calcium dependent exocytosis and Adenosine triphosphate(ATP) sensitive potassium ion channels. Sulfatide can also stimulate proinsulin folding as well, as it can serve as a molecular chaperone for insulin.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} {{of such a}} large bubble to the legs {{can be a problem}} for a number of reasons: It balloons the legs, and it may inflate thin rubber booties enough to cause fins to pop off; a diver without fins has more restricted ability to move and become upright, and also loses the ability to kick downward to maintain depth, so that the bubble expansion problem does not grow worse. Movement of gas into the legs and feet may also cause special difficulties in drysuits that have air exhaust values only at the shoulders or wrists, because the air in the legs and booties cannot be evacuated while the diver is inverted, and such a diver may be moving <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> causing the problem of expanding air in the suit to grow worse with each meter of lost depth. (Some low-quality buoyancy control devices also cannot vent air, when inverted). If the diver is positively buoyant and rising, the buoyancy of the dry suit becomes uncontrollable after rising though a certain fraction of depth, and there is then an increased risk of a rapid ascent which grows more rapid, as the distance to the surface decrease. The final result of such a run-away inversion is a diver rising {{all the way to the}} surface, feet first, in an uncontrolled ascent that is too rapid for decompression safety.|$|E
