50|$|Although less common, rolling burnouts can be {{achieved}} with modified line locks by proportionally increasing the front brake pressure and the throttle to keep the car at a <b>steady</b> <b>speed.</b> This makes the rear tires slip and spin faster than the front tires and burnout.|$|R
50|$|Another {{limitation}} of early steam engines was speed variability, which made them unsuitable for many textile applications, especially spinning.

30|$|The {{maximum speed}} of the drivers was {{analysed}} only for the free driving scenario, since in the following vehicle scenario, the drivers were instructed to follow the lead vehicle which moved with a <b>steady</b> <b>speed,</b> and, as such, we expected no significant findings from the observation of their maximum speed.|$|R
50|$|Drawbacks: The {{nature of}} the pump {{requires}} very close clearances between the rotating pump and the outer edge, making it rotate at a slow, <b>steady</b> <b>speed.</b> If rotary pumps are operated at high speeds, the fluids cause erosion, which eventually causes enlarged clearances that liquid can pass through, which reduces efficiency.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} effect was {{incorporated}} into the initiation and propagation process of a transformation inclusion. Based on the time-varying propagation equation of a spherical transformation inclusion with pure dilatational eigenstrain, the dynamic elastic fields {{both inside and outside}} the inclusion were derived explicitly, and it is found that when the transformation region expands at a constant speed, the strain field inside the inclusion is time-independent and uniform for uniform eigenstrain, Following the basic ideas of crack propagation problems in dynamic fracture mechanics, the reduction rate of the mechanical part of the free energy accompanying the growth of the transformation inclusion was derived as the driving force for the move of the interface. Then the equation to determine the propagation speed was established. It is found that there exists a <b>steady</b> <b>speed</b> for the growth of the transformation inclusion when lime is approaching infinity. Finally the relation between the <b>steady</b> <b>speed</b> and the applied hydrostatic stress was derived explicitly...|$|R
