He is kidnapped by Magneto in a test of his mutation machine, which causes his body to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> liquid-like substance. He dies before Jean could save him.|$|E
5|$|Owner Bill Veeck was {{concerned}} the promotion might <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> disaster and checked {{himself out of}} the hospital, where he had been undergoing tests. The elder Veeck's fears were substantiated when he saw the people walking towards the ballpark that afternoon; many carried signs that described disco in profane terms.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{does not}} have enough mass to explode as a supernova. Instead it will exit the main {{sequence}} in approximately 5 billion years and start to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> red giant. As a red giant, the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth.|$|E

He <b>turned</b> himself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fish and jumped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> river: she then <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> otter. He <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bird in the air, and in {{response}} she became a hawk.|$|R

5|$|The game follows Fox McCloud {{attempting}} {{to defend the}} galaxy from aliens known as the Anglar. Q-Games originally worked on Intersect, which Nintendo decided to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> DS game. The game was generally well-received; it has achieved an average score of 76% from GameRankings, a reviews aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|Hulk is a 2003 American superhero drama film {{based on}} the fictional Marvel Comics {{character}} of the same name. Ang Lee directed the film, which stars Eric Bana as Dr. Bruce Banner, as well as Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Nick Nolte. The film explores the origins of Bruce Banner, who after a lab accident involving gamma radiation finds himself able to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> huge green-skinned monster whenever he gets angry, while he is pursued by the United States military and comes into a conflict with his father.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} was {{supposed}} to revolve around the duo {{trying to get the}} plant back, lest Princess Bubblegum <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> man. In addition, the episode originally {{was supposed to}} feature a mysterious rabbit that guided Finn and Jake through the Underworld; this character was later cut. The episode was watched by 1.981 million people and received largely positive critical attention. Many critics applauded Ferrer's voice acting work, and Matt Fowler of IGN singled the episode out {{as an example of the}} comedic darkening of Adventure Time.|$|E
5|$|Sauron's second-in-command, the Witch-king of Angmar, led a {{much larger}} force from Minas Morgul, and {{attacked}} Osgiliath. After Osgiliath was conquered, Faramir decided {{to stay with the}} rearguard in order {{to make sure that the}} retreat over Pelennor would not <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rout. He was gravely wounded by a Southron arrow and the Black Breath of the Nazgûl. Fortunately, all of the mounted soldiers in the city rode to his aid and brought him back to Denethor in Minas Tirith.|$|E
5|$|Siwiec' {{funeral in}} Przemyśl was well attended, {{but did not}} <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{political}} manifestation; it was guarded by police, and secret agents spread rumors aimed at damaging Siwiec's reputation. His family reported that while some acquaintances were supportive and aware of Siwiec's true purpose, many turned away from them, either intimidated by the authorities or believing the stories that Siwiec had been drunk or mentally ill.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, due to ever growing {{demands for}} {{admission}} to the school, St. Xavier's, Godavari was <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> full-fledged primary school and St. Xavier's, Jawalakhel was <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> full-fledged high school.|$|R

5|$|The {{literary}} Dracula transforms into a bat {{several times}} in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of Dracula followed the novel in having Dracula <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bat, as did the film, where Béla Lugosi would transform into a bat. The bat transformation scene was used again by Lon Chaney Jr. in 1943's Son of Dracula.|$|E
5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{had been}} looking for someone to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> martyr for the Nazi cause. His first attempt was with Albert Leo Schlageter, a member of the Freikorps and a saboteur who was caught {{attempting}} to blow up a train in the Ruhr region while it was under occupation by French troops in retaliation Germany's not making its schedule of reparation payments. Schlageter was executed by the French, and his gravesite later became a Nazi shrine. There were also the 16 Nazis who had died during the Beer Hall Putsch, and would have a memorial built for them in Munich which was required to be saluted when passing by, and who were honored with a public ceremony every year when the Putsch was remembered.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{new line}} which {{features}} robot versions of various Marvel Comics superheroes (and later more of the Star Wars Transformers figures once it merged with this line). Confirmed figures are Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Venom and Hulk. Hulk <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tank while Iron Man <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> jet. Spider-Man becomes <b>a</b> helicopter, Wolverine <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> 4WD, Venom <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> turbocharged retro car. They {{are not to be}} confused with the Marvel Megamorphs toy line, which also featured transformable mecha piloted by the superheroes. Eventually, the Star Wars Transformers figure joined the line with reissues of previous figures, as well as all new molds.|$|R

5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all the files of the former communist secret police. Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{notes that}} he was {{surprised}} {{they were allowed to}} do the pickle gag, which consisted of Stewie placing a cucumber on the sofa where Patrick's imaginary wife is sitting, but inserting it into her imaginary vagina (to see if it would <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pickle), but suggests that maybe broadcasting standards did not fully understand the scene. The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers. The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George W. Bush is portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E
5|$|Many {{years prior}} to the game's events, the world was {{controlled}} by King , who ruled the kingdom bearing his name. Originally a kind man, a spell to bring his people prosperity drained his goodness, causing him to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> vicious dictator who declared war on the rest of Erion. During his conquests, the Cauldron went wild and destroyed the kingdom in a single night — everyone was cursed and transformed into Pookas, while Valentine's kingdom was reduced to a wasteland. In the aftermath of Valentine's fall, Ragnanival and Ringford had become Erion's most powerful nations, while the other nations have become weak in comparison. At the game's opening, Ragnanival and Ringford are at war over the possession of the Cauldron in the wasteland of Valentine, as each see the Cauldron as too dangerous for the other to possess.|$|E
50|$|Isabel Lucas as Alison Bromley. Charles' estranged daughter, {{forcibly}} <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> vampire by Frankie. She rejected {{her father}} and <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> subsider after drinking her own blood. Her death caused Frankie to have an epiphany and change sides.|$|R
50|$|It {{is home to}} {{a medieval}} rocca (fortress), <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> palace, called the Rocca Meli Lupi. It has 16th century frescoes by Cesare Baglione, {{possibly}} Niccolò dell'Abbate, and others. The surrounding park was <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> English garden around 1820.|$|R
25|$|Belle, however, is not {{oblivious}} to her peers' views of her. She voices her {{concerns about it}} to her eccentric father and inventor, Maurice who assures her that she is anything but strange ("No Matter What"). The two then put {{the finishing touches on}} his invention and Maurice heads off to an invention fair donning a scarf knitted for him by Belle ("No Matter What {Reprise]"), but becomes lost in the woods and attacked by a pack of wolves. After surviving a wolf attack, he enters the Beast's castle where the servants, including Lumière, <b>a</b> maître d' <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> candelabra, Cogsworth, the head of household <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> clock, Babette, <b>a</b> maid <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> feather duster that still seems to retain her flirtatious tendencies, Mrs. Potts, the head of the kitchen <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> teapot, and Chip, her son <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> teacup. They welcome him, but the horrid Beast arrives and locks Maurice away in the dungeon for trespassing.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1785, the {{government}} had taken possession of Southsea Common, the marshland surrounding the castle, to ensure it remained open and accessible to the fort's guns, and convicts were deployed to fill in and flatten out the marshes from 1831 onwards. The surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre; seaside facilities were established {{at the start of}} the century and in the 1840s new private housing was built around the edge of the common, used by military and naval officers. The construction of a railway line from London enabled the settlement of Southsea, named after the castle, to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> prosperous resort. Southsea Common was leased by the local government in 1884 and, as the population grew, practising firing the castle's guns became more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{considered}} for development by WayForward Technologies {{as far back}} as 1997. An archived version of the company's official website showcases a very different approach to the game, which was at the time considered for development on PC or PlayStation, in full 3D with traditionally animated characters moving before a 3D background. Shantae was presented as a troubled genie born without magic powers, who had to save the world from the Jins, powerful beings once sealed who escaped {{at the beginning of the}} game and planned to drain all magic from the world. Back then, her magic was capable, as envisioned by Erin Bozon, the original creator of the character, to summon animals, but transformation was already planned as Shantae could <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> harpy. Her dances could also launch attacks and she had different outfits with different characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The regular {{gameplay}} {{features a}} third-person perspective, where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally. Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> morph ball, which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay {{is similar to}} early Metroid titles, the game's environments are three-dimensional and movement {{is not limited to}} a two-dimensional plane. When the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches into a first-person perspective, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.|$|E

5|$|Early Greek {{sources have}} it that Philomela was <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> swallow, {{which has no}} song; Procne <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> nightingale, singing a {{beautiful}} but sad song in remorse. Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was tongueless, Philomela was <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> nightingale, and Procne <b>into</b> <b>a</b> swallow. Eustathius' {{version of the story}} has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.|$|R
