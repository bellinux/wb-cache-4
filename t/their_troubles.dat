5|$|The trio {{receive a}} warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The {{visitors}} are allowed to stay the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young Maharaja, Zalim Singh. Chattar Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient Thuggee cult is responsible for <b>their</b> <b>troubles.</b> Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is amiss. They discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room {{and set out to}} explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} been the site of several major {{accidents}} involving locomotives. In 1843, the Sloatsburg station {{was the site of}} a large accident by train full of milk bottles. On December 31, 1855, the railroad's Cincinnati Express was thrown off the tracks near the Sloatsburg station, when it tried to avoid a countrymen and his four mules, who were crossing the tracks. Three of the mules were killed and mutilated by the train, while the fourth died soon after. There was no damage to the cars or injuries to the passengers. In the early days of August 1856, a girl by the name of McGraff was injured by an oncoming train near the station after carelessly walking onto the tracks. The parents, who were in a poor state financially, was given $45 (1856 USD) in return for <b>their</b> <b>troubles</b> from the Board of Directors in nearby Goshen. On February 21, 1858, a train heading southbound experienced an accident when a brakeman, John Freeland, fell off the train and was run over. Freeland's legs were severed in the incident, and one arm was broken. They hurried Freeland southbound on a nearby train, but died by the time the train reached Paterson, New Jersey towards the hospital.|$|E

25|$|The defenders' {{position}} on Kos, never enviable, soon became serious and, presently, desperate, for the Italian anti-aircraft defence was negligible {{and their own}} resources meagre. To add to <b>their</b> <b>troubles,</b> the area round the airfield they had to protect was too rocky to permit digging in, {{and there was no}} time to build blast walls before the enemy was upon them. The air attacks were so severe that casualties inflicted on the British paratroopers forced them to be withdrawn on 25 September.|$|E

In exchange, the family cares for the sick Arpon while Paifu, Jos√© and Maruyama take off for the forest. Before they leave, they are told by the family of the forest monster's supposed weakness, whistling.|$|E

She combines the more violent characteristics of both and those who ask for or accept her ministrations think nothing at being cursed loudly at the very instant of being tenderly fed, clothed, nursed, or guided through <b>their</b> <b>troubles.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{historian}} by training, {{he wrote}} A Just Measure of Pain, {{a history of}} prisons during the Industrial Revolution. His biography of Isaiah Berlin reveals the strong impression the celebrated philosopher made on Ignatieff. Philosophical writings by Ignatieff include The Needs of Strangers and The Rights Revolution. The latter work explores social welfare and community, and shows Berlin's influence on Ignatieff. These tie closely to Ignatieff's political writings on national self-determination and the imperatives of democratic self-government. Ignatieff has also written extensively on international affairs. His historical memoir, The Russian Album, traces his family's life in Russia and <b>their</b> <b>troubles</b> and subsequent emigration {{as a result of}} the Bolshevik Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Before leaving London, Harrison had {{arranged}} to disembark in Delhi with Aspinall {{and buy a}} top-quality sitar there. During the tour, the other Beatles had each decided to join the pair, although, after <b>their</b> <b>troubles</b> in Manila, all of the band {{would have preferred to}} return to London immediately. Their plane landed at night at Delhi's Palam Airport. While the Beatles had assumed that they were unknown in India, they were welcomed by a crowd of 500 fans and journalists and forced to give a brief press conference. The group's two-day stay in Delhi similarly came to resemble the stops throughout the tour in terms of media attention and periods of confinement in their hotel, the Oberoi.|$|E
25|$|Departing Newport on 1 June, Benham and {{the rest}} of Destroyer Division 242 (DesDiv242) steamed south, passed through the Panama Canal, and crossed the Pacific Ocean to Japan. There, she spent several months {{training}} and patrolling with the 7th Fleet. One such patrol took place in the South China Sea after two Chinese communist Lavochkin La. 7 fighters shot down an Air Cathay passenger airplane in late July, killing half of the 18 passengers on board. On 25 July, while Benham searched for survivors, two Chinese fighters attacked nearby American fighters and were promptly splashed for <b>their</b> <b>troubles.</b> The destroyer also conducted antisubmarine training exercises with friendly submarines off Okinawa. Following a two-week yard period at Sasebo, Japan, the destroyer sailed for home in October. She visited Hong Kong and Singapore first, then sailed into the Indian Ocean before stopping at Ceylon and Aden. Other port visits included Naples, Barcelona, Gibraltar, and the Azores before she finally arrived in Newport on 18 December.|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} his work of reform, Solon surrendered his extraordinary authority {{and left the}} country. According to Herodotus the country was bound by Solon to maintain his reforms for 10 years, whereas according to Plutarch {{and the author of}} the Athenian Constitution (reputedly Aristotle) the contracted period was instead 100 years. A modern scholar considers the time-span given by Herodotus to be historically accurate because it fits the 10 years that Solon was said to have been absent from the country. Within 4 years of Solon's departure, the old social rifts re-appeared, but with some new complications. There were irregularities in the new governmental procedures, elected officials sometimes refused to stand down from their posts and occasionally important posts were left vacant. It has even been said that some people blamed Solon for <b>their</b> <b>troubles.</b> Eventually one of Solon's relatives, Peisistratos, ended the factionalism by force, thus instituting an unconstitutionally gained tyranny. In Plutarch's account, Solon accused Athenians of stupidity and cowardice for allowing this to happen.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{ingredients}} are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, {{such as the}} Piledriver or Blue Fairy. To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice. Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be {{different from what they}} order. For example, a character might be feeling depressed and ask for a sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget <b>their</b> <b>troubles</b> would have a better effect. Alternately, the player may {{be able to make a}} character happy by talking to them instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism. At various points, the player can also tweak the customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic. In these ways, the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.|$|E
25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates <b>their</b> <b>troubles</b> for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants‚Äô wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E

500|$|The poem is in {{the form}} of a speech from an unnamed speaker - {{possibly}} Sappho herself - to an addressee, whose identity is uncertain. [...] The speaker criticises the addressee for repeating that Charaxos will return safely, instead maintaining that his safety {{is in the}} hands of the gods and offering to pray to Hera for his return. [...] She then switches [...] her focus from Charaxos to Larichos, whom she hopes will relieve the family from <b>their</b> <b>troubles</b> when he grows up and becomes a man.|$|E

[...] This action and later ones by Brant and Butler contributed to {{the decision by the}} Continental Congress to authorize a major Continental Army expedition into Iroquois territory. [...] Commanded by Generals John Sullivan and James Clinton, the 1779 expedition systematically destroyed the villages of Iroquois tribes fighting for the British, but did little to stop the frontier war.|$|E

[...] Fitzpatrick noted other MCU tie-ins in the same episode [...] "never felt particularly labored, but rather lived-in with a world that stretches back to Agent Carter-era Stark tech, drops the odd Daredevil Easter Egg, and helps contextualize a world where heroes create country-dropping robots....A topical bent like tonight's [...] "Watchdogs" [...] made for a great angle to build up that world mentality without feeling particularly subservient to the movies." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{interest}} in portraying [...] "actual human drama" [...] has led Moore to these roles. She is particularly {{moved by the}} concept of an individual repressing <b>their</b> <b>troubles</b> and striving to maintain dignity. Parts where the character achieves an amazing feat are of little interest to her, because [...] "we're just not very often in that position in our lives." [...] Early in her career, Moore established a reputation for pushing boundaries, and she continues to be praised for her [...] "fearless" [...] performances and for taking on difficult roles. When asked if there are any roles she has avoided, she replied, [...] "Nothing within the realm of human behaviour." [...] She is known for her willingness to perform nude and appear in sex scenes, although she has said she will only do so if she feels it fits the role.|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} datelined May 4, {{entitled}} [...] "Anarchy‚Äôs Red Hand", The New York Times had described the incident as the [...] "bloody fruit" [...] of [...] "the villainous {{teachings of the}} Anarchists."

The journalist George Frederic Parsons wrote a piece for The Atlantic Monthly in which he identified the fears of middle-class Americans concerning labor radicalism, and asserted that the workers had only themselves to blame for <b>their</b> <b>troubles.</b> Edward Aveling remarked, [...] "If these men are ultimately hanged, {{it will be the}} Chicago Tribune that has done it."

500|$|For the 109 English captives, {{the raid}} {{was only the}} {{beginning}} of <b>their</b> <b>troubles.</b> The raiders intended to take them to Canada, a [...] journey, in the middle of winter. [...] Many of the captives were ill-prepared for this, and the raiders were short on provisions. The raiders consequently engaged in a common practice: they killed those captives when it was clear they were unable to keep up. Williams commented on the savage cruelty of the Indian raiders; although most killings were [...] "not random or wanton," [...] none of those killed would have [...] "needed to" [...] be killed had they not been taken in the first place. [...] Most (though not all) of the slain were the slow and vulnerable who could not keep up with the party and would likely have died less quickly en route. [...] Only 89 of the captives survived the ordeal. Survival chances correlated with age and gender: infants and young children fared the worst, and older children and teenagers (all 21 of whom survived the ordeal) fared the best. [...] Adult men fared better than adult women, especially pregnant women, and those with small children.|$|E
