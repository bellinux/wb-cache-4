5|$|Naim Frashëri, a {{prominent}} Albanian poet, wrote of how <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> of Krujë had saved Europe from Ottoman invasion. Today, Albanians {{take pride in}} the actions performed during <b>the</b> <b>siege.</b> The Skanderbeg Museum, in Krujë, has many commemorations to <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> and the film Skënderbeu (1953) stages <b>the</b> <b>siege.</b> It is {{the setting of the}} novel <b>The</b> <b>Siege</b> by Albanian writer Ismail Kadare.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>siege</b> was the {{inspiration}} for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock's original 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much; the whole story was heavily fictionalised in the 1960 film <b>The</b> <b>Siege</b> of Sidney Street. <b>The</b> <b>siege</b> was also the fictional inspiration for two novels, <b>The</b> <b>Siege</b> of Sidney Street (1960) by F Oughton and A Death Out of Season (1973) by Emanuel Litvinoff.|$|E
5|$|Commonwealth's cavalry, {{including}} the Winged Hussars, significantly restricted Russian mobility, {{forcing them to}} stay in their trenches. In a series of fierce engagements, Commonwealth forces gradually overran the Russian field fortifications, and <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> reached its final stages by late September. On 28 September 1633, Commonwealth forces took the main Russian supply points, and by 4 October <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> had broken.|$|E

5|$|Philip began <b>the</b> <b>siege,</b> but was {{frustrated}} {{in his attempt}} to take it, and <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> dragged on for nearly a year. During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> when he was hit by an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each. Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have been the result of the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Siege</b> of Boston (April 19, 1775 – March 17, 1776) was {{the opening}} {{phase of the}} American Revolutionary War.

Both sides had to deal with resource supply and personnel issues over the course of <b>the</b> <b>siege.</b> British resupply and reinforcement activities were limited to sea access. After eleven months of <b>the</b> <b>siege,</b> the British abandoned Boston by sailing to Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>siege</b> {{lasted for}} four months, {{during which time}} one-third of the Portuguese troops either died (mainly from the plague) or deserted. The arrival of a relief army, under King Philip IV of Spain's {{favorite}} don Luis de Haro in October, lifted <b>the</b> <b>siege.</b> Mendes de Vasconcelos, the Portuguese commander, was stripped of his rank and imprisoned for his failure.|$|E
5|$|The success {{led to a}} {{much more}} ambitious {{offensive}} operation named Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star) {{less than two weeks}} later. That operation had the aim of decisively defeating Army Group North, lifting <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> altogether, but it achieved only minimal progress. Soviet forces made several other attempts in 1943 to renew their offensive and completely lift <b>the</b> <b>siege,</b> but made only modest gains in each one. The corridor remained in range of German artillery and <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> was only over on January 27, 1944.|$|E
5|$|Thucydides {{provides}} a succinct {{list of the}} main events occurring {{between the end of}} the second Persian invasion and the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, but almost no chronological information. Various attempts have been made to reassemble the chronology, but there is no definitive answer. The assumption central to these attempts is that Thucydides is describing the events in the appropriate chronological order. The one firmly accepted date is 465 BC for the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>Siege</b> of Thasos. This is based on an ancient scholiast's annotation of a copy of Aeschines's works. The scholiast notes that the Athenians met disaster at the 'Nine-Ways' in the archonship of Lysitheus (known to be 465/464 BC). Thucydides mentions this attack on the 'Nine-Ways' in connection with the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>Siege</b> of Thasos, and since Thucydides says that <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> ended in its third year, <b>the</b> <b>Siege</b> of Thasos therefore dates to c.465463 BC.|$|E

5|$|After Henry's death, the Welsh {{attempted}} {{to drive out}} the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. Pain was with King Stephen at <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> to more easily monitor his actions, and {{to prevent him from}} defecting to Matilda's cause.|$|E
5|$|After Richard's death, King John of England {{failed to}} {{effectively}} defend Normandy against Philip's ongoing campaigns between 1202 and 1204. Château de Falaise fell to Philip's forces, {{as well as}} castles from Mortain to Pontorson while Philip simultaneously besieged Rouen, which capitulated to French forces on 24June 1204, effectively ending Norman independence. Philip laid siege to Château Gaillard, which was captured after a long siege from September 1203 to March 1204. As Philip continued <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> throughout the winter and King John {{made no attempt to}} relieve the castle, {{it was only a matter}} of time before the castellan was forced to capitulate. The main source for <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> is Philippidos, a poem by William the Breton, Philip's chaplain. As a result, modern scholars have paid little attention to the fate of the civilians of Les Andelys during <b>the</b> <b>siege.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, the British {{attempted to}} make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon <b>the</b> <b>siege,</b> some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted <b>the</b> <b>siege</b> and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.|$|E
