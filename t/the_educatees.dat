40|$|Learning is an unending, {{abstract}} and invisible process that permeates everyone’s life, whether young or old, rich or poor, educated or illiterate. Learning {{is also an}} embodiment of education which transcends the four-walls of the classroom. Therefore, education is an added knowledge to one’s existing knowledge {{which is expected to}} lead to behavioral modification on the part of <b>the</b> <b>educatee,</b> whose efficiency and performance in his/her daily activities should consequently improve positively. In the same vein, mentoring has a multi-faceted dimension, not limited only to the education industry but also includes all other aspects of human development process. Therefore, this paper analyses the varying dimensions of mentoring phenomenon which may be characterized by flexibility of learning process among different groups of people in any given society. The totality of such a learning encounter through mentoring process is aimed at achieving an all-round development of an individual, whether such is from cognitive, psychomotor or affective domain...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{attainment}} of effective education by <b>the</b> <b>educatee</b> is hinged on the balancing of the workload {{and the teaching}} staff strength (TSS) in schools. The interplay was the rallying point of this study which tried to ascertain the level of workload and teaching staff strength (TSS) in public senior secondary schools. Six (6) research questions were posed as guide with the questionnaire as a base instrument for data collection from the principals of the 18 public senior secondary schools in Onelga. Analysis of data on teacher-students ratio reveal that 11 schools representing 61 % have a ratio above 1 : 40 and 7 schools representing 39 % have a ratio below 1 : 40 as enshrined in the FRN (2004). The class size indicates that 7 schools have moderate class sizes whereas 11 schools have excess class sizes. Consequently the workload data analysis reveals that all the schools exceeded the 15 weekly periods per teaching staff with 17 % having 18 - 23 while 83 % having 24 - 30 per teacher per week. Female teachers occupied 21 % and male teachers occupied 79 % {{of the total population}} of 152. The implication is that excess workload will affect the output been churned into the tertiary institutions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{natural use}} of ICT, {{including}} modern social networks and open information sources by today's generation of pupils and students is a generally recognized fact, which stimulated {{the development of}} a new concept of learning theory based on the potential of modern information and communication technologies. It was designated as connectivism. The key aspect of teaching thus conceived is the creation and the maintenance of interconnection on the network, expanding the knowledge base of the individual beyond his or her own capacity. That is why constructivist methods, involving the process of active social learning have been gradually applied recently in order to build a proper learning network and to internalize basic knowledge structures, including further deepening of the knowledge gained, by <b>the</b> <b>educatee.</b> Within this context, a wide scale of questions arise as to how and to what extend the pupil‘s and student‘s cognitive process is influenced by modern information and communication technologies and tools, conversely, how these technologies are used by pupils and students to build their own learning networks and to internalize their knowledge structure. To be able to, at least partially, answer some of those questions, we carried out a survey research aimed at the explanation of the procedures and tools which pupils and students use in order to build their own learning networks and to internalize their knowledge structures based on a generic model of knowledge construction. Subsequently, a classification of pupils and students shall be carried out based on the said explanation. The submitted paper presents some of the partial results of the aforementioned survey...|$|R

O desenvolvimento da Sequência Didática na rede social Facebook, oportuniza ao professor o acompanhamento diário das atividades, podendo, assim, orientar o educando a qualquer momento. Este trabalho envolverá, somente, as partes que se referem à produção textual escrita do referido gênero, seguindo os descritores do Conteúdo Básico Comum (CBC) Ensino Médio Língua Portuguesa do Estado de Minas Gerais (MINAS GERAIS, 2006). O problema que motivou a pesquisa foram os resultados insatisfatórios apresentados nas redações do Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio ENEM de 2012 das escolas da rede estadual de Minas Gerais e o distanciamento desses resultados com o das escolas particulares, que são bem maiores, em relação às escolas públicas. O objetivo desta pesquisa é oferecer subsídios, ao professor de Língua Portuguesa, para desenvolver uma Sequência Didática utilizando a rede social Facebook. Especificamente, objetiva-se que os professores a partir desta proposta possam desenvolver novas práticas pedagógicas utilizando as tecnologias disponíveis, contribuindo assim para a formação integral do educando. Metodologicamente, trata-se de uma pesquisa de caráter qualitativo, na qual os dados foram analisados à luz da teoria do Interacionismo Sociodiscursivo, sobretudo das concepções particularmente atribuídas a Dolz, Norerraz e Schneuwly (2004) e Bronckart (1999), dada a influência destes pesquisadores em alguns dos documentos governamentais como: Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais (BRASIL, 2000), PCN+ (BRASIL, 2002), Orientações Curriculares para o Ensino Médio OCEM (BRASIL, 2006) e Conteúdo Básico Comum (MINAS GERAIS, 2006). This essay {{shows up}} {{the development of}} didatic sequence (SD) proposed by the material of studant book `high school in web- didatic sequence- opinion article from the State of Sao Paulo provincy, involving the social network Facebook. The development of didatic sequence in the social network Facebook provides opportunities for the teachers to follow the daily activities, being able to, with that, oriantate <b>the</b> <b>educatee</b> at any moment. This job will involve just the section that refers to the textual production writed of the refered genre, following the descriptors of the common basic contents (CBC) - high school - portuguese language from the State of Minas Gerais (MINAS GERAIS, 2006). The issue that motivated the search were the unsatisfactory results exhibited on {{the writings of the}} nacional test of high school - ENEM of 2012, from the staduals schools of Minas Gerais and the gap among those results and the results of particular schools, which are far higher in relation to public schools. The objective of this search is to offer subsidies to the portuguese teachers in order to develop a didatic sequence using the social network Facebook. Specifically, the objective is that teachers who are following these proposals could develop new pedagogical practices making use of available technology, giving a contribution to the full formation of <b>the</b> <b>educatee.</b> Methodologically, this is a research of qualitative character, in which the data were analyzed from the Interactionism Socio Discourse theory, principally about conceptions particularly attributed to Dolz, Norerraz and Schneuwly (2004) and Bronckart (1999), given the influence of these researchers on several government documents such as: Parameters National Curriculum (BRAZIL, 2000), PCN + (BRAZIL, 2002), Curriculum Guidelines for Teaching Middle OCEM (BRAZIL, 2006) and Common Basic Contents (MINAS, 2006...|$|R
40|$|I {{agree with}} Paulo Freire in that {{literacy}} {{education is not}} merely a process designed for reading letters and words but for reading the world. As he knew the social character of learning language, he never agreed with the opinion that we can separate the political struggle and literacy education movement. The neutrality of education prefer the language of educator rather than <b>educatee,</b> so <b>the</b> educational method is just pouring the words into <b>the</b> head of <b>educatee.</b> <b>The</b> participants of the cultural circle critically analyzed the myth of their society they lived in. They realized that they are not unable, insincere, and lazy in the cultural circle. They dreamed a new world where they are respected by the people, and can practice literacy process and political struggle for freedom. I hope the educational philosophy of Paulo Freire will not be forgotten in our country even though the period of illiterate person was gone. The important message he gave to us is the politics of education should be recognized by the educators, and the educational movement should be practiced with social change. For this purpose, I wrote about the coordinator, participant, and educational content of the cultural circle in ‘Brazil’ and ‘Sao Tome and Principe’...|$|R

Research materials: Published and unpublished sources: books of official orders in the Russian state, chronicles, acts, diplomatic documents, archaeological data, etc. Results and novelty of the research: Up to now {{the institution of}} atalykship has not been practically studied. The authors attempted to consider this phenomenon on {{the example of the}} Crimean, Siberian and Kazan khanates and the Nogai Horde. Evidence of the presence of atalyks {{in the service of the}} Chinggisids in Russia was also taken into account. The authors managed to show that atalyks represented a complex and multifaceted tool in the struggle of the khans with the heads of the els (clans) they controlled. The status of atalyk was based solely on the personal loyalty and affection between <b>the</b> educator and <b>educatee.</b> However, this relationship was beneficial to both sides. A Chinggisid received the faithful conductor of his policy, ready to fulfill his most delicate mission. For his part, the tutor automatically raised his social and material status and helped his relatives’ careers. This, in turn, helped the khan to curb the claims of clan elites. The phenomenon under consideration had many regional features throughout the entire Desht-i Kipchak’s space. We consider the emergence and development of the institution of atalykship on the example of the Crimean khanate. However, this example can not be considered standard. It can not be automatically applied to other territories. Over time, new documents will be found. This will substantially supplement information on this phenomenon in other regions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study: “A Critical Analysis of Interventionist Theatre Strategies: A Case Study of Hisia, Lumumba and Mlimani Performers Theatre Groups in Dar es Salaam” {{attempts}} {{to explore how}} interventionist strategies are framed to make them communicate specific messages to specific target communities. Through this exploration we expect to map out what might be considered as appropriate strategies that would be deployed in communicating HIV/Aids issues and messages more effectively. This study is motivated by the realisation {{that there has been}} inadequate focus by previous studies on youth intervention theatre strategies in Dar es Salaam particularly and Tanzania in general. Our study employed qualitative research in order to acquire in-depth understanding of how the three groups in Dar es Salaam deploy techniques of applied theatre in their HIV/Aids intervention initiatives. The methods utilised included observation and structured interviews. The study was theoretically guided by the ideas of Augusto Boal and Paulo Freire. Freire demonstrates how the marginalised populations regain their lost voices through dialogue and problem-posing education, a situation whereby the roles of <b>the</b> educators and <b>educatees</b> are flexible and interchangeable. The study also draws heavily from Boal, especially his argument that lack of power creates fears in peoples’ heads, what he describes as cops in our heads. Boal believes that all the cops in our heads have identities and headquarters in the external world that need to be located. This is one way in which oppressed people can confront their internalised forms of oppression. If we are to draw an analogy from Boal, the HIV/Aids conditions that disempower infected people can be interpreted as an oppressive situation. The findings of this study reveal weaknesses in the methods which are deployed by the applied theatre practitioners in HIV/Aids intervention initiatives. This study therefore suggests a rethinking in the way that intervention theatre practices are framed to make them become more effective tools of communicating issues and messages related to HIV and AIDS...|$|R

In the 2 nd article titled as “SERVANT LEADERSHIP THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING: A Case Study” is mentioned in context, study explored the influence a distance learning servant leadership course had on the emergency service students’ understanding of leadership. The research study utilized a case study design in order to tell the story of the lived experiences of the participants. The setting for the study was a state university in Utah, with the six participants being declared, undergraduate emergency services majors that underwent a 15 -week distance learning servant leadership class. The literature review acknowledged the problem of bureaucracy within the emergency services and identified the practice of servant leadership as a possibility for overcoming the often-bureaucratic approach towards leadership. In addition, the literature review identified commonalities between established constructs of servant leadership and the emergency services. The findings of the study seem to demonstrate that undergoing a class on servant leadership left lasting impressions on becoming a servant leader and overall was a positive experience for the student. This study’s findings add to the existing body of knowledge associated with servant leadership within emergency service academia. The 3 rd article from India which is written on “ETHICAL ISSUES IN OPEN ANDDISTANCE EDUCATION WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO EXPECTATIONS AND REALITY”, written by S. N. Vikram RAJ URS (Coresponding Author), T. S. HARSHA and Vijay RAJU B P. This current study investigated that distance learner may be suffering from a sense of isolation as he/she makes a return to study after a gap of time or while working. It is there that the distance educator makes a positive, ethical and interventionist role by helping the student to learn beyond the stereotypical classroom situation and can act effectively as the friend, philosopher and guide of the learner. Thus practicing what you preach is the moto of ethics in distance. Some of the more important ethical concerns associated with open and distance learning are not those that may be faced by learners. Instead, the challenges faced by those that design ODL or use it in their teaching can be seen as increasingly important. These challenges include globalization, which has emphasized instrumental rather than social aims of education, and the use of cognitive rather than affective pedagogies. For ODL designers and teachers, this has resulted in a concentration on cognitive tasks and market-driven aspects of open and distance learning at the expense of the social harmony that might otherwise be achieved. The overarching ethical concern for ODL practitioners should be to implement an appropriate pedagogy that will satisfy both instrumental and social aims. While this can be achieved, in part, through the use of the pedagogies outlined in this paper, the problem is seen as being associated with deeply interwoven social and cultural contexts. Consequently, there is a greater responsibility for all ODL practitioners to ensure that the choices that they make are ethical at all times, irrespective of the demands of any employer, institution or authority. This paper deals with ethics in general, its role in distance education and its significance to educational institutions. The fourth article written on “E-LEARNING CHANGE MANAGEMENT: Challenges and opportunities” and written Alaattin PARLAKKILIC Departmant of Medical Informatics Gülhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey. His paper discusses change management in transition to e-learning system considering pedagogical, cost and technical implications. It also discusses challenges and opportunities for integrating these technologies in higher learning institutions with examples from Turkey GATA (Gülhane Askeri Tıp Akademisi-Gülhane Military Medical Academy. The 5 th article is arrived from again from Turkey which is written on “ Investigating Distance Education Students’ Study Skills”, written by Cengiz POYRAZ, From Hasan Ali Yucel Educational Faculty Department of Educational Sciences, Istanbul University, Istanbul He emhasis in his study that distance education, students and instructors reside in different locations. Students can learn at their pace and control their learning path, content and load of what they have learned and evaluate it. However, they should adopt strategies for effective studying in order not to waste their time and efforts. Because study skills, motivation, time management, exam preparation and coping with exam stress have an impact on students’ success. In this context, distance education students’ study skills are foregrounded in today’s widespread use of distance education. In accordance with this, this study aims to investigate some variables which are influential on the dimensions of distance education students’ motivation, time management, exam preparation and coping with exam stress. A personal information form and the Study Skills scale were used for data collection. This study was designed in survey model and SPSS 16. 0 statistical package program was used for the statistical analyses of the research data. The research findings were discussed in line with the literature and some suggestions were presented for further research and researchers. 6 th article is from United Arab Emirates-UAE. Article is titled as “USING SOCIAL MEDIA (BLOG) IN THE CLASSROOM: Reflecting Lecturer’s Pedagogical Approach and Students (In-Service Teachers) Intrinsic Motivation”, written by Dr. Enas S. ABULIBDEH. This study was designed in a qualitative approach mainly to explore the extent of interest and enjoyment students experienced during an intensive ICT course. Blog was used as a medium for reflection during the class where students posted their creations of videos, posters and other ICT materials. The three needs investigated were namely autonomy, competence, and relatedness support. The researcher further examined on students’ awareness of the usefulness of the ICT skill they learned and how much they can use the blog for teaching and learning. Based on the Basic Psychological Needs Theory framework (BPNT), this study has adopted the direct observation, journal entry, and interviews as a triangulation approach. 7 th article is from from Sought Africa, “Linking Emotional Intelligence t Achieve Technology Enhanced Learning In Higher Education” nd written by dr. Janette kruger and prof. Dr. A. Seugnet bliignaut. This research explores and describes links between emotional intelligence and faculty’s ability to cope with new learning technologies. The purposive sampling comprised ten participants who completed a set of e-activities. A mixed methods approach triangulated the findings which provided insight into the coping tactics participants used to accomplish tel for odl. Five trends emerged: perception of adequate ability, cognitive decision making; perception of stressful situations; emotional disclosure; and social networking. Although the study identified links between emotional intelligence and coping strategies, the interdependency of coping strategies and emotional intelligence remains elusive. The 8 th article is titled as “THE IMPACT OF DISTANCE EDUCATION On HigHER EUCATION: A Case Study of the United States”, written by Gail D. CARUTH (Corresponding Author), Department of Educational Leadership Texas A&M University-Commerce, Commerce, Texas USA and Donald L. CARUTH Independent Management Consultant, Texas USA. This study used a qualitative case study approach to examine the research to determine the impact of distance education on higher education in the United States. This look into the impact of distance education is significant to higher education because informed knowledge of the impact will provide insight into the effects of overall education in the United States. The researchers asked the following two exploratory questions: What happened during the evolution of distance education in the United States? What themes emerged over time? The findings suggested that the impact of distance education on higher education in the United States has been change. It can be anticipated that in the future changes will continue to occur. Consequently, higher education has to be prepared to teach about change and teach students how to handle change.

The purpose of the current study was to analyse the pre service teachers training programs for the distance learners of Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) Islamabad, Pakistan. This kind of training is provided to the future teachers enrolled to acquire pre service training to become a teacher in a Government educational institution in Pakistan. The data was collected by administering a 45 items agree disagree four points Likert type scale to the subjects mainly through the scheduled meetings during the workshops. The independent sample t-test, and one way ANOVA along with mean difference was worked out for the data set [...] A group of 490 student teachers were randomly selected from the regions of Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rahimyarkhan, Multan, and D. G. Khan Districts (Southern Punjab). The planning for training is made timely but lacking physical facilities remains dominant in trainings. Although training plays an important role in students learning yet it is considered just a routine activity which made it a useless exercise. Similarly, findings reveal that co-curricular activities and child psychology are those aspects which ignored in the training. Future studies may be aimed at comparing the training system of teachers with teacher training through other channels of formal system of governments.
