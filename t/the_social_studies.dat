There needs to be a review of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>study</b> curriculum to cater for knowledge, values and skills that are relevant to the 21 st century Solomon Island’s society.

Chief {{editor of the}} party organ, Il Lavoratore, and {{a key figure in}} <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Circle, Pittoni also founded the Workers Cooperative of Trieste, Istria and Friulia. His participation in such causes increased the cultural and educational prestige of socialism, solving many of the movement's teething problems, and helping to spread the cooperative ideals among the Slovene population. He conditioned affiliation to these cooperatives on the desegregation and inter-ethnic solidarity of candidate unions. He also campaigned for the establishment of Workers Club and an Italian university in Trieste.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, William Stark, an {{assistant}} principal of <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Department, was appointed acting principal.

However, when that effort failed, Stark was still not offered the job as principal. Stark said that if he wasn't officially offered the job by a certain date, he would take another position being offered to him elsewhere. When the deadline came and went, Stark accepted a job as principal of Manhasset High School. Many faculty and parents were upset that Stark was not appointed in a timely way and thus had left the school; Vincent Galasso agreed to an interim appointment for one term in 2001.|$|E

500|$|Multiple reviewers {{stressed}} the school's reliance on Neill as a charismatic figure, which begat doubts of the institution's general replicability. Sarah Crutis (The Times Literary Supplement) asked whether teachers {{would have the}} [...] "time, patience, and personality" [...] to use Neill's methods. [...] "Their extremes of endurance may sometimes sound masochistic", wrote D. W. Harding (New Statesman), and Richard E. Gross (<b>The</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies)</b> added that Neill's [...] "extremes ... go far beyond good sense". Danica Deutsch (Journal of Individual Psychology) concluded that the school's lessons curbed the child's sense of social responsibility and other society-preserving functions. Jacob Hechler (Child Welfare) said that what Neill described as love—a combination of [...] "caring and noninterference"—was very hard to bring to bear. The New Yorker called Neill [...] "a fiery crusader" [...] with [...] "deep understanding of children", and Morris Fritz Mayer (Social Service Review) read Neill as having the [...] "wrath and eloquence of a biblical prophet" [...] with a belief in children and [...] "unyielding attack against pathological and phony values in education" [...] that [...] "one cannot help admiring". Willard W. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) positioned Neill as closer to a psychotherapist than a teacher, especially as the philosophy undergirding Summerhill [...] "derives from Freud". Gene Phillips (The Annals of the American Academy) described Neill as the [...] "essential ingredient of the democratic ethic that ... America needs".|$|E

2500|$|The ACT ( [...] ; {{originally}} an abbreviation of American College Testing) college readiness {{assessment is}} a standardized test {{for high school}} achievement and college admissions in the United States produced by ACT, a nonprofit organization of the same name. It was first administered in November 1959 by Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test, now the SAT. The ACT originally consisted of four tests: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Natural Sciences. In 1989 however, <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> test was changed into a Reading section (which included a Social Studies subsection) and the Natural Sciences test was renamed the Science Reasoning test, with more emphasis on problem solving skills. In February 2005, an optional Writing test {{was added to the}} ACT, mirroring changes to the SAT that took place later in March of the same year. In 2013, ACT announced that students would be able to take the ACT by computer starting in the spring of 2015. The test will continue to be offered in the paper format for schools that are not ready to transition to computer testing.|$|E
2500|$|Polanyi's {{family moved}} from Germany to Britain in 1933, {{partly as a}} result of the {{persecution}} of Jews under Adolf Hitler (Polanyi's father, who converted to Catholicism, was born Jewish). During World War II, Polanyi's father sent him to Canada for three years when he was 11, so he would be safe from German bombings. While living in Toronto, he attended the University of Toronto Schools. [...] After returning to Britain, Polanyi finished high school and attended university at Manchester, where he received his undergraduate degree in 1949 and his PhD in 1952. Although his university education was focused in science, he was not convinced it was his calling after finishing high school, when he briefly considered a career as a poet. His father, Michael Polanyi, was a professor in the chemistry department during his first year of university, before transferring to a newly created position in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> department. Polanyi's supervisor during his graduate studies was Ernest Warhurst, a former student of his father's. After completing his PhD studies, Polanyi did postdoctoral research at the National Research Council in Ottawa, Ontario from 1952 until 1954, where he worked with Edgar William Richard Steacie. From 1954 until 1956, he was a research associate at Princeton University.|$|E
