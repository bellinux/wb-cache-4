25|$|In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King James I of England. Scotland's Peerage {{then became}} subject {{to many of}} the same {{principles}} as the English Peerage, though many peculiarities of Scottish law continue to apply to it today. Scotland, like England, had lesser and greater barons, as well as earls. There was but one Duke in Scotland: the Duke of Rothesay, the heir-apparent to the Crown. The weak nature of the Scottish Crown had permitted the lesser feudal barons to continue attending the Scottish Estates, or Parliament, until the fifteenth century. Thereafter, only Earls and Lords of Parliament (the greater barons) came to be summoned to the Estates. In Scotland, the peerage remained tied to land until after <b>the</b> <b>Union.</b> <b>Every</b> earldom or lordship of Parliament was accompanied by a grant of land; sometimes, peerages and their associated lands were surrendered in return for other peerages and lands. After <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> of <b>the</b> Crowns, however, the concept of the Peerage as a personal dignity, not a dignity affixed to land, became established in Scotland.|$|R
