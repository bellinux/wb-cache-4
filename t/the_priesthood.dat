5000|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), <b>the</b> patriarchal <b>priesthood</b> (or Abrahamic priesthood) is {{sometimes}} understood {{as one of}} types or [...] "orders" [...] of <b>priesthood.</b> <b>The</b> two commonly known orders are <b>the</b> Aaronic <b>priesthood</b> and <b>the</b> Melchizedek <b>priesthood.</b> <b>The</b> patriarchal <b>priesthood</b> {{should not be confused}} with the calling of the patriarch. <b>The</b> patriarchal <b>priesthood</b> is associated with the patriarchal order found in Mormonism and is especially connected with celestial marriage.|$|R

The other is <b>the</b> Aaronic <b>priesthood.</b> <b>The</b> Patriarchal <b>priesthood</b> which is sometimes confused as a separate priesthood is explained by Boyd K. Packer, Apostle of the LDS Church as: [...] "The patriarchal order is not a third, separate priesthood. Whatever relates to the patriarchal order is embraced in <b>the</b> Melchizedek <b>Priesthood.</b> 'All other authorities or offices in the church are appendages to [...] priesthood.' (D 107:5.) The patriarchal order {{is a part of}} <b>the</b> Melchizedek <b>Priesthood</b> which enables endowed and worthy men to preside over their posterity in time and eternity.". <b>The</b> Melchizedek <b>priesthood</b> is also referred to as <b>the</b> high <b>priesthood</b> of <b>the</b> holy order of God and <b>the</b> Holy <b>Priesthood,</b> after <b>the</b> Order of the Son of God, or simply as <b>the</b> high <b>priesthood.</b>|$|R

5|$|Castelli {{was born}} in Buenos Aires in 1764. He {{was the first of}} eight {{children}} born to a Venetian doctor, Ángel Castelli Salomón, and Josefa Villarino, who was a relative of Manuel Belgrano. He was trained by the Jesuits shortly before their expulsion, and attended the Real Colegio de San Carlos in Buenos Aires. As was customary, one of the children of the Castelli family was ordained into <b>the</b> <b>priesthood,</b> and Juan José was chosen for this. He was sent to study at the Colegio Monserrat, part of the University of Córdoba. He was influenced by the works of Voltaire and Diderot, and especially by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract. He was a fellow student of men who would later have influence in the public life of South America, including Saturnino Rodríguez Peña, Juan José Paso, Manuel Alberti, Pedro Medrano, and Juan Martínez de Rozas, among others. He focused on studying philosophy and theology, but when his father died in 1785, he abandoned his career in <b>the</b> <b>priesthood,</b> for which he felt no strong vocation.|$|E

50|$|The LDS Church propagates an all-male priesthood. All worthy LDS males receive <b>the</b> Aaronic <b>Priesthood</b> at age twelve.

50|$|Melchizedek priesthood quorums also {{engaged in}} {{recruiting}} members from <b>the</b> Aaronic <b>priesthood,</b> which further depleted {{the ranks of}} <b>the</b> lesser <b>priesthood.</b> Unlike today, {{it was not a}} requirement to hold <b>the</b> Aaronic <b>priesthood</b> before receiving <b>the</b> Melchizedek <b>priesthood,</b> so <b>the</b> recruiting by <b>the</b> higher <b>priesthood</b> included <b>the</b> unordained as well. Presiding Bishop Edward Hunter and Brigham Young both lamented over the rush to ordain men to be high priests or seventies and the subsequent difficulty in keeping <b>the</b> Aaronic <b>priesthood</b> ranks filled. As examples, in 1857, Francis M. Lyman and Rudger Clawson were both ordained as elders at age 16; Clarence Merrill was ordained as a seventy at age 16.|$|R

50|$|The Melchisedec Order {{consists}} of two main offices and several specialized offices within them. The two main offices are Elder and High Priest. At times the term elder is {{used to refer to}} all who are of the Melchisedec Order. In a more specific sense, the office of elder is sometimes viewed as an appendage to the office of high priest. The Melchisedec Order is theologically viewed (and often termed) as being <b>the</b> High <b>Priesthood,</b> but a distinction needs to be made between <b>the</b> High <b>Priesthood</b> and <b>the</b> Quorum of High Priests (see below). Elders (and seventies, see below) are not high priests, and therefore do not belong to the Quorum of High Priests, but are, as members of <b>the</b> Melchisedec <b>priesthood,</b> part of <b>the</b> High <b>Priesthood.</b> <b>The</b> President of the Church is also the President of <b>the</b> High <b>Priesthood,</b> which means that he holds presidency over elders. Other members of <b>the</b> High <b>Priesthood</b> have their own presidents, but are also under the President of the Church by virtue again of his role as President of <b>the</b> entire High <b>Priesthood.</b> Indirectly, <b>the</b> President of the Church also holds presidency over <b>the</b> entire Aaronic <b>priesthood,</b> through <b>the</b> Order of Bishops. Therefore, the President of the Church presides over <b>the</b> entire <b>priesthood</b> of <b>the</b> church, both administratively and spiritually.The Melchisedec Ministers are seen as ministers of mission and vision.|$|R

5|$|The Maya made meticulous {{observations}} of celestial bodies, patiently recording astronomical {{data on the}} movements of the sun, moon, Venus, and the stars. This information was used for divination, so Maya astronomy was essentially for astrological purposes. Maya astronomy did not serve to study the universe for scientific reasons, nor was it used to measure the seasons in order to calculate crop planting. It was rather used by <b>the</b> <b>priesthood</b> to comprehend past cycles of time, and project them into the future to produce prophecy. <b>The</b> <b>priesthood</b> refined observations and recorded eclipses of the sun and moon, and movements of Venus and the stars; these were measured against dated events in the past, on the assumption that similar events would occur in the future when the same astronomical conditions prevailed. Illustrations in the codices show that priests made astronomical observations using the naked eye, assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device. Analysis of the few remaining Postclassic codices has revealed that, at the time of European contact, the Maya had recorded eclipse tables, calendars, and astronomical knowledge that was more accurate at that time than comparable knowledge in Europe.|$|E

5|$|A temple needed {{many people}} to perform its rituals and support duties. Priests {{performed}} the temple's essential ritual functions, but in Egyptian religious ideology they were far {{less important than the}} king. As temple decoration illustrates, all ceremonies were, in theory, acts by the king, and priests merely stood in his place. The priests were therefore subject to the king's authority, and he had the right to appoint anyone he wished to <b>the</b> <b>priesthood.</b> In fact, in the Old and Middle Kingdoms most priests were government officials who left their secular duties for part of the year to serve the temple in shifts. Once <b>the</b> <b>priesthood</b> became more professional, the king seems to have used his power over appointments mainly for the highest-ranking positions, usually to reward a favorite official with a job or to intervene for political reasons in the affairs of an important cult. Lesser appointments he delegated to his vizier or to the priests themselves. In the latter case, the holder of an office named his own son as his successor, or the temple clergy conferred to decide who should fill an empty post. Priestly offices were extremely lucrative and tended to be held by the wealthiest and most influential members of Egyptian society, until Roman economic reforms reduced the temples’ resources.|$|E
