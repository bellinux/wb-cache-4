At the turn of the century, the majority of Greek immigrants migrated to the United States; from the 1950s to the 1970s, migration flowed towards other European countries, mainly the Federal Republic of Germany, where there was a labor shortage in the rebuilding process after the second world war. Additionally, about 65,000 Greeks sought refuge in former Soviet Bloc countries after the defeat of the left-wing forces in the Greek Civil War (1946-9).

The precipitation datasets concern daily totals recorded at 21 surface meteorological {{stations of the}} Hellenic National Meteorological Service, which are uniformly distributed over the Greek region. First and foremost, the application of Factor Analysis resulted in grouping the meteorological stations with similar variation in time. The main sub groups represent the northern, southern, western, eastern and central regions of Greece with common precipitation characteristics.

Low or negative correlations were also observed between the bacteriological indices and BOD and COD levels, thus strengthening the hypothesis that indicator bacteria mainly depend upon the origin of pollution rather than {{the amount of the}} organic load.

5000|$|The occupying powers' requisitions and {{outright}} plunder, {{the drop in}} agricultural production from wartime disruption, {{the breakdown of the}} country's distribution networks due to a combination damage to infrastructure, the collapse of the central government and the fragmentation of the country {{at the hands of the}} Axis, coupled with hoarding by farmers, led to a severe shortage of food in the major urban centres in the winter of 1941-42. Given that even in peacetime, Greece was dependent on imports of wheat to cover about a third of its annual needs, the Allied blockade of German-dominated Europe further exacerbated the situation, creating the conditions for the [...] "Great Famine" [...] (Μεγάλος Λιμός): in the greater Athens-Piraeus area alone, some 40,000 people died of starvation, and by the end of the Occupation [...] "it was estimated that the <b>total</b> population of <b>Greece</b> ... was 300,000 less than it should have been because of famine or malnutrition" [...] (P.

5000|$|In Greece the German {{occupation}} (April 1941 - October 1944) {{destroyed the}} economy through war reparations, plundering of the country's resources and hyper-inflation. In addition, the Germans left {{most of the}} country's infrastructure in ruins as they withdrew in 1944. As {{a result of an}} Allied blockade and German indifference to local needs, the first winter of the occupation was marked by widespread famine in the main urban centres, with as many as 300,000 civilians dead from starvation. Although these levels of starvation were not repeated in the following years, malnourishment was common throughout the occupation. In addition, thousands more were executed by German forces as reprisals for partisan activities. As part of the Holocaust, Greece's Jewish community was almost wiped out, especially the large Sephardi community of Thessaloniki, which had earned the city the sobriquet [...] "Mother of Israel" [...] and had first settled there in the early 16th century at the invitation of the then-ruling Ottoman Empire.

50|$|The {{destruction}} of the Phocian cities and the heavy fine imposed on the Phocian confederation certainly caused the Phocians to bear a grudge against Philip II. Seven years later the Locrians brought charges against the Athenians in the amphictyonic council and a special session of the council was set {{in order to deal}} with that matter. The Athenians, however, did not send envoys and neither did the Thebans. This was a clear insult to the council and Philip II intervened once more as a regulator. The Fourth Sacred War broke out, ending in the <b>total</b> subjugation of <b>Greece</b> to the kingdom of Macedonia. The Phocians recovered gradually from the repercussions of the Third Sacred War and managed to be reinstated in the Amphictyony in 279 BC, when they joined forces with the Aetolian League fighting against the Gauls. However, a serious side-loss of the Third Sacred War remained the {{destruction of}} a large number of ex votos and other precious offerings to the sanctuary of Apollo, which deprived not only the sanctuary itself but also the later generations of some magnificent pieces of art.|$|R
25|$|Later {{during the}} month, as the Allies were forced back towards Sphakia, {{to prevent the}} Germans from {{capturing}} it, the regiment had to destroy most of its equipment. Two of the captured 75mm guns were saved, though, and were manpacked by men from 'B' Troop over mountainous terrain {{to act in a}} rearguard role between Sphakia and Suda, while the Royal Navy attempted to evacuate the stranded troops. The regiment continued to fight until it was withdrawn by sea on 31 May, leaving behind 129 men who were captured by the Germans. Amongst these were the men from 'B' Troop, who had formed the rearguard protecting the evacuation beach. After the departure of the last transport ship, they attempted to evade capture but were eventually rounded up by German patrols. The regiment's <b>total</b> losses for <b>Greece</b> and Crete were 27 killed and 47 wounded. In addition to the men captured on Crete, one other had been captured in Greece. Those that were captured were first sent to Salonica before being sent to a number of prisoner of wars camp in Germany, Italy and Austria. While prisoners, numerous escape attempts were made by men from the 2/3rd, although ultimately only four men successfully avoided recapture following their escape.|$|R

The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of hepatitis A virus infection (HAV) among municipal solid waste workers (MSWWs) in a municipality of central Greece. A seroprevalence study of HAV was conducted among 208 employees (100 waste collectors and 108 municipal gardeners) of a municipality in central <b>Greece.</b> <b>Total</b> antibodies against HAV were measured and information regarding potential risk factors was collected through a face to face interview. The prevalence of HAV infection among the municipal waste collectors was 61 % vs. 27 % among municipal gardeners.

Moreover, waste collectors who reported smoking/drinking/eating during waste collection were at higher risk of HAV infection (RR = 2. 84; 95 % CI = 1. 73 – 4. 63).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several medical, {{occupational}} and environmental paternal exposures {{have been suggested}} {{to be associated with}} low offspring sex ratios. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyse trends and variations in the second-ary sex ratio in Greece during the last 50 years and among different occupational groups of male employees of a ship-yard. METHODS: Data were retrieved from National Statistics Agency databases through the period 1955 – 2005, and linear regression was administered to examine the evolution of the sex ratio of newborns. In addition, 587 male ship-yard employees with 1012 children were included in the study. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to study the influence of father’s job title on offspring sex ratio. RESULTS: <b>Total</b> births in <b>Greece</b> declined by ~ 30 % between the mid 1950 s and 1980, while little change in sex ratio occurred. In contrast, while between 1980 and 2000, the birth rate continued to decline at the same rate (by ~ 30 %), there appeared to be a trend toward a decrease in sex ratio. The groups of sandblasters/painters and of ship carpenters showed a significantly lower proportion of boys among newborn children. CONCLUSIONS: Data from men working in a Greek shipyard suggest that the trend toward a decrease in secondary sex ratio observed in this country may be accounted for by a decrease in male births associated with specific workplace exposures of the father...|$|R
