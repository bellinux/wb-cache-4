40|$|Extensive {{research}} {{was done on}} the <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of a tyre from the 1960 s to the 1980 s, specifically looking at the tractive performance of tractors and agricultural vehicles. The {{research was}} limited to investigating slip conditions at low vehicle speed where {{it was safe to}} assume that the <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> is static or quasi-static. This paper revisits some of these investigations, and looks at the validity of the static or quasi-static <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> assumption on hard, high friction and uneven surfaces at higher speeds. The aim is to establish whether the <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> defined under static conditions can be used to estimate tyre contact patch velocity, a state needed to determine longitudinal tyre slip. Longitudinal tyre slip plays {{a crucial role in the}} performance of advanced driver assist systems.

40|$|In tyre {{testing the}} {{longitudinal}} tyre velocity and slip are important measurements {{in the development}} and parameterization of tyre models. The longitudinal slip of a tyre is often determined using three independent measurements namely the rotational velocity, tyre <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> and vehicle speed. However, during terremachanics tests the tyre <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> is almost impossible to measure from the outside. Methods have been created to determine the <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> on the inside of a tyre using lasers, however these methods generally only provide a single measurement point every few degrees. In this study a stereoscopic rig is used {{on the inside of the}} tyre to determine the longitudinal velocity of a large portion of the tyre in contact with the terrain. This measurement inherently includes the rotational velocity and <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the tyre. The measurement of the internal longitudinal velocity is used to determine the longitudinal velocity at the tyre-terrain contact interface. The longitudinal slip is determined from the measured longitudinal velocity and the velocity of the rim center. The method is evaluated on a Terramechanics rig using prepared sandy loam as the deformed soil material...|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to analyze the percentage of wheel slip for a passenger car in a various velocity, road condition and driving mode. The thesis describes the post-processing method to analyze the percentage of wheel slip and identify the effective <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> and the longitudinal tire stiffness for maximum tire life and performance. Driving and braking behaviour of vehicle were both studied in this thesis for paved and unpaved sandy road condition which commonly the contributing factors to the wheel slip to occur. The data used for the analysis is obtained through experimental test using UMP Test Car which has been installed with Wheel Pulse Transducer, Global Positioning System and DEWESOFT software for data acquisition purpose. The post-processing method was performed using Flexpro and Microsoft Office Excel. The post-processing method to analyze the percentage of wheel slip was performed using the SAE definition of wheel slip and the percent error in the distance travel by the car between free rolling and actual condition. Finally, the longitudinal force, the effective <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> and the longitudinal tire stiffness was determined for both driving and braking maneuver of vehicle on paved and unpaved sandy road condition. From the results, {{it is observed that}} the percentage of wheel slip during driving maneuver is higher for unpaved sandy road condition compares to that the paved road. It is also observed that the longitudinal force of the tire is lower for unpaved sandy road compare to the paved road condition. The effective <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the <b>tire</b> during driving maneuver was determined to be lower compare to the free <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the <b>tire.</b> During braking manuever, the results show that the percentage of wheel slip is higher for unpaved sandy road compare to that for paved road condition. The longitudinal force and tire stiffness also observed lower for unpaved sandy road condition. The effective <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the <b>tire</b> during braking determined higher compared to that in the free <b>rolling</b> <b>radius.</b> The results concluded that the percentage of wheel slip is strongly dependent to the longitudinal force and the tire road friction. Therefore, effective <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> and longitudinal <b>tire</b> stiffness obtained can significantly use to improve tire design and construction. The results also can be use to improve the energy usage efficiency and fuel consumption of vehicle...|$|R

After a certain period of operation the profiles of wheel and rail become worn, losing original designed form.

At some point in time, reconditioning work is arranged to return the wheel to its original profile.

50|$|Replacing {{the wheels}} {{on a car}} with larger ones, {{normally}} for a perceived improvement in appearance, also involves using tires with a reduced profile number (often as low as 35%) to keep the overall <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> within a few per cent of the original tire. If this is not done, gearing and speedometer accuracy are affected. All other things being equal, larger replacement wheels give a harsher ride because of the shorter and stiffer tire sidewall, in exchange for better handling and higher cornering limits due to the lower sidewall flex. In contrast, a car designed to have large wheels from the outset may have a more normal tire profile and gives a smoother ride due to the larger <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the <b>tire.</b>|$|R

For the standard four–dimensional solutions with varying dilaton and T–modulus, we find approximate five–dimensional counterparts.

Loop corrections in the four–dimensional theory are described by certain excitations of fields in the fifth dimension. We point out that the two exact separable solutions previously discovered are precisely the special cases for which the loop corrections are time–independent. Generically, loop corrections vary with time. Moreover, for a subset of solutions they increase in time, evolving into complicated, non-separating solutions.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research of tires {{was to determine the}} dynamic <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> and to apply it to wheel slip calculations with special respect to vertical wheel load and to tire inflation pressure. It is typical of mechanical four-wheel drive tractors that there is a definite additional power in the tractor power chain. This additional power is dependent on the difference between the front wheel and rear wheel peripheral speeds. Further-more, the purpose was to determine the effect of additional slip on four-wheel drive tractors operated without drawbar pull. Experiments were performed on asphalt surfaces and fields. A new measurement method was developed, and a device was constructed for the implementation of three tractor wheel drive operational modes (four-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and front-wheel drive). As the result of the experiments, a relationship was found to describe the dynamic <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> for low-profile radial tires tested on rigid road surfaces.

Normally, transient dynamic characteristics of a <b>rolling</b> <b>tire</b> are determined from tire rig tests, and the tire parameters are transferred into multi-body system for vehicle dynamic analysis. However rig design limitations mean that tests cannot be carried out in the most severe conditions, particularly for traversing high ramp or large obstacles. However, using detailed FE tire models, such tests can be carried out virtually. A FE tire model was developed specifically for this purpose using explicit integration in ABAQUS™. Tire enveloping tests in traversing obstacles of different sizes were then carried out, virtually, using the validated FE tire model. Satisfactory results of transient responses were obtained by comparison with the experimental tests for the tire traversing obstacles with different heights. Tire transient dynamic behaviour was investigated by analysing the influence of <b>tire</b> <b>rolling</b> velocity and height of road obstacle on transient spindle responses, dynamic stiffness, together with tire deformation for the tire impacting obstacles. Finally, the investigation showed that longitudinal dynamic stiffness decreases when the tire traverses a higher obstacle.
