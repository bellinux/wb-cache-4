50|$|Because of the diminished {{need for}} <b>trained</b> <b>labor,</b> {{families}} of slaves on cotton and rice plantations would often remain together, {{bought and sold}} as complete packages. Individual life expectancies were generally shorter, because their skill set was less refined and workers were easily replaced if killed.

50|$|The basic {{underlying}} problem behind EIFS litigation was that EIFS was marketed as a cost-effective replacement for stucco. Stucco is expensive to install because {{it must be}} carefully applied by skilled craftsmen and takes a month to cure between coats. General contractors switched to EIFS because {{they were supposed to}} be easy to install with unskilled or semi-skilled labor and would not crack like traditional stucco if they were not cured properly. Although EIFS if properly installed according to the manufacturer's directions should not have water intrusion problems, many GCs cut corners by using insufficiently <b>trained</b> <b>labor</b> and also failed to supervise their work adequately. In turn, thousands of EIFS installations were noncompliant and suffered severe water intrusion and mold as a result. While the EIFS industry has consistently tried to shift the blame to GCs, the construction industry has retorted that using journeymen carpenters in turn eliminates the cost advantage of EIFS over stucco, and that the EIFS industry should have anticipated this issue and engineered its products from the beginning to be installed by unskilled labor or semi-skilled labor (that is, it should have been a fault-tolerant design).|$|E

50|$|The Government of Portugal {{made some}} {{important}} progress towards meeting the minimum standards during the reporting period. In 2009, the government achieved a significant milestone in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts by aggressively prosecuting a sex trafficking case {{resulting in the}} highest penalties ever handed down for a trafficking crime in Portugal. In this case, the government convicted eight trafficking offenders for forcing 23 Romanian girls into prostitution, resulting in an average sentence of 12 years in prison. Portugal prohibits trafficking in persons for both forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation through Article 160, which prescribes penalties of three to 12 years’ imprisonment - which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those for other serious crimes. Although the government prohibits slavery and exploitation of prostitution by means of force, fraud, and coercion under Articles 159 and 169 respectively, it used its broader Article 160 to prosecute traffickers. During 2008 and 2009, police conducted 83 investigations of possible cases of trafficking. During the same time period, the government reported it prosecuted 207 suspected traffickers, convicting 298 under Article 160; the government reported this data was preliminary. This data could also include broader crimes involving sexual exploitation. The government did not provide sentencing information for all convicted traffickers {{to demonstrate that the}} majority of those convicted for trafficking received jail time in 2009. In previous years, courts suspended the sentences for the majority of convicted traffickers in Portugal. The government provided specialized anti-trafficking training to judges in December 2009 and <b>trained</b> <b>labor</b> inspectors in January 2010. Law enforcement officials continued to receive periodic specialized anti-trafficking training. There were no reported cases of government officials complicit in trafficking; however an NGO reported Portuguese girls engaged in prostitution often possess forged government documents to indicate they are older than 18.|$|E

Further, specification problems arising from spatial dependence are also addressed. Results from the empirical analysis show that the speed of convergence is influenced by region specific characteristics and the availability of <b>trained</b> <b>labor</b> in neighboring regions. ...|$|E
