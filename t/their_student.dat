40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{evolution}} of teachers 2 ̆ 7 collective interpretations of <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 thinking and of the teachers 2 ̆ 7 social processes as a result of investigating <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 work. The latest reform efforts in mathematics education stress the importance of teachers attending to and understanding <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 mathematical thinking, yet focusing on students 2 ̆ 7 thinking can prove difficult for teachers. Ball (1997 a) recommends that teacher investigations of classroom artifacts, such as students 2 ̆ 7 work, hold promise for assisting teachers with interpreting <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 thinking, but that it would be helpful to know more about how such approaches influence teachers 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of students 2 ̆ 7 thinking. Therefore, this study investigated two research questions: “When teachers as a group engage in an investigation of <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 work on a thought-revealing, non-routine mathematical task, how do the teachers 2 ̆ 7 collective interpretations of <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 mathematical thinking evolve within the investigation?” and “When teachers as a group engage in a series of investigations of <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 work on thought-revealing, non-routine mathematical tasks, how do the teachers 2 ̆ 7 social processes for making collective interpretations of <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 mathematical thinking evolve across the investigations?” The teachers engaged in five investigations of <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 work. For each investigation, the teachers participated in an Introductory Workshop, where they completed the non-routine mathematics task, then implemented the task in their classrooms, and finally participated in a Follow-Up Workshop, where they discussed and recorded on a Consensus Students 2 ̆ 7 Thinking Sheet <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 thinking strategies for solving the associated task, the mathematical skills and concepts associated with each thinking strategy, and the effectiveness of each thinking strategy in solving the task. Data analysis revealed that the teachers 2 ̆ 7 collective interpretations evolved within three dimensions corresponding with the content of the Consensus Students 2 ̆ 7 Thinking Sheets and that the teachers frequently adopted a students 2 ̆ 7 perspective of the task, leading them to more insights into <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 thinking and to more appreciation for <b>their</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 thinking. Data analysis also revealed that the teachers 2 ̆ 7 social processes did not evolve across the five investigations. Implications for facilitators of teacher investigations of students 2 ̆ 7 work and directions for further research are provided. ...|$|R

40|$|Elementary school {{teachers}} transition <b>their</b> <b>students</b> from recess {{to the classroom}} multiple times a day. When students do not line up quickly or are disruptive in line, teachers often spend valuable instructional time trying to manage students’ inappropriate behaviors. The result is a loss of instructional time {{that could lead to}} a decrease in student performance. The current study examined how teachers could use behavioral skills training with <b>their</b> <b>students</b> as a way to reduce the length of the recess-to-classroom transition. Participants included general education second – fourth grade teachers and <b>their</b> <b>students.</b> Target behaviors included teacher implementation of behavioral skills training and student behavior of transitioning from recess to the classroom. Procedures involved first using behavioral skills training as a method of instruction for teachers, who, in turn, used behavioral skills training as a method of instruction for <b>their</b> <b>students.</b> After training, teachers were able to proficiently provide <b>their</b> <b>students</b> with instruction, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback, and students began to line up more quickly at the teacher’s signal and use their hands and feet appropriately for the duration of the transition. These results imply that training teachers to better train <b>their</b> <b>students</b> can decrease the amount of time students spend on transitions and increase the amount of time teachers spend on instruction...|$|R

25|$|Singing is an {{integrated}} and coordinated act {{and it is}} difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with <b>their</b> <b>student</b> until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.|$|E
