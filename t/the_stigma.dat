5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing <b>the</b> <b>stigma,</b> style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} social and {{psychological}} well-being. These effects may include social isolation, stigmatization, or disability. They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes. Learning disabilities are common in those with the condition, and especially among children with epilepsy. <b>The</b> <b>stigma</b> of epilepsy can also affect {{the families of those}} with the disorder.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that {{families}} failed to seek medical treatment for their daughters because of <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> associated with negative medical histories. A study conducted by Pednekar et al. in 2011 found that out of 100 boys and girls with congenital heart disease, 70 boys would have an operation while only 22 girls will receive similar treatment.|$|E
60|$|Experiment repeated, but <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> were {{carefully}} examined after an interval of only five hours and a half. <b>The</b> two <b>stigmas</b> with pollen from a short-styled flower were penetrated by innumerable tubes, which were as yet short, and <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> themselves {{were not at}} all discoloured. <b>The</b> three <b>stigmas</b> covered with their own-form pollen were not penetrated by a single pollen-tube.|$|R
60|$|Pollen from a short-styled {{plant was}} placed on <b>the</b> five <b>stigmas</b> of a long-styled flower, and these, after thirty hours, were found deeply {{penetrated}} by a multitude of pollen-tubes, far too numerous to be counted; <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> had also become discoloured and twisted. I repeated this experiment on another flower, and in eighteen hours <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> were penetrated by a multitude of long pollen- tubes. This is {{what might have been}} expected, as the union is a legitimate one. The converse experiment was likewise tried, and pollen from a long-styled flower {{was placed on}} <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> of a short-styled flower, and in twenty-four hours <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> were discoloured, twisted, and penetrated by numerous pollen-tubes; and this, again, is what might have been expected, as the union was a legitimate one.|$|R
60|$|I placed own-form pollen {{on three}} of <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> of a long-styled flower, and pollen from a short-styled flower on <b>the</b> other two <b>stigmas.</b> After twenty-two hours these two stigmas were discoloured, {{slightly}} twisted, and penetrated by the tubes of numerous pollen-grains: <b>the</b> other three <b>stigmas,</b> covered with their own-form pollen, were fresh, {{and all the}} pollen-grains were loose; but I did not dissect <b>the</b> whole <b>stigma.</b>|$|R
5|$|Locals have {{estimated}} that the only area still affected by contamination is just offshore from the Alcoa plant.

5|$|Taken together, {{women are}} oftentimes seen less {{valuable}} than men.

5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to <b>the</b> <b>stigma,</b> more seeds are {{produced}} in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E

5|$|For many years, Adrian Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Wilson and his first wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side.

The enmity provoked in Wilson was to have lasting repercussions. <b>The</b> <b>stigma</b> attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career: he was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival for 25 years until 1957, when he narrated Honegger's King David in Worcester, by which time his singing career had ended.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation {{was created}} at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide {{postgraduate}} scholarships to African students.

He gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, calling for greater measures to tackle tuberculosis as well as HIV/AIDS.

60|$|Hildebrand {{has shown}} that this plant, the common Buck-wheat, is heterostyled. (3/13. 'Die Geschlechter-Vertheilung' etc. 1867 page 34.) In the long-styled form (Figure 3.7), <b>the</b> three <b>stigmas</b> project {{considerably}} above the eight short stamens, and stand on a level with the anthers of the eight long stamens in the short-styled form; {{and so it is}} conversely with <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> and stamens of this latter form. I could perceive no difference in the structure of <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> in <b>the</b> two forms. The pollen-grains of the short-styled form are to those of the long-styled as 100 to 82 in diameter. This plant is therefore without doubt heterostyled.|$|R
6000|$|Fritz Muller sent me from South Brazil dried {{flowers of}} this tree, {{together}} with the drawings (Figure 3.8.), which show the two forms, magnified about five times, with the petals removed. In the long-styled form <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> project above <b>the</b> anthers, and the styles are nearly {{twice as long as}} those of the short-styled form, in which <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> stand beneath <b>the</b> anthers. <b>The</b> <b>stigmas</b> in many, but not in all the short-styled flowers are larger than those in the long-styled. The anthers of the short-styled flowers stand on a level with <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> of <b>the</b> other form; but the stamens are longer by only one-fourth or one- fifth of their own length than those of the long-styled. Consequently the anthers of the latter do not stand on a level with, but rather above <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> of <b>the</b> other form. Differently from what occurs in the following closely allied genus, Sethia, the stamens are of nearly equal length in the flowers of the same form. The pollen-grains of the short-styled flowers, measured in their dry state, are a little larger than those from the long-styled flowers in about the ratio of 100 to 93. (3/19. F. Muller remarks in his letter to me that the flowers, of which he carefully examined many specimens, are curiously variable in the number of their parts: 5 sepals and petals, 10 stamens and 3 pistils are the prevailing numbers; but the sepals and petals often vary from 5 to 7; the stamens from 10 to 14, and the pistils from 3 to 4.) ...|$|R
50|$|Surface {{pollination}} is more frequent, {{and appears}} to be a transitional phase between wind pollination and true hydrophily. In these the pollen floats on the surface and reaches <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> of <b>the</b> female flowers as in Hydrilla, Callitriche, Ruppia, Zostera, Elodea. In Vallisneria the male flowers become detached and float {{on the surface of the}} water; the anthers are thus brought in contact with <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> of <b>the</b> female flowers. Surface hydrophily has been observed in several species of Potamogeton as well as some marine species.|$|R
5|$|In Japan, {{strong belief}} in astrology {{has led to}} {{dramatic}} changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of Fire Horse.

5|$|Keeping rats as pets {{can come}} with <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> that rats {{supposedly}} transmit dangerous diseases to their owners.

In 2004, an outbreak of salmonella in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to salmonella, {{along with many other}} zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ethylene {{production}} and senescence of petals of pollinated car-nation flowers were not prevented by {{removal of the}} ethylene produced by the gynoecium, suggesting that these events are a response to move-ment from the gynoecium of some stimulus other than ethylene gas. Ap-plication of l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid (ACC) to <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> caused an initial increase in gynoecium and petal ethylene production sim-ilar to that reported for pollinated flowers. This response was not seen in flowers whose stigmas were treated with indoleacetic acid (IAA). When [2 - 14 C]ACC was applied to <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> of carnation flowers, radioactive ethylene was produced both by the gynoecia nd by the petals. The pos-sibility that ACC, transported from <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> to <b>the</b> petals, {{is responsible for the}} postpollination changes in carnation flowers is discussed. In a number of flowers it is known that pollination results in stimulated eth-ylene {{production and}} early senescence (Hall and Forsyth 1967, Nichols 1977). These events have been suggested to be a response to IAA present in th...|$|R

5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. <b>The</b> <b>stigma</b> may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E
5|$|The androecium {{consists}} of six stamens with filiform (thread like) filaments, which are fasciculate (in close bundles) and declinate or ascendent. The anthers are dorsifixed or versatile. In the gynaecium, the ovary is inferior and trilocular with pluriovulate locules. The style is filiform, and <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> trifid. The fruit forms a trivalve capsule containing seeds which are dry, flattened, obliquely winged or irregularly discoid, hardly ever turgid, and globose (spherical) or subglobose, with a brown or black phytomelanous testa.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers {{retained}} {{the names of}} most of the case's real-life protagonists, but the names of several supporting characters were altered. For example, the character of Candace was named Lisa Lambert in real life. The casting process for Boys Don't Cry lasted almost four years. Drew Barrymore was an early candidate to star in the film. Peirce scouted the LGBT community, looking mainly for masculine, lesbian women for the role of Brandon Teena. Peirce said the LGBT community was very interested in the project because of the publicity surrounding the murder. High-profile actors avoided Peirce's auditions at the request of their agents because of <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> associated with the role.|$|E
2500|$|The gynoecium is unilocular and {{composed}} of three fused carpels. The ovules are numerous and attached near {{the margins of}} the carpels. <b>The</b> three <b>stigmas</b> are separate or initially joined at the base, but soon separating with growth of <b>the</b> ovary. <b>The</b> <b>stigmas</b> are commissural, meaning that the area that is receptive to pollen extends downward along the fissures where the carpels are joined.|$|R

5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} pistil protrude {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front.

Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds. The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|Because of its poor flying ability, {{large size}} and {{possible}} island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests {{would have been}} extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques and rats. Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, {{which may explain why}} it held out so long against introduced animals after all. The bird is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.|$|E
