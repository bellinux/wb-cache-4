5|$|Comstock and {{his allies}} also <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at the libertarians and utopians who {{comprised}} the free love movement– an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage. The free love proponents were the only group to actively oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, {{setting the stage for}} the birth control movement.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|The {{third season}} sparked controversy, namely Mel B's {{attitude}} towards the other judges, labeling them dishonest and boring. Controversy also occurred between Sebastian and contestant Mitchell Callaway; Sebastian <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at Callaway's attitude to the competition following his performance on the third live performance show. There were also claims of a clash between Callaway and contestant Declan Sykes. The grand final decider was watched by 1.99 million people, making it the highest rated television episode of the season.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
5|$|In Madame Satan (1930), {{adultery}} {{is explicitly}} condoned {{and used as}} a sign for a wife {{that she needs to}} act in a more enticing way to maintain her husband's interest. In Secrets (1933), a husband admits to serial adultery, only this time he repents and the marriage is saved. The films <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at what was already a damaged institution. During the Great Depression, relations between spouses often deteriorated due to financial strain, marriages lessened, and husbands abandoned their families in increased numbers. Marriage rates continually declined in the early 1930s, finally rising in 1934, the final year of the pre-Code era, and although divorce rates lowered, this is likely because desertion became a more common method of separation. Consequently, female characters, such as Ruth Chatterton's in Female, live promiscuous bachelorette lifestyles, and control their own financial destiny (Chatterton supervises an auto factory) without regret.|$|E

5|$|On 27 May 1942, Heydrich {{planned to}} meet Hitler in Berlin. German {{documents}} suggest that Hitler intended to transfer Heydrich to German-occupied France, where the French resistance was gaining ground. Heydrich {{would have to}} pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merges with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction, in the Prague suburb of Libeň, was well suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. As Heydrich's car slowed, Gabčík <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> with a Sten submachine gun, but it jammed and failed to fire. Instead of ordering his driver to speed away, Heydrich called his car to halt and attempted to confront the attackers. Kubiš then threw a bomb (a converted anti-tank mine) {{at the rear of}} the car as it stopped. The explosion wounded both Heydrich and Kubiš.|$|E
5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned to deal with him. Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post. After several days, Sing's spotter alerted him to a potential target, and he <b>took</b> <b>aim,</b> {{only to find the}} target—Abdul—looking in his direction. Sing prepared to fire, trying not to reveal his position, but the Turkish sniper noticed him and began his own firing sequence. Sing fired first and killed Abdul. Very shortly thereafter, the Turkish artillery fired on Sing's position—he and his spotter barely managed to evacuate from Chatham's Post alive.|$|E
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E

5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police <b>took</b> <b>aim,</b> sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|With {{only the}} two years {{remaining}} in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at a large and popular target: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives to abolish Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed {{and sent to the}} Senate. Senator Cassius M. Clay responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby. Goebel also helped defeat the bill to abolish the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero in his district. He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his Republican opponent.|$|E

25|$|Butler also <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at foreign consuls in New Orleans. He {{ordered the}} seizure of $800,000 that had been {{deposited}} {{in the office of}} the Dutch consul, imprisoned the French champagne magnate Charles Heidsieck, and took particular aim at George Coppell of Great Britain, whom he suspended for refusal to cooperate with the Union. Instead, Butler accused Coppell of giving aid to the Confederate cause.|$|E
25|$|Despite his prosperity, Svarocis {{was unhappy}} {{in his life}} and could hear the ducks and deer talking about him behind his back. One day he went hunting and <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at a boar, but a deer came through the {{clearing}} and asked to be shot in its place. When he enquired why, the deer told him that she was really the goddess of the forest and wished to marry Svarocisa. So he embraced the deer and she turned into a beautiful woman. Together, they had a son named Dyutiman, who later became the Svarocisa Manu.|$|E
25|$|When {{the commanders}} had fled the scene, Scottish mercenaries {{overwhelmed}} the German artillery, seized {{the guns and}} <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> at the German cavalry. The German cavalry charged, hit by Scottish artillery fire on their way, and cut down the Scots. The result was 30 dead Germans and 1,500 dead Scots. The German and Swedish infantry stood by without taking action, neither did the Scottish cavalry intervene. Several Scottish officers were among the dead, including David Murray, Jacob Murray and George Michell. About 70 Scots escaped to the Russian forces in Wesenberg, the last historical record {{of them is that}} they were subsequently brought to Moscow.|$|E

25|$|The café {{was very}} small, with the tables very close together, and was {{particularly}} busy that day, with many people {{waiting for the}} next ferry. The following events happened extremely quickly. Bryant <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> from his hip and pointed his rifle at Moh Yee (William) Ng and Sou Leng Chung, who were visiting from Malaysia, who were at a table beside Bryant. He shot them at close range, killing both instantly. Bryant then fired a shot at Mick Sargent, grazing his scalp and knocking him to the floor. He fired a fourth shot that killed Sargent's girlfriend, 21-year-old Kate Elizabeth Scott, by hitting her {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|Taishi Ci {{was famous}} for his archery skills. There was one notable {{incident}} when he accompanied Sun Ce to attack rebels in Mabao (麻保). The rebel leader stood at the viewing platform above the gate, with his hand resting against a wooden pillar, and hurled verbal abuse at Sun Ce. Taishi Ci <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> and fired an arrow at him. The arrow pierced through both the pillar and the rebel's hand. Everyone was awed by Taishi Ci's skill. When the warlord Cao Cao heard about Taishi Ci, {{he wrote a letter}} to him and put it inside a box containing a few pieces of danggui.|$|E
25|$|One day in May 1786, Abraham Lincoln {{was working}} in his field with his three sons {{when he was shot}} from the nearby forest and fell to the ground. The eldest boy, Mordecai, ran to the cabin where a loaded gun was kept, while the middle son, Josiah, ran to Hughes' Station for help. Thomas, the youngest, stood in shock by his father. From the cabin, Mordecai {{observed}} an Indian come out of the forest and stop by his father's body. The Indian reached for Thomas, either to kill him or to carry him off. Mordecai <b>took</b> <b>aim</b> and shot the Indian in the chest, killing him.|$|E
