2500|$|The current Mac Mini is {{designed}} to be opened using a round cover {{on the bottom of the}} computer. Prior versions of the Mac Mini were much more difficult to open. Some Mac Mini owners used a putty knife or a pizza cutter to pry open the cases of older models to gain access to the interior for installation of cheaper third party memory upgrades. The official Apple Service Source manual for Mac Mini describes this procedure in detail, including an official Apple part number for a [...] "modified putty knife". It's also possible to use wires to pull the white plastic bottom case out of the metal <b>top</b> <b>case.</b> While opening the case does not actually void the Mac Mini warranty, anything broken while the case is open is not covered. Other modifications include hard disk upgrades, overclocking the processor (G4 only), and upgrading the wireless networking (for older models) to 802.11n. The 2009 model can have its SuperDrive replaced with a second SATA hard drive. The removal of the optical drive in the 2011 models leaves internal space for a second internal hard drive or SSD, which can be ordered as a BTO option from Apple, or as an upgrade kit from 3rd party suppliers.|$|E

5000|$|For 2013 the Multistrada 1200 had changes {{including}} {{the addition of}} an active suspension system, using solenoid/valve actuated methods to actively control damping rates, often called the [...] "Sky-Hook method". The bike also had a revised second generation of the Testastretta 11-degree motor, now with [...] "twin-plug cylinder heads for smoother, more efficient combustion", the change contributing to a 5% increase in torque and a 10% improvement in fuel consumption. Also, there are significant changes to the windscreen, which is [...] "larger and shaped to reduce noise at high speed".

5000|$|To correct this, service {{groups will}} often replace the logic board or power converter, {{but the actual}} fix (depending on the model) for the first cause is to replace or remove {{the left or right}} ambient light sensors; and for the second cause, disconnect, remove, or replace the heat sensor, or the entire <b>top</b> <b>case</b> which holds the trackpad heat sensor.

5000|$|The Cavalcade {{features}} a 16 valve DOHC 1360 cc V4 with hydraulic lash adjusters and shaft drive for low maintenance. Many {{of the standard}} features on the Cavalcade were considered options on other motorcycles in 1985. The LX and LXE models feature self-cancelling turn signals, automatic rear pneumatic leveling system, rear suspension load pre-tensioner, air-adjustable damping on the front shocks that could be refilled with a standard tire pump connection, electronic cruise control, radio and cassette deck with LCD station display, volume and station selection controls on the handlebars, adjustment knob for the headlight, adjustable passenger floorboards, fore to aft <b>top</b> <b>case</b> adjustment for passenger comfort, adjustable handlebars and adjustable windshield. The radio is in a decorative housing that resembles a standard motorcycle fuel tank. The radio has an automatic volume control that raises and lowers the radio volume based on {{the speed of the}} motorcycle. The Cavalcade fuel tank is located under the driver's seat but is filled {{from the top of the}} decorative tank. A standard automobile-type oil filter is located midline of the underside of the chassis between the exhaust pipes. The engine is liquid cooled with a thermostatically-controlled electric fan. The radio antenna could be unscrewed and lowered so as not to interfere with the positioning of the weather cover, which was standard with all models.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{reviewed}} {{the data of}} the termination of pregnancy (<b>TOP)</b> <b>cases</b> between 2002 and 2010 to evaluate the changes in fetal indications for both early and late TOPs in this period. Material and Methods: The data of 962 <b>TOP</b> <b>cases</b> were analysed in two groups according to the periods as in 2002 - 2006 and 2007 - 2010. The women were also subdivided into two categories according to their gestational age; < 23 weeks’ gestation (early termination) and ≥ 23 weeks’ gestation (late termination). Results: Four hundred and fifty-eight (47. 6 %) of TOPs were performed between 2002 and 2006 (Group 1) and 504 (52. 3 %) were performed between 2007 and 2010 (Group 2). The number of early (< 23 weeks) and late (≥ 23 weeks) terminations were 583 (60. 6 %) and 379 (39. 3 %), respectively. The vast majority of anomalies were central nervous sytem malformations (51. 8 %). They were followed by multiple anomalies (10. 2 %) and chromosomal anomalies (9. 4 %). Chromosomal and cardiovascular system anomalies were significantly higher in 2007 - 2010 in comparison to 2002 - 2006 (p< 0. 0001 and p= 0. 002, respectively). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the fetal indications that led to early termination compared to those that led to late termination. Conclusion: The distribution of indications for TOP was influenced by the development in prenatal screening policy, resulting in a significant increase in terminations due to chromosomal and cardiovascular system anomalies. Cultural, educational, religious and legal factors cause differences in the indications for TOP as well as the gestational age that TOPS are performed...|$|R
40|$|Recent work on {{homicide}} and {{the media}} {{has focused on the}} United States.

The focus is on the newspaper coverage of the <b>top</b> <b>cases</b> each year and over the whole period. This approach allows for an exploration of the hierarchy within ‘media–homicides’ that are distinguished in terms of ‘mega–cases’, ‘mezzo–cases’ and ‘routine cases’. Hence, this issue is shown to be a more complex social and cultural phenomenon than is usually understood through the traditional binary ‘reported–non reported’ approach. The importance of unusualness and cultural context is emphasised in fully understanding how homicides become, particularly, mega–cases...|$|R
