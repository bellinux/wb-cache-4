5000|$|Borrelia {{bacteria}} are well described elsewhere {{in association with}} Ixodes ticks for causing Lyme disease in humans, but this disease also affects domestic dogs. Borrelia anserina is transmitted by Argas persicus to poultry, causing avian borreliosis in {{a wide spread of}} tropical and subtropical countries. [...] Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly Ehrlichia phagocytophila) is a bacterium of deer that spreads to sheep where it causes tick-borne fever in Europe, resulting in abortion by ewes and <b>temporary</b> <b>sterility</b> of rams. This bacterium invades and proliferates in neutrophil cells of the blood. This depletes these antibacterial cells and renders the host susceptible to opportunistic infections by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria which invade joints and cause the crippling disease of sheep called tick pyaemia. Anaplasma marginale infects marginal areas of red blood cells of cattle and causes anaplasmosis wherever boophilid ticks occur as transmitters. Anaplasma centrale tends to infect the central region of red blood cells, and is sufficiently closely related to An. marginale to have been used from long ago as a live vaccine to protect cattle against the more virulent An. marginale. Sheep and goats suffer disease from infection with Anaplasma ovis which is transmitted similarly to the anaplasmas described above. Ehrlichia ruminantium (formerly Cowdria ruminantium) is transmitted mainly by Amblyomma hebraeum and Am. variegatum in Africa, causing the severe disease heartwater in cattle, sheep, and goats. This disease is named after the prominent sign of pericardial edema. The bacteria infect the brain, causing prostration. Heartwater also occurs on the Caribbean islands, having spread there on shipments of cattle from Africa about 150 years ago, before anything was known of tick transmitted microbes. 11 ...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Antibody {{produced}} in rabbits against hamster ovary blocked fertilization of golden hamster eggs in vitro by binding {{to the surface}} of the zona pellucida and rendering it impenetrable to sperma-tozoa. The antibody was also effective in blocking fertilization in vivo. An intraperitoneal injection of the antibody into females resulted in the complete inhibition of fertilization for approximately 12 days, i. e. three oestrous cycles. This <b>temporary</b> <b>sterility</b> was apparently due to the bind-ing of the antibody to the zona pellucida ofoviducal and ovarian oocytes, and not due to a failure of sperm ascent or capacitation in the female genital tract. Neither the oestrous cycle nor ovulation was affected by the antibody injection...|$|E
50|$|BET inhibitors such as JQ1 {{block the}} region of BRDT {{responsible}} for chromatin binding, and cause a reversible reduction of sperm production, sperm quality, {{and size of the}} testis in mice.The mechanism of action of JQ1 could be explained by considering Brdt’s functions as a driver of testis-specific gene expression and post-meiotic chromatin reorganization. As BET inhibitors also inhibit other BET proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4, they are likely to have effects in people beyond <b>temporary</b> male <b>sterility.</b>|$|R
50|$|Swine {{brucellosis}} is a zoonosis affecting pigs, {{caused by}} the bacterium Brucella suis. The disease typically causes chronic inflammatory lesions in the reproductive organs of susceptible animals or orchitis, and may even affect joints and other organs. The most common symptom is abortion in pregnant susceptible sows at any stage of gestation. Other manifestations are <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>sterility,</b> lameness, posterior paralysis, spondylitis, and abscess formation. It is transmitted mainly by ingestion of infected tissues or fluids, semen during breeding, and suckling infected animals.|$|R
50|$|A {{chemosterilant}} is any {{chemical compound}} {{used to control}} economically destructive or disease-causing pests (usually insects) by causing <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>sterility</b> of {{one or both of}} the sexes or preventing maturation of the young to a sexually functional adult stage. The mating of sterilized insects with fertile insects produces no offspring, and if the number of sterile insects is kept constant, the percentage of sterile insects will increase, and fewer young will be produced in each successive generation. Chemosterilants should be applied in the larval or pupal stage of the insect to give rise to sterile adults or in the newly emerged adults before they become sexually mature.|$|R
40|$|Direct cell {{kill and}} {{inhibition}} of mitosis {{have been suggested}} as mechanisms to explain the occurrence of absolute sterility following the irradiation of the testes. In order to obtain information on the existence and dose dependency of the mechanisms for man, a controlled study was initiated. Sixty-four men received a single midorgan dose to both of their testes ranging from 7. 5 to 400 r (f =. 95). It was deduced from resulting pre-sterile period and sterile period data that both cell kill and mitosis halting mechanisms were operating. The maximum observed sterile period was 501 days with eventual recovery observed in each individual where the follow-up was complete. Thus man appears to be highly radiosensitive in regard to <b>temporary</b> <b>sterility</b> but quite radioresistant in regard to permanent sterility...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that 92 per cent of the total radiation emitted by radium in equilibrium with its subsequent products is given off in the form of α-rays. This, however, cannot be utilized when the source is enclosed in an ordinary container, because the α-rays are absorbed completely by even a small thickness of glass. About 3. 2 per cent of the total radiation is emitted in the form of β-rays, and 4. 8 per cent as gamma radiation. The effects produced on the radiated mice of these experiments were due mainly to the β-rays, which are easily absorbed by tissue. The γ-rays, being only slightly absorbed by organic matter, probably contributed very little to the observed effects. It is interesting to correlate the different effects produced by the same dose of radiation. The mice which received a dose of 1. 9 millicurie hours showed no local effects on the skin or hair. Neither females nor males were sterilized, and the time at which they opened their eyes or reached sexual maturity was not affected, as far as we could tell. The only difference noted between the radiated animals and the controls was in the body weight. This dose accelerated the growth of the young mice, that is, while initially of the same weight, soon after irradiation they became distinctly bigger than the controls, but finally the animals of each group had substantially the same average weight. That this variation in body weight should be accidental is unlikely, since it was observed also in the animals treated by a slightly larger dose (2. 4 millicurie hours). The number of animals (seven) which showed this effect is too small to prove conclusively the accelerating effect of small doses of radiation on the body growth of mice. But considering that similar results have been. obtained by radiating plants and beetles, it is reasonable that the observed increase in weight might be attributed, at least in part, to the effects of radiation. Since this paper was first written Russ, Chambers, and Scott have shown that small doses of x-rays accelerate the body growth of rats. In view of this additional evidence {{there can be little doubt}} that the increase in weight observed in our experiments was due to the radiation. A dose of 2. 4 millicurie hours applied over the backs of the animals produced no local skin effects, but it accelerated the growth of the mice as in the previous case. In addition it caused permanent sterilization of all the females. A similar result was obtained with 4. 9 millicurie hours, except that the effect on the rate of growth was uncertain. A dose of 6. 8 millicurie hours produced a definite but mild skin erythema and retarded the development of lanugo hair. But since in this instance the emanation was applied over the heads of the animals, the dose reaching the ovaries was not sufficient to cause sterilization, as already explained. No other definite effect was noted. In connection with the sterilization of the females it should be noted that a dose of radiation which produced no visible skin changes was sufficient to cause permanent sterility. On account of the greater distance of the ovaries from the source of radiation as compared with that of the skin directly below the tube, and the depth of tissue which the rays had to traverse to reach the ovaries, the amount of radiation acting on the latter was much smaller than the amount falling on the skin. The radiation emitted by the emanation tube is reduced to about 50 per cent of its initial value after traversing 1 mm. of tissue. Still, while the skin was not visibly affected, the mice were sterilized. This shows that the ovaries are influenced very easily by radiation of this type. We can estimate the amount of radiation reaching the ovaries which is sufficient to cause sterility to be less than 25 per cent of the amount necessary to produce visible skin changes in the mice. It should be noted also that whenever sterility of the female mice was induced, it was permanent. Furthermore, those mice which were not rendered sterile by radiation were, as far as the experiments enable us to say, as prolific as the controls. Remembering that a dose of 1. 9 millicurie hours had no apparent effect on the ovaries, while a slightly larger dose, 2. 4 millicurie hours, caused permanent sterility, it might be concluded that it is not possible to produce <b>temporary</b> <b>sterility</b> by radiation. We know, however, that <b>temporary</b> <b>sterility</b> can be produced, at least when the animals are radiated at a later stage in their development. The mice in our experiments were radiated for the first time soon after birth, and it is not improbable that under these conditions <b>temporary</b> <b>sterility</b> cannot be obtained. Large sublethal doses produced severe skin burns, retarded the body growth of the animals, but failed to sterilize the males. About one-third of the total skin area of the mice showed marked effects from the radiation. The animals were very sick for a time, and their growth was temporarily stunted. But nevertheless they recovered and finally became apparently normal except for the narrow hairless strip of skin which had been closest to the emanation tube. Only the females were rendered permanently sterile. The males did not show even <b>temporary</b> <b>sterility</b> when the doses of radiation were close to the lethal dose. While the testes of mammals are known to be very easily affected by radiation, still they are more resistant than the ovaries. In addition, in these experiments they were at a greater distance from the source of radiation than the ovaries, and they were better protected by the thicker layer of tissue in the path of the rays. The fact that no sublethal dose in these experiments sterilized the males shows that under the conditions of irradiation adopted the amount of radiation reaching the testes was not sufficient to affect them noticeably. If the source of radiation had been applied closer to the reproductive organs of the males, they would have been sterilized by millicurie hour doses much smaller than the lethal dose. Some of the radiated animals were killed with ether, and macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the reproductive organs were made. The ovaries of the sterile females were generally atrophied and colored yellow. The normal histological structure was altered. The characteristic findings were the destruction of the Graafian follicles, with absence of ovum cells. The testes and the epididymis of the radiated mice of the present experiment appeared macroscopically and histologically normal, with the presence of abundant spermatozoa. Owing to the method adopted for the irradiation of the mice, the testes were too far from the source of radiation, and too well protected by the intervening tissue to be definitely affected by the rays...|$|E
40|$|The {{deployment}} of {{more and more}} wireless communication systems cause a potential danger to public health due to exposure {{of the human body}} to electromagnetic waves from RF and microwave. transmissions through free space. The amount of electromagnetic energy absorbed by the body is given by the Specific Absorption Rate or the SAR value given in W/kg. International regulations specify the maximum acceptable SAR value and the maximum permissible electromagnetic field for public safety. This thesis presents a case study for Sri Lanka. Electric field strengths due to transmissions from FM radio, VHF and UHF TV and Cellular mobile base stations, are measured {{in different parts of the}} country at sites which represent a normally high population during day time. SAR values are then calculated for the human eye based on the measured exposure levels due to RF and microwave transmitters radiating in all directions. Results indicate that cellular mobile base stations are the major sources of public exposure to electromagnetic radiation. The maximum exposure level recorded at one site due to all RF and microwave transmissions correspond to a field of approximately 1 V/m. The SAR values are calculated based on the measured exposure levels during the year 2005, using Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. The maximum SAR for the eye under worst-case conditions is 0. 0922 W/kg as compared with the safe limit of l. 6 W/kg for the whole body according to FCC standards. This is an estimated maximum value based on measured field strengths and it is 12 dB below the standards. The maximum SAR values and the SAR distribution in several organs such as the eye, brain, kidney, testis and neck are also estimated when high frequency signals propagate into the human body. A signal of strength IV 1 m is considered as the incident wave for calculations. The frequency of the signal is taken from 100 MHz to 3. 5 GHz which represent FM radio, TV, Cellular mobile, Bluetooth, WiFi and WiMax wireless transmissions. Remarkable variations of SAR distribution are observed in different body organs. Results show that at high enough frequencies into the microwave region, there is an absorption peak near the centre of the eye and the testis. From experimental evidence on animals, such an absorption peak in the eye is considered to be a possible cause of eye cataract. It is also reported that an absorption peak at the centre of the testis could cause <b>temporary</b> <b>sterility</b> in males. It is observed that electromagnetic absorption depends on the electrical properties of the tissue and not on the shape or the size of the organ. Our measurements of RF and microwave exposure and calculations of SAR conclude that we are safe at present. However, as the number of wireless transmissions increase, regular monitoring of the exposure levels should be carried out and a proper mechanism of regulation should be established for public safet...|$|E

However, administration of busulfan may cause <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>sterility</b> in male patients. Therefore, reduction of this side is necessary. Objective: evaluation of the protective effects of L-carnitine and testis homogenized tissue(THT) on sperm parameters and the testis structure after busulfan treatment. Materials and Methods: Twenty rats were divided four groups. Group I (Control) received a single dose of DMSO and 1 mL of distilled water (I. P.). Group II (Bus) received a single of busulfan (10 mg/kg) plus 1 ml of the distilled water(I. P.). Group III (Bus+THT) received busulfan plus 1 mL of THT daily by oral gavages. Group IV (Bus+L-car) received a single dose of busulfan plus 100 mg/kg/day L-carnitine(I.

40|$|Understanding the {{consequences}} of inbreeding in combination with stress {{is important for the}} persistence of small endangered populations in a changing environment. Inbreeding and stress can influence the population at all stages of the life cycle, and {{in the last two decades}} a number of studies have demonstrated inbreeding depression for most life-cycle components, both in laboratory populations and in the wild. Although male fertility is known to be sensitive to temperature extremes, few studies have focused on this life-cycle component. We studied the effects of inbreeding on male sterility in benign and stressful environments using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. Male sterility was compared in 21 inbred lines and five non-inbred control lines at 25. 0 and 29. 0 degrees C. The effect of inbreeding on sterility was significant only at 29. 0 C. This stress-induced increase in sterility indicates an interaction between the effects of inbreeding and high-temperature stress on male sterility. In addition, the stress-induced <b>temporary</b> and permanent <b>sterility</b> showed significant positive correlation, as did stress-induced sterility and the decrease in egg-to-adult viability. This suggests that the observed stress-induced decline in fitness could result from conditionally expressed, recessive deleterious alleles affecting both sterility and viability simultaneously.
