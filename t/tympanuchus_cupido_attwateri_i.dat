50|$|Attwater's prairie chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri)</b> is {{a highly}} {{endangered}} subspecies of the greater prairie chicken that is native to coastal Texas and Louisiana in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{forests are}} home to a rich {{wildlife}} including Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), North American least shrews (Cryptotis parva), North American beavers (Castor canadensis) and many species of butterflies and reptiles. Larger mammals that once lived here, including jaguar (Panthera onca) and Plains bison (Bison bison bison), have now disappeared from the region. Endangered fauna found in this ecoregion include the Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis) and Attwater's prairie chickens (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri).</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{coast is}} rich in wildlife, and 700 species of birds, animals and {{reptiles}} have been counted here, although many are now threatened or endangered. This coast is a critical habitat for the Attwater's prairie chickens (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri),</b> over one million of which inhabited the prairie in Texas and Louisiana in the 19th century, but extreme reduction of their habitat {{put them on the}} U.S. endangered species list in 1967. Another endangered bird of the coast is the whooping crane (Grus americana) while other birds include least grebe, white-collared seedeater (Sporophila morelleti), red-billed pigeon (Columba flavirostris), brown jay (Cyanocorax morio), Neotropic cormorant, white-winged dove (Leptotila verrequxi) and Audubon's oriole (Icterus graduacauda).|$|R

We also {{examined the}} relationship of prairie-chicken population increases and decreases on the refuge to rainfall and off-refuge prairie-chicken populations. Burning within the prairie-chicken 2 ̆ 7 s core habitat on the refuge and variability in grassland structure were directly correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with increases and declines in prairie-chicken populations. Refuge population increases and declines were inversely correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 1) with average April rainfall/event, May absolute departure from long-term average rainfall, May number of rainfall events, annual absolute departure of rainfall from the long-term average, and the annual number of rainfall events.

40|$|Prairie grouse (genus: Tympanuchus) once existed {{throughout}} much of North America but have recently experienced significant population declines, isolation, and extinction. In previous molecular studies, contrasting patterns or an unresolved polytomy among Tympanuchus taxa (Tympanuchus phasianellus, Tympanuchus pallidicinctus, and <b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido)</b> have resulted from traditional phylogenetic methods. As an alternative approach, the timing of expansion and the demographic processes that may have lead to this association among haplotypes, namely incomplete lineage sorting or migration, were explicitly investigated by comparing pairwise mitochondrial DNA control region nucleotide differences and {{through the use of}} a isolation with migration coalescent model. The timing of geographic expansion and population divergence time estimates generated under these models support previous inferences that Tympanuchus experienced a rapid expansion and diversification in the late Pleistocene 10, 000 – 80, 000 years before present. Further, morphological and behavioral differences originally used to describe Tympanuchus species were substantiated with little or no migration identified since population divergence. However, estimates of population divergence and migration between a number of morphologically similar subspecific taxa, including the greater prairie chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>Cupido</b> pinnatus), the endangered Attwater’s prairie chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>Cupido</b> <b>attwateri),</b> and the extinct heath hen (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>Cupido</b> cupido), suggest these taxa are as differentiated with each other as they are from other Tympanuchus species.

40|$|The {{goals of}} captive {{breeding}} programs for endangered species include preserving genetic diversity and avoiding inbreeding. Typically {{this is accomplished}} by minimizing population mean kinship; however, this approach becomes less effective when errors in the pedigree exist and may result in inbreeding depression, or reduced survival. Here, both pedigree- and DNA-based methods {{were used to assess}} inbreeding depression in the critically endangered Attwater’s prairie-chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri).</b> Less variation in the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients and parental relatedness values were observed compared to DNA-based measures suggesting that errors exist in the pedigree. Further, chicks identified with high parental DNA-based relatedness exhibited decreased survival at both 14 - and 50 -days post-hatch. A similar pattern was observed in later life stages (> 50 days post-hatch) with birds released to the wild; however, the pattern varied depending on the time post-release. While DNA-based inbreeding coefficient was positively correlated with mortality to one month post-release, an opposite pattern was observed at nine months suggesting purging of deleterious alleles. I also investigated whether immunocompetence, or the ability to produce a normal immune response, was correlated with survival; however, no significant correlation was observed suggesting that inbreeding was a more important factor influencing survival. Pairing individuals for breeding by minimizing DNA-based parental relatedness values resulted in a significant increase in chick survival. This study highlights the importance of using DNA-based methods to avoid inbreeding depression when errors exist in the pedigree...|$|R
40|$|Unambiguous gender {{identification}} (ID) {{is needed}} to assess parameters in studies of population dynamics, behavior, and evolutionary biology of Caribbean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber ruber) and other birds. Due to its importance for management and conservation, molecular (DNA-based) avian gender ID assays targeting intron-size differences of the Chromosome Helicase ATPase DNA Binding (CHD) gene of males (CHD-Z) and females (CHD-W) have been developed. Male (ZZ) and female (WZ) genotypes are usually scored as size polymorphisms through agarose or acrylamide gels. For certain species, W-specific restriction sites or multiplex polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) involving CHD-W specific primers are needed. These approaches involve {{a minimum of three}} steps following DNA isolation: PCR, gel electrophoresis, and photo-documentation, which limit high throughput scoring and automation potential. In here, a short amplicon (SA) High-resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA) assay for avian gender ID is developed. SA-HRMA of an 81 -Base Pair (bp) segment differentiates heteroduplex female (WZ) from homoduplex male (ZZ) genotypes by targeting Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) instead of intron-size differences between CHD-Z and CHD-W genes. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, the gender of Caribbean Flamingo (P. ruber ruber) (17 captive from the Dallas Zoo and 359 wild from Ria Lagartos, Yucatan, Mexico) was determined. The assay was also tested on specimens of Lesser Flamingo (P. minor), Chilean Flamingo (P. chilensis), Saddle-billed Stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber), White-bellied Stork (Ciconia abdimii), Roseate Spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), Marabou Stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), Greater Roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), and Attwater's Prairie Chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri).</b> Although the orthologous 81 bp segments of Z and W are highly conserved, sequence alignments with 50 avian species across 15 families revealed mismatches affecting one or more nucleotides within the SA-HRMA forward or reverse primers. Most mismatches were located along the CHD-Z gene that may generate heteroduplex curves and thus gender ID errors. For such cases, taxon and species-specific primer sets were designed. The SA-HRMA gender ID assay can be used in studies of avian ecology and behavior, to assess sex-associated demographics and migratory patterns, and as a proxy to determine the health of the flock and the degree by which conservation and captive breeding programs are functioning...|$|R
40|$|Once {{abundant}} in the Texas and Louisiana coastal prairie, currently the Attwater?s Prairie Chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri,</b> APC) is close to extinction. Efforts to {{increase the size of}} the remaining populations at the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge (APCNWR) and the Galveston Bay Prairie Preserve (GBPP) with releases of captive-reared individuals are part of the APC captive- breeding initiative. However, after a decade of yearly releases, the populations are not reaching viable sizes. I analyzed post-release survival data of individuals released at the APCNWR from 1996 to 2005. Results suggest that age at release or date of release had little influence on survival of captive-breed APC. At two weeks post-release, survival estimates (SE) were 0. 76 (0. 03) for females and 0. 82 (0. 04) for males. Approximately 50 % of the females and 33 % of the males died within the first 60 days post-release. Survivorship during the breeding season showed that male survival (0. 36) was higher than female survival (0. 23). Survivorship from the median release date to beginning of the breeding season was 52 % for males and 39 % for females. Mean female survival was 155 days, while median survival was 94 days. For males, mean survival was 135 days and the median was 81 days. Results from a stochastic simulation model, which was developed based on the survival analysis of APC on the APCNWR, confirmed that releasing individuals closer {{to the beginning of the}} breeding season and sex ratio at release had little effect on population growth. Regardless of the number of individuals released annually, population sizes immediately prior to the release dates were only 11 ? 12 % of the population sizes immediately after the release dates. At current mortality rates, simulated APC populations could not sustain themselves even if reproductive parameters were increased to the maximum rates reported for APC, or to the maximum rates reported for the closely related Greater prairie chicken. Based on these results, the APC may face extinction within the next decade unless conservation efforts succeed on increasing reproductive success and greatly reducing mortality rates...|$|R
40|$|Northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) {{have been}} declining {{throughout}} their range since the 1960 s. The {{decline in the}} Gulf Prairies and Marshes Ecoregion (GPM) has primarily {{been the result of}} habitat loss and fragmentation. With the population already reduced, additional causes of quail decline become important issues. In 1957, red imported fire ants (RIFA, Solenopsis invicta) began to invade the GPM. RIFA can potentially affect bobwhites by direct predation of pipping chicks, reduced survival of young chicks, and competition for food. Eastern cottontails are another important species that could be impacted by RIFA. Previous work has documented RIFA predation of altricial young born in pen-raised cottontail nests. The Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge in Colorado County, Texas received large-scale aerial treatment of RIFA with Extinguish Plus? insecticide as a management action for the endangered Attwater?s prairie-chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri).</b> This presented me with an opportunity to evaluate the effects of RIFA treatment on: (1) bobwhite nest success and brood survival, (2) bobwhite abundance and density, (3) bobwhite movements and ranges, and (4) cottontail numbers. An additional objective was to (5) contribute reference data for bobwhite in the GPM to address this region?s lack of data. To investigate these objectives bobwhites were radio-collared and tracked, RIFA were sampled, and cottontails were surveyed in both the treated and non-treated areas. Treatment with Extinguish Plus? successfully reduced the abundance of RIFA in iii the treated area from 2014 ? 2017. However, I found that flooding can negate the effectiveness of the treatment when the treated area is surrounded by adjacent non-treated areas. Bobwhite densities were 76. 6 % higher (P = 0. 042) in the treated area compared to the non-treated area. There was no difference between bobwhite consecutive movements (P = 0. 275) or seasonal ranges (P = 0. 783) in the treated and non-treated area. However, there was a difference (P = < 0. 001) by category. Nesting season females without a brood had larger movements (P = < 0. 001) than nesting season females with a brood and larger movements (P = 0. 002) than pre-nesting females. Cottontail numbers were higher (P = 0. 003) in the non-treated than the treated area...|$|R

(Pasteurelia multocida) and Trichostrongylus tenuis, may be responsible for the continuing decline of the endangered Attwater's prairie-chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri).</b> Because geese are known to contract these and other diseases of concern, 10 Canada (Branta canadensis), 24 snow (Chen caerulescens), and 22 white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) were examined for endoparasites. Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) (n = 62), the closest relative of Attwater's prairie-chickens with sympatric range, were examined for ectoparasites, endoparasites, and hemoparasites and serologically tested for 8 infectious diseases. Autopsies of 4 Attwater's prairie-chickens were performed. Geese harbored 3 cestode, 7 nematode, and 3 trematode species. Gizzard worms (Amidostomum anseris, A. spatulatum, or Epomidiostomum crami) infected 53 of 54 examined gizzards. Trichostrongylus tenuis was found in 4 of 13 geese examined. Gizzard worms frequently caused obvious localized damage to the gizzard lining; other parasite species did not appear to cause pathology. Northern bobwhite harbored I cestode, 4 nematode, and numerous unidentified lice and mite species. Raillietina spp. was found in 27 of 62 northern bobwhite, Strongyloides avium in 20 of 62, and T. tenuis in 60 of 62. Parasites did not appear to cause pathology in northern bobwhite. There was no significant (P < 0. 05) correlation of parasite intensity and host weight for either geese or northern bobwhite. All hematologic tests and serologic tests were negative. Dispharynx nasuta was found in I of 3 and T. tenuis in all 3 Attwater's prairie-chickens examined for these parasites. Intensity of T. tenuis exceeded 1, 100 in 2 individuals. Numerous unidentified lice and mites were taken from I bird. Geese appeared to harbor less potentially harmful parasites for the Attwater's prairie-chicken than did northern bobwhite. It is recommended that further examination of Attwater's prairie-chicken, sympatric northern bobwhite, and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) for disease agents be conducted.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of pen-reared Attwater's prairie-chickens (APC, <b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri)</b> {{into the wild}} to supplement existing populations has met with marginal success. Flight characteristics, predator avoidance behavior, and rearing methods are possible factors contributing to post-release mortality of pen-reared birds. To evaluate flight characteristics and predator avoidance behavior of pen-reared APC's released onto the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge, flight characteristics and predator avoidance behavior of pen-reared APC's was compared to wild greater prairie-chickens (GPC, T. c. pinnatus) in Minnesota and Kansas using a radar gun and a trained dog. There was no difference (P = 0. 134) in flight speed for pen-reared APC and wild GPC. However, wild GPC had greater (P < 0. 001) flight distances than did pen-reared APC. Wild GPC and pen-reared APC that had survived in the wild {{for at least a}} year flushed at a greater (P < 0. 001) distance from an approaching human than did pen-reared APC that had been released for less than 3 months. A trained dog was able to approach closer (P < 0. 001) to APC than GPC before birds flushed, and APC did not fly as far as GPC after being flushed by the dog. Pen-reared APC displayed flight endurance deficiencies and were more approachable by humans and a dog before they flushed when compared to wild GPC, which could explain their increased mortality when released into the wild. To determine if APC chicks could be reared without daily human contact, pelleted food, and water in founts, a greenhouse was used to rear chicks in a semi-natural environment. Planted vegetation and commercial insects provided hiding cover and a food source for the APC chicks. An underground heat source provided chick warmth, and water misters and a sprinkler system simulated dew (a water source for chicks) and rain. The greenhouse provided chicks protection from predators and adverse weather conditions (before they could thermo-regulate) while exposing chicks to natural sunlight, day length, and temperature fluctuations. This technique allowed chicks to be reared in a semi-natural environment which reinforced their natural foraging behavior for food and water, and reinforced their hiding and avoidance behaviors, creating a wilder pen-reared bird...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A problem encountered by captive breeding facilities attempting to save the Attwater's prairie chicken (APC; <b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri)</b> from extinction is infection with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). REV is known to be immunosuppressive. However the factors contributing to immunosuppression in infected birds are not fully understood. Understanding the effects of REV infection on the immune system of these birds is crucial in understanding the pathogenesis of this virus. The objective of this project was to develop a method to monitor CD 4 ? and CD 8 ? T cells in prairie chickens and to determine if there was an alteration in the number of circulating T cells associated with REV infection in prairie chickens. A panel of anti-chicken monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was screened for reactivity to prairie chicken leukocytes using indirect fluorescent labeling and bow cytometry analysis. Monoclonal antibodies reactive to prairie chicken leukocytes were used to characterize white blood cells in the peripheral blood of prairie chickens. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from REV infected and uninfected APC were examined to determine if there were differences in T-lymphocyte subpopulations. There were no statistically significant (P < 0. 05) differences in the percentage of CD 8 ? T cells, macrophages and thrombocytes, and leukocytes between PBMC from REV infected and uninfected APC. However, the percentage of PBMC labeled by anti-CD 4 mAb were significantly lower in the REV infected APC compared to the uninfected APC (P = 0. 0018). These data indicate that REV infection in APC is associated with a drop in CD 4 ? T cells, therefore suggesting a contributing factor to immunosuppressive. CD 4 ? T cells are pivotal in an immune response to viral infection in their ability to either stimulate B cells to produce antibody or to activate cytotoxic T cells. Hence, a loss of these cells can be detrimental to an animal. This is the first report identifying leukocyte phenotypes in prairie chickens using anti-chicken monoclonal antibodies and of a decrease of CD 4 ? T cells in REV infected birds...|$|R

High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from over 40 chorioallantoic membranes (CAMS) of hatched Attwater's prairie chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri),</b> (APC), eggshells and successfully utilized in DNA fingerprint analyses. In 3 instances, CAM and brain tissue from the same individual were available. In each case, identical fingerprint profiles were produced by CAM DNA and brain tissue DNA from the same individual. Thus, CAM DNA provides a non-invasive means of genetically sampling the endangered APC and other avian species. DNA fingerprint data also were used to assess captive and natural populations of APC. DNA fingerprints were used to determine the sex (n = 33 juveniles) and identify the mother (n;= 5) of captively produced birds. These data also revealed that a bird, recently brought into captivity, had been incorrectly identified in terms of the clutch from which it came. Levels of genetic variability in the 3 remaining natural APC populations were assessed with DNA fingerprint similarity data produced from 2 minisatellite probes. Mean similarity (. a) within the Refugio-County population was lowest (0. 293 + 0. 023, n = 4) and that within the Galveston-County population was highest (0. 457 + 0. 090, n = 12). The Colorado-County population exhibited an intermediate mean-similarity value (0. 363 + 0. 090, n = 11). Genetic variation in a stable population of non-endangered greater prairie chickens (T. C. pinnatus), (GPC), was similarly evaluated (S = 0. 280 -+ 0. 025, n = 19). Both the Galveston-County and Colorado-County APC populations exhibited a mean similarity significantly different from the GPC population (P < 0. 01, P = 0. 01, respectively), indicating loss of genetic variability in these populations. Comparison of mean similarity among GPC with that of the entire extant APC subspecies indicates the APC subspecies has a significantly higher mean similarity (P < 0. 001). Estimates of heterozygosity and population differentiation give corresponding results. At least 2 APC populations have suffered a reduction in genetic variability, presumably as a result of prolonged small size. However, this {{does not seem to be}} a major factor contributing to the subspecies, decline...|$|R

40|$|Population {{introduction}} is {{an important}} tool for ecosystem restoration. However, before introductions should be conducted, {{it is important to}} evaluate the genetic, phenotypic and ecological suitability of possible replacement populations. Careful genetic analysis is particularly important if it is suspected that the extirpated population was unique or genetically divergent. On the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the introduction of greater prairie chickens (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> pinnatus) to replace the extinct heath hen (T. cupido cupido) is being considered as part of an ecosystem restoration project. Martha's Vineyard was home to the last remaining heath hen population until its extinction in 1932. We conducted this study to aid in determining the suitability of greater prairie chickens as a possible replacement for the heath hen. We examined mitochondrial control region sequences from extant populations of all prairie grouse species (Tympanuchus) and from museum skin heath hen specimens. Our data suggest that the Martha's Vineyard heath hen population represents a divergent mitochondrial lineage. This result is attributable either to a long period of geographical isolation from other prairie grouse populations or to a population bottleneck resulting from human disturbance. The mtDNA diagnosability of the heath hen contrasts with the network of mtDNA haplotypes of other prairie grouse (T. <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri,</b> T. pallidicinctus and T. phasianellus), which do not form distinguishable mtDNA groupings. Our findings suggest that the Martha's Vineyard heath hen was more genetically isolated than are current populations of prairie grouse and place the emphasis for future research on examining prairie grouse adaptations to different habitat types to assess ecological exchangeability between heath hens and greater prairie chickens...|$|R
50|$|Prairie {{chickens}} were indiscriminately {{introduced to}} the Eastern Seaboard after the heath hen was gone from the mainland, but failed to thrive. There exist {{a considerable number of}} supposed heath hen specimens in public collections today, but many - all mainland specimens and those with insufficient locality information - cannot be unequivocally assumed to be heath hens. For example, a mere 7 unequivocal heath hen eggs - equivalent to a very small clutch - are known to be held in public collections today. That the genus Tympanuchus apparently evolved rapidly and therefore has high morphological but low genetic distinctness between taxa further complicates research. It is also important to note that while introductions of the greater prairie chicken (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> pinnatus) were occurring, true heath hens (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> cupido) are distinct enough in morphological features to be separated from the greater prairie chicken. Taking a generous starting date of ~1810 when introductions could have started, and taking into account that Lewis and Clark did not even return from their expedition until 1806, gives roughly a 60-year period of possible introductions. From an evolutionary biology aspect, in a 60, or even 100-year timeframe, a species like the greater prairie chicken {{would not have been able}} to evolve to the point where he would so closely resemble the native heath hen that he could not be distinguished.|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} {{predation}} by a raptor is determined {{in a large}} part by {{the vulnerability of the}} prey. Many ecological factors influence the vulnerability of prey, such as habitat quality, prey density, prey health, predator behavior, predator density and the accessibility of an area to predators. I use vulnerability similarly to Craighead and Craighead (1969) : the sum of the environmental conditions that allow a species to be preyed on. For example, even with large prey densities in a prairie, if the vegetation provides cover and protects the prey from aerial hunting or perched raptors, the prey population is less vulnerable to predation. Prey vulnerability can be affected by the ecology of the predator species as well. If a predator is unable to use an area then the prey are not vulnerable even if the vegetation does not provide protection for the prey species. Habitat use by prey and predators plays a crucial part in predator-prey interactions. An ecological approach can be used to modify the hunting behavior of a predator, such as hunting forays from a perch, by altering the natural interactions of predators and prey with their habitats (Herkert 1994, Jimenez and Conover 2001). Habitat can be altered to enhance cover for a prey species or to limit the hunting effectiveness of the predator species (Greenwood and Sovada 1996, Schroeder and Baydack 2001). Habitat alteration to modify predators 2 ̆ 7 ability to search for prey species has been widely used by managers who work with prairie-nesting waterfowl (Greenwood and Sovada 1996). Currently most management plans for prairie grouse recommend management such as increased vegetation around nesting areas, and flooding of marshes to reduce predation (Westemeier and Gough 1999, Schroeder and Baydack 2001). The Attwater 2 ̆ 7 s prairie chickens (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> <b>attwateri)</b> are the most endangered birds in the 48 conterminous states. Attwater 2 ̆ 7 s prairie chickens (APC) numbers once estimated to be nearly 1 million (Lehmann 1941) have declined dramatically reaching an estimated low of 42 in 1996. On the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge (APCNWR), the estimate was eight birds in spring surveys of 1998. This dramatic decline was driven by habitat loss through conversion to unusable habitat, habitat fragmentation, and invasion of natural habitat by woody shrubs and trees (Lehmann 1941, U. S. Fish and Wildl. Servo 1993). Starting with a pilot project in 1995 captive-raised APC have been released yearly on the APCNWR. In 1997, I participated in radio tracking of released captive-raised APC on the APCNWR. Predation accounted for {{a significant portion of the}} mortalities post-release, especially during the first 30 days. Great homed owls (Bubo virginianus) were identified as one of the primary predators (Lockwood 1998, pers. obs.). Current predator management includes exclosures around known nests and lethal removal of coyotes, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and other potential predatory mammal species. Because great homed owls prey on released APC, management attention must be given to them as well. This study focused on evaluation of management practices hypothesized to reduce great homed owl predation. Two recent publications review predation and predator management. Newton (1998) authored 2 ̆ 2 Population Limitations In Birds 2 ̆ 2 and the 2001 Wildlife Society Bulletin issue 29 : 1 - 69, provided a special section to review avian predation of gallinaceous birds and the related predator control. These publications provide examples ranging from predator management being beneficial for increasing prey numbers or breeding success to examples of no significant success. Two conclusions from these publications are particularly relevant to my research. The first is that most predator management programs do not collect data about the target predators prior to implementation of efforts and therefore lack a quantitative basis for planning the management. This void of basic information results in not understanding the specific situation and therefore, whether or not predator management is likely to be effective. I address this issue by collecting basic ecological information about great homed owl use of the APCNWR. The second conclusion concerning management options is that the gains of lethal predator control are limited to the time the target predator(s) is being removed, and therefore, habitat management generally has a longer lasting effect than predator removal (Greenwood and Sovada 1996). I address the issue option of habitat manipulation as a management option with an experiment to reduce hunting perches on sections of the refuge. The reduction of perches might have a positive effect in controlling great homed owl use of the refuge and thus, their ability to hunt released APC. I collected data with the goal to provide fundamental information about the use of the refuge by great homed owls and assess the feasibility of perch-manipulation as a management option so managers can make informed predator management decisions concerning owls. This research was conducted to address the specific needs of the APCNWR, but the results should have implications in any prairie habitat. In the following chapters I describe this research and make suggestions concerning great homed owl management on the APCNWR. In Chapter 1, I describe the development and testing of a new survey method to collect information about great homed nocturnal habitat use. I conducted a point count (Ralph et al. 1995) using a spotlight to illuminate a field of vision. Radio tracking (Nicolls and Wamer 1966) and broadcast surveys (Fuller and Mosher 1987) are common methods of collecting information about owls, but often they do not provide exact locations of the owls. I found that the spotlight survey provided information about specific habitat use, such as perching. This survey method also provided information that contributed to understanding the extent of use of the APCNWR by great horned owls and important results from the perch-manipulation experiment I ultimately performed. In Chapter 2, I address basic questions related to distribution and habitat use of great horned owls on the APCNWR. I collected this information to improve the basis for management options concerning great homed owls on the APCNWR. I found that great horned owls occurred throughout the refuge, while APC use was largely restricted to the prairie. This is important because it allows for a potential alternative to lethal predator removal. That is, management of great horned owl predation can be achieved by restricting their use of the prairie habitat and, thus potentially reducing mortality of APC. In Chapter 3, I describe the experiment I conducted to test the hypothesis that removing and placing deterrents on great horned owl hunting perches would reduce owl use of manipulated habitat, and thereby reduce their predation of released APC in those areas. I used a spotlight survey, telemetry location estimates, and incidental observations. I also conducted daylight surveys to assess diurnal raptor use of those same areas. I conclude that perch-manipulation reduced use of treatment areas by great homed owls and other raptors. To summarize my research, I found that a spotlight survey in open habitat is a viable method to locate great homed owls. I documented that great horned owls used virtually all of the habitats within the APCNWR. I found that habitat management, specifically removal of potential perches and placing perching deterrents on fence posts, reduced the use of treated habitat by great horned owls. As a result of limiting the ability of great homed owls to use an area I reduced the number of APC mortalities attributed to owls in those areas. This study also provides an example of the benefit of assessing the ecology of predators prior to implementing management. I conclude that perch-manipulation will be less costly, have longer lasting results, and more effective for managing great homed owls than lethal control or transplanting...|$|R
30|$|Losses may be {{acceptable}} if the long-term {{benefits to the}} habitat increase fitness in individuals within the population that survive or immigrate into the burned area. The biggest concern about mortality caused by fire is the potential loss of an entire population of a rare species. One such example involves the last population of eastern prairie chickens (<b>Tympanuchus</b> <b>cupido</b> cupido) in the eastern US. In 1916, a brush fire burned {{the center of the}} breeding grounds of the heath hen (estimated population of approximately 2000) on Martha’s Vineyard. This was followed by a severe winter during which high numbers of goshawks (Accipiter gentilus) preyed on the heath hens and then the population suffered an outbreak of blackhead disease. By 1927, only 13 heath hens were left, and these gradually disappeared (Halladay 1978).|$|R

We found that NCA did not perform well in the presence of bottleneck events, although it did recover some genetic signals associated with increased isolation and the extinction of intermediate populations.

40|$|Until {{recently}} the severe {{decline in the}} populations of many species of grassland birds in eastern North America has aroused relatively little concern or conservation action.

Extensive grasslands resulted from burning and agricultural clearing by Native Americans.
