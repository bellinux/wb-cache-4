5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: <b>tantalite,</b> microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. <b>Tantalite</b> (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. <b>Tantalite</b> has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called <b>tantalite</b> and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of <b>tantalite</b> and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum, always {{together}} with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in the minerals <b>tantalite,</b> columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and <b>tantalite).</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{steps are}} {{involved}} in the extraction of tantalum from <b>tantalite.</b> First, the mineral is crushed and concentrated by gravity separation. This is generally carried out near the mine site.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria {{also has}} {{a wide array of}} underexploited mineral {{resources}} which include natural gas, coal, bauxite, <b>tantalite,</b> gold, tin, iron ore, limestone, niobium, lead and zinc. Despite huge deposits of these natural resources, the mining industry in Nigeria is still in its infancy.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8g/cm3, {{and concluded that the}} two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two different elements in the <b>tantalite</b> sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe) and pelopium (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium, and dianium were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.|$|E
25|$|Coltan (short for columbitetantalite {{and known}} industrially as <b>tantalite)</b> is a dull black {{metallic}} ore {{from which the}} elements niobium and tantalum are extracted. The niobium-dominant mineral in coltan is columbite (after niobium's original American name, columbium), and the tantalum-dominant mineral is <b>tantalite.</b>|$|E
25|$|From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of {{economic}} growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its <b>tantalite,</b> 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used {{in the production of}} tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves. Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite. As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place {{on the heels of the}} global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity.|$|E
500|$|Tantalum was {{discovered}} in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg. One year earlier, Charles Hatchett had discovered columbium (now niobium), and in 1809 the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared its oxide, columbite with a density of 5.918 g/cm3, to that of tantalum, <b>tantalite</b> with a density of 7.935 g/cm3. He concluded that the two oxides, despite their difference in measured density, were identical and kept the name tantalum. After Friedrich Wöhler confirmed these results, {{it was thought that}} columbium and tantalum were the same element. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two additional elements in the <b>tantalite</b> sample, and he named them after the children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe, the goddess of tears), and pelopium (from Pelops). The supposed element [...] "pelopium" [...] was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium, and {{it was found that the}} niobium was identical to the columbium already discovered in 1801 by Hatchett.|$|E
500|$|The primary mining of {{tantalum}} is in Australia, {{where the}} largest producer, Global Advanced Metals, {{formerly known as}} Talison Minerals, operates two mines in Western Australia, Greenbushes in the Southwest and Wodgina in the Pilbara region. The Wodgina mine was reopened in January 2011 after mining at the site was suspended in late-2008 due to the global financial crisis. Less {{than a year after}} it reopened, Global Advanced Metals announced that due to again [...] "... softening tantalum demand ...", and other factors, tantalum mining operations were to cease at the end of February 2012. Wodgina produces a primary tantalum concentrate which is further upgraded at the Greenbushes operation before being sold to customers. Whereas the large-scale producers of niobium are in Brazil and Canada, the ore there also yields a small percentage of tantalum. Some other countries such as China, Ethiopia, and Mozambique mine ores with a higher percentage of tantalum, and they produce a significant percentage of the world's output of it. Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by-product of the tin mining there. During gravitational separation of the ores from placer deposits, not only is cassiterite (SnO2) found, but a small percentage of <b>tantalite</b> also included. The slag from the tin smelters then contains economically useful amounts of tantalum, which is leached from the slag.|$|E
2500|$|Mining {{operations}} in the Pilbara preceded those at Coolgardie with gold, tin, lead, zinc, <b>tantalite,</b> antimony and bismuth being among the minerals chipped from the Pilbara rocks and sands during this period. The miners needed equipment, large and small. Small stores and hotels alongside prospecting sites retailed food, drink, clothing and other supplies which were brought in by camels as well as teams of horses and bullocks and, eventually, by rail from the Whim Creek wharves. Five years after [...] the shifting of the port to Port Hedland, a new rail link was made to Marble Bar.|$|E
50|$|Coltan (short for {{columbite}} - <b>tantalite</b> {{and known}} industrially as <b>tantalite)</b> is a dull black metallic ore {{from which the}} elements niobium and tantalum are extracted.

50|$|Tantalum {{occurs in}} the {{minerals}} <b>tantalite</b> and columbite (columbium being an archaic name for niobium), which occur in pegmatites, an igneous rock formation. Mixtures of columbite and <b>tantalite</b> are called coltan. <b>Tantalite</b> was discovered by Anders Gustaf Ekeberg at Ytterby, Sweden, and Kimoto, Finland. The minerals microlite and pyrochlore contain approximately 70% and 10% Ta, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Tapiolite is {{very close}} to {{columbite}} and <b>tantalite.</b> Those minerals have the same chemical composition, but different crystal symmetry orthorhombic for <b>tantalite</b> or columbite and tetragonal for tapiolite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tantalite</b> {{occurs in}} {{granitic}} pegmatites that {{are rich in}} rare-earth elements, and in placer deposits derived from such rocks. It {{has been found in}} Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia (Guainía and Vichada), Egypt, northern Europe, Madagascar, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, the United States (California, Colorado, Maine, and Virginia), and Zimbabwe. Brazil has the world's largest reserve of <b>tantalite</b> (52.1%). In 2006, 75% of world <b>tantalite</b> production came from Australia.|$|E
5000|$|The mineral group <b>tantalite</b> Mn)Ta2O6 is {{the primary}} source of the {{chemical}} element tantalum. It is chemically similar to columbite, and the two are often grouped together as a semi-singular mineral called coltan or [...] "columbite-tantalite" [...] in many mineral guides. However, <b>tantalite</b> has a much greater specific gravity than columbite (8.0+ compared to columbite's 5.2). Iron-rich <b>tantalite</b> is the mineral tantalite-(Fe) or ferrotantalite and manganese-rich is tantalite-(Mn) or manganotantalite.|$|E
50|$|In 1923 Lady Moulden became {{interested}} in <b>tantalite,</b> a rare mineral found in the Northern Territory and at Wodgina in Western Australia. <b>Tantalite</b> was scarce throughout the world, {{and the price of}} tantalum was enormous; she saw the wealth that it could bring to Australia, particularly if it was processed in Australia, but the government was not particularly interested in the idea. She founded <b>Tantalite</b> Ltd which was incorporated in 1932. In World War II her tantalum was used in developing radar; the need for it became so obvious to the previously reluctant Commonwealth government that it resumed <b>Tantalite</b> Ltd {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E
50|$|Columbite has {{the same}} {{composition}} and crystal symmetry (orthorhombic) as <b>tantalite.</b> In fact, the two are often grouped together as a semi-singular mineral series called columbite-tantalite or coltan in many mineral guides.

5000|$|Columbite and <b>Tantalite</b> are ores used {{to produce}} the {{elements}} niobium and tantalum. Columbite and <b>tantalite</b> are collectively known as coltan in Africa. Tantalum is a valuable rare element used in electronics manufacturing. In Nigeria, pegmatite deposits of coltan are frequently also the source of several precious and semi-precious stones such as beryl, aquamarine, and tourmaline. These pegmatites are found in Nassarawa State near the Jos Plateau, {{as well as in}} several areas in southeast Nigeria. There is small-scale mining of these minerals.
