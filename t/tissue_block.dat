40|$|A current {{injection}} pattern in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) {{has its own}} current distribution profile within the domain under test. Hence, different current patterns have different sensitivity, spatial resolution and distinguishability. Image reconstruction studies with practical phantoms are essential to assess the performance of EIT systems for their validation, calibration and comparison purposes. Impedance imaging of real tissue phantoms with different current injection methods is also essential for better assessment of the biomedical EIT systems. Chicken tissue paste phantoms and chicken <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> phantoms are developed and the resistivity image reconstruction is studied with different current injection methods. A 16 -electrode array is placed inside the phantom tank and the tank is filled with chicken muscle tissue paste or chicken tissue blocks as the background mediums. Chicken fat tissue, chicken bone, air hole and nylon cylinders are used as the inhomogeneity to obtained different phantom configurations. A low magnitude low frequency constant sinusoidal current is injected at the phantom boundary with opposite and neighboring current patterns and the boundary potentials are measured. Resistivity images are reconstructed from the boundary data using EIDORS and the reconstructed images are analyzed with the contrast parameters calculated from their elemental resistivity profiles. Results show that the resistivity profiles of all the phantom domains are successfully reconstructed with a proper background resistivity and high inhomogeneity resistivity for both the current injection methods. Reconstructed images show that, for all the chicken tissue phantoms, the inhomogeneities are suitably reconstructed with both the current injection protocols though the chicken <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> phantom and opposite method are found more suitable. It is observed that the boundary potentials of the chicken <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> phantoms are higher than the chicken tissue paste phantom. SNR of the chicken <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> phantoms are found comparatively more and hence the chicken <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> phantom is found more suitable for its lower noise performance. The background noise is found less in opposite method for all the phantom configurations which yields the better resistivity images with high PCR and COC and proper IRMean and IRMax neighboring method showed higher noise level for both the chicken tissue paste phantoms and chicken <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> phantoms with all the inhomogeneities. Opposite method is found more suitable for both the chicken tissue phantoms, and also, chicken <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> phantoms are found more suitable compared to the chicken tissue paste phantom.

40|$|SummaryGastric cancer shows {{intratumoral}} heterogeneity {{for human}} {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor 2 expression. We evaluated {{whether the number of}} tissue blocks analyzed or the antibodies used may influence the immunohistochemical results in gastrectomy specimens. Clinicopathologic data from 148 patients receiving gastric surgery for cancer were collected. One <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> for each of 88 primary tumors and 60 paired primary tumors and metastases was examined for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status by immunohistochemistry using 3 different antibodies (HercepTest, CB 11, and 4 B 5) and by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Two additional tissue blocks of the primary tumor were tested by immunohistochemistry if the results were negative on the first <b>tissue</b> <b>block.</b> The concordance among the 3 antibodies was 94. 5 % (testing 1 <b>tissue</b> <b>block).</b> Two cases showed a clinically significant discrepancy between primary tumor (score 0) and lymph nodes metastases (score 3 +). Additional block analysis increased both the sensitivity (from 63 % to 83 %) and the accuracy (from 91 % to 94 %) of immunohistochemistry as compared with fluorescent in situ hybridization. The multiblock approach could potentially identify a greater number of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 –positive gastric cancers, particularly those with higher levels of intratumor heterogeneity. In turn, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity correlated with a worse prognosis (P =. 011) and was an independent variable in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1. 57). In conclusion, testing more than 1 <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> of cancer from specimens of gastric resection provides a more reliable human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 assessment regardless of the antibody used...|$|E

The 2 most common procedures to isolate cells for DNA extraction from paraffin-embedded tissues are scalpel microdissection and laser capture microdissection. A new tissue- and time-conserving method for rapid DNA isolation from small cores taken from paraffin-embedded <b>tissue</b> <b>blocks</b> is described in this report. Methods. DNA was {{extracted from}} small tissue cores collected from paraffin-embedded <b>tissue</b> <b>blocks</b> {{at the time of}} tissue microarray construction. The quality and quantity of the DNA extracted was compared to DNA collected by scalpel microdissection. DNA collected from tissue cores was used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. Results. The quality and quantity of DNA obtained using tissue cores was comparable to DNA obtained by traditional methods. The tissue core method of DNA extraction preserves the <b>tissue</b> <b>blocks</b> from which the cores are extracted for future use. Adequate quantities of DNA can be successfully extracted from small segments of tissue cores and used for PCR. DNA isolated by tissue microdissection and the tissue core method were comparable when used to assess allelic heterozygosity on chromosome arm 18 q. Conclusion. The tissue core method of DNA isolation is reliable, tissue conserving, and time effective. Tissue cores for DNA extraction can be harvested {{at the same time as}} tissue microarray construction.

40|$|Patients with metastatic {{colorectal}} cancer and KRAS mutation {{are unlikely to}} benefit from treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies, and testing for KRAS mutation in this setting is recommended. Pathologists have {{a crucial role in}} accurate testing for KRAS mutations, whether or not testing is performed in their own laboratory, as mutation analysis is performed on paraffin embedded tissue selected by the pathologists. The type of fixative used is a very important issue, as some fixatives do not allow molecular testing. Pathologists must select the most appropriate tumoral <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> for KRAS mutation analysis and hence, must know the sensitivity of the KRAS mutation detection methodology utilized in their reference laboratory. It is essential that they select a <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> that contains enough percentage of viable tumour cells, as false negative results will occur when the sample is contaminated with high levels of nontumour elements. Pathologists not only have to recognize the area of invasive carcinoma and distinguish it from non-invasive neoplastic components, but also have to estimate the percentage of necrotic debris and nontumoural elements. For tests that require a high percentage of tumour cells, macrodissection before extraction of nucleic acids is often indicated. The primary pathologists in addition are responsible for preparation of the pathology report for the <b>tissue</b> <b>block</b> on which the KRAS mutation analysis was performed and should transmit the results to the requesting clinician.
