50|$|Depression {{has quite}} a well-evidenced link with a {{decrease}} in the motive to self-enhance. Depressives are less able to self-enhance in response to negative feedback than non-depressive controls. Having a depressive disposition decreases the discrepancy between one's own estimates of one's virtues and the estimates of a neutral observer, namely by increasing modesty. Illusions of control are moderated by melancholy. However, whilst the self-ratings of depressives are more in line with those of neutral observers than <b>the</b> self <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> normals, <b>the</b> self <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> normals are more in line with those of friends and family than <b>the</b> self <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> depressives.|$|R

5|$|Publicity for IRIS in Japan {{was strong}} from its premiere and beyond. In late May 2010, {{a set of}} two concert events billed as {{dramatic}} live stage shows drew sold-out crowds that amounted to over 60,000 attendees. The concerts were a combination of live interviews {{with much of the}} primary cast, re-enactments of pivotal scenes from the series, and performances by the musical acts featured in its soundtrack. Broadcaster TBS revealed in June 2010 that airings of the series on its satellite offerings had broken records daily, doubling <b>the</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> its previous programs. Such was the influence of the series that flights between Seoul and Akita that had been nearing decommission were revitalized as a result of mounting tourist interest. Due to the commerce generated for Akita prefecture as a result of Iris having filmed there, local governments in Japan began competing for interest from producers in order to solicit tourists with future installments of the series.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies show}} that <b>the</b> {{unsolicited}} <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> S&P and Fitch are lower than <b>the</b> solicited <b>ratings</b> assigned by these two agencies. <b>The</b> unsolicited <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> S&P and Fitch are based on publicly available information for a firm. However, no previous study has examined <b>the</b> unsolicited <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> Moody's because Moody's does not disclose whether its ratings are solicited or unsolicited. Using Moody's solicited and unsolicited ratings collected from a survey of Japanese firms, we find that unsolicited credit ratings are still lower than solicited ratings even though firms with unsolicited ratings provide Moody's {{with some degree of}} inside information. We also compare <b>the</b> unsolicited <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> S&P with those of Moody's and find that Moody's ratings are no different than those assigned by S&P although S&P's unsolicited ratings are based on public information. Therefore, we conclude that, regardless of the rating agency, unsolicited ratings are lower than solicited ratings because firms with unsolicited ratings provide incomplete private information to rating agencies.

25|$|The {{most direct}} evidence, {{according}} to Kahneman, is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of TomW., a fictional graduate student. One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student {{in each of}} nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate how {{likely it is that}} Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the base rates, i.e., the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom {{is more likely to be}} a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> likelihood matched <b>the</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.|$|E
