40|$|This {{study was}} {{proposed}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of different cell designs and hydrodynamic conditions of the flow-through cell (FTC), USP dissolution Apparatus 4, on the release rate of a sustained-release product. Sustained-release (SR) diclofenac sodium (DS), 100 mg/tablet, was selected for this study. Different cell sizes and types, the flow rate of dissolution medium, and the <b>tablet</b> <b>position</b> within the FTC were considered. Results revealed {{that some of these}} variables affect the release rate of DS. It was obvious that the turbulent flow of the dissolution medium resulted in a higher DS release rate compared with the laminar flow. In addition, the results show that the drug release rate decreased when the tablet was buried in the glass beads compared with the unburied tablet. On the other hand, variables such as cell size (12 -mm and 22. 6 -mm diameter), flow rates (8 and 16 mL/min), and presence of a tablet holder had a negligible role in drug release rate...|$|E
40|$|Background : Modern {{medical imaging}} {{modalities}} can trace labelled oral drug dosage {{forms in the}} gastrointestinal tract, and thus represent important tools {{for the evaluation of}} their in vivo performance. The application of gastric-retentive drug delivery systems to improve bioavailability and to avoid unwanted plasma peak concentrations of orally administered drugs is of special interest in clinical and pharmaceutical research. Aim : To determine the influence of meal composition and timing of tablet administration on the intragastric performance of a gastric-retentive floating tablet using magnetic resonance imaging in the sitting position. Methods : A tablet formulation was labelled with iron oxide particles as negative magnetic resonance contrast marker to allow the monitoring of the <b>tablet</b> <b>position</b> in the food-filled human stomach. Labelled tablet was administered, together with three different solid meals, to volunteers seated in a 0. 5 -T open-configuration magnetic resonance system. Volunteers were followed over a 4 -h period. Results : Labelled tablet was detectable in all subjects throughout the entire study. The tablet showed persistent good intragastric floating performance independent of meal composition. Unfavourable timing of tablet administration had a minor effect on the intragastric tablet residence time and floating performance. Conclusion : Magnetic resonance imaging can reliably monitor and analyse the in vivo performance of labelled gastric-retentive tablets in the human stomac...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine {{emergent}} technological practices relating to tablet computers in scientific research laboratories. I ask four main questions: To what extent can tablets be considered scientific instruments? How do tablets help to construct technoscientific imaginaries? What role do tablets {{play in the}} construction of technoscientific subjectivities? Can <b>tablets,</b> <b>positioned</b> as popular everyday computing devices, be considered in terms of expertise in the context of laboratory science? To answer these questions, research is presented that examines the situated practices of scientists using tablet computers. I use textual analysis to examine the marketing discourses relating to laboratory-specific tablet apps and how their material structure defines scientific community and communication. Ethnographic research into the way that tablets are being introduced as part of a new teaching laboratory in a large UK university is presented, focusing on how institutional power affects the definition of the tablet. A second ethnographic research case study addresses how two chemists define their own scientific subjectivity by constructing the tablet as a futuristic technology. In a third large ethnographic research case, I consider the way that tablets can be used in practices of inclusion and exclusion from sites of scientific knowledge. I draw on literature from media and cultural studies and science and technology studies, arguing that the two fields intersect in ways that can be productive for research in both. This serves as a contribution to knowledge, demonstrating how research into identity, politics and technologies can benefit from a focus on materiality drawn from the two disciplines. I contribute to knowledge in both fields by developing two key concepts, ‘affordance ambiguity’ and ‘tablet imaginary’. These concepts can be applied in the analysis of uses of technology to better understand, firstly, how technologies are made meaningful for users and, secondly, how this individual meaning-making affects broader cultural trends and understandings of technologies...|$|R
40|$|Designers of force-sensitive user {{interfaces}} lack a ground-truth characterization of input force while performing common touch gestures (zooming, panning, tapping, and rotating). This paper provides such a characterization firstly by deriving baseline force profiles in a tightly-controlled user study; then by examining how these profiles vary in different {{conditions such as}} form factor (mobile phone and <b>tablet),</b> interaction <b>position</b> (walking and sitting) and urgency (timed tasks and untimed tasks). We conducted two user studies with 14 and 24 participants respectively and report: (1) force profile graphs that depict the force variations of common touch gestures, (2) {{the effect of the}} different conditions on force exerted and gesture completion time, (3) the most common forces that users apply, and the time taken to complete the gestures.

This paper {{introduces}} {{a series of}} studies in which we analyze the impairments in a planar reaching task in human patients with severe proprioceptive deficits resulting from large-fiber sensory neuropathy. We studied three patients, all of whom showed absence of discriminative tactile sensation, position sense, and stretch re-flexes in the upper extremities. Muscle strength was normal. We compared the reaching movements of the patients with those of normal control subjects. The purpose of this first paper was to characterize the spatial errors in these patients that result primarily from impairments in the planning and execution of movement rather than in feedback control. This was done by using a task in which visual feedback of errors during movement was prevented. 2.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an inexpensive}} position input device called the FieldMouse, with which a computer {{can tell the}} position of the device on paper or any flat surface without using special input <b>tablets</b> or <b>position</b> detection devices. A FieldMouse is a combination of an ID recognizer like a barcode reader and a mouse which detects relative movement of the device. Using a FieldMouse, a user first detects an ID on paper by using the barcode reader, and then drags it from the ID using the mouse. If the location of the ID is known, the location of the dragged FieldMouse can also be calculated by adding the amount of movement from the ID to {{the position of the}} FieldMouse. Using a FieldMouse in this way, any flat surface can work as a pointing device that supports absolute position input, just by putting an ID tag somewhere on the surface.

30|$|We are {{exploring}} the expressive potential of personal devices for social, multimodal displays: “multimedia juggling.” We originally experimented with using laptop sudden motion sensor control (Cohen 2008), 1 but eventually settled on tracking with mobile devices. Modern smartphones and <b>tablets</b> feature various <b>position</b> sensors, including triaxial gyroscope (to measure orientation) and accelerometer (to measure changing velocity), GPS sensor (to determine location), barometer (which which to infer altitude), and magnetometer (to gauge horizontal bearing). We describe a system here that basically senses orientation to modulate ambient media. “Twhirleds” (for ‘Twirled Whirled Worlds’) is a rotation-sensing mobile application using juggling-style affordances, supported by wireless network communication and a distributed suite of multimodal and mixed reality clients.|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether position sense acuity of the upper extremity and tracking performance, pen pressure and muscle activity in a tracking task are af-fected in subjects with neck and upper extremity pain. Methods: Twenty-three subjects with neck and upper extrem-ity pain and 26 healthy controls participated in the study. Position sense acuity of the upper extremity was measured while subjects pointed at targets, without vision of their arm and hand. In the computer tracking task, subjects were in-structed to position a cursor within a moving target dot, us-ing a pen on a <b>tablet.</b> Results: <b>Position</b> sense acuity of the upper extremity was im-paired in subjects with pain. Their variable error was 20 – 30 % larger than in healthy controls. Subjects with pain also showed reduced tracking precision. Both the mean and the standard deviation of the distance to target were significant-ly larger in subjects with pain than in healthy controls, 10 % and 13 % respectively. No differences between groups were found in pen pressure and muscle activity during tracking. Conclusion: The results suggest that subjects with pain are limited in performing precision tasks due to impaired po-sition sense of the upper extremity, but do not compensate with increased effort.

30|$|Large displays/cave 3 D {{interaction}} {{in front of}} a large display is not much different to immersive VR with an HMD and some of the techniques used in immersive VR could be applied to large displays. However, the major difference with HMD’s and CAVE systems is that {{interaction in}} front of a large display often involves more than one user (e.g. a presenter and an audience, or two collaborators) and that makes it problematic to track the viewpoint. If the viewpoint cannot be tracked, implementation of ray-based techniques [26] becomes problematic because the ray does not look like it is emanating from the wand. Navidget [27], an alternative to ray techniques for large display interaction, uses 2 D input on a <b>tablet</b> to <b>position</b> the camera in a 3 D environment. Although this is similar to manipulating an object for inspection, their technique does not directly support object manipulation so it cannot be applied to collaborative scenarios (more than one users could not control the viewpoint simultaneously). The authors reported good usability for both novice and expert users based on questionnaires. Fröhlich [28] presented the cubic mouse, a box with three perpendicular rods passing through its center. The authors report positive reactions from participants, yet the device form factor makes it difficult to relax the non-dominant arm in a presentation as the rods can be accidentally pressed against the presenter’s body and thus induce accidental input.|$|R
40|$|Several {{sophisticated}} {{techniques to}} study in vivo GI transit and regional absorption of pharmaceuticals {{are available and}} increasingly used. Examples of such methods are Magnetic Marker Monitoring (MMM) and local drug administration with remotely operated capsules. Another approach is the paracetamol and sulfapyridine double marker method which utilizes observed plasma concentrations of the two substances as markers for GI transit. Common {{for all of these}} methods is that they generate multiple types of observations e. g. <b>tablet</b> GI <b>position,</b> drug release and plasma concentrations of one or more substances. This thesis is based on the hypothesis that application of mechanistic nonlinear mixed-effect models could facilitate {{a better understanding of the}} interrelationship between such variables and result improved predictions of the processes involved in oral absorption. Mechanistic modeling approaches have been developed for application to data from MMM studies, paracetamol and sulfapyridine double marker studies and for linking in vitro and in vivo drug release. Models for integrating information about tablet GI transit, in vivo drug release and drug plasma concentrations measured in MMM studies was outlined and utilized to describe drug release and absorption properties along the GI tract for felodipine and the investigational drug AZD 0837. A mechanistic link between in vitro and in vivo drug release was established by estimation of the mechanical stress in different regions of the GI tract in a unit equivalent to rotation speed in the in vitro experimental setup. The effect of atropine and erythromycin on gastric emptying and small intestinal transit was characterized with a semi-mechanistic model applied to double marker studies in fed and fasting dogs. The work with modeling of in vivo drug absorption has highlighted the need for, and led to, further development of mixed-effect modeling methodology with respect to model diagnostics and the handling of censored observations...|$|R
30|$|Following {{previous}} experiments, a Wacom Intuos 5 M-touch tablet {{has been}} {{chosen as the}} interface, allowing for bi-manual chironomic control: the <b>tablet</b> detects the <b>position</b> of the pen pressure over the 2 D plan, {{as well as the}} finger position over the surface. This interface is preferred for two main reasons. On the one hand, it is reactive, with no noticeable latency. The time resolution of the Wacom Intuos 5 M tablets is 5 ms with a pen and 20 ms with a finger. This resolution proved short enough to provide the player with the feeling of direct causality between gesture and sound, similar to that for an acoustical instrument. On the other hand, this interface provides a fine spatial resolution, avoiding noticeable quantization effects in parameter variation. Wacom Intuos 5 M tablets have a spatial resolution of 5080 lines per inch (0.005 mm) with a pen tip diameter of approximately 0.25 mm and 2048 levels of pressure. In addition, this interface allows for accurate, reproducible, and intuitive gestures. The pen tablet takes advantage of our writing ability, developed since childhood. The touch technology also takes advantage of the widespread habit of finger gestures on phones and computer tablets.|$|R

From left to right: desktop monitors at arbitrary <b>positions,</b> <b>tablet</b> with smartphones laid on top, {{a crowd of}} people with devices, smartphones arranged on a table. We present Phone as a Pixel: a scalable, synchronizationfree, platform-independent system for creating large, ad-hoc displays from a collection of smaller devices. In contrast to most tiled-display systems, the only requirement for participation is for devices to have an internet connection and a web browser. Thus, most smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar devices can be used. Phone as a Pixel uses a colortransition encoding scheme to identify and locate displays. This approach has several advantages: devices can be arbitrarily arranged (i. e., not in a grid) and infrastructure consists of a single conventional camera. Further, additional devices can join at any time without re-calibration. These are desirable properties to enable collective displays in contexts like sporting events, concerts and political rallies. In this paper we describe our system, show results from proofof-concept setups, and quantify the performance of our approach on hundreds of displays.

50|$|The first {{devices to}} {{accurately}} record handwriting {{that could be}} connected to computers were graphics tablet, or digitizer, x-y-tablet, graphics pad, with electronic pens {{as we know them}} today. Among the earliest tablets are theStyalator electronic tablet with pen for computer input and handwriting recognition in 1957 and the commercial products by Vector General. The Vector General products reported the position of the stylus at 100 Hz and claimed an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Typical <b>tablets</b> sense the <b>position</b> of the pen electromagnetically. Touch-sensitive tablets cannot be used when the hand is resting on the tablet unless they implement some form of hand rejection. Tablets can have a display built in (e.g., as in a tablet PC). Still today, handwriting tablets are the gold standard to record handwriting. Sampling rates used to be 100 Hz until it was decided that the minimum rate for Human Input Devices HID should be at least 133 Hz, bumping the sampling rates up to 133 - 200 Hz. The advantage is a 15%-40% reduction of device noise and quantization noise. The digitizer technology belongs to the most accurate and cost-effective pointing devices. Dynamic accuracy of 0.01 cm at constant frequency is achievable. Opaque tablets are produced by Wacom who also produces display digitizers, Euronovate SA, Hanvon, VisTablet, Adesso, Genius.|$|R
40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen wide spread {{adoption}} of outdoor positioning services, mainly GPS, being incorporated into everyday devices such as smartphones and <b>tablets.</b> While outdoor <b>positioning</b> has been well received by the public, its indoor counterpart has been mostly limited to private use due to its higher costs and complexity for setting up the proper environment. The objective {{of this research is}} to provide an affordable mean for indoor localization using wireless local area network (WLAN) Wi-Fi technology. We combined two different Wi-Fi approaches to locate a user. The first method involves the use of matching the pre-recorded received signal strength (RSS) from nearby access points (AP), to the data transmitted from the user on the fly. This is commonly known as "fingerprint matching". The second approach is a distance-based trilateration approach using three known AP coordinates detected on the user's device to derive the position. The combination of the two steps enhances the accuracy of the user position in an indoor environment allowing location-based services (LBS) such as mobile augmented reality (MAR) to be deployed more effectively in the indoor environment. The mapping of the RSS map can also prove useful to IT planning personnel for covering locations with no Wi-Fi coverage (ie. dead spots). The experiments presented in this research helps provide a foundation for the integration of indoor with outdoor positioning to create a seamless transition experience for users...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, most {{of speech}} synthesizers are those which require symbol inputs, such as TTS (Text-to-Speech) converters. The quality of {{synthesized}} speech sample produced by those speech synthesizers is improving. However, {{it still has}} some drawbacks, for example, in emotional speech synthesis or in expressive pitch control. On the other hand, synthesis methods which do not require symbol inputs, such as articulatory synthesis, are effective for continuous speech synthesis and pitch control based on dynamic body motion. Therefore they attract research interest and several applications have been proposed. A dysarthric engineer, Ken-ichiro Yabu, developed a unique speech generator by using a pen tablet. The F 1 -F 2 plane {{is embedded in the}} <b>tablet.</b> The pen <b>position</b> controls F 1 and F 2 of vowel sounds and the pen pressure controls their energy. Another example of speech generation from body motions is Glove Talk proposed by Sidney Fels. With two data gloves and some additional devices equipped to the user, body motions are transformed into parameters for a formant speech synthesizer. In this study, we consider the process of speech production as media conversion from body motions to sound motions. Recently, GMM-based speaker conversion techniques have been intensively studied, where the voice spaces of two speakers are mapped to each other and the mapping function is estimated based on a GMM. This technique was directly and successfully applied to estimate a mapping function between a space of tongue gestures and other speech sounds. This result naturally makes us expect that a mapping function between hand gestures and speech can be estimated as well. People usually use tongue gesture transitions to generate a speech stream. But previous works showed that tongue gestures, which are inherently mapped to speech sounds, are not always required to speak. What is needed is a voluntarily movable part of the body whose gestures can be technically mapped to speech sounds. However, Yabu and Fels use classical synthesizers, i. e. formant synthesizers. Partly inspired by the remarkable progress of voice conversion techniques and voice morphing techniques in this decade, we are developing a GMM-based Hand-to-Speech conversion system (H 2 S system). Unlike the current techniques, our new synthesis method does not limit the input media. Therefore, our technique would be useful in assistive technology, in which devices are tuned for person to person, and in performative field, in which people pursue the human capability of expression. In this study, we focus attention on the design of the system. As an initial trial, a mapping between hand gestures and Japanese vowel sounds was estimated so that topological features of the selected gestures in a feature space and those of the five Japanese vowels in a cepstrum space are equalized. Experiments showed that the special glove can generate good Japanese vowel transitions with voluntary control of duration and articulation. We also discussed how to extend this framework to consonants. The challenge here was to figure out appropriate gestures for consonant sounds when the gesture design for vowels is given. We found that inappropriate gesture designs for consonants result in a lack of smoothness in transitional segments of synthesized speech. We have considered the reason to be: (1) the positional relation between vowels and consonants in the gesture space and that in the speech space were not equivalent, (2) parallel data for transition parts from consonants to vowels did not correspond well. In order to solve those problems, we have developed a Speech-to-Hand conversion system (S 2 H system, the inverse system of H 2 S system) trained from parallel data for vowels only to infer the gestures corresponding to consonants. Listeners evaluated that an H 2 S system, which exploits gesture data for consonants derived from an S 2 H system, can generate more natural sounds than those trained with heuristic gesture design for consonants. Those natural speech generated by H 2 S system trained exploiting data generated by S 2 H system were, however, obtained only when input gestures were the same as the one which generated by S 2 H system. S 2 H system sometimes output gestures whose dynamic range is too large or which is not smooth enough. In those cases, it was difficult for users to form those gestures in realistic time. In this thesis, we compensated those problems with two ways: (1) reduce the dynamic range by setting the optimal weight for the gesture model (2) smooth the gesture trajectories by considering delta features. Exploiting parallel data for consonants derived from a S 2 H system, we also implemented a real-time Hand-to-Speech conversion system and evaluated the effectiveness. Subjective user evaluations showed that almost a half of the phonemes, which are generated by our H 2 S system are perceived correctly and that this system is effective enough to generate emotional speech. 音声合成技術は, TTSに代表される, 文字や記号を入力とする合成方式と, 調音音声合成に代表される, 文字や記号を介さない合成方式に大別される. 前者と比較して後者は, 運動の連続性に基づく滑らかな合成音の生成や, 合成音における持続時間やピッチのリアルタイム制御においてその有効性が注目されており, 芸術的歌声生成, 教育応用, 構音障害者支援など, 様々なアプリケーションが提案されている. 本研究では文字や記号を介さない音声生成として, 構音器官以外の身体運動から直接音声を生成する新しいシステムを提案する. 報告番号: 甲 27932; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 7700 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電気系工学専...|$|R
