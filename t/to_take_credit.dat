5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit.</b> Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in {{imitation}} of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On {{a tactical}} level, the battle went in Israel's favor, and {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved. On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israelis. Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians. The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters. Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein allowed them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
25|$|SDS {{had opposed}} {{the call for}} mass demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. The group felt that mass demonstrations and electoral {{politics}} were not effective {{as a means of}} influencing national policy. But when the demonstrations proved popular and provoked a heavy-handed police response (as SDS predicted), the organization moved quickly <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for the protests.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{political}} {{figures in the}} ancient Near East liked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler {{are likely to have}} some sort of inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.|$|E

Meanwhile, there was some confusion about who had made three of Velocity's sales, with Ruth and Samuel both trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit.</b> In the end, Sir Alan decided that Ruth deserved sole credit, leaving Samuel without a sale to his name.|$|E

After Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast, Alex attempts <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for it, but Janet sees through the deception. Although the inversion is undone, the two separate for good when Alex {{is one of three}} characters (the other two being Iron Man and Sabretooth) to remain in their new state.|$|E

25|$|Independent TD Maureen O'Sullivan accused Ahern of {{attempting}} {{in his autobiography}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for the Gregory deal by claiming he was present in negotiations between Charles Haughey and Tony Gregory {{and that he had}} provided Haughey with estimates from Dublin City Council. The Gregory deal was an agreement negotiated between the independent socialist TD Tony Gregory and Fianna Fáil leader Charles Haughey {{in the aftermath of the}} February 1982 general election, which resulted in a hung Dáil. In return for supporting Haughey, Gregory was promised a deal worth 100 million pounds at the time, which was to be used to redevelop North Inner City Dublin and to provide a greater number of houses and employment in an area which was considered Ireland's poorest and most disadvantaged. Ahern had gone with Haughey to the negotiations with Gregory; he was immediately asked to leave by Gregory and was forced to wait publicly in his car outside for three and a half hours. Although both had been elected to the same constituency, they were fierce rivals and the relationship between them was often sour. O'Sullivan was Tony Gregory's director of elections and successor as a TD.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Mubarak became Commander of the Air Force and Egyptian Deputy Minister of Defense. On 6 October 1973, the Egyptian Air Force {{launched}} a surprise attack on Israeli {{soldiers on the}} east bank of the Suez Canal. Egyptian pilots hit 90% of their targets, making Mubarak a national hero. The next year {{he was promoted to}} Air Chief Marshal in recognition of service during the October War of 1973 against Israel. Mubarak was credited in some publications for Egypt's initial strong performance in the war. The Egyptian analyst Mohamed Hassanein Heikal said the Air Force played a mostly psychological role in the war, providing an inspirational sight for the Egyptian ground troops who carried out the crossing of the Suez Canal, rather than for any military necessity. However Mubarak's influence was also disputed by Shahdan El-Shazli, the daughter of the former Egyptian military Chief of Staff Saad el-Shazly. She said Mubarak exaggerated his role in the 1973 war. In an interview with the Egyptian independent newspaper Almasry Alyoum (26 February 2011), El-Shazli said Mubarak altered documents <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> from her father for the initial success of the Egyptian forces in 1973. She also said photographs pertaining to the discussions in the military command room were altered and Saad El-Shazli was erased and replaced with Mubarak. She stated she intends to take legal action.|$|E

Memories of the Great Depression faded, and Hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II. In 1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name [...] "Hoover Dam."

500|$|In {{demand more}} for his legal {{expertise}} than his military training, {{he was named}} as assistant counsel for Gideon Johnson Pillow during a court of inquiry initiated against him by Winfield Scott. Seeking to derail Scott's presidential ambitions, Pillow and his supporters composed and published letters that lauded Pillow, not Scott, for the American victories at Contreras and Churubusco. To hide his involvement, Pillow convinced a subordinate <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for the letter he wrote. Breckinridge biographer William C. Davis writes that it was [...] "most unlikely" [...] that Breckinridge knew the details of Pillow's intrigue. His role in the proceedings was limited to questioning a few witnesses; records show that Pillow represented himself during the court's proceedings.|$|E
500|$|Karen is more {{competent}} than Plankton in formulating plots {{to steal the}} Krabby Patty recipe. Most of his effective plans have come from Karen, including [...] "Plan Z"—the only scheme to result in Plankton successfully stealing the formula and using it to his advantage—in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. Nonetheless, he tends <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for them, much to her dismay. Karen has effortlessly stolen Krabs' formula without Plankton's help on many occasions, but her husband always inadvertently gets in the way. Because of their contrasting behaviors, Plankton and Karen {{have a tendency to}} argue. Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, has called their marriage [...] "Honeymooners-like," [...] comparing them to the bickering couple from the sitcom The Honeymooners.|$|E
500|$|Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey {{received}} extensive negative {{media coverage}} since its inception. The BBC were heavily criticized for hiring Lohan despite her then recent widely publicized drink-driving conviction and [...] "party lifestyle". BBC said they chose Lohan to attract {{an audience that}} might otherwise not watch. Indian non-governmental organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, criticized Lohan for a Twitter post where she appeared <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for one of their raids, something BBC said was a misinterpretation. The media coverage did not translate to high ratings. In its original broadcast on BBC Three on 1 April 2010, it was viewed by 224,000 households, a 0.9% share of the audience. Critics complimented the documentary for being well researched and compelling, but found Lohan's presence to be odd and distracting.|$|E

500|$|In a {{continuing}} attempt by Universal Interactive <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for Crash Bandicoot, Naughty Dog {{was told that}} it was not [...] "allowed" [...] to go to the first Electronic Entertainment Expo. In addition, there were leaked copies of the temporary box cover and press materials for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, upon which the Naughty Dog logo, in violation of the contract between Naughty Dog and Universal Interactive, was omitted. In response, Jason Rubin drafted and printed 1,000 copies of a document entitled [...] "Naughty Dog, creator and developer of Crash Bandicoot" [...] to hand {{out in front of the}} Crash Bandicoot display at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Beforehand, Rubin passed out the flyers [...] "for review" [...] to Universal Interactive, angering its president. Crash Bandicoot was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on May 1996 and was met with enthusiastic reactions. The game was released on September 9, 1996. This was followed by its European release on November 8, 1996.|$|E
500|$|On July 16, 1945, with {{numerous}} other Manhattan Project personnel, von Neumann was an eyewitness {{to the first}} atomic bomb blast, code named Trinity, conducted {{as a test of}} the implosion method device, at the bombing range near Alamogordo Army Airfield, [...] southeast of Socorro, New Mexico. Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to [...] but Enrico Fermi produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered. The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons. It was in von Neumann's 1944 papers that the expression [...] "kilotons" [...] appeared for the first time. After the war, Robert Oppenheimer remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had [...] "known sin".

500|$|The Nova Scotia {{legislature}} {{recognized the}} growing power of industrial unions in the 1930s by passing what historian Stephen Henderson calls [...] "Canada's {{first piece of}} modern labour legislation". Although Macdonald's governing Liberals and the opposition Conservatives agreed {{on the need to}} protect union rights, the parties vied with each other <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for the Trade Union Act. In January 1937, Premier Macdonald carried a bottle of bootleg rum to a meeting with union officials in Sydney, Cape Breton where they gave him a draft bill based on the American National Labor Relations Act. Before the Macdonald government could introduce the bill in the legislature, the Conservatives presented a similar one of their own. The legislation faced opposition from the Canadian Manufacturers' Association during public hearings, but Liberals and Conservatives combined to pass it unanimously. The new Trade Union Act required employers to bargain with any union chosen by a majority of their employees. It also prohibited employers from firing workers for organizing a union.|$|E
