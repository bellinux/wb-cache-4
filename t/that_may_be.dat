5|$|A 30 Days of Night/The X-Files {{cross-over}} graphic {{novel was}} published by WildStorm in 2010. It follows Mulder and Scully to Alaska as they investigate a series of grisly murders <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> linked to vampires.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of {{cavities}} {{play a vital role}} in moulding costs, so does the complexity of the part's design. Complexity can be incorporated into many factors such as surface finishing, tolerance requirements, internal or external threads, fine detailing or {{the number of}} undercuts <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> incorporated.|$|E

40|$|Tensor {{universality}} often {{implies that}} multi-partite quantum-state processing {{is determined by}} what happens in totally disentangled cases. In independent systems relative time direction for the parts is arbitrary. This hints <b>that</b> time <b>may</b> <b>be</b> linked to entanglement and measurements and <b>that</b> there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a measurement-only version of quantum mechanics. One-way quantum computation suggests <b>that</b> this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> possible. ...|$|R

5|$|Divers {{with long}} {{decompression}} obligations may be decompressed inside gas filled hyperbaric chambers {{in the water}} or at the surface, and in the extreme case, saturation divers are only decompressed {{at the end of}} a tour of duty <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> several weeks long.|$|E
5|$|Liquid or solid xenon {{nanoparticles}} can {{be formed}} {{at room temperature}} by implanting Xe+ ions into a solid matrix. Many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid Xe. This results in compression of the implanted Xe to pressures <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> sufficient for its liquefaction or solidification.|$|E
5000|$|The Pigskin Club of Washington, D.C., Inc. {{was founded}} in 1938 {{with the goals of}} [...] "improving {{relationship}} between persons interested in the game of football; <b>that</b> there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> given encouragement for good, clean sport; <b>that</b> there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a more perfect understanding among such persons; and, <b>that</b> there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> mutual benefits and pleasures derived from such association." ...|$|R

5|$|Pentastomida is {{an enigmatic}} group of parasites <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> related to maxillopod crustaceans. One species, Porocephalus crotali, is {{known from the}} marsh rice rat. It infects various mammals in the southeastern United States, which serve as {{intermediate}} hosts; snakes which eat those mammals are the definitive hosts.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the mineral {{contents}} of various edible mushrooms found that C.micaceus contained the highest concentration of potassium in the 34species tested, close to half a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom. Because the species can bioaccumulate detrimental heavy metals like lead and cadmium, it has been advised to restrict consumption of specimens collected from roadsides or other collection sites <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> exposed to or contain pollutants.|$|E
5|$|A young star such as Epsilon Eridani {{can produce}} {{large amounts of}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> harmful to life. The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5AU. Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for interstellar travel in science fiction stories.|$|E

5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|As the greenstone belts were forming, volcanoes ejected tephra {{into the}} air which settled as sediments to become {{compacted}} into the greywackes and mudstones of the Knife Lake and Lake Vermilion formations. Greywackes are poorly sorted mixtures of clay, mica and quartz <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic debris; {{the presence of this}} debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier. The volcanism took place on the surface and the other deformations took place at various depths. Numerous earthquakes accompanied the volcanism and faulting.|$|E
40|$|There exists {{reasoning}} popularly {{characterized as}} 2 ̆ 2 prejudiced 2 ̆ 2 <b>that</b> <b>may</b> nevertheless <b>be</b> both sound and prudential, and this reasoning involves {{the application of}} exactly the same inductive correlational strategies applied without moral objection in non -human cases. While such reasoning <b>may</b> <b>be</b> rationally unobjectionable, it <b>may</b> yet <b>be</b> morally objectionable because its methods inherently entail a risk of unfairness to others. This raises the interesting philosophical possibility <b>that</b> arguments <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a ppraised and found wanting on other than rational grounds, <b>that</b> arguments <b>may</b> <b>be</b> subject to moral defects in addition to defects of rationality...|$|R
