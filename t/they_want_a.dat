5|$|In naval battles, players {{control a}} fleet of up to twenty varied ships, and use 18th-century tactics to {{overcome}} enemy fleets. As with army units, each ship's crew has a set amount of morale that changes as a battle progresses; a crew may attempt to withdraw their vessel from the battle if their morale is broken, or in extreme cases may surrender. A battle is won when all hostile ships have been sunk, captured, or have left the map. Individual ships can be maneuvered, or remain in formation with other ships from the fleet. Players can designate which parts of a hostile ship <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> crew to target, making ships prone to sustaining authentic damage during a battle: masts can be toppled, sails and gun ports can be destroyed and damage can entirely disable a ship's ability to manoeuvre or eventually sink it. The types of ammunition can be used during a battle are grapeshot, chain-shot and round shot, which have different uses, from killing enemy crew to disabling enemy movement. As battles progress, crews can try to board enemy vessels and fight hand-to-hand {{in an attempt to}} capture the ship. The weather in a naval battle is also important; bad weather can create poor visibility. Ships cannot be repaired in mid-battle unlike its successor, , but fires on board ships can be put out automatically.|$|E

The broad basis of the course could be seen as bringing increased legal awareness to future professionals.|$|E

In the email, Apple also wrote that employees should first ask the customer if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> bag, rather than giving them one without asking.|$|E
25|$|Faced with an {{impending}} split between its monarchists and republicans, a compromise was brokered at the 1917 Ard Fheis (party conference) whereby the party would campaign {{to create a}} republic, then let the people decide if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> monarchy or republic, subject to the proviso that if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> king, <b>they</b> could not choose someone from Britain's Royal Family.|$|R

25|$|Burns v. Hickenlooper is a {{same-sex}} marriage case filed on July 1, 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs are six same-sex couples {{who have been}} legally married in another state but whose marriage Colorado does not legally recognize or who have been refused a Colorado marriage license, solely because of who they are. The main defendants, the state governor and attorney general, agree with the plaintiffs insofar as having the court issue an injunction declaring the {{same-sex marriage}} ban unconstitutional, but <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> stay and swift resolution by the U.S. Supreme Court {{in order to avoid}} costly litigation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} Parliamentary hearing, Labour Party, NZ First, Green Party and Māori Party {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} order of the questions and said that the public should first be asked whether <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> change, and continue with a second referendum only if they do, or both questions compacted into one referendum, which could potentially save millions of dollars. David Seymour (ACT's representative in the Cross-Party Group) said that the planned order made sense, as the public would need to see the alternative designs before deciding on a change. Professor John Burrows, chair of the Flag Consideration Panel, agreed that familiarity with proposals is a prerequisite for a properly informed decision about them.|$|E

500|$|Issues {{with the}} game's engine and [...] "a {{confused}} high-level {{vision for the}} game" [...] led the game's production to be transferred from the team in the United States to another studio in the United Kingdom, to ensure the final product would be [...] "a tighter, more focused game that will provide fans with the experience <b>they</b> <b>want...</b> <b>a</b> Silent Hill experience"; the release date was also pushed forward from winter 2006 to Q3/Q4 2007. The version of Origins that the United Kingdom development team received {{was intended to be}} a dark comedy inspired by the American television series Scrubs. Konami allowed the team to change the game, provided that the changes were done within the same budget and time frame; Originss script, level design, and monsters were redone within a week by Sam Barlow. For Origins, the developers intentionally replicated aspects of gameplay and atmosphere from the first installment; for example, the monsters behave more aggressively than those in previous installments, as a throwback to the first game. Later previews showed that the game had changed significantly and contained gameplay more in line with that found in the previous titles in the series. The changes were well received by video game journalists. On 19 August 2007, a demo of the game was leaked to internet download sites; Climax promptly denied they were the source of the leaked content.|$|E

Additionally, polygamy and child marriage were still legal, and there were few legal protections against domestic abuse.|$|R
2500|$|The Princess's {{influential}} short hairstyle {{was created}} by Sam McKnight after a Vogue shoot in 1990, which, in McKnight and Donatella Versace's opinion, showed her liberty. The Princess reportedly did her own make up and would always have a hairstylist by her side before an event, on which she told McKnight: [...] "It's not for me, Sam.
