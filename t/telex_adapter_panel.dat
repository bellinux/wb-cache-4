5000|$|Following orbital {{injection}} {{and separation}} from the S-IVB, the crew turned the CSM around using its Reaction Control System thrusters, and Eisele practiced a simulated Lunar Module rendezvous and docking, using a visual reference target mounted inside the spacecraft adapter in the same radial position it occupied on the LM. One of the <b>adapter</b> <b>panels</b> on the S-IVB failed to completely deploy to its 45 degree open position, reminding CAPCOM Tom Stafford of his [...] "angry alligator" [...] experience on Gemini 9A, when docking was prevented by mis-deployed <b>adapter</b> <b>panels.</b> Had this been an actual lunar mission, the astronauts might have found the process of LM extraction from the adapter more difficult, risking possible damage. This reinforced the decision to add a system to completely separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent Apollo-Saturn V flights.|$|R

50|$|M-Modules are {{standardized}} as ANSI/VITA 12-1996 and {{are especially}} suited for adding {{any kind of}} real-world I/O to a system in a flexible way. They are modular I/O extensions {{for all types of}} industrial computers, from embedded systems up to high-end workstations. The M-Module Interface - a fast asynchronous parallel interface - offers sophisticated functions like 32-bit data bus, burst transfers up to 100 MB/s, DMA and trigger capabilities. M-Modules also offer direct front-panel connection rather than requiring a separate <b>adapter</b> <b>panel</b> with ribbon-cable connections. This provides a clean path for sensitive signals without loss of data or signal quality - using, for example, shielded D-Sub connectors and coaxial cables.|$|R
25|$|The Saturn V Instrument Unit is a {{ring-shaped}} structure {{fitted to}} the top of the Saturn V rocket's third stage (S-IVB) and the Saturn IB's second stage (also an S-IVB). It was immediately below the SLA (Spacecraft/Lunar Module <b>Adapter)</b> <b>panels</b> that contained the Lunar Module. The Instrument Unit contains the guidance system for the Saturn V rocket. Some of the electronics contained within the Instrument Unit are a digital computer, analog flight control computer, emergency detection system, inertial guidance platform, control accelerometers and control rate gyros. The instrument unit (IU) for Saturn V was designed by NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and was developed from the Saturn I IU. NASA's contractor to construct the Saturn V Instrument Unit was International Business Machines (IBM).|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, {{while being}} interviewed for a {{documentary}} titled First on the Moon: The Untold Story, Aldrin {{told an interviewer}} that they saw an unidentified flying object. Aldrin told David Morrison, a NASA Astrobiology Institute senior scientist, that the documentary cut the crew's conclusion that they were probably seeing one of four detached spacecraft <b>adapter</b> <b>panels.</b> Their S-IVB upper stage was 6000 mi away, but the four panels were jettisoned before the S-IVB made its separation maneuver so they would closely follow the Apollo 11 spacecraft until its first midcourse correction. When Aldrin appeared on The Howard Stern Show on August 15, 2007, Stern {{asked him about the}} supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial, and said they were and are [...] "99.9 percent" [...] sure that the object was the detached panel.|$|R
50|$|All the Visual Workstations {{supported}} conventional CRT {{monitors and}} had VGA display connectors. As the 230 330, and 550 models used Nvidia Quadro cards they also supported DVI. The SGI 320 and 540 models shipped with the groundbreaking and stylistically matched 1600SW LCD display, using an OpenLDI display connector that required an accessory flat <b>panel</b> <b>adapter.</b> The SGI O2 also supported the 1600SW with an adapter.|$|R
50|$|In 1993 Mastervolt {{introduced}} {{their first}} grid-tie inverter, the Sunmaster 130S, {{based on a}} collaborative effort between Shell Solar, Ecofys and ECN. The 130 was designed to mount directly {{to the back of}} the panel, connecting both AC and DC lines with compression fittings. In 2000, the 130 was replaced by the Soladin 120, a microinverter in the form of an AC <b>adapter</b> that allows <b>panels</b> to be connected simply by plugging them into any wall socket.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the structural design {{and analysis of}} the Brazilian Scientific Applications Satellite (SACI- 1) that is devised as a multipurpose bus for scientific applications. The structure includes a Mainbody (Platform and Payload), an <b>Adapter,</b> four deployable <b>panels</b> and the holddown and release mechanisms (HDR). Its overall shape resembles a parallelepiped measuring 600 x 400 x 400 mm (Main body only) and weighting about 65 kg (Mainbody plus Adapter). The Platform consists on a pack of 9 aluminum ribbed frames of different thickness stacked horizontally and connected by means of 12 stud bolts. The Payload is assembled {{on the top of the}} Platform and has six ribbed plates that form a box in which most of the payload is assembled. The separation is accomplished by cutting (or releasing) one central rod that joins the Platform to the Adapter. The analysis of this structure was performed using a FEM model for static, normal modes, frequency response, transient response and random vibration analysis. With these results it was possible: (a) to verify the preliminary design of the structure and define the necessary changes; (b) to determine the first global frequencies of the assembly and; (c) to verify the accelerations on the printed circuit boards...|$|R
