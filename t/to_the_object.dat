5|$|Mayan {{languages}} are ergative in their alignment. This {{means that the}} subject of an intransitive verb is treated similarly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of a transitive verb, but differently from the subject of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{tend to have}} a rich set of grammatical voices. Proto-Mayan had {{at least}} one passive construction as well as an antipassive rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> and another that emphasizes the verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of applicative promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> position).|$|E

5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
5|$|Marie herself {{begins the}} {{operation}} {{on a quest}} to seduce and betray her target. Her reversal (followed by two subsequent changes of heart, {{back to the original}} mission and then in opposition to it) counterbalance the wickedness of Madame du Gua and Corentin. Her ultimate fidelity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of her desire demonstrates the possibility of sincere passion, even as the other pair speak to the venom of the slighted heart.|$|E
5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Equality {{is one of}} {{the chief}} {{guarantees}} of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14–16, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non-discrimination, and Articles 17–18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as equal protection of the law to all persons within the territory of India. This includes the equal subjection of all persons to the authority of law, as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{an object}} {{suspended}} by a spring {{as a simple}} proportional control. The spring will attempt <b>to</b> maintain <b>the</b> <b>object</b> in a certain location despite disturbances which may temporarily displace it. Hooke's law {{tells us that the}} spring applies a corrective force that is proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>object's</b> displacement. While this will tend <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> <b>object</b> in a particular location, the absolute resting location of <b>the</b> <b>object</b> will vary if its mass is changed. This difference in resting location is the offset error.|$|R
