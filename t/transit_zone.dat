Previously there was also another checkpoint located at Titovka, between Nikel and Murmansk. There are more border checkpoints today than during the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|Terminal C {{was opened}} in May 2007 as a {{temporary}} solution because all other terminals operated on their maximum capacity. It has been largely used by Air Berlin until its demise. It features 26 check-in counters and the gates numbered C38-C51, C60–C67 (Section C2) and C80-C89 (in the newest addition Section C3). From 2008 until August 2009, 5 additional aircraft stands were constructed and the building was expanded by approximately 50% of its original size, in order to handle another 1.5million passengers per year. The extended terminal now houses a <b>transit</b> <b>zone</b> for connecting passengers which does not exist at any other terminal at Tegel Airport. Due to noise protection treaties, {{the overall number of}} aircraft stands at the airport is restricted, thus aircraft stands on the apron (serving Terminals A and D) had to be removed for compensation. Terminal C is able to handle widebody-aircraft like Air Berlin's Airbus A330-200s, but features no jet bridges.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{terminal}} was officially opened on 3 May 1970, by HM Queen Elizabeth II. The first Boeing 747 [...] "Jumbo Jet" [...] at the airport, Pan American's Clipper Flying Cloud (N734PA), arrived on 4 October 1970. The east-west runway was then [...] long; in the 1970s the north-south runway was expanded {{to become one}} of the longest runways in the southern hemisphere. The international terminal was expanded in 1992 [...] and has undergone several refurbishments since then, including one that was completed in early 2000 in order to re-invent the airport in time for the 2000 Olympic Games held in Sydney. The airport additionally underwent another project development that began in 2010 to extend the <b>transit</b> <b>zone</b> which brought new duty free facilities, shops & leisure areas for passengers.|$|E
2500|$|Terminal A is a hexagon-shaped ring {{concourse}} with {{a parking}} area, taxi stands and bus stops in its middle. It features 14 jet bridges which correspond to 16 respective check-in counters (A00–A15), with jetways 1 and 14 each serving two check-in counters. There is no <b>transit</b> <b>zone,</b> {{which means that}} each gate has its own security clearance checkpoint and exit for arriving passengers. Therefore, direct flight connections without leaving the airside area are not possible. Most major airlines arrive and depart here, especially [...] "prestigious" [...] flights like intercontinental services or flights to the busy European hub airports; for example United Airlines flights to Newark and Lufthansa services to Munich are handled here. The whole rooftop works as a visitor platform. Terminal A is capable of handling wide-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 767 or Airbus A330 on two positions but with only one jet bridge attached to each.|$|E
2500|$|According to one Russian report, Snowden {{planned to}} fly from Moscow through Havana to Latin America; however, Cuba told Moscow {{it would not}} allow the Aeroflot plane {{carrying}} Snowden to land. Anonymous Russian sources claimed that Cuba {{had a change of}} heart after receiving pressure from U.S. officials, leaving him stuck in the <b>transit</b> <b>zone</b> because at the last minute Havana told officials in Moscow not to allow him on the flight. The Washington Post contrasted this version with rife speculation that Russia never intended to let Snowden proceed. Fidel Castro called claims that Cuba would have blocked Snowden's entry a [...] "lie" [...] and a [...] "libel." [...] Describing Snowden's arrival in Moscow as a surprise and likening it to [...] "an unwanted Christmas gift," [...] Russian president Putin said that Snowden remained in the transit area of Sheremetyevo Airport, had committed no crime in Russia, was free to leave and should do so. Putin denied that Russia's intelligence agencies had worked or were working with Snowden.|$|E

40|$|<b>Transit</b> <b>Zones</b> interrogates {{conceptual}} and theoretical issues concerning {{the notion of}} nomadic transience, where movement, stasis and the peripatetic state converge with time. This photographic based research examines {{the relationship between the}} still frame and the moving image and the visual metamorphosis from realism to abstraction in the spatial and temporal dimensions of terrestrial places and non-places. <b>Transit</b> <b>Zones</b> identifies isolates, preserves and presents a moment taken from a continuum; a journey into contemporary spaces to engage viewers at a visceral level. Still or static photographic images within <b>Transit</b> <b>Zones</b> observe the state of transit and the movement encountered in transit; inscribing this state of being somewhere else, in another country, another time and place, taking a momentary glimpse of the world, and seeing it phenomenologically to make meaning of the experience. As John Berger states, the true content of a photograph is invisible, for it derives from a play, not with form, but with time. One might argue that photography is as close to music as to painting. Objects recorded in any photograph (from the most effective to the most commonplace) carry approximately the same weight, the same conviction. What varies is the intensity with which we are made aware of the poles of absence and presence. Between these two poles photography finds its proper meaning. The most popular use of the photograph is as a memento of the absent. Here the state of transit or peripatetique, by its very nature, transforms the real into the state of the unknown, offering a dreamlike quality, as the past resonates in the now. As anthropological places of consumption and communication are photographed, we are presented with a memory, a new reality, translated through movement. <b>Transit</b> <b>Zones</b> is this state of transit. Central to this research are the symbiotic relationship between the still frame and the moving image, stasis and movement, time and motion, past and present and the selected moment of transience revealed by the narrative of the photograph. The affect of evolving technologies on the transmission of the image and the symbiotic relationship between travel, movement, speed and perception revealing how nomadic wanderings can change our perception of time. The visual presentation and preservation of time is pivotal within <b>Transit</b> <b>Zones</b> research, from the pictorial to abstraction and stasis to movement and the relationship with time and photographic representation...|$|R
40|$|Sieve {{electrodes}} {{provide a}} chronic interface for stimulating peripheral nerve axons. Yet, successful utilization requires robust axonal regeneration through the implanted electrode. The present study determined {{the effect of}} large <b>transit</b> <b>zones</b> in enhancing axonal regeneration and revealed an intimate neural interface with an implanted sieve electrode. Fabrication of the polyimide sieve electrodes employed sacrificial photolithography. The manufactured macro-sieve electrode (MSE) contained nine large <b>transit</b> <b>zones</b> with areas of ~ 0. 285 mm 2 surrounded by eight Pt-Ir metallized electrode sites. Prior to implantation, saline or glial derived neurotropic factor (GDNF) was injected into nerve guidance silicone-conduits {{with or without a}} MSE. The MSE assembly or a nerve guidance conduit was implanted between transected ends of the sciatic nerve in adult male Lewis rats. At 3 months’ post-operation, fiber counts were similar through both implant types. Likewise, stimulation of nerves regenerated through a MSE or an open silicone conduit evoked comparable muscle forces. These results showed that nerve regeneration was comparable through MSE <b>transit</b> <b>zones</b> and an open conduit. GDNF had a minimal positive effect on the quality and morphology of fibers regenerating through the MSE; thus, the MSE may reduce reliance on GDNF to augment axonal regeneration. Selective stimulation of several individual muscles was achieved through monopolar stimulation of individual electrodes sites suggesting that the MSE might be an optimal platform for functional neuromuscular stimulation...|$|R

Zones of more intensive seismicity and existence of active faults include NPS, HEP and TEP in the Urals, the Kola Peninsula, south Siberia, Transbaikal and Far East regions of Russia.
