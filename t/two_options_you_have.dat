50|$|A {{system that}} is {{currently}} in place for helping trafficked people is the National Referral Mechanism (NRM). In order to protect trafficked people, a first responder must refer the woman to the NRM. A first responder might include the National Health Service or local authorities. In these cases, the victim has to consent to being referred, and it is preferred that it is done within 48 hours of contact with the victim. The referral {{is sent to the}} Competent Authority which is the program that will decide whether or not a person is being trafficked. The Competent Authority will analyze the referral form and make a decision within 5 business days. If the victim is believed to be trafficked, the Competent Authority will grant the victim a 45-day recovery and reflection period. This would involve being in a safe environment with medical and other kinds of help. Before the end of the 45-day period, the Competent Authority will make a ‘conclusive decision’ {{about whether or not the}} victim was one of trafficking. These results might depend on evidence that is recovered during the 45-day period. If you are found to be a victim of trafficking, a decision might be made to extend your recovery period, or to grant you a residence permit. If you receive a negative conclusive decision, the only <b>option</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> is to ask the Competent Authority to review the decision.

Cooper ends up in a replica town of the one he lived in life. The Black is kind of like a place you go to after death. Everybody goes there. You get sent to Hell/ The Blood or Heaven /- based on the choices you make there and once you come to terms with your old life you move on to the <b>options.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to come to terms and earn forgiveness for what wrongs you did in life. All the people in the replica town had died earlier like Cooper's grandpa. He meets a girl named Maggie. Maggie knew Cooper's grandfather when they were young. Cooper stays in his grandfather's house in the Black. His grandfather shows him how to see the living but forbids him from making things happen in the living world. He meets up with Damon and Damon makes a deal with him. Cooper has to find the enemy of Damon by using his cut off ear to track him down. Damon wants that to help him find the poleax. If he succeeds he gets to be brought back to life. Cooper has a change of heart when he meets up with Marshall's mom. She is working with the man who is leading something much like resistance against Damon. The book ends with Cooper visiting Marshall.|$|R
