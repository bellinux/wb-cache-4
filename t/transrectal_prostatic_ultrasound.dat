40|$|Echoguided drug {{infiltration}} {{in chronic}} prostatitis: {{results of a}} multi-centre study. Objectives: In chronic prostatitis there are many causes that may provoke a thera-peutical failure of a systemic antibiotic treatment. At the moment a consensus has not been reached on {{the efficacy of the}} many therapeutical options that are available with not one of these approaches being efficacious in all patients. In our view the main cau-ses of treatment failure are the well-known hurdle to antibiotic diffusion inside the glandular parenchyma associated with the so-called intraprostatic bacterial biofilms and the possible presence of local auto-immune reactions. Given this background we tested ultrasound guided intra-prostate infiltration of a cocktail of antibiotics and betamethazone, for a thera-peutical options. Material and Methods: 320 patients, referred to us because of symptoms indi-cative of chronic prostatitis, were enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were the seve-rity of the symptoms and the failure of repeated cycles of antibiotics in the previous 12 months. At the initial consultation patients completed the NIH Prostatitis Symptoms Index (NIH-CPSI).

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} circadian urine {{production and}} its determinants {{in a large}} population based sample of older men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data on 1, 688 men 50 to 78 years old, without radical prostatectomy, prostate or bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder disease or negative advice from their general practitioner, recruited from the population of Krimpen, the Netherlands. Measurements consisted of self-administered questionnaires, including the International Prostate Symptom Score, a 3 -day frequency-volume chart, <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> uroflowmetry and post-void residual volume. Hourly urine production was determined and urine production day-to-night ratio was calculated from the frequency-volume chart. RESULTS: Men younger than 65 years showed a clear circadian urine production pattern, whereas in older men this pattern was less clear. Smoking, use of diuretic drugs, post-void residual and 24 -hour polyuria reinforced the circadian pattern, in favor of daytime urine production. The urine production day-to-night ratio {{was not associated with}} prostate enlargement, reduced urinary flow rate, body weight, hypertension, cardiac symptoms, diabetes mellitus, use of antidepressants, cardiac or hypnotic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Urine production in men younger than 65 years showed a clear circadian pattern in contrast to men older than 65 years. These data {{can be used as a}} reference when describing urine production patterns in select populations. In daily practice frequency-volume charts can be used to determine urine production. This method is inexpensive, easy to use and provides valid information on urine production in a natural environment...|$|E
40|$|Dear Editors, We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Di Franco and co-workers (1). The introduction of prostatic magnetic resonance and the relative fusion-biopsy have not yet allowed the expected improvements in prostate biopsy. To our knowledge, there are no works that demonstrate the superiority of fusion techniques on the remaining ultrasound guided prostate biopsies that are still the widely used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Furthemore, these technologies are expensive exams {{and they are not}} yet available in all centers, especially in those minors. We work at a “minor” center and we always {{keep in mind that the}} goal of  prostatic biopsy is the diagnosis and the staging of prostatic neoplasms [...] However, it remains uncertain which of the two techniques, transperineal (TP) or transrectal (TR), is superior in terms of detection rate during first biopsy setting. Several studies have compared the prostate cancer detection rate but TR and TP access route in prostatic gland sampling seems to be equivalent in terms of efficiency and complications, as reported by Shen PF et al. (2), despite several methodological limitations recognized in their work. The results reported by Di Franco CA et al. represent the real life experience of most urologists that perform the PB based on their own training experience and available technical devices. From an historical viewpoint, the TP route has been the first one to be used to reach the prostate, both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To date, because it seems to be more invasive and difficult, the TP route is less used worldwide than the TR one (2). Theoretically, the TP approach should detect more prostate cancer than the TR way   because the cores of the TP approach are directed longitudinally to the peripheral zone and the anterior part of the prostate (4). The results reported by Di Franco et al. seems to confirm these considerations. However, our real life experience differ from the conclusions reached in their work. We recently conducted a prospective evaluation of 352 patients who underwent their first prostate biopsy because of a suspicious of prostate cancer (elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination and/or abnormal findings on <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>ultrasound).</b> Patients was randomized as following. A total of 187 patients (Group A) underwent a prostatic biopsy with a transperineal approach in a lithotomic position,  using a biplane probe (8818 BK Medical, Denmark) and a fan technique with a single perineal median access (5). The remnants 165 patients (Group B) underwent a transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy in a left lateral position, using a end fire probe configuration (8818 BK Medical, Denmark) and a sagittal technique. The bioptic prostatic mapping was performed with a 12 -core scheme sec. Gore (3) by a single experienced operator and the histopathologic evaluation was performed by a single dedicated uro-pathologist. Statistical evaluations were made with a T Student test  (p< 0, 005). Group A and Group B was similar in term of mean patient age (67, 9 years and 67 years respectively), mean total PSA (12, 1 ng/ml vs 12 ng/ml) and digital rectal examination positivity (22 % vs 29 %).   The global cancer detection rate was 33, 69 % (63 / 187) in the transperineal prostate biopsy group and 48, 48 % (80 / 165) in the transrectal approach (p= 0. 0047).   No significant statistical differences were found in the complications rates between the two groups. Statistical evaluation of site of tumor localization reveal only a trend to statistical significance in apical site tumors diagnosed with the TR approach versus the TP technique. The TR approach had a better diagnostic accuracy than TP technique in case of PSA< 4 ng/ml, intermediate prostate volume (30 and 50 ml), normal digital rectal examination without any relationship with the patient age. In our experience, two aspect may explain the difference between the two group in term of global detection rate. First, we usually perform transrectal biopsy with a sagittal technique that simulates the transperineal way of needle incidence with the prostatic gland. The lateral and anterior gland portions may be sampled more accurately. Second, our transperineal approach consists in a single perineal median access that can make more difficult the gland sampling between the two lobes. However, there was no significant difference in core positivity rate at the peripheral zone, medium gland, apex or any other site such as reported in many randomized clinical trials (2). Unlike the conclusions reported by Di Franco et al., in our experience we found a statistically significant difference between the TR and TP approach, at the first biopsy setting, in term of global cancer detection rate. No differences were found in terms of complications. Moreover, our data suggest that TR approach had a better diagnostic accuracy than TP technique in case of  PSA< 4 ng/ml, prostate volume 30 - 50 ml, normal digital rectal examination without any relationship with the patient age. The further step of the statistical evaluation of our data will be the definition of the possibility that the TR biopsy determine a better staging of prostate cancer than TP approach as first procedure.       REFERENCES   1)       Di Franco CA, Jallous H., Porru D. et al.

Research work has been on-going to assess if there are other better tests suitable for primary or secondary screening of PCa to supplement the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, which fails to work accurately in a grey zone of 4 - 10 ng/ml. In this pilot study, the potential roles of urinary polyamines as prostate cancer biomarkers were evaluated. PCa, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and healthy controls (HC) showing PSA> 4. 0 ng/ml {{were enrolled in the}} study. Their urine samples were obtained, and the urinary levels of putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and Student's t-test were used to evaluate their diagnostic accuracies. Among the three biogenic polyamines, Spm had demonstrated a good diagnostic performance when comparing their levels in PCa patients with BPH patients (1. 47 in PCa vs 5. 87 in BPH; p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} prostate cancer (PCa) on a third prostate biopsy {{in a group of}} patients with two consecutive diagnoses of high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). Materials and methods: From November 2004 to December 2007, patients referred to our clinic with a PSA ! 4 ng/ml or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) were scheduled for trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided 12 -core prostate biopsy. Patients with HGPIN underwent a second prostate biopsy, and if the results of such procedure yielded a second diagnosis of HGPIN, we proposed a third 12 -core needle biopsy regardless of PSA value. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions were used to assess predictors of PCa on the third biopsy. Results: A total of 650 patients underwent 12 cores <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> <b>prostatic</b> biopsy in the study period. Of 147 (22 %) men with a diagnosis of HGPIN, 117 underwent a second prostatic biopsy after six months and 43 a third biopsy after other six months. After the third biopsy, 19 patients (34 %) still showed HGPIN, 15 (35 %) were diagnosed with PCa and 9 (21 %) presented with chronic prostatitis. Widespread HGPIN on a second biopsy was significantly associated with PCa on further biopsy (! 2 = 4. 04, p = 0. 04). Moreover, the presence of widespread HGPIN significantly predicted the risk of PCa on crude and adjusted logistic regressions. Conclusions: Widespread HGPIN on second biopsy is associated with the presence of PCa on a third biopsy. Nonetheless, the relationship between HGPIN and PCa remains complex and further studies are needed to confirm our findings...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Transrectal {{ultrasound}} biopsy {{of prostate}} is a painful procedure. The {{introduction of the}} rectal probe {{is one of the}} major contributors to the pain associated with this procedure. Drugs that relax the anal sphincter should theoretically decrease this pain. This study was done to compare the efficacy and safety of two topical medications that relax the anal sphincter, diltiazem and nitroglycerine, in decreasing the pain associated with transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 66 patients who were to undergo their first prostate biopsy were randomized to receive either 2 mL of 2 % topical diltiazem or 2 mL of 0. 2 % topical nitroglycerine or placebo 20 minutes before prostate biopsy. All patients also received 15 mL of intrarectal lignocaine. A 10 -point visual analogue score was used to record the pain immediately after the insertion of the probe, during biopsy and at the end of the procedure. RESULTS: The pain scores due to probe insertion, during biopsy and at the end of the procedure in patients who received topical diltiazem or nitroglycerine were significantly lower compared to the placebo group (p < 0. 001). There were no significant differences in the pain scores between the patients receiving diltiazem compared to those receiving nitroglycerine. Higher incidence of headache and fall in blood pressure was noted in patients who received nitroglycerine compared to those receiving diltiazem.

40|$|Objective: To search which {{category}} of proteins {{can be detected}} in urine {{in order to examine}} subsequently its ability to improve our accuracy for the diagnosis of Prostate Cancer (PCa) as biomarkers in clinical useful fluids like urine and serum. Material and method(s) : Urine samples of 127 patients were obtained after a vigorous <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostatic</b> massage to both lobes. The patients were considered to have a high risk for PCa according to their PSA (> 4 ng/ml), their digital rectal examination (DRE) (positive for suspicious prostatic lesions) or to their abnormal PSA kinetics (PSA velocity (PSAV > 0. 75 ng/mL). All patients subsequently were subjected to an extended 10 -core per prostatic lobe TRUS-b (total 20 prostatic samples). The proteins that were chosen to be detected in the urine samples with Western-blot, as possible biomarkers, were Glutathione peroxidase 3 precursor (GPx 3), Cofilin- 1 (CFL 1), Heat shock protein- 90 β (HSP 90 β), Zinc alpha 2 -glycoprotein (ZAG) and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). These proteins have been detected previously in the prostatic tissue by proteomics proving their discriminative ability between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Result(s) : From the five proteins, only the secreted Zinc alpha 2 -glycoprotein was detected in urine showing a promising ability in the improvement of our diagnostic accuracy for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Conclusions: From various categories of proteins that have already been detected in the tissue of prostate by proteomics, only secreted protein Zinc alpha 2 -glycoprotein showed a clear signal in the urine, proving its discriminative potential for the early diagnosis of PCa...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To make an {{objective}} controlled comparison of pain tolerance in <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound-guided <b>prostatic</b> biopsy using intrarectal topic anesthesia, injectable periprostatic anesthesia, or low-dose intravenous sedation. Materials and Methods: One {{hundred and sixty}} patients were randomized into 4 groups: group I, intrarectal application of 2 % lidocaine gel; group II, periprostatic anesthesia; group III, intravenous injection of midazolam and meperidine; and group IV, control, patients to whom no sedation or analgesic was given. Pain was evaluated using an analogue pain scale graded from 0 to 5. Acceptance of a repetition biopsy, {{the side effects of}} the drugs and complications were also evaluated. Results: 18 / 20 (90 %) and 6 / 20 (30 %) patients reported strong or unbearable pain in the group submitted to conventional biopsy and topical anesthesia (p = 0. 23, chi-square = 1. 41); whereas those submitted to periprostatic blockade and sedation, severe pain occurred in only 2 / 60 (3 %) patients (p < 0. 001, chi-square = 40. 19) and 3 / 60 (5 %) patients (p < 0. 001, chi-square = 33. 34). Acceptance of repetition of the biopsy was present in only 45 % of the patients submitted to conventional biopsy, 60 % of those that were given topical anesthesia (p = 0. 52, chi-square = 0. 4), compared to 100 % of those submitted to periprostatic anesthesia (p < 0. 01, chi-square = 15. 17), and 95 % of those who were sedated (p < 0. 001, chi-square = 25. 97 %). Conclusions: <b>Transrectal</b> ultrasound-guided <b>prostatic</b> biopsy is an uncomfortable experience; however application of periprostatic blockade and intravenous analgesia are associated to higher tolerance of the exam and patient comfort. Low dose sedation by association of intravenous meperidine and midazolam is an emerging and safe outpatient option.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigated}} an algorithm {{to detect}} grey level transitions with multiple scales of resolution to improve edge detection and localisation in ultrasound {{images of the}} prostate. INTRODUCTION: We had developed a non-analytical operator for prostate contour determination implemented with minimum and maximum filters and locate edges. We implemented a technique for improved determination of boundary parts in <b>prostatic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> images by adjusting the edge detection parameter to signal information. METHODS: First the influence of prefilter settings and edge detection parameters is investigated in a test image and a real ultrasound image. Then, local standard deviation is used to identify or fewer homogeneous regions that are filtered with course resolution, while areas with larger deviation that grey level transitions occur, which should be preserved using smaller filter sizes to improve edge localisation. RESULTS: Analysis of images with different filter sizes indicated that areas are merged for increasing filter sizes: less pronounced edges disappear or displace for larger filters. Two scales of resolution lead to an improved localisation of edges when smaller filter sizes are used in areas with an increased local standard deviation. CONCLUSIONS: This paper illustrates an edge detection method suitable as pre-processing step in interpretation of medical images. By adapting input parameters to signal information, object recognition can be applied in images from different imaging modalities. Also, disadvantages are discussed, resulting in a new application combining a localisation algorithm to find the initial contour and a delineation algorithm to improve the outlining of the resulting contou...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of an obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts, {{in spite of}} its rarity, must be considered by the Urologists in the screening of the etiologic causes of obstructive azoospermia. Nowadays, the diagnostic approach, which includes the biochemical study of seminal plasma and <b>prostatic</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> often leads to the preoperative recognition of the site of obstruction. Various surgical and endoscopic techniques have been adopted for the treatment of ejaculatory duct obstructions in different historical periods. Herein we describe our experience that starts from 1979. 17 infertile patients with intraprostatic cysts and 2 with a stenosis of the veru montanum were treated by us following these criteria: 9 azoospermic patients underwent scrototomy and endoscopy; 10 patients with a severe oligozoospermia underwent echo-guided puncture of an intraprostatic cyst. The patients were placed in the lithotomy position, a 16 G needle was adopted and by means ultrasound was possible to follow the needle entering the cyst. When no spermatozoa was detected in the cystic liquid, sclerosing agents (Sodium-tetradecyl-sulphate 30 mg in 1 l.) was introduced. This easy procedure was carried out on outpatients in local anaesthesia. One out of ten oligozoospermic patients had to repeat the echo-guided puncture of intraprostatic cyst as the first attempt had been followed by recurrence. Eight out of ten subfertile patients who had undergone percutaneous echo-guided treatment had longer than 1 year follow-up: in seven cases an increase in sperms number and motility was obtained; in one case sperm count remained unmodified. In three cases the partners became pregnant...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} relationship between parathyroid glands and prostatic gland is commonly very well known. The aim {{of our study}} was to investigate the relationship between serum levels of PTH and serum levels of PSA in patients with pathological finding of BPH. According to 261 <b>transrectal</b> ultra- sound-guided <b>prostatic</b> biopsies performed from March 2009 to March 2010, 75 patients, responding to our inclusion criteria, were selected. 26 patients (34. 6 %) ended the study.

40|$|Grey-scale {{ultrasound}} defines smaller renal lesions {{that had}} previously been appreciated and is able to define associated lesions of the liver such as metastases and cysts. The appropriate technique to delineate the normal anatomy of the kidney is described. Ultrasound plays {{a central role in the}} identification and characterization of renal mass lesions thus leading to appropriate further work up. In renal transplant evaluation ultrasound is useful as a complementary modality to other imaging studies permitting the recognition of pelvic fluid collections, rejection, and hydronephrosis. Specific findings are present in renal abscess, perirenal abscess, and in several of the renal cystic diseases. Adrenal lesions can be identified and clarified. In the lower urinary tract, ultrasound can identify bladder and <b>prostatic</b> tumors. <b>Ultrasound</b> provides a rapid, safe and non-invasive modality which is complementary to other imaging techniques in the diagnosis of urinary tract disease...|$|R
40|$|Mr NC is a 76 -year-old {{patient with}} no {{significant}} past medical history referred by his GP with a PSA of 17 ng/ml following opportunistic screening. Rectal examination showed {{an area of}} firmness in the left lobe of the prostate measuring about 1 cm without clinical features of extra-capsular extension. He underwent <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostatic</b> biopsies of his prostate gland which showed prostatic adenocarcinoma with a Gleason Score of 4 + 4 = 8 involving three out of six cores taken from the left lobe in 70 per cent of tissue submitted and a Gleason Score of 3 + 4 = 7 in four out of six cores in 60 per cent of tissue submitted from the right lobe. A staging bone scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease and a MRI of the pelvis suggested extra-capsular extension {{on the left side}} with no seminal vesicle involvement and no pelvic adenopathy. His final diagnosis was prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason 8 (4 + 4) T 3 aN 0 M 0 with a presenting PSA of 17 ng/ml, entering the RTOG high risk localised category. Following a discussion at the multidisciplinary conference, the patient was referred to the Radiation Oncology Department at St Luke’s Hospital in Rathgar for further management. In keeping with European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG) guidelines, the patient was prescribed a combination of long-term hormonal therapy for three years and radical radiotherapy. In our institution, patients are treated with pre-radiotherapy induction maximum androgen blockade therapy for two to four months with a view to achieving pre-radiotherapy prostatic gland and tumour shrinkage. The patient was commenced on neoadjuvant maximum androgen blockade therapy using a combination of three-monthly leuprorelin acetate injection and daily bicalutamide orally. The treatment was tolerated well with no significant side effects. An assessment at three months showed a complete clinical and biochemical response with no abnormality detected in his prostate on rectal examination and an undetectable PSA. He subsequently embarked on radiotherapy and completed a course of localised 3 D conformal radiotherapy to the prostate and seminal vesicles at a dose of 74 Gray in 37 daily fractions with omission of elective nodal irradiation. Following the completion of his radiotherapy the patient was commenced on adjuvant LH-RH agonist therapy using six-monthly leuprorelin acetate. Presently the patient is still on adjuvant LH-RH therapy and is in complete clinical and biochemical remission 18 months from diagnosis. He continues to tolerate the hormonal therapy well with no significant side effects...|$|R
