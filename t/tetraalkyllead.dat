In situ derivatized organomercury, organotin and organolead compounds are separated isothermally within several seconds instead of several minutes {{required by the}} conventional procedures. Neither the resolution nor the sample capacity are sacrificed compared with conventional capillary GC with oven temperature gradient programming. Sub-picogram detection limits are obtained.

40|$|International audienceMulticapillary GC is {{proposed}} and optimized {{as a tool}} for the introduction of gasoline samples into an MIP atomic emission spectrometer for the fingerprinting and species-selective analysis for organolead additives. The coupling of multicapillary GC with MIP-AES not only allows speciation of alkyllead but is also faster than analysis for total lead in gasoline by flame AAS or ICP-AES. All five <b>tetraalkyllead</b> species (MenEt 4 -nPb, n= 1 - 4) are baseline separated and quantified within 10 s in comparison with about 10 - 20 min required by conventional GC procedures. Separation is carried out in the isothermal mode but neither resolution nor sample capacity is sacrificed in comparison with conventional capillary GC with oven temperature gradient programming. The throughput reaches about 100 samples h- 1. The detection limit is below 1 ?g I- 1 and the linearity range spans four concentration decades. The method was validated by the analysis of the NIST SRM 2715 (Lead in Fuel) reference material...|$|E

The interface is based on purging the gaseous analytes with an inert gas, drying the gas stream using a 30 -cm tubular Nation membrane and trapping the compounds in a thick film-coated capillary tube followed by their isothermal separation on a 1 -m multicapillary GC column. Developments regarding each of the steps of the analytical procedure and effects of operational variables (sample volume, purge flow, trap temperature, speed of injection, GC separation conditions) are discussed using the speciation analysis of a mixture of <b>tetraalkyllead</b> compounds as an example. Recoveries are quantitative up to a sample volume of 50 ml. Figures of merit for the interface coupled to a microwave-induced plasma atomic emission detector are given.

40|$|Tetraethyllead (TEL) and tetramethyllead (TML) were {{produced}} world-wide as anti-knocking additives for gasoline to increase octane numbers. The use of leaded gasoline over almost one century caused an ubiquiteous pollution {{of the environment}} with lead ions or alkyllead compounds (Rhue et al. 1992). Nowadays, tertiär-butylether (Europe) or in future ethanol (U. S.) are used to increase the octane numbers. Whereas car emissions led to an ubiquiteous distribution of low concentrations of organolead compounds and in greater amounts of inorganic lead in the upper layers of soil, spillages of highly toxic <b>tetraalkyllead</b> (TAL) compounds during production, transportation or blending at oil refineries and petrol stations caused more severe soil and groundwater contaminations. The toxicity of alkyllead compounds decreases in the sequence: R 4 Pb> R 3 Pb+> R 2 Pb 2 + with R = -CH 3 or-C 2 H 5. Methylated lead species are less toxic than the ethylated compounds. In the atmosphere TAL is decomposed photocatalytically by UV irradiation, by ozone or by hydroxyl radicals to the more stable, water soluble ionic tri- and dialkylated species. Monoalkyllea...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Organic {{derivatives}} of tin, lead, mercury are {{the most}} widely distributed organometallic ecotoxicants in the environment. While some of these organometallic compounds exist in the environment {{as a result of}} direct discharge, anthropogenic emissions alone cannot explain the ubiquity, for example, of the organomercury and organolead compounds in marine and fresh waters, sediments and biota. It is known that some organometallic compounds are formed via a bioconversion from the inorganic contaminants. Depending on the source, they can enter the environment in varied forms inorganic species of different stability. These can be bio-converted further by environmental biota; for instance metals such as tin and lead can be discharged into the environment in the form of organometallic species which can undergo further transformation. Determination of organometallics in environmental and biological samples is difficult due to matrix effect and their low concentrations. Separation and preconcentration is necessary to enhance final determination. Speciation studies are even more complicated. Speciation is an important aspect and gives information about bioavailability of the metal thus their toxicity. This work focused on the development of a method for speciation of organospecies of tin, lead and mercury. A new derivatisation agent has been synthesised and used successfully. SLM probe extraction has been exposed to a new matrix. Different environmental samples have been analysed for organo-species of tin and lead and their pathways predicted. The SLM probe extraction gives the advantage of carrying out several extractions, reduction of the amount of solvent used and avoidance of emulsion problems. A simple system has been developed and applied successfully on organotin and organolead extraction from aqueous environmental sample. For reproducibility of the results, pH, salinity, stirring rate and extraction time were optimized. An analytical method for simultaneous in situ ethylation, using new derivatisation agent bromomagnesium tetraethylborate (Et 4 BMgBr), of organotin and organomercury compounds in sediment samples was developed. The determination of mercury and tin compounds is achieved by species-specific isotope dilution, derivatisation and gas chromatography – inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC-ICP-MS). In derivatisation, pH and the amount of derivatisation agent were studied. Percentage recovery and accuracy of the method was confirmed by comparison of experimental results with sediment and plant certified reference material (IAEA 405 for sediment and CRM 279 for plant). Although organolead compounds as a gasoline additive are banned in most countries, in some regions, lead is still added to gasoline in varying proportions of different <b>tetraalkyllead</b> compounds and contamination by organolead compounds is still present at different places, e. g. : lead alkyl manufactures The use of both <b>tetraalkyllead</b> and butyltin is banned (<b>tetraalkyllead</b> as gasoline additive and butyltin in antifouling pints and PVC materials). This work focussed on their conversion in water and soil. This should provide an insight into their presence in the environment and an understanding of their degradation in the environment. A method for full speciation and determination of alkyl lead and inorganic lead (II) after the tetramethyllead degradation in aqueous samples has been developed. This was accomplished by in situ derivatisation with sodium tetraphenyllead borate NaB(Ph) 4 derivative. The derivatisation was carried out directly in the aqueous sample and the derivatives were extracted using the supported liquid membrane probe extraction (SLMPE). The extracted analytes were then transferred to a GC/MS for separation and detection. This study focused on the transformation of tetramethyllead in aqueous media, at different concentration of major elements, K+,Na+,Ca++, Mg++,Cl-,SO 4 [...] . Adsorption / desorption on soil of ionic organolead and organotin were also studied. As South Africa is one of the world’s major producers of coal, mercury should be monitored as it is a side product in coal combustion. The trend of inorganic mercury and methylmercury in sediment found in this work indicated a possible methylation of inorganic mercury to methylmercury in Klipriver sediments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{sensitive}} {{method for}} multielemental speciation analysis of volatile metal and metalloid compounds in air has been developed. The analytes are sampled simultaneously {{in the field}} by cryofocusing on a small glass wool-packed column at - 175 °C. Detection is performed in the laboratory by low-temperature GC hyphenated with ICPMS. Oxygen addition in the carrier gas was used to reduce interferences originating from the presence of volatile carbon-containing species in the samples. Plasma stability during analysis was monitored continuously by internal standardization (Xe). This system provides routine absolute detection limits of 0. 06 - 0. 07 pg (as Pb) for <b>tetraalkyllead</b> species (Me 4 Pb, Et 4 Pb), 0. 2 pg (as Sn) for tetraalkyltin species (Me 4 Sn, Et 4 Sn), 0. 8 pg (as Hg) for mercury species (Hg 0, Me 2 Hg, Et 2 Hg), and 2. 5 pg (as Se) for selenium species (Me 2 Se). This instrumentation {{makes it possible to}} collect small air sample volumes and has been successfully applied to the determination of volatile metal and metalloid species in the atmosphere in urban and rural locations. Qualitative application in the semiconductor industry is also reported with regard to the detection of arsenic (ASH 3, tert-butylarsine), phosphorus (PH 3, tert-butylphosphine), alkylindium, and gallium species...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIonic alkyllead {{species have}} been {{determined}} in fresh or slightly aged surface snow from Greenland relying on ultraclean sampling, high-resolution separation of individual species, and ultrasensitive determination procedures. The samples were collected from January to August 1989 on a precipitation event basis at Dye 3 (south Greenland) and in late spring and summer 1987 and 1989 {{at or near the}} Summit site (central Greenland). Evidence for long-range transport of organolead compounds into the very remote environment is given, and {{the nature and extent of}} the global pollution by organolead compounds are evaluated. Triethyl- and diethyllead species were found in all the samples, whereas methyllead species were absent in the late spring and summer samples. Monoalkyllead, mixed ionic organolead, and <b>tetraalkyllead</b> species were always found to be below 10 - 20 fg/g. The average total organolead concentrations form January to April was very high (476 fg/g, values between 100 and 800 fg/g, 0. 3 - 2 % of the total Pb), whereas the average summer concentration (May-August) was a factor of 5 lower (82. 6 fg/g, values between 15 and 220 fg/g, less than 0. 4 % of the total lead). The variations in the concentrations measured are interpreted in terms of backwards air mass trajectories. Source regions influencing Dye 3 at different times are indicated. Organolead compounds in Greenland are established to be valuable indicators of the global character of the lead pollution originated specifically in the use of leaded gasoline. © 1994 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Lead compounds, {{especially}} ionic organolead compounds (OLC), {{are highly}} toxic and mobile pollutants strongly affecting many ecosystems. Soil pools and fluxes with precipitation, litterfall and runoff of trimethyllead (TML), {{one of the}} dominant ionic OLC in the environment, and Pb-total were investigated in a forested ecosystem in NE-Bavaria, Germany. In addition, ad/desorption of TML to soils was studied in batch experiments and its degradation in soils was investigated using long term incubations. Total soil storage in the catchment was 11. 56 mg Pb ha(- 1) for TML and 222 kg Pb ha(- 1) for Pb-total. More than 90 % of the soil storage of TML {{was found in the}} wetland soils of the catchment representing only 30 % of the area. Most Pb-total (> 90 %) was found in die upland soils. In upland soils. TML was only detectable in the forest floor. The annual total deposition from the atmosphere. estimated as throughfall + litterfall fluxes, amounted to 3. 7 mg Pb ha(- 1) year(- 1) for TML and 52 g Pb ha(- 1) year(- 1) for Pb-total. The contribution of litterfall was 1. 5 and 32 %, respectively. The concentrations of TML and Pb-total in wet precipitation were: fog > throughfall > bulk precipitation. The annual fluxes with runoff from the catchment was 0. 5 mg Pb ha(- 1) year(- 1) for TML and 2. 8 g Pb ha(- 1) year(- 1) for Pb-total. TML degraded rapidly in the forest floor (Oa horizon) with a half-life (t(1 / 2)) of 33. 5 days. The degradation of TML in Fen (t(1 / 2) = 421 days) and in the mineral soil (Bw-C horizon, t(1 / 2) = 612 days) was much slower. Emission of tetramethyllead front wetland soils was not observed during the I year incubation. The adsorption affinity of TML to different soils was Fen > Oa > A {{greater than or equal to}} Bw-C The ratio of total soil storages to the present annual input were 3. 6 years for TML. TML and Pb-total are still deposited in remote areas even after the use of <b>tetraalkyllead</b> as additives has been terminated for years. The rates of deposition are, however, much lower than in the past. Forest soils act as a sink for deposited TML and Pb-total. TML is accumulated mostly in wetland soils and seems to be stable under anoxic conditions for along time. In upland soils, TML decomposes rapidly Only small amounts of TML are transferred from soils into runoff...|$|E
40|$|DOI: 10. 1016 /S 0167 - 9244 (06) 80015 - 6 International audienceThe {{pollution}} {{of the environment}} by lead is ubiquitous and has a global character. The major source of this element in the environment is the combustion of leaded gasoline. Despite severe restrictions in force in many countries, the use of <b>tetraalkyllead</b> as an antiknock agent remains the largest industrial application of organolead compounds and represents about 5 – 7 % of the total lead consumption, which is estimated at 3 – 3. 5 M tons [1, 2]. Other applications of organolead are less important and {{include the use of}} tetraethyllead (Et 4 Pb) in the manufacture of ethylmercury while trialkyllead compounds have been used as wood preservatives, antifouling agents in marine paints, and components of pesticides [1]. Evidence for the environmental formation of alkyllead from inorganic lead in nature is mainly circumstantial. The amount of organolead produced by biomethylation, if any, is insignificant when compared to the anthropogenic emission [3, 4]. The harmful effects of organolead compounds are considered to be much larger than those of inorganic lead [4 – 6]. The toxicity of alkyllead species diminishes in the sequence R 4 Pb → R 3 Pb+ → R 2 Pb 2 + → Pb 2 + (where R is a methyl- or ethyl- group) but the ionic forms are more persistent in the environment. In algae and higher plants alkyllead compounds were found to be responsible for the inhibition of growth, disturbances of mitosis and ultrastructural alterations. The organolead contamination of the aquatic environment is known to affect fish. About 150 fatal cases of human intoxication with Et 4 Pb {{have been reported in the}} literature. They were related to accidental exposures but long term environmental exposure to low levels of organolead has been associated with a wide range of metabolic disorders and neurophysical deficits especially to children. Starting in the seventies, the growing concern about the contribution of organolead to the lead burden of the biosphere has stimulated the development of analytical methodologies capable of discriminating between the inorganic lead - Pb(II) and traces (0. 1 – 1 % of the total lead) of organolead - Pb(IV), and further among the different organolead species. The currently accepted approaches are based almost exclusively on the use of hyphenated techniques as discussed in a few monographs[7 – 9]. These techniques are based on a combination of a separation technique such as gas chromatography (GC) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an element sensitive and selective detection technique, usually atomic absorption or emission spectrometry. The use of non-specific detectors is restricted owing to the interferences of many hydrocarbons occurring at high concentrations in real samples. The only noteworthy non-spectrometric technique proposed, differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry [10, 11], shows limited application especially when applied to the analysis of real samples. In the past 5 years, speciation analysis of organolead has been the subject of a few comprehensive review papers [4, 12, 13]. The very recent advances in instrumentation have rendered the routine detection of lead possible at the sub-pg level. However, severe limitations still remain on the level of sample preparation. Most of the existing procedures are very cumbersome, requiring a large amount of sample and tedious separation-preconcentration steps. Moreover, controversies still exist about the recovery of analytes and the efficiency of their derivatization which depends on the matrix type involved. Ultratrace analysis for organolead in the remote environment is likely to face the blank value problems common in trace analysis for total lead. Effective studies of pathways and natural sources of organolead require more straightforward analytical methods that are capable of the reliable determination of organolead species at concentration levels down to sub-ng. 11 in waters and sub-ng. g 1 in biological materials or sediments. Because of a large variety of sample types, custom-tailored methods need to be designed. This chapter aims to evaluate the state-of-the-art of methods available for the speciation analysis of organolead in different samples. Advantages and limitations of the analytical procedures applied are critically discussed with respect to sample preparation, Chromatographic separation and detector operating conditions as well as the chromatograph-spectrometer interface design. Very recent developments in speciation analysis for organolead by capillary gas chromatography, atomic emission and mass spectrometry are highlighted. Particular attention is given to the factors affecting accuracy of analyses and to the validation of the results. © 1995, Elsevier B. V...|$|E
