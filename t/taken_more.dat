5|$|Crawford {{originally}} created Frog Fractions {{to entertain}} his friends, {{and to see}} their reactions when they first played it. Later on, he felt that with the indie genre taking off, Frog Fractions was <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> seriously among gamers. Crawford noted that although critics often described the game as a satire on old educational games, he never intentionally developed Frog Fractions with that in mind. Instead, Crawford explained that Frog Fractions had an educational theme because of the name's alliteration, and because he considered educational games {{a part of his}} youth.|$|E

English, Pakistani and New Zealand bowlers have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> hat-tricks than any other nations; three bowlers from each nation have achieved the feat. Nine hat-tricks have been taken in ODIs, while all six of the hat-tricks in T20I matches have happened since the most recent instance in women's Tests.|$|E

5|$|Sercey's {{campaign}} had ended in failure, with little disruption to British trade or naval {{operations in the}} East Indies. The East India Company had however <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> serious losses from the depredations of privateers. Most active was Robert Surcouf, whose small ship Emilie captured the timber ship Penguin off Pegu in October 1795 and country ships Russell, Sambolasse and Diana off {{the mouth of the}} Hooghly River in January 1796. More seriously, he also captured the pilot boat Cartier, which he used to seize the large East Indiaman Triton.|$|E

5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> often.|$|E
5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E

In 2007, Rowling's young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of him. The photo, taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was subsequently published in a Sunday Express article featuring Rowling's family life and motherhood. The judgement was overturned in David's favour in May 2008.|$|E

5|$|England {{have won}} 46 of their 96 T20I matches. In 2010, they were crowned T20I world champions, {{defeating}} Australia by seven wickets in the final. Eoin Morgan {{is the current}} captain of the side, made the most appearances for England in T20I playing in 70 matches and has scored the most runs of any English batsman, making 1,576 runs from 68 innings, {{at an average of}} 28.65. Stuart Broad has <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> wickets than any other English bowler in T20I, dismissing 65 batsmen with an average of 22.93. Paul Collingwood has captained the side the most on 30 occasions. Alex Hales is the only English batsman to have scored a century and holds the record for the highest score by an England player in T20I cricket, with 116 not out in a six wicket victory over Sri Lanka in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deployment}} of the AIF a reinforcement system was used to replace wastage. Reinforcements received training in Australia before sailing as drafts and joining their assigned units at the front. To provide officer reinforcements, a series of AIF officer schools, such as that at Broadmeadows, were established in Australia before officer training was eventually concentrated at a school near Duntroon. These schools produced {{a large number of}} officers, but they were eventually closed in 1917 due to concerns that their graduates were too inexperienced and after this most replacement officers were drawn from the ranks of the AIF's deployed units, and candidates attended either British officer training units, or in-theatre schools established in France. After February 1916, the issue of NCO training was also <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> seriously, and several schools were established, with training initially being two weeks in duration before being increased to two months.|$|E
5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E

5|$|Like Leyland, the Yorkshire bowler Roy Kilner coached in India during 1927–28. However, {{in doing}} so Kilner {{contracted}} a fever and died shortly after returning to England. With a weakened bowling attack, and affected by injuries and loss of form, Yorkshire pressed Leyland into service as an occasional bowler in the 1928 season. He had done little bowling for Yorkshire at this point; the team possessed two slow left-arm spinners in Kilner and Rhodes, leaving Leyland with little opportunity. Having never bowled 50 first-class overs in a previous season, nor <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> than four wickets, he bowled over 500 overs in 1928 and took 35 wickets {{at an average of}} 34.20. At this stage, the Yorkshire authorities thought that he might fully take on Kilner's bowling workload, or succeed Rhodes in the senior spinner's position.|$|E
5|$|Nestling {{birds are}} common prey, being <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> often from nests in trees {{rather than on}} the ground. Grey jays find them by moving from perch to perch and {{scanning}} surroundings. Avian nest predation by grey jays is not necessarily higher in fragmented versus unfragmented forest. Evidence from studies in the Pacific Northwest suggest a moderate increase in nest predation in logged plots adjacent to mature conifer forest, which is the grey jay's preferred habitat. Studies of nest predation by grey jays in Quebec have shown that the birds prefer preying on nests in open forest with high prominence of jack pine, and greater rates of predation in riparian forest strips and green-tree retention stands versus clearcuts. This may be due to increased availability of perch sites for avian predators such as the grey jay. Grey jays are suspected but not proven to prey on nests of the threatened marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|Shane Warne, {{a retired}} {{international}} Australian cricketer, took {{a number of}} five-wicket hauls during his career for Australia. In cricket, a five-wicket haul - {{also known as a}} five-for or fifer- refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only four bowlers have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> than 30 five-wicket hauls in their Test cricket careers. Warne has the second-most five-wicket hauls in Test cricket with 37, behind Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan. Despite this he has only taken a single five-wicket haul in One Day Internationals (ODI). He {{is one of the most}} experienced Australian cricketers, and the second leading wicket taker in Test cricket history with 708 wickets, again behind Muralitharan. He is twelfth on the all-time list of ODI wicket takers. In 2000, Warne was named fourth of five Wisden Cricketers of the Century behind Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers and Sir Jack Hobbs.|$|E

5|$|Sydney Barnes was a {{professional}} cricketer who played for England in 27 Test matches between 1901 and 1914. He claimed 24 five-wicket hauls (five or more wickets in an innings) during his Test career. A five-wicket haul {{is regarded as a}} notable achievement, and as of 2014 fewer than 50 bowlers have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Barnes had only played seven first-class matches when he was chosen by Archie MacLaren to tour Australia, and played only 47 County Championship matches throughout his entire career, opting to play Minor Counties and Lancashire League cricket instead. He based his decision upon two main criteria– playing club cricket was more financially rewarding, and he was worried about having to bowl too much in first-class county cricket, and suffering from burnout.|$|E
5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.|$|E
