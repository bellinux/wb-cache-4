2500|$|Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly has {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. Nintendo Power {{gave it a}} 3.4/5 rating in 1991. UGO Networks gave the game a negative review, commenting that [...] "this uninspired train wreck of a Game Boy title fails on nearly every level, {{but most of all}} simply because it's a snore-fest. It's your basic side-scrolling platformer with little to no connection to the source material and lasts only about few hours at best. During the game you come across bullies, camp counselors and even a few wild animals, battling them with spitballs, a boomerang and, in <b>the</b> <b>lunchroom</b> level, food. This one is for completists only." [...] Matt Williamson of the Rocky Mountain News gave the game a C+ grade and commented that [...] "Escape from Camp Deadly tries too hard to be a Nintendo game. It's hard, I know, to try to make game graphics more primitive, but please, guys, the more complex you make the graphics, the more confusing a game gets!" [...] However, the Channel 4 video game programme GamesMaster gave the game an 89% rating.|$|E

2500|$|Baker {{then ran}} to the {{entrance}} of the Texas School Book Depository, entered the building with his gun drawn, and led by building superintendent Roy Truly, {{made his way to the}} far northwest corner of the first floor. From there, Baker and Truly started yelling for someone to send an elevator down from a higher floor. When there was no response, the two men began climbing the stairs, with Truly in the lead. Approximately 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Baker stepped out onto the second floor and a movement towards <b>the</b> <b>lunchroom</b> vestibule across from the stairs caught his attention. Baker confronted Oswald at gunpoint. He let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be nervous or out of breath. Truly said that Oswald appeared [...] "startled" [...] when Baker aimed his gun at him. According to the Warren Commission, Oswald was next seen by a secretary as he crossed through the second-floor business office carrying a soda bottle. He left the Texas School Book Depository through its front door at approximately 12:33p.m..|$|E
50|$|In 1931, Mrs. Betty Gray {{used the}} old home {{economics}} {{room of the}} grammar school building to start the School Lunchroom Program, mainly to supplement the diet of needy children. Without a market for their produce, many farmers were glad to exchange chickens, eggs, ham, milk, etc., for meals for their children. Under {{the guidance of the}} Woman's Club, with Mrs. Vernon Ward, Mrs. Haywood Wilson, and Mrs. Betty Gray, summer garden and canning projects served to stock <b>the</b> <b>lunchroom.</b> In 1939-40 more than 110 lunches were furnished daily, about 95 of which were free. Mrs. Betty Gray worked as a volunteer in <b>the</b> <b>lunchroom</b> for five years. Mr. Marvin Everett, Building Principal of the Outterbridge Grammar School, assumed the business management of <b>the</b> <b>lunchroom</b> in 1938-48. A ruling was passed in 1944 requesting pupils of the grammar school to bring lunch and eat in <b>the</b> <b>lunchroom.</b> An important by-product of <b>the</b> <b>lunchroom</b> was the group feeling that was created by all eating together.|$|E

As the town grew, it became a junction, with one branch of the railroad continuing west toward Sioux Falls, South Dakota and a second branch going north toward Farmington, Minnesota. The railroad placed a railyard at Wells. In 1903, as railroad operations expanded, The Milwaukee Road built the present station out of brick.

He was definitively more shocked than hurt. <b>The</b> <b>lunchroom</b> ladies came out see what was the ruckus. When they heard what happened, {{they gave me a}} free lunch and the kid had to stay on line. That was the end of it.
