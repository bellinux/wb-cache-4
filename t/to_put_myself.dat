25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E

The engineering process was handled by Jens Koerkmeier. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song's keyboards, whistle, guitars, bass, percussion and drum programming were provided by Eman, with additional keyboards and drum programming by Koerkmeier and Andrew Goldstein. On July 29, 2011, the audio of [...] "It Girl" [...] was uploaded to Derulo's official YouTube account. When speaking of the song, Derulo told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in a position as if I'd found my It Girl, to make myself feel like if I found that one true love.

[...] "It's You" [...] premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats One Radio on 25 February 2016, and a day later, 26 February 2016, it was released as the first promotional single from Zayn's debut solo studio album Mind of Mine (2016), along with the pre-order of the album on the iTunes Store.|$|E
500|$|Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker {{originally}} {{suggested the}} genus name Utahraptor {{for a new}} dinosaur specimen that had been found by an amateur bone-hunter in Utah. Bakker {{was at the time}} consulting with the designers of the Jurassic Park film, whose largest portrayed Velociraptorcalled the [...] "big female" [...] in the scriptwas coincidentally {{the same size as the}} newly discovered Utahraptor. Bakker was motivated to write the book by both his interest in dinosaur behavior and his desire to marry science and entertainment, saying that [...] "nature is a drama. It is the most ripping yarn ever written. You've got life and death and sex and betrayal and the best way to approach it is through individual animals." [...] According to Bakker, [...] "It was fun <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in the mind of a raptor, especially since being a top predator is so challenging ... much harder than [...] a herbivore." [...] He credited the turn-of-the-century naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton's works that focused on life from the perspectives of grizzly bears and wolves as having inspired him to write the novel from the dinosaur's point of view.|$|E

I {{have to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in the song for it to ring true to me. If it doesn't ring true to me, it's not going to be {{believable}} to anyone else." [...] Lewis described the album's style as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", containing R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds; however, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends, but are songs that can be performed acoustically.|$|E

2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for me to do this song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. She got it on me. And I'm just fucked up. It was good for me to get over that.

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible.

2500|$|In 2006 it was {{announced}} that Harry's unit was scheduled to be deployed in Iraq the following year and a public debate ensued as to whether he should serve there. Defence Secretary John Reid said that he should be allowed to serve on the front line of battle zones. Harry agreed saying, [...] "If they said 'no, you can't go front line' then I wouldn't drag my sorry ass through Sandhurst and I wouldn't be where I am now". The Ministry of Defence and Clarence House made a joint announcement on 22 February 2007 that Harry would be deployed with his regiment to Iraq, as part of the 1st Mechanised Brigade of the 3rd Mechanised Divisiona move supported by Harry, who had stated that he would leave the army if he was told to remain in safety while his regiment went to war. He said: [...] "There's no way I'm going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> through Sandhurst and then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country." [...] The head of the British army at the time, General Sir Richard Dannatt, said on 30 April 2007 that he had personally decided that Harry would serve with his unit in Iraq, and Harry was scheduled for deployment in May or June 2007, to patrol the Maysan Governorate. By 16 May, however, Dannatt announced that Harry would not serve in Iraq; concerns included Harry being a high-value target (as several threats by various groups had already been made against him) and the dangers the soldiers around him would face should any attempt be made on his life or if he was captured. Clarence House made public Harry's disappointment with the decision, though he said he would abide by it.|$|E

A nail driven down through the sleeve of the medium's dress seems to increase our control of her, and a metronome or a Morse telegraphic sounder does add value to our testimony, and yet Zöllner seems nearer right than Miller: matter seems only a condition of force, and subject to change at the will of the psychic.|$|R

Also on January 2, 2017 Wolfpac accepted the invite to perform, March and take part in the Family Psypher. On January 2, 2017 Killa C declined the invite (as he is now a devout Christian and no longer does horrorcore). Also on the same day other artist, 2 Live Crew, Glasses Malone and Kissing Candice accepted the invite. A few hours later Anybody Killa, Big Hoodoo, Blahzay Roze, DJ Clay, Jumpsteady, Lyte, JellyRoll, Vanilla Ice, Lil Wyte and Kung Fu Vampire all accepted invites for the March. A few hours later in the mid evening of January 2, 2017 Twiztid and Scum accepted their invites. Late in the night of January 2, 2017 Liquid Assassin and Bukshot accepted their invites to the March. On January 3, 2017 artists Necro and Sewerside accepted their invites, while The R.O.C. declined. In the early afternoon on January 3, 2017 Project Born accepted their invites to the March.

Since Young Wicked will not take part in the March, Axe Murder Boyz too will not take part. On January 5, 2017 Zug Izland accepted their invite for the March. On January 11, 2017 Lo Key accepted his invite for the March. On January 12, 2017, MC Chris declined his invite stating in part, [...] "I do not have a problem with Juggalos, but I will decline the invite because I have a upcoming fall tour, and am dependent on the DC market to make a living". On January 13, 2017 Potluck announced that they were no longer performing together, and have officially disbanded, thus they will not perform at the 2017 Juggalo March On Washington. On February 26, 2017 it was announced by the venue that Sam Hunt is scheduled to perform at the Jiffy Lube Center on September 16, 2017 and there never was any Insane Clown Posse or Psychopathic Records event ever scheduled to perform that night.|$|E

5000|$|In 1960, Hantaï {{developed}} his technique of [...] "pliage" [...] (folding): the canvas is folded and scrunched, then doused with colour, and unfolded, leaving apparent blank {{sections of the}} canvas interrupted by vibrant splashes of colour. He stated: [...] "The pliage developed out of nothing. It was necessary <b>to</b> simply <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> {{in the place of}} someone who had seen nothing... in the place of the canvas. You could fill the folded canvas without knowing where the edge was. You don't know where things stop. You could even go further, and paint with your eyes closed."

6000|$|During my time of {{struggle}} I had avoided all communication with old Hasluck. He {{was not a}} man to sympathise with feelings he did not understand. With boisterous good humour he would have insisted upon helping me. Why I preferred half starving with Lott and Co. to selling my labour for a fair wage to good-natured old Hasluck, merely because I knew him, I cannot explain. Though the profits may not have been so large, Lott and Co.'s dealings were not one whit more honest: I do not believe it was that which decided me. Nor do I think it was because he was Barbara's father. I never connected him, nor that good old soul, his vulgar, homely wife, in any way with Barbara. To me she was a being apart from all the world. Her true Parents! I should have sought them rather amid the sacred groves of vanished lands, within the sky-domed shrines of banished gods. There are instincts in us not easily analysed, not to be explained by reason.
