Robyn Blumner of <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of <b>the</b> <b>St</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Conservatory, Prokofiev initially {{made his name}} as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety {{with a series of}} ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915 Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite, compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev – Chout, Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son – which {{at the time of their}} original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel. Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges, composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia.|$|E

5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. <b>The</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|In 1760, {{with the}} Seven Years' War raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by {{advancing}} Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid {{compensation for the}} damage caused to Euler's estate, later Empress Elizabeth of Russia added a further payment of 4000 roubles – an exorbitant amount at the time. The political situation in Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great's accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant – a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.|$|E
5|$|The International Bowl had {{contracts}} with the Big East and Mid-American Conferences {{that allowed them to}} select one team from each conference to participate in their annual game. By virtue of being the Big East champion Cincinnati was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth; they would play in the 2009 Orange Bowl. The Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl shared the second pick of Big East teams; after the Gator Bowl opted to select Big 12 member Nebraska and the Sun Bowl learned {{that they would not be}} allowed to select Notre Dame, Pittsburgh received the Sun Bowl invitation. The Meineke Car Care Bowl, which had the third selection, picked West Virginia. The fourth, fifth, and sixth selections of Big East teams belonged collectively to the International Bowl, PapaJohns.com Bowl, and St. Petersburg Bowl, which, in consultation with the Big East, decided which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three remaining bowl-eligible Big East teams: Connecticut, Rutgers, and South Florida. The previous season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had appeared in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls in general dislike inviting the same team in consecutive years, on the theory that fans are less likely to want to travel to the same destination they were at the year before. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Bowl, in its inaugural year, sought to have local team South Florida play in their game to drive local attendance. Therefore, the teams were apportioned among the bowls as follows: South Florida to <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl. On December7,2008, UConn formally accepted the bowl invitation, the third in their history.|$|E

5|$|With the {{transition}} to hard courts after Wimbledon, Raonic made {{the quarterfinals of the}} Canadian Open, losing to Monfils, before falling to Murray for the fifth time in 2016 in the Cincinnati Masters semifinal. Raonic was the fifth seed at the US Open, but lost in the second round to Ryan Harrison, partly due to debilitating cramps. In September, cramps were cited as the reason for Raonic to miss Canada's Davis Cup tie against Chile. Later that month, Raonic failed to defend his title at <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Open, falling in his opening match to Youzhny. Raonic withdrew from the China Open prior to his semifinal match due to an ankle injury sustained in the quarterfinal. With the result, Raonic qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for the second time. Raonic suffered another injury, a quadriceps tear, during his quarterfinal match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Paris Masters and withdrew before his scheduled semifinal against Murray.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 Busoni {{published}} his {{first edition of}} works of J.S. Bach (the two- and three-part Inventions). In the same year he won the prize for composition, with his Konzertstück ("Concert Piece") for piano and orchestra Op.31a (BV 236), at the first Anton Rubinstein Competition, initiated by Anton Rubinstein himself at <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Conservatory. As a consequence {{he was invited to}} visit and teach at the Moscow Conservatoire. Gerda joined him in Moscow where they promptly married. His first concert in Moscow, when he performed Beethoven's Emperor Concerto, was warmly received. But living in Moscow did not suit the Busonis for both financial and professional reasons; he felt excluded by his nationalistically-inclined Russian colleagues. So when he received an approach from William Steinway to teach at New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, he was happy to take the opportunity, particularly as the conductor at that time of the Boston Symphony Orchestra was Arthur Nikisch, whom he had known since 1876, when they performed together at a concert in Vienna.|$|E

He later appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central TV series The Colbert Report, a news satire show about modern American politics. According to Moore, the decision to have him on the show came from Stephen Colbert, the current host for the TV series. A spokeswoman from Comedy Central {{would not comment on}} the motives behind the selection. Moore also wrote several articles in The Nation, The New Republic and National Journal, and the newspapers <b>The</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Times, The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune.
