The Blix' station building was therefore moved to Sunnan Station, while a new and larger building, designed by Paul Due, was built at Hell. It received an intermediate style between Dragestil and Jugendstil.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E
5|$|From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship. With {{no need for}} elaborate buildings divided up by ritual there was widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to adapt old buildings and build new churches suitable for reformed services, particularly by putting the pulpit and preaching at the centre of worship.|$|E

The master huntsman, or the veneur, held a central position in greater noble households. Likewise, the master falconer was a high-ranking officer, often of noble birth himself. There were spiritual needs to be cared for, and a chapel was a natural part of every large household. These household chapels would be staffed by varying numbers of clerics. The chaplains, confessors and almoners could serve in administrative capacities as well as the religious ones.|$|E
5|$|Sale's built {{environment}} is varied, {{with a mixture}} of modern and old buildings. Some terraces, semi-detached houses and villas, survive from the Victorian period, although many of the larger houses have been converted into flats. Many semi-detached houses survive from the 1930s, when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for new housing in the town {{as a result of a}} growing population and an increasingly wealthy middle class. Interspersed with these older structures are newer housing developments, such as the estates built in Ashton upon Mersey and the east of Sale during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|A {{multi-purpose}} breed, the Norman Cob {{was formerly}} used wherever <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need.</b> It was utilized {{in a variety}} of agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery. The postal service used it to pull mail carriages, which it was capable of doing at a fast trot over bad roads for long distances. Postal workers appreciated the breed for its willingness to remain calm, stationary and tethered for long periods of time. Due to the modernization of agriculture and transport, it is now used very little in these areas.|$|E

5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, {{the creation of a}} top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did not want the anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E
5|$|Historian R. E. Smith {{notes that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to raise {{additional}} legions {{in an emergency}} to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion. Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps {{with little or no}} military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder. However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.|$|E

Third <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for the development of an eco-syndemic understanding of the ways in which global warming contributes to the spread of diseases and new disease interactions. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for <b>a</b> better understanding of how public health systems and communities can best respond to and limit the health consequences of syndemics. Systems are needed to monitor the emergence of syndemics and to allow early medical and public health responses to lessen their impact. Systematic ethno-epidemiological surveillance with populations subject to multiple social stressors must be one component of such a monitoring system.|$|R
5|$|In December 2014, the Hellenic Parliament did {{not approve}} the new President with the supermajority required, and so a snap {{election}} was called {{for the end of}} January 2015. A few days before the 2015 election took place, Tsakalotos was quizzed on Syriza's economic policies by a number of economists, debt campaigners and investment analysts at the London School of Economics. Tsakalotos said <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for fiscal space, meaning 6–7billion Euros a year to spend on an expansionary fiscal policy. He also said that they would cancel the austerity budgets already agreed with the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), pay back the loans from the IMF and focus on rescheduling and writing off the loans from the EU.|$|E
5|$|One 1954 penny is known, struck for die-testing {{purposes}} at the Royal Mint, {{and intended}} for melting, but recovered from circulation. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the price of metal ensured that every bronze coin was struck at a loss; the Mint hoped for a reduction in size, and the demonetisation of the farthing at the end of 1960 helped clear the way for such a scheme. It was not until 1961 that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for more pennies to be minted, and production continued each year in very large numbers until the final pre-decimal pennies for circulation, dated 1967, were coined.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative {{government}} believed <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> {{for it to}} act {{to prevent}} Sinn Féin from using the media to defend {{the actions of the}} IRA, and the measures were part of a wider government response to the increase in violence, which also included changes to the right to silence and the tightening of rules allowing paramilitary prisoners early release. Further controversy also erupted in September 1988 over an intended edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark which was to have featured the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, as a guest. The show was dropped after the conservative academic Paul Wilkinson – a Professor at Aberdeen University who specialised in the study of terrorism and political violence – voiced strong objections to its transmission (more details here).|$|E

5|$|The Southern Railway was {{primarily}} a passenger-carrying railway which used most of its resources to extend its electrified lines. There was a continuing need for steam freight locomotives however, although the Traffic Department preferred mixed traffic designs which could also haul passenger trains on the remaining non-electrified lines at peak periods. By the late 1930s the Southern Railway was adequately served with powerful mixed traffic locomotives of the S15 and N and N1 classes, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for a smaller freight locomotive with high route availability that could also undertake light passenger duties.

5|$|With {{the team}} in the Premier League, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was {{recruited}} for a fee of £1.2 million.

Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds' {{further evidence of the}} decay in the modern game and modern player. Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000 which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction.

There was little infrastructure for the settlers, let alone criminals, so the shipwrecked Marquis of Angelsea, just off the coast from South Beach, was used as a makeshift prison. This arrangement was quite arduous for the sheriff, who spent much of his time rowing a small boat, either to transfer prisoners or bring over their meals. It was not until September 1830 that work started on a new prison at the west end of High Street: the twelve-sided Round House on Arthur Head.|$|E
