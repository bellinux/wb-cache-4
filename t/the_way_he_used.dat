500|$|Kohli {{is often}} {{compared}} to Tendulkar, {{due to their}} similar styles of batting, and {{sometimes referred to as}} Tendulkar's [...] "successor". Many former cricketers expect Kohli to break Tendulkar's batting records. Kohli has stated that growing up his idol and role model was Tendulkar and that as a kid he [...] "tried to copy the shots [...] played and hit sixes <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to hit them." [...] Former West Indies great Vivian Richards, who is regarded as the most destructive batsman in cricket, stated that Kohli reminds him of himself. In early 2015, Richards said Kohli was [...] "already legendary" [...] in the ODI format, while former Australian cricketer Dean Jones called Kohli the [...] "new king of world cricket".|$|E
500|$|Program music came {{naturally}} to Rimsky-Korsakov. To him, [...] "even a folk theme has {{a program of}} sorts." [...] He composed {{the majority of his}} orchestral works in this genre at two periods of his career—at the beginning, with Sadko and Antar (also known as his Second Symphony, Op. 9), and in the 1880s, with Scheherezade, Capriccio Espagnol and the Russian Easter Overture. Despite the gap between these two periods, the composer's overall approach and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> his musical themes remained consistent. Both Antar and Scheherezade use a robust [...] "Russian" [...] theme to portray the male progagonists (the title character in Antar; the sultan in Scheherezade) and a more sinuous [...] "Eastern" [...] theme for the female ones (the peri Gul-Nazar in Antar and the title character in Scheherezade).|$|E
500|$|Formby was {{the first}} comic to use a delayed {{entrance}} as a joke to make the audience laugh before he arrived: his orchestra played his entrance music, and then he failed to appear on stage. His act included songs, described by Smart and Bothway Howard as [...] "characteristically simple, some with tunes derived from Methodist hymns, and with catchy choruses", and he would chat to the orchestra conductor and front rows, punctuating his stage patter—delivered in a deadpan style—with his cough. He used his health—particularly the coughing—as part of his act, and would {{say that he was}} [...] "Coughin' well tonight!" [...] He also created the phrase [...] "It's not the cough that carries you off – it's the coffin they carries you off in!" [...] One of Formby's nicknames, [...] "The Wigan Nightingale" [...] was coined because of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> his bronchial cough in his act.|$|E

500|$|The episode [...] "The Sponge Who Could Fly" [...] {{was adapted}} in 2009 {{as a stage}} musical at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, and later in South Africa. Actor Charles Brunton {{originated}} the role of Squidward, later recalling that he loved the character, and the [...] "fun [...] trying to re-create a well established cartoon character into a live performance on stage." [...] Brunton prepared for the role by buying nine DVDs of the series, acting out Squidward's part in each episode, in his bedroom. He said, [...] "it took ages to perfect the voice and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> his arms". Brunton's performance and the musical were well received by most critics. A critic from The Public Reviews wrote, [...] "Charles Brunton as Squidward really stole the show for us, his character was nailed to perfection, from his comic acting, voice and mannerisms this was a faultless performance". In his review for The Northern Echo, Viv Hardwick said, [...] "Charles Brunton makes a convincing Squidward". The role was played by Chris van Rensburg in South Africa.|$|E
500|$|The {{film critic}} Baradwaj Rangan, {{in his review}} of another Kamal film, Vishwaroopam (2013), found the {{ethnicity}} {{of the characters in}} the film to be a continuation of Kamal's inclusion of non-Tamil characters in his films. Rangan considered this to be Kamal's acknowledgement of the [...] "interconnectedness of the nation" [...] and [...] "the world beyond India". He pointed out in his article that Kamal had experimented with the concept before by including the usage of Bengali language and meeting Bengalis in Mahanadi (1994), a Telugu-speaking love interest in Nammavar (1994), marrying a Bengali woman in Hey Ram (2000), conducting investigations with an American associate in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu (2006), and marriage to a Frenchwoman in Manmadan Ambu (2010). Rangan notes that in Anbe Sivam, the inclusion of and interaction with the Odia people was another example of including non-Tamil characters in his films. Rangan also compared Kamal's fight sequence with the use of an umbrella to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> a book and stool in Thoongadhey Thambi Thoongadhey (1983).|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of November, before the first-class matches began, Waddington was operated on for abscesses, and missed the first five games. He played only one first-class match before the first Test, but took wickets in several minor matches. Selected for the first Test, he took the first wicket to fall in the game, that of Charlie Macartney, but failed to take another wicket in the match while conceding 88 runs, hampered by a leg injury in the later stages. He did not play another Test until the fourth, where he bowled five overs for 31 runs. Waddington ended the tour with seven wickets {{at an average of}} 46.71; his single Test wicket was at a cost of 119 runs. The tour was a frustrating experience for Waddington, who found the heat difficult to deal with; he was also unhappy that most of his appearances came in the non-first-class country matches, many against opponents fielding more than eleven players to make a more even fight. [...] Throughout the tour, the press criticised Douglas for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> bowlers. Although Yorkshire used Waddington in short bursts with the objective of taking wickets, Douglas used him to bowl long defensive spells with the prime objective of [...] run-saving, a task to which Waddington was unsuited. Considered a failure—Wisden later described his tour as [...] "a sad disappointment"—Waddington did not play for England again and was never seriously considered for a recall. He did have one batting success on the tour, scoring his maiden first-class fifty against an [...] "Australian XI".|$|E

500|$|Returning home, Brian informs Lois that Limbaugh will {{be coming}} over for dinner. That night, Lois and Peter begin arguing and {{challenging}} Limbaugh politically. Deciding to confront Limbaugh for brainwashing Brian, Lois demands for their dog {{to go back to}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to be. Limbaugh insists Brian became a conservative on his own terms, and the two sing a number based on [...] "The Company Way", [...] "Republican Town". Angered, Brian decides to move out and become roommates with a reluctant Limbaugh. Brian begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion. He replaces lots of Limbaugh's possessions with American-Made versions, which all go wrong. Deciding to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, Brian attempts to voice his own political opinions on the air about Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, causing Limbaugh to become frustrated and throw him out. Deciding to prove his devotion to the conservative cause, Brian attempts to waterboard Pelosi before being apprehended and arrested. After being bailed out by Limbaugh later that day, Brian continues to assert his conservatism. Limbaugh attempts to convince Brian he is only fighting against the Establishment due to his desire of being the underdog. He tells Brian that a child was executed in Texas and Brian is visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian's honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Rush leaves the jail, making a Grapes of Wrath-like pledge to [...] "be around" [...] wherever conservative causes need help. Outside, they heckle each other with reassurance, and the episode ends with Limbaugh then transforming into a bald eagle and flying away into the skyline.|$|E
2500|$|... 1. The Mirror of Princes genre. [...] {{summarized}} {{the similarities between}} The Prince and the genre it obviously imitates, the so-called [...] "Mirror of Princes" [...] style. This was a classically influenced genre, with models {{at least as far}} back as Xenophon and Isocrates, that was still quite popular during Machiavelli's life. While Gilbert emphasizes the similarities however, he agrees with all other commentators that Machiavelli was particularly novel in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> this genre, even when compared to his contemporaries such as Baldassare Castiglione and Erasmus. One of the major innovations Gilbert noted was that Machiavelli focused upon the [...] "deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom". Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. (Xenophon is also an exception in this regard.) ...|$|E
