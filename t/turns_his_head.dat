5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, The Amazing Maleeni, a small-time magician, performs an amazing feat to impress a heckler—he <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> 360 degrees. So when he is later found without a head at all, Mulder and Scully arrive on the case and discover an angry ex-con, an unimpressed rival, and Maleeni’s twin brother. All seem {{to have something to}} do with a plan to rob a major bank.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings are {{not highly}} territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.|$|E
25|$|The head tracker {{registers}} {{the translation}} and {{rotation of the}} user's head. Pointman uses these inputs to map {{the movements of the}} user's head and torso one-for-one to those of his avatar. The virtual view changes as the user <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to look around or leans his torso in any direction. When the weapon is raised into an aim position its sights remain centered in the field of view, so that turning the head also adjusts the aim. The user can aim as precisely as he can hold his head on target. Hunching the head down by flexing the spine is also registered by the head's translation, and the avatar adopts a matching posture. Leaning forward and hunching are used to duck behind cover. Rising up and leaning to the side are used to look out and shoot from behind cover.|$|E
60|$|It was {{astonishing}} {{how easily}} he could <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> without moving <b>his</b> body. Some folks {{told us that}} if we walked around and around him, he would <b>turn</b> and <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> until he twisted it off, but we never tried that.|$|R
60|$|He had not <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at {{the opening}} or closing of the door, but {{presently}} another sound broke the silence. It was a woman's sob, and as he slowly <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> a tall, graceful figure moved forward out of the shadows, and he heard his name softly murmured.|$|R
60|$|Von Ragastein <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} towards his questioner.|$|R
500|$|Adam Serwer from Mother Jones said, [...] "Django, {{like many}} Tarantino films, {{also has been}} criticized as cartoonishly violent, {{but it is only}} so when Django is killing slave owners and overseers. The {{violence}} against slaves is always appropriately terrifying. This, if nothing else, puts Django in the running for Tarantino's best film, the first one in which he discovers violence as horror rather than just spectacle. When Schultz <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away from a slave being torn apart by dogs, Django explains to Calvin Candie—the plantation owner played by Leo DiCaprio—that Schultz just isn't used to Americans." ...|$|E
500|$|However, SpongeBob convinces {{the other}} band members {{to go through}} with the {{performance}} for Squidward's sake, and he takes command of their training. On the day of the concert, when Squilliam shows up in order to see Squidward fail, Squidward claims that his band died in a marching accident. However, Squidward's band shows up and he is forced {{to go through with}} the performance. [...] They enter a large glass dome complete with human fans. Squidward <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away from the band before they begin, assuming that the performance will be a disaster, but the band is tremendously successful, playing a rock ballad titled [...] "Sweet Victory". Squilliam enters a state of shock and faints, leaving Squidward to celebrate as he leaps into the air.|$|E
500|$|The man {{is again}} {{lying on the}} bed, now in a gray suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before {{opening the door to}} a woman (Natalie Portman). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and {{presents}} the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it [...] "wasn't actually that hard". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.|$|E
60|$|His {{face was}} {{suddenly}} immovable. He <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very slightly.|$|R
60|$|Andrew <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> toward <b>his</b> friend. The tone puzzled him.|$|R
60|$|He {{proceeded}} with his task, and never <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> towards me.|$|R
500|$|The male European nightjar's song is a {{sustained}} churring trill, given continuously {{for up to}} 10minutes with occasional shifts of speed or pitch. It is delivered from a perch, and the male may move around its territory using different song posts. Singing is more frequent at dawn and dusk than during the night, and is reduced in poor weather. The song may end with a bubbling trill and wing-clapping, perhaps indicating the approach of a female. Migrating or wintering birds sometimes sing. Individual male nightjars can be identified by analysing the rate and length of the pulses in their songs. Even a singing male {{may be hard to}} locate; the perched bird is difficult to spot in low light conditions, and the song has a ventriloquial quality as the singer <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The song is easily audible at , and can be heard at [...] in good conditions; it can be confused with the very similar sound of the European mole cricket.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E
500|$|Condors {{begin to}} look for a mate when they reach sexual {{maturity}} at the age of six. To attract a prospective mate, the male condor performs a display, in which the male <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> red and puffs out his neck feathers. He then spreads his wings and slowly approaches the female. If the female lowers her head to accept the male, the condors become mates for life. The pair makes a simple nest in caves or on cliff clefts, especially ones with nearby roosting trees and open spaces for landing. A mated female lays one bluish-white egg every other year. Eggs are laid as early as January to as late as April. The egg weighs about [...] and measures from [...] in length and about [...] in width. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, the parents [...] "double clutch", or lay another egg to take the lost one's place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for puppet-rearing; this induces the parents to lay a second egg, which the condors are sometimes allowed to raise.|$|E

500|$|Dale Keown's {{comic book}} artwork of the Hulk was an {{inspiration}} for his design. Leterrier felt the first Hulk had [...] "too much fat [...] the proportions were a little off". He explained, [...] "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank." [...] Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder. A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as {{they did not want}} him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited flushing as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions. The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an olive or even gray slate. His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film. The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato's art. He originally had a crew cut, but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character. Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change. As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms. Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of [...] "an über-human" [...] like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones; creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle. The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on a shark. The character also shares Roth's tattoos. A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character. Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the example of Mike Tyson when he fought Evander Holyfield), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.|$|E
2500|$|Okajima has a {{distinctive}} pitching {{form in which}} he <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> downwards just before he releases the ball and after release jerks it hard towards third base. These extra movements appear to give Okajima some added velocity to his pitches as they torque his body towards home plate and reportedly disguise his pitches and cause batters to swing early. Okajima {{is said to have}} mimicked the pitching form of a pitcher in Yoichi Takahashi's manga [...] who torqued his head so much after every pitch that his hat came flying off. Okajima admits, [...] "I was trying to copy the motion. I believed it would make me throw harder." ...|$|E
60|$|Tanner <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and looks}} fixedly at Ramsden, who angrily refuses to receive this mute communication.|$|E
60|$|Mannering <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Apparently he {{was looking}} out of the window.|$|R
60|$|He {{started out}} of the room, halted, and <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and hesitated.|$|R
60|$|The Mexican <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{quickly in}} the {{direction}} Bridge's index finger indicated.|$|R
6000|$|CANDIDA. Shall he stay, James, if he {{promises}} to be a good boy and to help me to lay the table? (Marchbanks <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looks steadfastly at Morell over his shoulder, challenging his answer.) ...|$|E
60|$|D'Orsay, {{who knows}} Italy very well indeed, strenuously insists {{there is no}} such place for {{headquarters}} as Pisa. Lady Blessington says so also. What do you say? On the first of July! The first of July! Dick <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> towards the orange groves.|$|E
60|$|The {{next one}} {{has no such}} courage. Collapsed altogether, he has nothing more to say for himself or his creed. Giotto hangs the cloak upon him, in Ghirlandajo's fashion, as from a peg, but with ludicrous narrowness of fold. Literally, he is a 'shut-up' Magus--closed like a fan. He <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away, hopelessly. And the last Magus shows nothing but his back, disappearing through the door.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{touched his}} arm almost imperiously as he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again.|$|R
60|$|Brooke <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{a little}} {{so that he}} could see Barbara's face.|$|R

6000|$|... "Even so. THEN he {{springs from}} behind and <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> aside as he strikes, for he is full of fear. If Man looked at him he would run. But on his one Night he goes openly down to the village. He walks between the houses and thrusts {{his head into the}} doorway, and the men fall on their faces, and there he does his kill. One kill in that Night." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the mating}} season, when {{three or four}} bears often roam the woods {{together}} in fighting humor, Mooween uses a curious kind of challenge. Rising on his hind legs against a big fir or spruce, he tears the bark with his claws as high as he can reach on either side. Then placing {{his back against the}} trunk, he <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and bites into the tree with his long canine teeth, tearing out a mouthful of the wood. That is to let all rivals know just how big a bear he is.|$|E
60|$|He {{does not}} busy {{himself with the}} sports of his comrades, and holds a cricket-bat no better than Miss Raby would. He employs the play-hours in {{improving}} his mind, and reading the newspaper; he is a profound politician, and, it must be owned, on the liberal side. The elder boys despise him rather; and when champion Major passes, he <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and looks down. I don't like the expression of Bullock's narrow green eyes, as they follow the elder Champion, who {{does not seem to}} know or care how much the other hates him.|$|E
