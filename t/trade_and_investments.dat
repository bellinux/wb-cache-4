40|$|The global <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>investment</b> {{architecture}} (GTIA) plays {{a critical}} role in shaping the organisation and structure of international commerce – from production and distribution to consumption. Yet, tensions and questions abound – some longstanding, some new – about whose interests it best advances, its distributional impacts, and its responsiveness to changing market forces and political demands. Although there is a regular supply of proposals on rules and policies for global <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>investment,</b> critical thinking on the <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>investment</b> architecture is less prevalent. This paper seeks to update and bolster the analytical foundations for such discussion by reviewing the changing demands on the global architecture for <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>investment,</b> <b>and</b> by mapping its contours. To begin, we review the changing global landscape for <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>investment,</b> the key policy debates, and the myriad pressures on policymakers – arguing that these have implications for what is needed in terms of a global architecture. Alongside key enduring challenges, we identify important shifts and game changers in <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>investment</b> flows, which in turn spur new policy challenges and implications for the governance architecture. Second, we presen...|$|R
