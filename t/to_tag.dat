The Disasters used {{their size and}} strength to gain the advantage, but Earthquake accidentally performed an avalanche on Typhoon. The Beverlys controlled the match for several minutes, with Blake executing a splash and a front facelock. Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents but was unable <b>to</b> <b>tag</b> in Earthquake. Later, Typhoon tried <b>to</b> <b>tag</b> again, but Beau distracted Earthquake; while the referee's back was turned, The Beverlys' manager, The Genius handed Blake a metal scroll, which Blake used to hit Typhoon. Typhoon recovered, however, and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled {{the remainder of the}} match. He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake splash.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed.

Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP <b>to</b> <b>tag</b> the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E

5|$|GJ 3634 {{is named}} for its {{location}} in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars; a later expansion of the original catalogue was compiled jointly by Gliese and Hartmut Jahreiß. The Third Catalogue, the most recent catalogue, was formed <b>to</b> <b>tag</b> all then-known stars within 25 parsecs of Earth (81.54 light years). GJ 3634 was first catalogued in 1987. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b worked through the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile for over six years in search of planets that orbited low-mass red dwarfs. After the discoveries of eleven prior planets, the researchers changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits. They would first discover the system using the radial velocity method, in which an observed Doppler shift in the star's light would be measured and interpreted; and would then follow up with a search for transits, in which the planet crosses in front of and dims its star as seen from Earth. Radial velocity measurements would help determine the most efficient and time-effective means of observing potential planetary transits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Web 2. 0 {{has brought}} tagging at the {{forefront}} of user practises for organizing and locating resources. Unfortunately, these tagging efforts suffer from a main drawback: lack of interoperability. Such situation hinders tag sharing (e. g. tags introduced at del. icio. us to be available at Flickr) and, in practice, leads <b>to</b> <b>tagging</b> data <b>to</b> be locked <b>to</b> <b>tagging</b> sites. This work argues that for <b>tagging</b> <b>to</b> reach its full potential, tag management systems should be provided that accounts for a common way <b>to</b> handle <b>tags</b> no matter the tagging site (e. g. del. icio. us, Flickr) that frontended the tagging. This paper introduces TAGMAS (TAG MAnagement System) that offers a global view of your tagging data no matter where it is located. By capitalizing on TAGMAS, tagging applications can be built in a quicker and robust way. Using measurements and one use case, we demonstrate the practicality and performance of TAGMAS...|$|R

Rhodes and DiBiase, however, {{isolated}} JTG in their corner and performed a number of offensive maneuvers on him. Rhodes attempted a moonsault onto JTG, but missed, allowing JTG <b>to</b> <b>tag</b> in Shad {{at the same time}} Rhodes tagged in DiBiase. Shad performed a back body drop on DiBiase, but while the referee was distracted, Rhodes performed a DDT on Shad. DiBiase attempted to cover Shad, but was forced to break the cover as Shad placed his foot on the bottom rope. JTG attempted an inside cradle pin on Rhodes, but Shad accidentally pushed DiBiase on Rhodes, reversing the pinfall attempt so that Rhodes scored the pin over JTG, retaining his and DiBiase's title in the process.|$|E

When Dink entered the match, the rules stated that Bigelow had <b>to</b> <b>tag</b> Vachon into the match. Dink ran around the ring avoiding Vachon, but she eventually caught him. She kicked him and powerslammed him, but she then missed a moonsault attempt. Doink and Bigelow re-entered the match, and Doink performed a DDT on Bigelow. Bigelow reversed the momentum to win the match after a diving headbutt on Doink. Bigelow pinned Doink to win the match, and he and Vachon then attacked Dink.|$|E
