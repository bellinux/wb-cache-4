5|$|In the Early Modern period, Aristotle came to {{represent}} {{all that was}} obsolete, scholastic, and wrong, not helped by his association with medieval theology. In 1632, Galileo represented Aristotelianism in his Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo by the strawman Simplicio ("Simpleton"). That same year, William Harvey proved Aristotle wrong by demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>blood</b> circulates.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so <b>that</b> <b>blood</b> can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E
5|$|High {{blood lead}} levels in adults are also {{associated}} with decreases in cognitive performance and with psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. It {{was found in a}} large group of current and former inorganic lead workers in Korea <b>that</b> <b>blood</b> lead levels in the range of 20–50μg/dL were correlated with neuro-cognitive defects. Increases in blood lead levels from about 50 to about 100μg/dL in adults {{have been found to be}} associated with persistent, and possibly permanent, impairment of central nervous system function.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{the teachings}} of Galen {{continued}} to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the Church. Andreas Vesalius questioned some of Galen's beliefs of the heart in De humani corporis fabrica (1543), but his magnum opus was interpreted {{as a challenge to}} the authorities and he was subjected to a number of attacks. Michael Servetus wrote in Christianismi Restitutio (1553) <b>that</b> <b>blood</b> flows {{from one side of the}} heart to the other via the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Seemingly {{restored}} to full health, Bradman blazed two centuries {{in the last}} two games of the tour. However, when he returned to London to prepare for the trip home, he experienced severe abdominal pain. It took a doctor more than 24hours to diagnose acute appendicitis and a surgeon operated immediately. Bradman lost a lot of blood during the four-hour procedure and peritonitis set in. Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition. On 25 September, the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and <b>that</b> <b>blood</b> donors were needed urgently.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by blood bank leadership occurred {{as early as}} 1982, yet {{it was not until}} 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), <b>that</b> <b>blood</b> bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions. Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for hepatitis alone might offend the donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.|$|E

5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} <b>that</b> <b>blood</b> exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins {{and back to the}} heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E
5|$|Shtriga is a vampiric witch in {{traditional}} Albanian folklore that sucks {{the blood of}} infants at night while they sleep, and then turns into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as {{a woman with a}} hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in <b>that</b> <b>blood</b> and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|E

25|$|Transfusion-associated volume {{overload}} is {{a common}} complication simply {{due to the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>blood</b> products have a certain amount of volume.
