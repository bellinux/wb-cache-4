40|$|Toxocara canis (T. canis) is {{the common}} {{roundworm}} of dogs and other Canidae. Seroprevalence surveys suggest that human infection with this parasite is second only the pinworm in developed countries. Human infection with T. canis is difficult to demonstrate because infecting larvae remain developmentally arrested within the tissues. The current diagnosis of toxocariasis is based on clinical findings correlated with the detection of specific antibodies in the serum. However, many seroresponders show no evidence of clinical infection which questions the relevance of detecting an antibody response to <b>T.</b> canis in <b>these</b> <b>people.</b> <b>T.</b> canis larvae are known to release excretory-secretory antigens in vivo and in vitro. The detection of these antigens in serum potentially provides a marker for current infection. The aim {{of this research was}} the development and evaluation of an ELISA capable of detecting circulating ED antigens in human serum. Four assays for ES antigen detection were evaluated using both polyclonal antisera produced against T. canis and a T. canis-specific monoclonal antibody...|$|R
40|$|Traveling Waggoner {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and prestige work of the Ukrainians at particular historical times. In the <b>T.</b> Shevchenko heritage <b>these</b> <b>people</b> got a lot of attention in both literature texts and paintings. The author of this article gives the deep analysis of the philosophical and historical origins of the Wagoner motifs in Shevchenko's art. T. Shevchenko brought the knowledge about Waggoner gob and life style from an early childhood. His ethnographical descriptions of a life style of such people correspond completely to an official information about Waggoners. T. Shevchenko's art is a miniature reflection of the traveling Waggoners life (social and ethnographical). The scrupulous analyses of the poetry and paintings with the "Chumatsky" motif i testifies that there are a strong connection with the history, philosophy and social life of this social group of Ukrainian population. T. Shevchenko's poetry shows a link between unhappy imperial life of the contemporaries and the Cossacks liberty. The Traveling Waggoners became in his poetry the symbolic figure representing Ukrainians who are trying to remember their historical, religious and ethnic heritage but their consciousness has had some deformation. This aspect gives an additional element for Shevchenko's myth of Ukraine...|$|R
