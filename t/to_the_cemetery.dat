5|$|Despite the opposition, on 30 June 1852 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Act 1852 was passed, {{giving the}} Brookwood scheme Parliamentary consent to proceed. The former Woking Common at Brookwood, {{owned by the}} Earl of Onslow, {{was chosen as the}} site for the new cemetery. To prevent the LSWR from {{exploiting}} its monopoly on access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did not specify details of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E
5|$|Near the baptistery is a {{separate}} rectangular mortuary chapel (ermita de difuntos) built in 1859. A road from the mortuary chapel leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> with stone fences. At {{the middle of the}} cemetery is a stone chapel and an ossuary at its back.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 1852 the {{promoters}} of the Brookwood scheme were given Parliamentary consent to proceed, and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company (LNC) was formed.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cemetery</b> has within {{recent years}} {{announced}} {{policies and procedures}} that limit visitor access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery's</b> grounds. <b>The</b> <b>Cemetery's</b> executive director has stated {{that some of these}} may create delays for visitors.

5|$|Some special {{aspects of}} the temple complex are: the belief that Maitreya (Byams pa) assures rebirth to those whose remains are brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> below Keu tshang {{and it is also}} {{believed}} that light rays are exchanged between the Maitreya image here and the Maitreya Chapel at the northern end of the Barskor in Lhasa.|$|E
5|$|The LNC {{continued}} to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s {{on the matter}} of cheap fares for visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s4d) for day return tickets from London to Brookwood. By this time most visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> were travelling by road. The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway, and the proposal was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{operating}} entrances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> The main entrance is on Oakwood Avenue {{at the southern}} tip of the property; it is flanked by the keeper's house. The 114th Street entrance is marked only by a gate and connects to Gurley Avenue. The 101st Street entrance passes the office lodge.|$|E

25|$|Hosking's brief was <b>to</b> design <b>the</b> <b>cemetery's</b> {{buildings}} <b>to</b> {{reflect this}} new liberal departure in burial reform, and <b>to</b> complement <b>the</b> <b>cemetery's</b> historic parkland setting, into which a magnificent arboretum and educational institute were {{also to be}} established.|$|R
5|$|Brookwood {{station on}} the former LSWR line (now the South Western Main Line and the Alton Line) is little changed since the 1903 {{expansion}} and rebuilding. It remains in use both by commuters from the village which has grown {{to the north of}} the railway line, and by visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> to the south of the line. A small monument to the London Necropolis Railway, consisting of a short length of railway track on the former trackbed, was erected in 2007 outside the southern (cemetery-side) entrance to the station.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the decline}} in burials from an already low level, rising land values in the post war years meant that the LNC was a {{valuable}} and successful company. In the 1940s it bought {{out a number of}} other firms of funeral directors, particularly those catering for the expanding and prosperous suburbs of south west London within easy reach of Brookwood by road. The LNC continued to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s on the matter of cheap fares for visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s4d) for return tickets for same-day travel from London to Brookwood and back. By this time most visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> were travelling by road. The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway, and the proposal was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|He died on March 29, 1829. He {{was taken}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> by his sons. There was no state funeral at the time, because Juan Lavalle made a coup against the {{governor}} Manuel Dorrego and executed him, starting {{a period of}} civil war. Lavalle was defeated by Juan Manuel de Rosas, who was appointed governor. Once he restored peace, Rosas made a state funeral for Saavedra, on January 13, 1830.|$|E

5|$|José de San Martín died on 17 August 1850, in {{his house}} at Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. Between 1850 and 1861, his corpse {{was buried in the}} crypt of the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Boulogne. He {{requested}} in his will to be taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> without any funeral, and to be moved to Buenos Aires thereafter. Balcarce informed Rosas and the foreign minister Felipe Arana of San Martín's death. Balcarce oversaw the embalming of his remains and their temporary stay in a chapel of the city. He also sent San Martin's saber to Rosas.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> to exhume {{the other}} victims {{only to find}} the graves already dug up and the coffins missing. Mulder realizes that Billy Miles is {{responsible}} for bringing the victims to the woods. Returning to the woods, they again encounter Detective Miles, but hear a scream and find Billy nearby with Theresa in his arms. There is a flash of light, and Billy and Theresa are recovered unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Railway (SR), {{which had}} absorbed the LSWR in 1923, offered the LNC the {{temporary}} use of Waterloo station {{to allow the}} Necropolis Railway service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling {{to and from the}} cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery had little reason to choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> stations over the SR's fast and frequent services to Brookwood. The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which genuine mourners could still travel cheaply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> on the 11.57am service to Brookwood (the SR service closest to the LNC's traditional departure time), but the SR management (themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage) refused to entertain any compromise. In September 1945, following the end of hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway. Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition, the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus. With the soil of the cemetery causing the branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained, the branch line was in extremely poor condition.|$|E

5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man {{who was supposed to be}} in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits what appears to be the visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E
5|$|Howell's body later washed ashore and was {{returned}} to Australia for burial; Fraser's remains were never discovered. Howell was accorded a funeral with full military honours, which took place at Warringal Cemetery, Heidelberg on 22 April 1920, with several hundred mourners in attendance; his widow, parents and sister were chief among these. A firing party of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery led the gun carriage bearing the coffin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery.</b> Captains Adrian Cole, Frank Lukis and Raymond Brownell acted as pallbearers along with five other officers who had served in either the Royal or Australian Flying Corps. On 12 February 1923, a stained-glass window dedicated {{to the memory of}} Howell was unveiled by General Sir Harry Chauvel at St. Anselm's Church of England in Middle Park; Howell {{had been a member of}} the congregation there in his youth. Following the closure of St. Anselm's in 2001, the window was moved to St. Silas's Church, Albert Park, which is now also the parish church for the former parish of St. Anselm.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1941 {{the station}} was officially {{declared}} closed. The last recorded funeral carried on the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish (1868–1941), buried on 11 April 1941. The SR offered the LNC the temporary use of platform 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to allow the service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling {{to and from the}} cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery had little reason to choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains over the SR's fast and frequent services to their own Brookwood railway station. The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which bona fide mourners could still travel cheaply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> on the 11.57am service to Brookwood (the SR service closest to the LNC's traditional departure time), but the SR management (themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage) refused to entertain any compromise.|$|E
50|$|The Town of Lawndale was {{incorporated}} in 1924, primarily {{at the behest}} of <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> owners with <b>the</b> cooperation of the handful of residents who lived closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemeteries.</b> <b>The</b> residential and business areas immediately <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north continued <b>to</b> be known as Colma. Because another California city named Lawndale already existed, in Los Angeles County, the post office retained the Colma designation, and the town changed its name back to Colma in 1941.|$|R
25|$|All {{three are}} {{contributing}} resources <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery's</b> historic character. There {{is one other}} building, a modern cemetery office and garage {{just south of the}} main entrance. Due to its recent construction it is non-contributing.|$|R
50|$|A {{cemetery}} {{association was}} incorporated in 1850, following a pattern around the county. This seemed <b>to</b> ignore <b>the</b> <b>cemetery's</b> inclusion in <b>the</b> church's original incorporation 46 years earlier. It {{may have been}} done <b>to</b> ensure that <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> remained nondenominational.|$|R
5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E
5|$|The last {{recorded}} funeral party {{carried on}} the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish (1868–1941), buried on 11 April 1941. The Southern Railway offered the LNC the temporary use of platform 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to allow the service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling {{to and from the}} cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery other than members of funeral parties had little reason to choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains over the SR's fast and frequent services to Brookwood. The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which genuine mourners could still travel cheaply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery</b> on the 11.57am service to Brookwood (the SR service closest to the LNC's traditional departure time), but the SR management, themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage, refused to entertain any compromise.|$|E
5|$|The train only ran {{if there}} was a coffin or {{passengers}} at the London terminus waiting to use it, and both the journey from London to Brookwood and the later return would be cancelled if nobody was due to leave London that morning. It would not run {{if there was}} only a single third or second class coffin to be carried, and in these cases the coffin and funeral party would be held until the next service. Generally the trains ran direct from London <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cemetery,</b> other than occasional stops to take on water. Between 1890 and 1910 the trains also sometimes stopped at Vauxhall and Clapham Junction for the benefit of mourners from south west London {{who did not want to}} travel via Waterloo, but these intermediate stops were discontinued and never reinstated. After 1 October 1900 the Sunday trains were discontinued, and from 1902 the daily train service was ended and trains ran only as required.|$|E
