40|$|International audienceThe {{reduction}} of acidity of {{passion fruit juice}} was investigated by electrodialysis (ED) with bipolar membranes (BM) at the laboratory and pre-industrial scale. Four states of juice were tested: initial pulpy juice, juice clarified by <b>tangential</b> <b>microfiltration,</b> twice-concentrated clarified juice, centrifuged juice. The ED performances were compared in terms of deacidification rate, current efficiency, and energy consumption. The deacidification was carried out up to pH 4. 5 with satisfactory results. ED performances were lower with the pulpy and concentrated juices because of fouling of the anion-exchange membrane, which increased voltage. The differences in acidity between the juices was reduced by the pre-industrial ED stack, which involved better hydrodynamics through high flow rates and low compartment thickness. Whatever the juices, physico-chemical analysis showed that colour changed only slightly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The main {{virulence}} {{factor of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae is the capsular polysaccharide (PS), {{which is the}} antigen of all current vaccines that are prepared with PS purified from serotypes prevalent in the population. In this work, three purification strategies were evaluated and a new process was developed for purification of serotype 14 PS (PS 14), responsible for 39. 8 % of diseases in children of 0 - 6 years old in Brazil. The developed method consists of cell separation by <b>tangential</b> <b>microfiltration,</b> concentration of the microfiltrate by tangential ultrafiltration (50 kDa), diafiltration {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate using a 30 kDa ultrafiltration membrane, precipitation with 5 % trichloroacetic acid, precipitation with 20 % and 60 % ethanol, and anion exchange chromatography. The required purity regarding nucleic acids (&# 8804; 2 %) and proteins (&# 8804; 3 %) was achieved, resulting in a relative purity of 439 mg PS 14 /mg nucleic acids and 146 mg PS 14 /mg proteins. The final polysaccharide recovery was 65 %, which is higher than the recovery of the majority of processes described in the literature...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the {{manufacture}} of a tubular supports ceramics membrane is described. The main objective of this work consists of the preparation and characterization of adequate and less expensive membrane supports, using abundant local raw materials. A porous raw materials tube of 20 mm in diameters and 170 mm in length were successfully fabricated by centrifugal casting technique. Moreover, the obtained samples were characterized, using different techniques. The structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and mercury porosimetry techniques. The pore size {{and the presence of}} possible defects in the supports were determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). It has been found that tubular ceramic membrane supports had a highly homogeneous product and a smooth inside-surface. The influence of the sintering temperature on the total porosity, average pore size and pore size distribution of supports is taken into account. The obtained results enabled to conclude that clay supports can be used alone (without any additions), successfully, in <b>tangential</b> <b>microfiltration</b> or as a support for ultrafiltration membranes. Finally, this investigation demonstrates that centrifugal casting may be also considered as a promising technique in order to fabricate tubes for membrane applicatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{membrane}} separation process {{is used to}} recover, concentrate and/or even purify macromolecules. The reduction of the permeate flux rate during the operation time {{is one of the}} most important limiting factors in that process. It is associated to some phenomena such as the concentration polarization, the adsorption and the fouling. The Ananas comosus L. Merril is a source of bromelain enzyme (EC 3. 4. 22. 5) with high commercial value and it is not produced in Brazil. In this work, the aim was to study the parameters that cause the reduction of the permeate flow rate in the bromelain enzyme recovering process through <b>tangential</b> <b>microfiltrations</b> of Ananas comosus juice using plane membranes and hollow fiber. Results showed that, at neutral pH, the effects of protein adsorption decreased and that the increase in pressure contributed to the fouling and enzyme denaturin...|$|R

This presentation will focus on the effect of process variables and feedstream characteristics on depth filtration performance, recovery, and capacity.

40|$|Recombinant protein {{technology}} {{has become increasingly}} important in recent years. Recombinant proteins {{can be found in}} everything from pharmaceuticals to detergents. The increasing demand and the high cost associated with the production and purification of recombinant proteins highlights the need to develop efficient and inexpensive methods for the solid/liquid clarification and purification of these proteins. Membrane technologies, which offer the advantage of high throughput and ever-improving selectivity, have the potential to meet the increased demands placed on the downstream processing of recombinant proteins. The overall objective of this work was to develop methods for the solid/liquid clarification and purification of recombinant proteins using membrane based separations. First, we explored the use of polyelectrolyte flocculation to improve the microfiltration of an industrial fermentation broth. We evaluated the effectiveness of several cationic polyelectrolytes of differing repeating unit, molecular weight, and charge density for the flocculation of an industrial Bacillus subtilis fermentation and the subsequent effect on the permeate flux and product rejection in both dead-end and <b>tangential</b> flow <b>microfiltration.</b> We also investigated the effect of crossflow rate on the permeate flux, product rejection, and the rate of floc breakup. Finally, we used flocculation to examine particle deposition in the highly variable shear environment that occurs in flow through a spacer filled channel. Then, we investigated microfiltration for the solids/liquid clarification of transgenic corn extracts. Within this work we characterized the resistance and compressibility of filter cakes formed in dead-end microfiltration of endosperm- and germ-rich extracts. In <b>tangential</b> flow <b>microfiltration</b> the effects of crossflow rate and transmembrane pressure (TMP) on the permeate flux and rejection of corn host cell proteins (HCP), recombinant Type 1 human collagen (rCollagen), and GFP were investigated. We also examined both a ceramic and a poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane for the extent of membrane fouling and the subsequent effect on the rejection of HCP, GFP, and rCollagen. Finally, we examined ultrafiltration for the purification of recombinant proteins from transgenic corn extracts. We investigated the effects of membrane pore size, crossflow rate, TMP, filtration pH, and corn tissue (i. e. endosperm or germ) on the permeate flux and protein sieving in ultrafiltration. We also developed a purification strategy to purify rCollagen from transgenic corn extracts using only acid salt precipitation and ultrafiltration...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{studied the}} influence of clarification techniques of Castilla's blackberry wine Rubus glaucus Benth on its chromaticity, turbidity and yields of the process. Initially, the <b>tangential</b> <b>microfiltration</b> (TMF) at three different working pressures (1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 bar) and then {{the treatment of the}} feed with sodium bentonite prior the filtration. The TMF at 1. 5 bar obtained the highest Volume Reduction Factor (VRF) and the best performance, standardizing the pressure conditions for the TMF with pretreatment. According the pH, the optimum quantity of flocculant added to each batch of wine was established at 9 grams, carried to rest at 6 ° C (6, 12 and 24 hours), obtaining 610 ± 38 g for the highest proportion of turbid in the batch of 6 hours of rest, product of a greater unstable catch by the clarifier. The TMF of the pretreated batches indicated representative improvements in the yield, up to 40 %. All the analyzed microfiltered wine samples with and without pretreatment achieved a turbidity less than 2 NTU, accomplishing with the quality criterion of "bright red", concluding that the TMF separately and with pretreatment improve the quality of the product, but they can cause color deterioration...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{introduce}} the <b>tangential</b> <b>microfiltration</b> (TMF) technique on the production of orange juice (TMFJ), and compare it with pasteurised juice (control) as regards chemical composition and sensorial characteristics. We used a TMF pilot equipped with four monotubular ceramic membranes (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 8 and 1. 4 mm) arranged in series with a filtering area of 0. 005 m² each. Commercial flash-pasteurised orange juice was used as the initial product. Experiments were divided into three parts: a) the characterisation of the TMF pilot; b) optimisation of operational conditions; c) production of the TMFJ. In the second part, membrane with 0. 8 -mm pores presented best flux followed by those with 1. 4 -, 0. 1 -, and 0. 2 -mm pores. However, to guarantee permeate sterility, we chose the membrane with 0. 1 -mm pores for TMFJ production. Initially, the orange juice was sieved in order to separate part of the pulp, being subsequently submitted to TMF. A mixture of retentate and pulp was made, and was subsequently pasteurised. We obtained the TMFJ by adding the permeate to the mixture. TMFJ presented soluble solids content (°Brix), pulp, pH, and titrable acidity similar to the initial pasteurised juice (control). Nevertheless, 28 % of vitamin C was lost during the TMFJ production. According to the juice taster panel, the control juice presented best sensorial characteristics (greater aroma intensity and fruity flavour) when compared with the TMJF...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{capability}} of genetic algorithms (GAs) to optimise an alternative fermentation process {{for the production of}} biobutanol was assessed. The process consists of three interconnected units, as follows: fermentor, cell retention system (<b>tangential</b> <b>microfiltration)</b> and vacuum flash vessel (responsible for the continuous recovery of butanol from the broth). The dynamic behaviour of the process is described by a non-linear mathematical model with kinetic parameters determined experimentally, whose non-linearity makes the solution of the optimisation problem difficult through conventional algorithms, thus justifying the use of an evolutionary method based on the GAs. The objective of the optimisation was the search of the process inputs that maximises the productivity of butanol for a desired substrate conversion. The potential of binary and real coded genetic algorithms to solve the optimisation problem was assessed. The GA parameters were evaluated making use of the statistical technique of the factorial design in order to identify the most significant ones to the GAs response and to determine the values of the parameters that improve the GAs performance. With both GA codes similar solutions to the optimisation problem were obtained. However, in relation to computational time, the binary code outperformed the real code. The optimised process ran on concentrated sugar solution (140. 7 g/l), reaching a high final butanol concentration (27. 1 g/l) and high butanol productivity (9. 0 g/l. h). The use of mathematical optimisers in the butanol fermentation is a novel approach and sums up the efforts of recent researches in turning the biobutanol industry commercially viable...|$|E
40|$|Four 20 -L scale batch fermentations in LB medium were {{performed}} to investigate time-dependent yields of organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) in E. coli XL 1 containing pVSEOP 7. The specific OPH activity was monitored during each 20 -L batch fermentation culture by assaying several times between the IPTG induction point (OD of 0. 4 to 0. 5 at 600 nm) and the cell harvest point (near-stationary phase of each 20 -L batch culture). From the four 20 -L batch fermentations, only the 20 -L batch cultures with 1 mM of cobalt chloride added 3 -hr prior to cell harvest resulted in a drastic increase in the specific OPH activity (369 to 1809 U/mL). A similar strategy of 1 mM cobalt chloride addition was successfully used to obtain a 20. 7 mg OPH per liter of culture at the 1000 -L scale batch fermentation in LB, as compared to 5 to 10 mg/L in flask cultures. The specific OPH activity was shown to be stable through additional process time associated with downstream processing steps such as cell concentration by continuous disk centrifugation, cell paste preparation by bottle centrifugation, cell disruption by Microfluidizer® homogenization, and lysed cell clarification by 0. 22 µm <b>tangential</b> flow <b>microfiltration...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{confined}} {{flows in}} tubes with permeable surfaces arc associated to <b>tangential</b> filtration processes (<b>microfiltration</b> or ultrafiltration). The {{complexity of the}} phenomena do not allow {{for the development of}} exact analytical solutions, however, approximate solutions are of great interest for the calculation of the transmembrane outflow and estimate of the concentration, polarization phenomenon. In the present work, the generalized integral transform technique (GITT) was employed in solving the laminar and permanent flow in permeable tubes of Newtonian and incompressible fluid. The mathematical formulation employed the parabolic differential equation of chemical species conservation (convective-diffusive equation). The velocity profiles for the entrance region flow, which are found in the connective terms of the equation, were assessed by solutions obtained from literature. The velocity at the permeable wall was considered uniform, with the concentration at the tube wall regarded as variable with an axial position. A computational methodology using global error control was applied to determine the concentration in the wall and concentration boundary layer thickness. The results obtained for the local transmembrane flux and the concentration boundary layer thickness were compared against others in literature. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Researches on the {{experimental}} ultrasonic installation were carried out, using industrial equipment for bottling liquids and ultrasonic apparatus "Volna-M" UZTA- 1 / 22 -OM, for clarification and filtering of table wines by <b>tangential</b> <b>microfiltration</b> using membrane ceramic filtering elements with a pore size of 0. 2 micron at a pressure of 0. 5 - 2. 0 bar. Membrane ultrafiltration upon application of ultrasound of 30 - 40 microns amplitude and a frequency of 20 kHz ± 1. 65 Hz at high filter performance and work stability changes the quantitative {{content of the}} valuable wine components slightly. But {{much attention to the}} increase of titratable acidity and pH medium due to possible degradation and esterification intensification of higher acids and alcohols was paid. At the same time more intense and rich aroma and distinct flavor with berry notes appears in wine that along with the physical- and chemical indicators helped to improve organoleptic characteristics and to increase the tasting evaluation of wines. At the same time, the content of phenolic and nitrogen compounds is reduced resulting in wines stability to protein and colloidal opacification. It became possible to refuse multiple regeneration of ceramic filter elements for the  ecovery of their performance, as well as the use of preservatives and antiseptics at a high wines bottling stability. It is shown that the filtration with the dosing of ultrasound in the wine industry allows not only reducing the cost of consumables, equipment and removing some of the traditional processes, but also providing the cold sterilization of wine materials with an increase in their quality...|$|E
