5000|$|While simple {{longitudinal}} parity {{can only}} detect errors, {{it can be}} combined with additional error-control coding, such as a <b>transverse</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>check,</b> to correct errors.The <b>transverse</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> is stored on a dedicated [...] "parity track".|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, a <b>transverse</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (TRC) or {{vertical}} {{redundancy check}} is a redundancy check for synchronized parallel bits applied once per bit time, across the bit streams. This requires additional parallel channels for the check bit or bits.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "parity track" [...] {{was present}} on the first {{magnetic}} tape data storage in 1951. Parity in this form, applied across multiple parallel signals, {{is known as a}} <b>transverse</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>check.</b> This can be combined with parity computed over multiple bits sent on a single signal, a longitudinal redundancy check. In a parallel bus, there is one longitudinal redundancy check bit per parallel signal.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, a {{longitudinal}} <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (LRC), or horizontal <b>redundancy</b> <b>check,</b> {{is a form}} of <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> that is applied independently to each of a parallel group of bit streams. The data must be divided into transmission blocks, to which the additional check data is added.|$|R
5000|$|Extensions and {{variations}} on the parity bit mechanism are horizontal <b>redundancy</b> <b>checks,</b> vertical <b>redundancy</b> <b>checks,</b> and [...] "double," [...] "dual," [...] or [...] "diagonal" [...] parity (used in RAID-DP).|$|R
50|$|In {{longitudinal}} <b>redundancy</b> <b>checking</b> and cyclic <b>redundancy</b> <b>checking,</b> {{block check}} characters are computed for, and added to, each message block transmitted.

40|$|Error {{detection}} is {{a technique}} that enables reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communication channels. Many communication channels are subject to channel noise, and thus errors may be introduced during transmission from the source to a receiver. Basically error detection mechanism contains various methods but LRC and CRC are {{the most commonly used}} methods. A longitudinal <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (LRC) is a form of <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> that is applied independently to each of a parallel group of bit streams. A Cyclic <b>Redundancy</b> <b>Check</b> (CRC) {{is one of the most}} powerful <b>redundancies</b> <b>checking</b> technique.

50|$|Typically the {{transmitter}} adds a <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> number {{to the end}} of each frame. The receiver uses the <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> number to check for possible damage.
