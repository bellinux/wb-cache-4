5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") in the lungs <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E
5|$|In April 1998, Wooller {{claimed that}} the council of the ICAEW was obstructing his {{campaign}} to increase democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998. Wooller's first motion was about electing {{the president of the}} ICAEW democratically by ballot. The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report. The second motion said the district societies should be self-financing and the third motion was on reducing the number of council members to fifty-three. The first motion used a quotation from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison, and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison's quotation after he objected to being quoted. The ICAEW asked members to vote on {{an increase in the number}} of council members from seventy-five after requests made in the Gerrard report. Wooller asked members <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of council members to fifty-three, which was recommended by the Gerrard report as the ideal council quota. A 54% majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller's motion <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E

On 3 November 1918, the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending their participation in the conflict. After the end of the war, Kaiser Karl VI was ceded as a war prize to Great Britain, {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

Devers' November 1945 testimony before the board had urged that the Army Service Forces be retained. Army Ground Forces was given control of the six armies in the United States, but as demobilization gathered pace, the strength of the army shrank dramatically. Devers was faced with the unpleasant task of informing many officers that they were being demoted.

5|$|The Settlement of Singapore had no {{separate}} flag, {{although the}} city was granted a coat of arms which featured a lion in 1911.

5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Rejewski {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} {{due to the}} large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxième Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector.|$|E

By this time casualties amongst the Australian Corps had reached critical level {{and as a result}} many battalions—from an authorised strength of over 1,000 men—were only able to field between 300 and 400. As a result, the decision was made <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of infantry battalions in each brigade from four to three by disbanding one battalion and using its personnel to reinforce the others. The 29th Battalion was one of those chosen to be broken up and as a result on 19 October 1918, the 29th Battalion was disbanded. The majority of the battalion's personnel—29 officers and 517 other ranks—were transferred to the 32nd Battalion as reinforcements.|$|E

However, certain critical materials for which Japan relied heavily on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber, {{and many of the}} best sources of these were under British control.
