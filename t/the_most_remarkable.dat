5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> victory which naval annals record.|$|E

5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead reckoning whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his position relative to the reference island's location in his mental model. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{thing is that the}} reference island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> discoveries {{was that}} the comet had a third type of tail. In {{addition}} to the well-known gas and dust tails, Hale–Bopp also exhibited a faint sodium tail, only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown {{to come from a}} tail. Hale–Bopp's sodium tail consisted of neutral atoms (not ions), and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length.|$|E

40|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>remarkables</b> {{effects of}} {{economic}} globalization is the change {{on the nature}} of work. From the theoretical perspective of operaism, the emphasis is on the communicative and cognitive dimension that characterizes <b>most</b> of <b>the</b> work performance today.

5|$|The book {{contains}} an evenly distributed mixture of natural history, travel, and observation of human societies, including the towns with their Catholic processions. Only <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> discoveries {{of animals and}} plants are described, and theories such as evolution and mimicry are barely mentioned. Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start; he also describes animal behaviour, sometimes in detail, as for the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, explaining how the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated with drawings by leading artists including E. W. Robinson, Josiah Wood Whymper, Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker.|$|E
5|$|Michael Shishman is {{considered}} a vain, aggressive, and opportunistic ruler, whose Protean foreign policy perhaps contributed to the battle that {{put an end to}} his life. At the same time he was clearly forceful and energetic, overcoming and reversing Bulgaria's losses during the uncertainty that preceded his accession, and managing to maintain internal peace and security within Bulgaria during his short reign. Andreev calls him <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> 14th-century Bulgarian monarch. According to Kantacouzenos he desired to expand the country from Byzantium to the Istros, i. e. from Constantinople to the Danube which makes him the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who effectively attempted to capture the Byzantine capital. He was also the first Bulgarian ruler for decades who tried to lead a more active policy in Macedonia. Michael Shishman's seal is depicted on the reverse of the Bulgarian 2 levs banknote, issued in 1999 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|Perry and Whitford {{returned}} to Aerosmith in 1984 {{and the band}} signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It {{was not until the}} band's collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>remarkable</b> and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year, except 2008. After 47 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music, but is embarking on a farewell tour that will likely last several years.|$|E
