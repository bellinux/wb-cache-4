5|$|As {{with each}} All-Star Game since 1970, the eight {{starting}} position players (with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, {{and a second}} fan balloting to add one more player <b>to</b> <b>each</b> roster. In all, 32players were selected <b>to</b> <b>each</b> league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are more similar <b>to</b> <b>each</b> {{other than the}} {{elements}} in any other group are <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.|$|E

5|$|The long-running HUG process {{complicated}} the RAAF's management of its fleet of F/A-18s. At any one time, {{the capabilities of}} individual aircraft differed considerably depending on their upgrades. Accordingly, the long-standing arrangement where aircraft were almost permanently assigned <b>to</b> <b>each</b> squadron {{was replaced by a}} system where they were pooled. Attempts to allocate Hornets with similar levels of modifications from the common pool <b>to</b> <b>each</b> squadron were not successful.|$|E
5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other and are thus antiparallel. Attached <b>to</b> <b>each</b> sugar {{is one of four}} types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E
