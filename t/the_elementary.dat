5|$|In Byzantium, <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> {{school teacher}} {{occupied}} a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used).

5|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Elementary</b> Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion {{was a source of}} camaraderie and solidarity.

He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to present the history of <b>the</b> Catholic <b>elementary</b> school system in the city of Omaha, Nebraska from 1858 to 1999. ^ The {{following}} questions guided this study: (1) How did <b>the</b> Catholic <b>elementary</b> schools come into being, evolve and maintain themselves? (2) What changes occurred in the student and teacher populations during these years? (3) What changes in <b>the</b> Catholic <b>elementary</b> schools were initiated by the Omaha Archdiocesan superintendent of schools? ^ In reviewing the history of <b>the</b> Catholic <b>elementary</b> schools in Omaha, Nebraska from 1858 to 1999, the following conclusions emerged: <b>the</b> Catholic <b>elementary</b> schools developed because of the commitment of each individual parish; <b>the</b> Catholic <b>elementary</b> schools began because of the dedication of the religious orders who taught in the schools; the diocesan superintendents performed a variety of tasks but they were not responsible for the formation and operation of <b>the</b> individual Catholic <b>elementary</b> schools; population shifts caused schools to open and close; a shift in teachers from religious to laity took place and student enrollments changed over time. ...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Elementary</b> Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of <b>the</b> <b>Elementary</b> Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E

5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in <b>The</b> <b>Elementary</b> Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E
