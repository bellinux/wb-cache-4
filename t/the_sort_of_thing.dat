5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-story house {{with his wife and two}} children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is just <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> could happen to anyone.|$|E

25|$|Kant opens section III by {{defining}} the will {{as the cause}} of our actions. According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E

American director Roger Corman congratulated Warren on the film and considered commissioning him for further productions. However, a private screening had failed to impress members of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, who dismissed Inseminoid as [...] "'Commercial rubbish! ...

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} of the Ninja Gaiden series, Eurogamer said that Ninja GaidenIII {{was the only}} game in the NES trilogy not to make it to Europe. They made similar criticisms about the difficulty level, saying that the North American version was made more difficult than the Japanese version by utilizing limited continues, making the enemies much more powerful, and removing the password system present in the Japanese version. They said the story was too outlandish, calling the plot, of which a short-lived anime Ninja Gaiden series would loosely be based, [...] "a glorious load of old bollocks". While the version from Ninja Gaiden Trilogy for the Super NES remedied most of their criticisms, they said that the game added new frustrations which included slower framerates, lower-quality controls, and the omission and shuffling around of several tracks, which they said [...] "is precisely <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that makes die-hard videogame fans apoplectic with rage".|$|E

On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue.

[...] Saskatchewan Tory MP John Diefenbaker spoke the following day, and alleged that Howe had said, [...] "We may save a million dollars, but what of it?" [...] Howe angrily denied the quote, accusing Diefenbaker of being [...] "a past master of distortion"—language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary. Diefenbaker sharpened the anecdote over time, and it emerged in its final form as Howe saying, [...] "What's a million?" [...] Even Liberals who knew that Howe had made no such statement agreed that it was just <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> he could have said.

A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested.

Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does [...] "nearly everything Lovato touches". Masley concluded, writing, [...] "When she sings 'I {{want to get back}} to the old days,' what she means is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails." [...] Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an [...] "insidious, Go-Go's-like single".|$|E

Melody Maker deemed it [...] "a milestone {{in the history of}} awfulness", and the NMEs Richard Cook wrote: [...] "Like the poor damned Tommies that haunt his mind, Roger Waters' writing has been blown to hell... Waters stopped with The Wall, and The Final Cut isolates and juggles the identical themes of that elephantine concept with no fresh momentum to drive them." [...] Robert Christgau opined: [...] "it's a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it", and awarded the album a C+ grade. [...] More impressed, Rolling Stones Kurt Loder viewed it as [...] "essentially a Roger Waters solo album... a superlative achievement on several levels". [...] Dan Hedges of Record also approved, writing: [...] "On paper it sounds hackneyed and contrived – <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that was worked into the ground by everyone from P.
