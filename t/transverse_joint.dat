40|$|Reflective {{cracking}} is {{a relatively}} premature distress that occurs in HMA materials overlaying cracked and jointed underlying pavements.

A 3 D {{finite element}} model is used to {{investigate}} the state of load stress developed in concrete pavement with dowel bar under the effect of typical pavement damages of pumping area of slab corner and pumping area of <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> edge. The results indicate that slab corner stress tends to decrease {{with the increase of}} slab thickness and possesses a nonlinear growth as pumping area increases; when the pumping area of slab corner is less than 1. 5 m× 1. 5 m, the maximum pavement slab tensile stress is less than or close to the load stress in critical loading position. Stress in <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> edge also grows in a nonlinear tendency and axle load also grows gradually with the expansion of pumping area, of which the slope of the curve in the relationship between stress and void size is much greater.

40|$|Concrete {{structural}} {{elements such as}} wall sections, bridge abutments and slabs on grade rely on dowels to transfer loads across the joints. As the joint width becomes wider, or if the joint is formed, the effect of aggregate interlock to transfer load is reduced and the loads are transferred by dowels. The dowels can be circular or elliptical shaped and are more commonly made of steel or Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP). This research project considered steel dowels with either a circular or an elliptical shape used in a highway or airport pavement. The following linear-elastic analysis, however, {{can be used for}} FRP dowels and for other doweled {{structural elements}}. Dowels are spaced along transverse joints in a highway or airport pavement. The dowel 2 ̆ 7 s main purpose is to transfer shear load across the joint which separates adjacent concrete slabs. Dowels are approximately eighteen inches (457 mm) long, placed at mid-height of the pavement thickness, positioned parallel to the pavement surface, and embedded symmetrically about the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> centerline. The <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> was assumed to open, and its width is dependent on the combination of concrete shrinkage and slab contraction due to colder temperatures. Wheel loads from a single axle, positioned along the open <b>transverse</b> <b>joint,</b> apply a shear load to each effective dowel along the joint. Effective dowels are those dowels included in the distribution of the wheel loads. The shear load causes the dowels to bear against the concrete and causes the dowels to deflect within the concrete. These deflections are directly related to the bearing stress between the embedded dowel and the concrete (or contact bearing stress). The maximum bearing stress corresponds to the maximum deflection which occurs at the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> face. If the maximum bearing stress does not exceed some portion of the elastic-limit stress for concrete, the deformed concrete around the deflected dowel will rebound to its original or reference state. Repetitive loading, however, may not allow the deformed concrete around the dowel to rebound to its original state before another set of wheel loads crosses the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint.</b> In this repetitive load case, permanent concrete deformation would be present. A need exists to reduce the bearing stress around dowels for maximum axle loading, as well as, repetitive axle loading. Therefore, a comparison was made between circular- and elliptical-shaped dowels with equivalent flexural rigidity. This dowel comparison showed that, for a given load, the elliptical shape with a wider cross section had reduced deflections within the concrete and, reduced bearing stress between the dowel and the concrete. Also, the deflections of the dowel within the concrete at the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> face, for the circular and elliptical shapes, compare favorably with measured deflections found through experimental methods. Two published analytical foundation models for a beam on elastic foundation were used to determine the deflections of the embedded dowel within the concrete. The first foundation model {{is referred to as the}} one-parameter (or Winkler) model, and the second foundation model is referred to as the two-parameter model. The deflections along the dowel were found using each model 2 ̆ 7 s respective assumed displaced shape (general solution to the differential equation). The first model 2 ̆ 7 s general solution, based on the embedded length of the dowel, was divided into separate theories used for analyzing the dowel. The second model 2 ̆ 7 s general solution was simplified due to a slight modification. The contribution of this research project was to simplify beam on elastic foundation theory through matrix formulation and apply these improved analysis methods to dowels embedded in concrete pavements joints. One of these simplifications allows for the analysis of any dowel embedment length greater than about nine inches (229 mm). Dividing the dowel into smaller elements is not required in the solution. The analytical foundation models represented the concrete with linear-elastic springs. The spring stiffness for each model is given by elastic constants or parameters. Each model predicts slightly different deflection behavior for the embedded dowel based on these parameters. The first model assumes the springs act independently to support the dowel; whereas, the second model assumes interaction between adjacent springs. Modifications were made to the first model to include the effect of pavement thickness which allowed for comparison of both models. The theoretical bearing stress between the dowel and the concrete was determined based on the fourth derivative of the assumed displaced shape for a particular model. Therefore, the bearing stresses along the dowel-concrete interface are directly related to the corresponding deflections along the dowel within the concrete. The maximum theoretical bearing stress at the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> face was compared to experimental bearing stress. The experimental bearing stress was calculated from the measured deflection of the dowel at the <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> face. The maximum bearing stress was limited to some portion of the elastic-limit stress for the concrete medium. For a given concrete depth below the dowel, as the load on the dowel is increased, the deflections along the dowel within the concrete and the bearing stresses along the dowel-concrete interface will increase. The analyses using the foundation models (described previously) showed, however, that as the medium depth below the dowel was reduced the dowel deflections within the concrete decreased. A decrease in deflection could be explained by the reduction in cumulative compression over the smaller depth. In addition, the analyses by these models showed that as the concrete medium depth below the dowel decreased the contact bearing stress increased. To verify the deflection behavior of dowels embedded in concrete, experimental testing was undertaken for various size steel dowels having either a circular or an elliptical shape. Three laboratory test methods were modeled using the stiffness method of structural analysis. Two elemental shear test methods and a cantilever test method were modeled. The elemental shear test methods investigated a single dowel that was embedded in concrete on either side of an open <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> and subjected to shear loading. The models, based on the assembled stiffness matrix, were used to determine the deflections along the dowel within the concrete and to verify elastic constants for a particular foundation model. Additional analysis of the elemental shear test specimens allowed for the inclusion of an elastic medium under a portion of the test specimen to model soil-pavement interaction. This analysis was referred to as the three-parameter model which defines a layered system. In this system, the embedded dowel and surrounding concrete are idealized as beams, connected together with springs and the concrete beam is further supported by an elastic medium...|$|E

To date, little if any performance variations after limited trafficking have been noted for jointed PCC sections constructed over OGPB layers as compared to those constructed over conventional dense graded aggregate base layers. Data was collected along USH 18 / 151 in lowa/Dane Counties from a total of 17 test sections constructed to monitor performance variations due to base layer design, <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> sealing practices, and <b>transverse</b> <b>joint</b> doweling. The field data collected for this research included slab dimensions, surface detections from central slab and slab comer positions, and slab temperature measurements at various slab depths. In addition to the collected field data, construction records were reviewed to determine base layer design and pavement surface thickness as measured by cores extracted after construction. The data was used in conjunction with back calculation procedures developed by the author to establish slab-by-slab interior and corner foundation support k-values. The ratio of corner k-value to interior k-value, termed the slab support ratio, was used to identify slabs which were not uniformly supported by foundation materials. This research concluded that for the test sections included, little or no evidence of poor support could be found. However, based on the limited data obtained, there were some indications of poor support due to base layer densification. As a result of this research investigation, the author recommends a more detailed study of certain test sections included in this study to better quantify the reasons for the indications of poor support.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Satisfactory {{performance}} of the <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> is crucial for achieving the intended service life of jointed plain concrete pavement. An accurate prediction of joint opening and movement is desired in order to quantify {{the effects of the}} environment, base type, concrete material constituents, and slab geometry on the concrete pavement responses. In this paper, an analytical model based on elasticity theory is presented to predict joint opening using a bilinear slab-subbase interfacial constraint assumption. The proposed model predicts the mean joint opening based on uniform temperature change and drying shrinkage through the slab thickness. To account for the temperature curling effect, a “correction ” term to the joint opening is proposed using a closed-form solution derived from Westergaard’s temperature curling deflection equation.

Specifically, this research is directed at analyzing the load transfer characteristics of: (a) 8 -inch verses 12 -inch spacing, and (b) alternative dowel material compared to epoxy coated steel dowels, will also be analyzed. This report documents the installation of the test sections, placed in 1997. Dowel material type and location are identified. Construction observations and limitations with each dowel material are shown...|$|E
5000|$|The Supreme Court, without dissent, {{reversed}} {{the judgment of}} the Fourth Circuit and reinstated {{the judgment of the}} district court. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion of the Court. The Court agreed with the reasoning of the district court and the court of appeals dissent that combining the claimed elements of the patent was obvious: [...] "A separate heater can also be used in conjunction with a standard paving machine to eliminate the cold joint, and in fact is so used for heating the <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> of the pavement." ...|$|R
40|$|In 1993, two hot-mix {{asphalt and}} four whitetopping overlay test {{sections}} were constructed on low volume TH 30 in southern Minnesota. A study was undertaken {{to examine the}} performance and {{costs associated with the}} test sections after nine years of service. The field testing and evaluation are described, and the costs incurred through 2001 are tabulated. The hot-mix asphalt overlay test sections are performing up to their design expectations. Both hot-mix asphalt test sections have had routine preventative maintenance applied to them, adding to their long-term cost of operation and ownership. The whitetopping test sections are performing very well at the midpoint of their design life of 20 years. Most distresses to date are related to poor construction and materials, rather than inherent design features. Some random longitudinal cracking has occurred in areas of the whitetopping control section. The doweled test section has numerous distressed <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> caused by dowels near the surface of the slabs. There is virtually no faulting of the <b>transverse</b> <b>joints,</b> and the ride quality has stabilized. No maintenance has been performed on the whitetopping sections through 2001. As of 2002, the most economical overlay design in this study is a 6 inch thick bonded whitetopping. Based on recent observations, it appears whitetopping is a good performing and economical rehabilitation option for low volume roads in Minnesota...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{different}} kinds of <b>transverse</b> <b>joints</b> of common concrete pavements, this paper puts forward oblique-reinforced transverse prestressed continuous concrete pavement, and compares it with other reinforcement types of continuous pavements in their mechanical and deformation behaviors {{under the influence of}} temperature drop. Analysis results show that oblique-reinforced transverse prestressed concrete pavement could take advantage of deformation transfer competence of oblique steels, and while applying prestressing force on slab along transverse direction, longitudinal prestressing force appears which would effectively counteract temperature shrinkage stress along driving direction. Thus this paper provides corresponding theoretical support for the feasibility study on jointless concrete pavement...|$|R
