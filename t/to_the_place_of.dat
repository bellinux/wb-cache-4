5|$|Hooper has not {{represented}} England at any level. His paternal grandfather William Hooper {{was raised in}} the Scottish Borders, and this led to hopes that Hooper could be eligible to play for Scotland. Then Scotland head coach Craig Levein sought clarification as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> birth his grandfather's birth certificate recorded, as he had been born in a hospital in the English border town Berwick-upon-Tweed. The possibility was closed off when it was confirmed that his grandfather was included in the English Births Index. On 13 March 2011, Hooper was included by Stuart Pearce in his 31-man squad for the England under-21 team to play Denmark and Iceland. However, Hooper pulled out of the squad due to injury. On 3 May 2011, he was named in the 40-man provisional squad for the UEFA Under-21 Championship, but did not make the final selection.|$|E

The authorities were concerned that an injury could delay the execution. Parsons was permitted to walk outdoors at night <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> execution.|$|E
5|$|The James Edgar and Jean Jessop Hervey Public Library {{opened in}} 2003, {{replacing}} {{a much smaller}} public library. The new library, built by Conwell Shonkwiler & Associates, was partly funded by a donation via the San Diego Foundation from the Hervey family, who had {{close ties to the}} area. Jean Jessop Hervey in particular used to visit the old Point Loma Library every Tuesday to read with her children. The library, located at 3701 Voltaire Street, is over 25,000 square feet and holds over 80,000 books. It includes a kitchen area, a community meeting room, and outdoor sitting patios. The lower floor is the largest children's library in the City of San Diego, featuring a simulated ship, reading desks shaped like surfboards, an art space and a Story Time Zone. In connecting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> Point Loma, the library's architectural style features a nautical theme. There is even an operating periscope, salvaged from a U.S. Navy submarine, through which visitors can see the surrounding neighborhood. The floor in the entry lobby features a terrazzo map of the Point Loma Peninsula. The library holds scheduled events such as story time for children, Thursday after school movies, and arts and crafts demonstrations.|$|E

Those cruel sinners who, from a desire of (worldly) life, commit bad deeds, will sink into the dreadful hell which is full of dense darkness and great suffering. He who always kills movable and immovable beings {{for the sake of}} his own comfort, who injures them, who takes what is not freely given, who does not learn what is to be practised (viz. control). The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink <b>to</b> <b>the</b> (<b>place</b> <b>of)</b> darkness; head downwards he comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> torture. The prisoners in hell lose their senses from fright, and do not know in what direction to run.

25|$|Karmana sarira nama karma {{gives the}} karman body which is possessed by all worldly souls. This body is the {{receptacle}} for karman matter.
