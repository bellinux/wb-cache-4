5|$|Wyatt Earp testified {{after the}} gunfight that {{five or six}} weeks prior he had met Ike Clanton outside the Alhambra Hotel.

Ike now accused Earp of telling Holliday about <b>these</b> <b>conversations.</b> Earp testified that he told Ike he had not told Holliday anything. Wyatt Earp offered to prove this when Holliday and the Clantons next returned to town.|$|E
5|$|In {{months prior}} to the settlement, Seattle {{publicly}} released email conversations that took place within Bennett's ownership group alleging they indicated that some members of the group had a desire to move the team to Oklahoma City prior to its purchase in 2006. The city used <b>these</b> <b>conversations</b> to argue that ownership failed to negotiate in good faith and as a result, Schultz filed a lawsuit seeking to rescind the sale of the team and transfer the ownership to a court-appointed receiver. The NBA claimed the lawsuit was void because Schultz signed a release forbidding himself to sue Bennett's group but also argued that the proposal would have violated league ownership rules. Schultz dropped the case {{before the start of the}} 2008–09 NBA season.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] As {{companies}} {{continue to}} grow globally, learning how to innovate across geographic lines has become even more important as “water cooler” conversations become less of the norm. This challenge is even more pertinent for the tech industry, where innovation is at its core. I sought {{to answer the following}} question: As tech companies continue to expand globally and open offices in more locations, the employee population becomes more decentralized, resulting in fewer organic, “water cooler” <b>conversations.</b> <b>These</b> “water cooler” <b>conversations,</b> or unintentional run-ins with one another which typically result in work conversation, can lead to innovative thinking or ideas. As companies expand globally, teams grow across various sites and more employees work at remote sites (not at the company’s headquarters), fewer of <b>these</b> organic <b>conversations</b> occur. So how can we continue to innovate without <b>these</b> “water cooler” <b>conversations...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the player {{can choose to}} talk to demons encountered on the field, and attempt to recruit them to their party; {{the success of this}} depends on the player's level, with more powerful demons only being recruitable if the player's level is sufficiently high. In Ronde, the player does not initiate <b>these</b> <b>conversations</b> themselves, however: instead, defeated demons sometimes choose to talk to the player, and sometimes decide to join their party. Like in other Megami Tensei games, the player can fuse multiple allied demons with each other, thereby creating more powerful demons. In Ronde, the player can form contracts with demons, allowing human characters to use demon magic. Demons are fueled by magnetite, so the player needs to manage the supply of this, and thus cannot have too many allied demons on the field at once or take too long to finish a battle. By clearing battles, the player can advance to the next chapter. The games' stories are affected by player choices, and have multiple endings.|$|E

25|$|The matrix in the {{following}} table shows how Brasel and colleagues found that the teachers combined these four questions to learn about two dimensions of teaching: student thinking and instruction.

While <b>these</b> <b>conversations</b> were helpful in identifying students in need of remediation, they did little in the way to improve instruction in the long run.|$|E

25|$|Adventure {{games have}} strong storylines with {{significant}} dialog, and sometimes make {{effective use of}} recorded dialog or narration from voice actors. This genre of game is known for representing dialog as a conversation tree. Players are able to engage a non-player character by choosing a line of pre-written dialog from a menu, which triggers a response from the game character. <b>These</b> <b>conversations</b> are often designed as a tree structure, with players deciding between each branch of dialog to pursue. However, there are always {{a finite number of}} branches to pursue, and some adventure games devolve into selecting each option one-by-one. Conversing with characters can reveal clues about how to solve puzzles, including hints about what that character would want before they will cooperate with the player. Other conversations will have far-reaching consequences, deciding to disclose a valuable secret that has been entrusted to the player. Characters may also be convinced to reveal their own secrets, either through conversation or by giving them something that will benefit them.|$|E

While her mother thinks {{of her as a}} good-natured and well-mannered girl, she is not of a high opinion about her intelligence, and quite wrongly. She also thinks Natasha is ‘cold’, emotionless, but in the beginning of Chapter Five we are told by the narrator that “Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; even as a child she seldom cried, and now she seldom even sighed and only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her.” She engages in intellectual conversations with Rudin (which are not discouraged by her mother because she thinks that <b>these</b> <b>conversations</b> “improve her mind”); Natasha thinks highly of Rudin, who confides to her his ideas and “privately gives her books”, and soon falls in love with him. She also often compels him to apply his talents and act. Natasha is often thought of as the first of 'Turgenev maids' to feature in Turgenev's fiction.|$|E

The columnist passed along information to Warren that a client of one of his Washington lawyer friends had told his friend that Castro had plans to retaliate. Pearson asked Warren to meet with the lawyer, but Warren never did. However, Warren did inform the director of the Secret Service, James Rowley. Rowley passed the information on to Hoover, who in turn sent six secret letters to senior Bureau officials. There are no records of <b>these</b> <b>conversations,</b> and officials have adamantly denied that conversations about Castro's revenge plans ever took place.
