50|$|The {{gauge of}} the coils is another factor which determines {{firmness}} and support. Coils are measured in quarter increments. The lower <b>the</b> number, <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>the</b> spring. In general, higher-quality mattress coils have a 14-gauge (1.63 mm) diameter. Coils of 14 to 15.5-gauge (1.63 to 1.37 mm) give more easily under pressure, while a 12.5-gauge (1.94 mm) coil, <b>the</b> <b>thickest</b> typically available, feels quite firm.|$|R

5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated {{as a result of}} being subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E
30|$|Comparison of CFRP {{laminates}} with 90 o ply {{of different}} thicknesses (Table 5) {{indicates that the}} laminate with <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> transverse ply fail at lower stress than the laminate with the thinner transverse ply. Similar behavior {{can be observed in}} the angle-ply laminates where thinner laminates showed higher stiffness and strength, {{as can be seen in}} Figs.  3 b & c and 4 b & c and Table 5. This is because the Energy Release Rate (ERR) associated with the formation of cracks in <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> laminates is higher, thus caused cracks to form earlier in <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> laminates.|$|R

5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E
5|$|Cork is {{produced}} from <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested {{from the living}} trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable industry. More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine bottles. Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds {{of animals}} {{along the coast}} were coated with <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> crude oil and many died. State parks and beaches located along the {{coastline}} were temporarily closed. While {{much smaller than the}} oil rig blowout that resulted in the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, this spill may have greater long term effects due to its potential impact on four state marine protected areas. Due to the unique characteristics of the area, {{it is one of the}} most studied marine environments in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} the New Zealanders sent the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major James McGregor Elmslie, forward {{to reinforce the}} 9th Squadron. But by itself the 2nd Squadron was {{not strong enough to}} break through the Turkish lines and reach the post, and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting in <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> scrub. Eventually the 2nd Squadron had to form their own defensive position in the ground between No.2 and No.3 Posts.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E

40|$|The NiO {{thin films}} were {{prepared}} by the electron beam evaporation method using synthesized sintered targets. As-prepared films were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, UV–VIS spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. <b>The</b> <b>thicker</b> films were found to exhibit a well-defined structure and a well-developed crystallite size with greater transmittance modulation and durability. The as-deposited thinner films of 170  nm showed a faster response time during electrochromic cycles with a coloration efficiency of 53. 1  C/cm 2 than <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> ones. However, <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> films showed no enhanced electrochromic properties such as a larger intercalated charge than the thinner ones. The electrochromic properties of the thinner films became deteriorated after 800 cycling tests...|$|R

Ethiopian MiG fighters, tanks, artillery and mortars struck Islamic positions in the assault. Residents reported the road to Jilib was littered with remote-controlled landmines by the ICU. TFG and Ethiopian forces also attacked Bulobaley, with mortars and rockets.|$|E
5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets fore and aft. Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; {{but they were}} the only guns heavy enough to penetrate <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.|$|E
5|$|Steep {{contacts}} between <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> basal breccia of Mount Silverthrone and older crystalline rocks of adjacent peaks {{suggest that the}} breccia {{is part of a}} caldera-fill succession. The presence of irregular subvolcanic intrusions and a profusion of dikes within the breccia—but not in adjacent country rock—provide further evidence of the Silverthrone Caldera. Potassium-argon dates of 750,000 and 400,000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal breccia are consistent with the high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains.|$|E

Moving in the dark through <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> scrub of the Razorback, the 15th found in the scrub the empty positions that it was sent to fill.

5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines buried in <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> wing roots. Distinguishing {{features of the}} Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position.

40|$|Abstract. Tensile {{properties}} of rolled and annealed copper thin foils were investigated {{based on the}} grain size and thickness. Yield strength was higher in the thinner foil than in <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> foil at as-rolled state. Difference of yield strength between the thinner foil and <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> foil becomes small at annealed state. Tensile strength was higher in the thinner foil than in <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> foil at as-rolled state, but it was reversed at annealed state. Strain to fracture or elongation increased with increasing thickness in the annealed state. A knife edge type of fracture was characterized in both the as-rolled state and the annealed state. A higher tensile strength and strain to fracture of <b>the</b> annealed <b>thicker</b> foil was attributed to the higher number of grains per thickness. From this work, {{it was concluded that}} mechanical {{properties of}} thin foils were dependent upon the number of grains per thickness...|$|R
