5|$|During the {{streaming}} of the series, Silverman criticized <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> {{because of}} the low lighting levels that might {{make it hard to}} understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> for its high quality. Episode 18, which is known for its flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons where <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> was {{produced}} by Film Roman. Up until this point, Film Roman had mostly worked on Garfield and Friends and Bobby's World episodes, and {{were not used to}} the speed with which The Simpsons episodes were produced. However, they quickly adjusted. Film Roman went on to do <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> {{for the rest of the}} series and eventually The Simpsons Movie.

5|$|On February 1, 1985, Disney {{executives}} moved <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> division {{from the}} Disney studio lot in Burbank {{to a variety}} of warehouses, hangars, and trailers located about two miles east (3.2 kilometers) in nearby Glendale, California. <b>The</b> <b>animation</b> division's first feature animation at its new location was The Great Mouse Detective (1986), begun by John Musker and Ron Clements as Basil of Baker Street after both left production of The Black Cauldron. The film was enough of a critical and commercial success to instill executive confidence in <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> studio. Later the same year, however, Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment released Don Bluth's An American Tail, which outgrossed The Great Mouse Detective at the box office and became the highest-grossing first-issue animated film to that point.|$|E
5|$|Persona 3 The Movie: No. 1, Spring of Birth was {{animated}} by AIC ASTA. The main staff {{consisted of the}} same people behind Persona 4: <b>The</b> <b>Animation</b> along with a few modifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{first such}} effort, Cosgrove Hall's {{animation}} of The Invasion episodes 1 and 4, was released to DVD alongside the surviving episodes in November 2006. <b>The</b> <b>animation</b> {{had been paid}} for by an earlier surplus in the Doctor Who website budget, allowing it {{to be used in}} the DVD release as a test for the concept, at no extra cost.

5|$|The four-minute ride uses 85-foot IMAX Dome {{screens and}} Sony Projectors. There are 24 ride cars, each seating eight people, and {{approximately}} 2000 people can ride it per hour. The projection system uses four overlapping Sony SXRD 4K resolution projectors on each dome, using custom-made semi-circular fisheye lenses to project undistorted images {{at a rate}} of 60 frames per second (in comparison, most feature films project at 24 frames per second). The video is projected onto two dome screens which are made of 416 panels (each 4feet by two feet) and are approximately 80feet tall and 85feet wide. <b>The</b> <b>animation</b> in the ride uses computer generated 3D animation rendered by Blur Studio and Reel FX, rather than the traditional 2-D animation seen on The Simpsons and the queue and pre-show of the ride. <b>The</b> <b>animation</b> reference was provided by Film Roman, <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> studio that animates the series. Each car contains 12 speakers and a Dolby 6.1 surround sound, while the domes contain an additional 90 speakers.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation {{in the development of the}} art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> field during the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Wallner {{then turned}} his attentions to <b>the</b> <b>animations.</b> As all <b>the</b> <b>animations</b> in <b>the</b> game {{had to be}} {{interchangeable}} for every settler (walking, bending etc.), he first needed to work on <b>the</b> skeletal <b>animation.</b> Unsatisfied with <b>the</b> results when he attempted to use 3D Studio Max, he chose instead to build an [...] "extremely primitive skeletal settler which we could put under the visible structure of our figures." [...] The drawback to this approach was that all actions had to animated separately, frame-by-frame.|$|R

5|$|Concerns arose {{internally}} at Disney, {{particularly from}} Roy E. Disney, about studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg taking too much {{credit for the}} success of Disney's early 1990s releases. Disney president Frank Wells was killed in a helicopter accident in 1994, and Katzenberg lobbied CEO Michael Eisner for the vacant president position. Instead, tensions between Katzenberg, Eisner, and Disney resulted in Katzenberg being forced to resign from the company that August 24, with Joe Roth taking his place. On October 12, 1994, Katzenberg went on {{to become one of the}} founders of DreamWorks SKG, whose animation division became Disney's key rival in feature animation with both computer animated films such as Antz (1998), and traditionally animated films such as The Prince of Egypt (1998).

5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic {{to take over the}} American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without <b>the</b> <b>animation</b> slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team then noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, the game was slowed down.|$|E
