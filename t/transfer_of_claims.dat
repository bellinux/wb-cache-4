Examples include {{construction of a new}} mine, purchase of software, or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory. Spending by households (not government) on new houses is also included in investment. In contrast to its colloquial meaning, [...] "investment" [...] in GDP does not mean purchases of financial products. Buying financial products is classed as 'saving', as opposed to investment. This avoids double-counting: if one buys shares in a company, and the company uses the money received to buy plant, equipment, etc., the amount will be counted toward GDP when the company spends the money on those things; to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products. Buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds, a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> on future production, not directly an expenditure on products.|$|E

Analiza je namenjena tako pojmu in razvoju obeh omenjenih vrst, kot tudi pogodbi o factoringu in pogodbi o forfaitingu. Pozornost je namenjena primerjavi med pojmoma factoringa in forfaitinga, ter osvetlitvi podobnosti in razlik med njima glede na klasifikacijo obeh pogodb, glede na stranke, ki pri poslih sodelujejo, glede na kavzo pogodbe, glede na vrsto in način prenosa terjatev, glede na vpliv pogoja pri obeh pogodbah, glede na postopek ter pojavne oblike obeh poslov, glede na sestavine pogodbe ter glede na funkcije, ki jih obravnavani pogodbi omogočata. Povzamem lahko da sta forfaiting in factoring posla, ki omogočata financiranje trgovine na način,da pridobi prodajalec iz osnovnega posla s prenosom terjatve plačilo pred njeno zapadlostjo, s strani posebne finančne organizacije ali banke. Oba posla omogočata, da za primerno provizijo, prevzemnik nase prevzame terjatve z vsemi riziki, ki izhajajo iz njih. Razlika med factoringom in forfaitingom pa se kaže glede na vrsto terjatev, ki se prenaša, ter glede na zavarovanost terjatve. In this thesis I will present {{two types of}} modern financial transactions, more accurately two modern types of contracts in autonomous trade law, namely the factoring and forfaiting. The analysis is aimed at both the concept and development of both types, {{as well as on}} factoring and forfaiting contract. Special attention is given to a comparison between the concept of factoring and forfaitinga and highlighting similarities and differences between them, regarding to the classification of the two contracts, according to the parties that participate in transactions, due to a reason for concluding the contract, depending on the impact of type and mode of <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> in both contracts, according to the procedure and the manifestations of both types, depending on the elements of the contract and the functions resulting from both contracts. I can summarize that the forfaiting and factoring business, both are allowing financing trade in a way in which seller from the basic transaction by transferring assets obtains payment before its maturity, from the specific financial institutions or bank. Both concepts allow, for the appropriate commission, acceptance of claims that are not yet matured to be paid, and the transfer of all risks arising from those claims. An important difference between the factoring and forfaiting is reflected on the type of claim that is being transfered, and according to insurance given to those claims...|$|E

The first chapter is dedicated to assurance at the municipal level, familiarizing with its rules, types and functions.

40|$|Bank owner {{contingent}} liability has been {{important in the}} development of many industrial countries. Unlimited liability on bank owners was an important element in the success of Scottish banking, which led Scotland to be free of the banking and monetary upheavals that occurred in Britain and the United States. The unlimited liability provision effectively minimized the losses suffered by bank noteholders and other creditors. Three factors were vital to the success of unlimited liability in Scotland: 1) the identities of bank owners were made publicly available, and their level of wealth could be verified; 2) under Scottish bankruptcy law, owner liability extended to both personal and inheritable wealth; and 3) the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> ownership <b>claims</b> in private and provincial banks required that ownership first be dissolved before a new bank could be formed. A {{contingent liability}} system has three advantages: 1) because double liability imposes postclosure losses on bank stockholders, it increases incentives for banks to hold capital and decreases moral hazard incentives; 2) a contingent liability system can ameliorate asymmetric information problems between bank creditors and owners; and 3) contingent liability can lead to more efficient capital formation if potential capital sources are predominantly in the form of fixed wealth, as is true in many developing countries. But a free-rider problem arises when less-wealthy stockholders rely on the monitoring efforts of wealthier stockholders, who have more incentive to monitor. And in a free and anonymous exchange market, investors with less personal fixed wealth will outbid those with greater wealth, so the value of double liability could collapse overtime.
