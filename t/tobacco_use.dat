5|$|Although {{visually}} {{similar to}} Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was designed for}} mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and <b>tobacco</b> <b>use,</b> profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was developed {{over the course of}} four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>use</b> is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
40|$|This across {{sectional}} {{descriptive study}} was conducted {{during the period from}} Nov- Dec 2002 to measure the prevalence of <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> among the students at Alzaiem Alazhari University. From 4782 male and female students 320 students were selected using simple random sample technique to represent the whole students in the three complexes of the university. The study revealed that the prevalence of <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> among the students was 62. 5 % and <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> is more prevalent among male than female students. Also it reveled that cigarettes and shisha are more prevalent types of <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> among the students. The commonest factors increased this high prevalence of <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> among the students were, they desire to appear like adults starting <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> at early age, presence of tobacco user in the family in addition to presence of friends who <b>using</b> <b>tobacco...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Nazi anti-tobacco {{campaign}} included banning {{smoking in}} trams, buses and city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, {{and raising the}} tobacco tax.

40|$|Tobacco {{has been}} {{labelled}} by the World Health Organisation {{as the largest}} preventable threat to modern day health, due to the tobacco plant being highly susceptible to bioavailable elements and the accumulation of over 4, 000 different chemicals throughout cultivation. The risks of <b>using</b> <b>tobacco</b> are significantly heightened when the tobacco is illicit due {{to the use of}} poor grade unregulated tobacco and sub-standard delivery systems. This research that was conducted in collaboration with Lancashire Trading Standards and allows for the profiling of a diverse range of different <b>tobaccos</b> <b>using</b> 88 samples collected from Lancashire Trading Standards, various licit retailers in Preston, France and Sweden. The aims of this research include; the elemental profiling of <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy as a rapid handheld qualitative technique, the quantification and comparison of nicotine levels within licit, illicit and niche <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry, including a single strand extraction study to determine the possibility of the natural spatial distribution of nicotine along the tobacco leaf and finally, the molecular profiling of <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy aided by multivariate data analysis. Through analysis of spectra collected using X-ray Fluorescence, we were able to determine elemental differences between dried leaf and treated <b>tobacco</b> <b>using</b> fluctuations in elements such as Potassium, Calcium and Iron. The most significant elemental difference between niche and licit tobacco was the presence of Chlorine found within the Snüs. The extraction and quantification of nicotine using Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry identified significantly higher levels of nicotine present within illicit tobacco when compared to that of a licit cigarette, supporting the theory that illicit tobacco contains higher doses of nicotine leading to higher rates of addiction. Data collected from single stranded extractions identified similar high standard deviations (> 25...|$|R
