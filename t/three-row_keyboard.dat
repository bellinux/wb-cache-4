50|$|The Model 32 line {{used the}} same {{mechanism}} and looked identical, except for having a <b>three-row</b> <b>keyboard</b> and, on the ASR model, a five-level paper tape reader and punch, both appropriate for Baudot code.|$|E
50|$|The KL-7 was {{designed}} for off-line operation. It was {{about the size of}} a Teletype machine and had a similar <b>three-row</b> <b>keyboard,</b> with shift keys for letters and figures. The KL-7 produced printed output on narrow paper strips that were then glued to message pads. When encrypting, it automatically inserted a space between five-letter code groups. One of the reasons for the five letter groups was messages might be given to a morse code operator. The number of five letter groups was easily verified when transmitted. There was an adaptor available, the HL-1/X22, that allowed 5-level Baudot punched paper tape from Teletype equipment to be read for decryption. The standard KL-7 had no ability to punch tapes. A variant of the KL-7, the KL-47, could also punch paper tape for direct input to teleprinters.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Teletype <b>three-row</b> <b>keyboard</b> is expanded on the Model 28 {{with the}} addition of special keys, normally colored red, which allow the operator to control keyboard line break, keyboard lock and unlock, repeat operation, and local carriage return and local line feed. The keyboard base, with the attached motor unit and typing unit, is pivotally mounted a cradle within the cabinet and swings outward for maintenance. Unlike previous machines, all mechanical controls, such as the Model 15 manual platen crank, are brought to the front so that machines can be positioned side-by-side in rows. Electrical accessories, such as the line relays, motor relays and power fuses are mounted in a separate removable chassis called the Electrical Service Unit. A separate shelf is available in the console base for ancillary equipment such as rectifiers and is also used to store local installation documentation.|$|E
500|$|In 1928, the Oliver Typewriter Company {{was sold}} to investors who formed the British Oliver Typewriter Company in Croydon, England. Production of Oliver’s original, <b>three-rowed</b> <b>keyboard</b> design was {{discontinued}} in 1931 when the company began to produce a rebranded model of the [...] "Fortuna" [...] typewriter, a four-rowed German design. In 1935, the company began to produce the Halda-Norden standard typewriter, another licensed design, as model No. 20. The company, however, had to retool its machines {{and return to the}} original Oliver design when the British government placed large orders for the three-rowed No. 15 at the outbreak of World War II.|$|R
5000|$|This {{model was}} first marketed in 1893, and {{was built on}} the same {{principles}} as the New Model. It added a straight <b>three-row</b> QWERTY <b>keyboard,</b> and as Model No. 4 it also offered a two-color ribbon. The elaborate decorations had by now given way to a comparatively sober design.FASFAS ...|$|R
50|$|The aim of {{the design}} is to {{optimise}} text entry by organising keys to minimise key-to-key finger movement, allowing faster input through one-finger entry (compared to ten digits required to type efficiently on QWERTY layout). As compared to the <b>three-row</b> QWERTY <b>keyboard,</b> FITALY has five rows with at most six letters in a row (as opposed to the ten on QWERTY).|$|R
500|$|The Oliver’s typebars {{are bent}} in a bow (forming an {{inverted}} [...] "U" [...] shape) and rest in [...] "towers" [...] {{on the sides}} of the typewriter. This design limited the machine to a <b>three-row</b> QWERTY <b>keyboard</b> as the typebars were stacked such that they grew progressively larger as more were added. The size and usability implications of adding additional keys and thus, more typebars, precluded the addition of a fourth keyboard row dedicated to numbers. Although a four-row prototype was designed in 1922, it was shelved due to the company’s financial troubles at that time. The No. 20, No. 21 and portable models produced by the British Oliver Typewriter Company had four-row keyboards.|$|R
50|$|By {{the year}} 1900, the Stradella bass system had principally reached its current {{construction}} with 120 buttons over 6 rows. However, while that setup {{worked well for}} major and minor music accompanied by many chords, the performer would only have access to about a single octave of notes while playing - two with a timely shift of registers. The problem was solved in the early 1900s by adding three rows of chromatically ordered single notes next to the standard bass. In 1900 in Moscow Russian master Bakanov made a garmon with piano keyboards for both right and left hands. From 1906 the brothers Kiselevs' factory in Tula began to produce bayans with the <b>three-row</b> free-bass left <b>keyboard.</b>|$|R
