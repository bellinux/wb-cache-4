40|$|The BID (Bep {{intracellular}} delivery) domain {{functions as}} secretion signal in a subfamily of protein substrates of bacterial type IV secretion (T 4 S) systems. It mediates transfer of (1) relaxases and the attached DNA during bacterial conjugation, and (2) numerous Bartonella effector proteins (Beps) during protein transfer into host cells infected by pathogenic Bartonella species. Furthermore, BID domains of Beps have often evolved secondary effector functions within host cells. Here, we provide crystal structures for three representative BID domains and describe a novel conserved fold {{characterized by a}} compact, antiparallel four-helix bundle <b>topped</b> with a <b>hook.</b> The conserved hydrophobic core provides a rigid scaffold to a surface that, despite a few conserved exposed residues and similarities in charge distribution, displays significant variability.

5000|$|Supported {{spindles}} spin on surfaces such as bowls {{that are}} usually ceramic or wooden. This type of spindle gives the user more control {{of the weight of}} the yarn. The various types of supported spindles range due to the difference in styles of spinning and yarn weight. Navajo spindles have longer shafts that should reach from the ground to the top of thigh. The spun yarn is wound above the whorl. [...] In Icelandic Viking times, the people used a high whorl lap spindle to spin wool into yarn. The high whorl lap spindle has a whorl on <b>top</b> with a <b>hook</b> on the <b>top</b> and a long shaft like other supported spindles. Unlike the Navajo spindle, however the spun yarn is wrapped around {{the lower end of the}} spindle. First the roving is prepped by drafting it before the wool is spun into yarn. The separation between the drafting and spinning creates a softer yarn. Since it is a supported spindle, the yarn is less strained, which also makes the yarn soft.|$|R

In December 1936 the military branch of Renault was nationalised as the AMX company which continued production to a total of about 2,200, later joined by Berliet which would build another 100 and Fouga which would produce 300 for a grand total for the Modèle 31 of about 2600.|$|R
50|$|During the ascus initial {{formation}} the crozier {{helps to}} maintain a dikaryotic state in the ascus initial and its side branch that will continue the spreading growth of the ascogenous hyphae in Ascomycota fruitbodies. The tips of developing asci on these ascogenous hyphae curl over. One haploid nucleus migrates into the curved tip while the other compatible haploid nucleus remains in the penultimate space below the hook. The ascus initial itself forms as a radiating spur branch at the <b>top</b> of the <b>hook.</b> Each nucleus divides resulting {{in the formation of}} a pair of compatible nuclei, i.e. a dikaryon, in the ascus. Two sister nuclei remain, one in the basal cell and the other in the crozier. The tip of the crozier fuses with the penultimate cell while walling itself off from the ascus by the formation of a septum. The nucleus from the crozier migrates into the penultimate cell joining the other nucleus, thus maintaining a dikaryotic state. These nuclei migrate into a side branch growing {{from the base of the}} ascus that repeats the ascus-crozier formation innumerable times. Mature croziers are detectable through microscopic examination of mature asci as small curved bridges at the basal septa. A minority of Ascomycota lack crosiers, hence the presence or absence of croziers is an important taxonomic character. Croziers resemble and function similarly to clamp connections on the dikaryotic hyphae of Basidiomycota.|$|R
40|$|Short {{sediment}} cores {{were collected}} from ? 1100 m water depth at the <b>top</b> of <b>Hook</b> Ridge, a submarine volcanic edifice in the Central Basin of the Bransfield Strait, Antarctica, to assess Fe and Mn supply to the water column. Low-temperature hydrothermal fluids advect through these sediments and, in places, subsurface H 2 S is present at high enough concentrations to support abundant Sclerolinum sp., an infaunal tubeworm that hosts symbiotic thiotrophic bacteria. The water column is fully oxic, and oxygen penetration depths at all sites are 2 - 5 cmbsf. Pore water Fe and Mn content is high within the subsurface ferruginous zone (max. 565 ?mol Fe L- 1, > 3 to 7 cmbsf) — 14 - 18 times higher than values measured at a nearby, background site of equivalent water depth. Diffision and advection of pore waters supply significant Fe and Mn to the surface sediment. Sequential extraction of the sediment demonstrates {{that there is a}} significant enrichment in a suite of reactive, authigenic Fe minerals in the upper 0 - 5 cm of sediment at one site characterised by weathered crusts at the seafloor. At a site with only minor authigenic mineral surface enrichment we infer that leakage of pore water Fe and Mn from the sediment leads to enriched total dissolvable Fe and Mn in bottom waters. The largest Eh anomaly observed from our Bransfield Strait survey is associated with the elevated total dissolvable metal content in the water column above this coring site [...] We hypothesize that the main mechanism for Fe and Mn efflux from the sediment is breach of the surface oxic layer by the abundant Sclerolinum sp., along with episodic enhancements by physical mixing and resuspension of sediment in this dynamic volcanic environment. We propose that Hook Ridge sediments are an important source of Fe and Mn to the deep waters of the Central Basin in the Bransfield Strait, where concentrations are sustained by the benthic flux, and Fe is stabilised in the water column as either colloidal phases or ligand-bound dissolved species. Entrainment of this water mass into the Drake Passage and thereby the Antarctic Circumpolar Current could provide a significant metal source to this HNLC region of the Southern Ocean if mixing and upwelling occurs before removal of this metal pool to underlying sediments. Sediment-covered volcanic ridges are common within rifted margins and may play a previously overlooked role in the global Fe cycle...|$|R
50|$|Near Pointe du Hoc, {{the landing}} craft {{flotilla}} carrying Force A made a wrong turn. By {{the time the}} force got back on track, Colonel Rudder {{knew that he would}} never be able to signal Force C by 7:00. That meant no reinforcements. Companies D, E, and F of the 2nd would have to do their best without help until Force C could get across four miles of enemy territory and join up with them. When the landing crafts hit a narrow, pebbled beach near a cliff, German machine-gunners opened up on the Rangers. Some of them were killed, but the rest of them got to the bottom of the cliff and used miniature rockets to fire grappling ropes up to the <b>top.</b> Once the <b>hooks</b> caught on barbed wire of bushes, the Rangers climbed up. Some Germans unhooked the ropes and sent the men on them plummeting to their deaths. However, Rudder and most of his men reached the top of the cliff and engaged in a battle with a force of Germans in bunkers. Tossing grenades and blasting their way into the bunkers, Rudder's Rangers killed many Germans but found wooden posts instead of heavy artillery inside. The guns had been moved away to a more secure location some months before D-day to facilitate the installation of casemented deck guns. Some of the Rangers were able to locate a battery of mobile guns inland and destroy them. The men at the cliff set up a makeshift headquarters and prepared for a counterattack. Throughout their battle for Pointe du Hoc, the Rangers were under fire from the nearby coastal gun battery at Maisy. (Maisy was a Rangers objective - taken on 9 June 1944).|$|R
