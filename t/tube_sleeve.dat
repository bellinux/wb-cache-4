40|$|Abstract The {{circular}} {{hollow sections}} (CHS) are being widely employed in steel structures around the world, increasing {{the development of}} new researches. This article proposes an innovative connection model for circular hollow sections that facilitates and reduces the assembly cost of hollow section structures. The proposed connection is a <b>tube</b> <b>sleeve,</b> used to splice two tubes, composed of an inner tube with a diameter smaller than the connecting tubes, which is connected to the outer tubes by bolts passing through both tubes. This connection can be a cheaper and easier alternative to flange connections, which are widely used in large span tubular trusses. The connection was tested in laboratory under tension loading. The tests made it possible to identify the influence of stress distribution on tubes and the need for the use of a shear lag coefficient.

This paper presents the parametric analysis conducted to derive the optimal dimensions of the steel sleeve necessary to secure the bond performance of the swaging type anchorage for CFRP tendon with diameter of 5 mm. To that goal, fi-nite element analysis is performed on the parameters determining {{the dimensions of the}} sleeve like the thickness and inner diameters of the sleeve. The results show that a constant swaging pressure of about 450 MPa on the mean is dis-tributed in the sleeve when the thickness ratio of the stress relief zone to the effective swaging zone of the sleeve is lar-ger than 1. 1 and that the swaging pressure tends to reduce linearly as much as this thickness ratio becomes smaller than 1. 1. The pressure varies within a range of about 30 % according to the change in the inner diameter of the sleeve whereas varies within a range less than 10 % according to the change in the inner diameter when the thickness ratio is larger than 1. 1. Finally, the optimal dimensions of the steel <b>tube</b> <b>sleeve</b> enabling to secure an anchor force larger than the rupture strength of the CFRP tendon with diameter of 5 mm are determined based upon the results of the parametric analysis...|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} occurs when {{refrigerant}} fluids wick inside the insulation of thermocouple wires through a compressor's casing feedthrough and then leak into the adjacent disconnect box outside the casing. Leaking fluids create an unfavorable situation inside the disconnect box and may contaminate the fluids. To address this problem, NASA Lewis Research Center s Manufacturing Engineering Division developed a customized hermetic feedthrough for {{a bank of}} Worthington compressors. In these compressors, bearing temperatures are measured by internal thermocouples embedded in bearings located inside the compressor casings. The thermocouple wires need to be routed outside the casing and read at another location. These wires are short and are terminated to a disconnect strip inside the casing. The bearings operate at about 170 F, but because the casing is filled with R 12 refrigerant oil, the casing has a maximum temperature of about 100 F. The operating conditions of these compressors {{permit the use of}} an epoxy that is compatible with the R 12 fluid. The desired finished product is a stainless steel tube that has been filled solid with epoxy after thermocouple wires bonded and sealed by epoxy have been inserted through its length. Shrink tubing extends from both ends of the tube. The process that was developed to isolate the thermocouple wires from the R 12 fluid follows. For this application, use an 8 -in. -long piece of 0. 500 -in. 304 stainless steel tube with six pairs of 24 -gauge stranded, PTFE-insulated (polytetrafluoroethylene) type "T" thermocouple wires for each feedthrough. Use shrink tubing to strain relief the insulated wires at their exit from the stainless steel tube. Cut the wire to length and identify the location of the stainless steel <b>tube</b> <b>sleeve</b> with masking tape. Then, remove the outer insulation from a 2 -in. section of wire that will be inside the tube, and carefully strip to bare wire a 1 -in. section {{in the middle of the}} section with the outer insulation removed. For an effective seal, the epoxy must penetrate between the strands when stranded conductors are used. Make the seal with epoxy bond on the bare wire. The bare wire must be encapsulated with a thin layer of the epoxy that leaves only a very low profile. These encapsulated wires must cure before the assembly can be continued. Then, inspect the cured wires for complete encapsulation before going to the next step. Insert the wires in the stainless steel tube and orient them so that the epoxied stripped sections are staggered within the tube; then, apply shrink tubing to one end of the cleaned wires, positioning it inside the edge of the tube. The small gaps between the wires on the other end will be used to inject the epoxy into the tube. Let the epoxy cure inside the tube, free of any voids. Then, continue to fill the tube until the entire 8 -in. length is nearly filled, allowing room for the other strain-relieving shrink tubing. Since this first design, the process has been adjusted to fit many needs and situations. Customized feedthroughs have been assembled from various wire types, wire gauges, and/or stainless steel tube passages. The fittings selected to mount these feedthroughs allow their use in other areas, such as pressure or vacuum systems...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTensegrity rings, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} hollow ropes, <b>tubes</b> or <b>sleeve</b> modules, are systems based on straight prism geometry and composed {{of one or}} more bar circuits and cables. Recently, we developed a general study for these structures, including their ability of folding.

This prototype has been tested under compression loading in several experiments. Finite element (FE) simulations are consistent with the experimental observations. In this paper, we present an analytical model of the axial behaviour of such a ring.

The artillery factory at Trubia produced the first exemplars in 1903, but the howitzer was not ready for adoption for active duty until 1916, by which time it was obsolescent. Still, it went into service and by 1936 M1916 240mm howitzers armed several batteries around Spain. Four were at Ferrol in the Fuente Seca Battery, four at Cartagena at the Loma Larga Battery, which were moved in 1940 to Ceuta, and four each were in the Regana and Refeubeitx batteries on Mallorca. Lastly, eight of the howitzers were held in reserve at an artillery park. In April 1937 the army moved four of these howitzers by rail to Águilas.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a sleeve technique during endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) in primary nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) patients with a high lacrimal sac. Materials and Methods: The medical records of 45 patients (49 cases) undergoing endoscopic DCR for primary NLDO with a high lacrimal sac were retrospectively reviewed. In 19 patients (21 cases), the thick maxilla covering the common canalicular opening was removed using a drill and a bicanalicular silicone tube was inserted (group 1). In 26 patients (28 cases), instead of removal of the thick maxilla, a sleeve was inserted into the bicanalicular silicone tube (group 2).

40|$|The {{objective}} was to develop and characterize a potential method to alleviate the issues regarding post impact effective modulus of composites in a tubular geometry. The hypothesis was {{that the use of}} a metallic substrate may increase post impact stiffness characteristics of the sample geometry, compared to a traditional fiber reinforced composite tube, in the torsion and tensile loading scenarios. This required the manufacture of non substrate fiber reinforced composite samples and aluminum substrate composite samples, and testing under torsion and tension loading scenarios. Main sample testing was carried out below the sample yield point, and therefore tests were nondestructive in nature. This research has concluded with statistical significance that an aluminum substrate decreases loss in torsional effective modulus following impact compared to a composite shaft only composed of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy. Samples with both aluminum sleeve factor levels produced significantly lower post impact effective modulus change compared to traditional composite counterparts. This appears to be correlated with the elimination of visible fiber and matrix rupture during the impact event. Therefore, torsional effective modulus decrease of the aluminum <b>sleeve</b> <b>tubes</b> appears to be dictated by tube geometry change. This is in contrast to traditional composite tubes, where a decrease in effective modulus was primarily dictated by the decrease in fiber cross sectional area. This research has concluded that the aluminum substrate decreases post impact tensile effective modulus change compared to traditional composite tubes, but statistical significance could not be attained due to the high degree of variance within each of the sleeve thickness factor levels. Samples with aluminum sleeves produced lower post impact effective modulus change compared to the traditional composite counterparts, but each sample sleeve thickness factor level variance was relatively high compared to the difference in mean values...|$|R
