50|$|By 1934, the {{original}} site had become inadequate and 3½ acres of adjoining land were purchased for expansion. Although car body production {{was coming to}} an end, major contracts for the GPO were obtained during the 1930s, for telephone repair vans in the main, on either Morris Minor or larger Morris Commercial Chassis, although two specials were BLB444 of 1934 the blue streamlined van designed to publicise the air mail service, which was modelled as a Dinky Toy. and GPO1 which was a Morris Commercial Leader <b>tractive</b> <b>unit</b> coupled to a Brockhouse semi-trailer upon which Duple built a travelling post office for use at agricultural shows, race meetings and other major public events.|$|E
5000|$|The cargo trailer is, {{by means}} of a king pin, hooked to a horseshoe-shaped {{quick-release}} coupling device called a fifth wheel or a turntable hitch {{at the rear of the}} towing engine that allows easy hook up and release. The truck trailer cannot move by itself because it only has wheels at the rear end: it requires a forward axle, provided by the towing engine, to carry half the load weight. When braking hard at high speeds, the vehicle has a tendency to fold at the pivot point between the towing vehicle and the trailer. Such a truck accident is called a [...] "trailer swing", although it is also commonly described as a [...] "jackknife". Jackknifing is a condition where the <b>tractive</b> <b>unit</b> swings round against the trailer, and not vice versa.|$|E
50|$|A {{register}} of <b>tractive</b> <b>units</b> {{has been introduced}} by the Federal Railway Office (Eisenbahnbundesamt, EBA), which also issues vehicle numbers. Digits 5-8 are a four-digit class number, 9-11 the three-digit serial number of the vehicle within its class.|$|R
5000|$|For every railway that enters its <b>tractive</b> <b>units</b> {{into the}} register, a clear European-wide code is needed, {{separate}} from the number. This alphanumerical Vehicle Keeper Marking (VKM) is allocated by a railway administration in accordance with CR OPE TSI. The list of keeper codes is linked below.

40|$|The length {{legislation}} for trucks in Europe regulates the total {{length of a}} vehicle combination, {{from the front of}} the cab to the trailing edge of the trailer. The European Cab Over Engine (COE) <b>tractive</b> <b>units</b> are, compared to the conventional designs with a hood, not preferred aerodynamically due to its flat front and relatively sharp edges. If elongating the nose of the COE cab, creating a so-called Soft Nose (SN), potential for improved aerodynamic properties is seen. To improve the transport efficiency, some countries in Europe allow vehicle combinations of up to 25. 25 m; the aerodynamic properties of these longer vehicles have however not been in much focus historically. This thesis deals with perspectives of aerodynamic drag and cooling airflow for heavy trucks, under the circumstances of reconsidered total length legislation. The potential for design changes of different parts of a complete truck-trailer combination have been evaluated. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was the main tool for obtaining the results; measurements have been used to verify the results.|$|R
40|$|The results {{presented}} in this thesis showed {{that there are many}} areas on a complete truck-trailer combination where substantial drag reductions may be acquired. It has been seen that for longer vehicle combinations, the gap between the cargo-units and the chassis level of the trailer units were large sources of drag, especially in yawed-wind conditions. By design changes of these areas, drag was reduced by significant amounts. Working with the front-end of the COE cab, an elongation of the grille area could result in both improved aerodynamic properties, but also cooling airflow can be enhanced if also considering the layout of the components in the under hood. Without a ducting system, guiding the flow from the grille towards the cooling module, or a movement of the cooling module by the same magnitude as the SN elongation, {{a large portion of the}} airflow in the under hood leaked around the cooling module and reduced cooling capacity. The main conclusion to be made is that there still are much room for aerodynamic improvements on a truck-trailer combination if reconsidering the total-length legislation. Ideally, the <b>tractive</b> <b>units</b> and trailers should be developed as a whole, to maximize the possible aerodynamic reductions...|$|R
40|$|The {{realization}} of maximum adhesive forces for a railway vehicle {{is a very}} difficult process, because it involves using tractive efforts and depends on friction characteristics in the contact zone between wheels and rails. Tractive efforts are realized by means of tractive torques of motors, and their maximum values can provide negative effects such as slip and skid. These situations usually happen when information about friction conditions is lacking. The negative processes have a major influence on wearing of contact bodies and <b>tractive</b> <b>units.</b> Therefore, many existing control systems for vehicles use an effect of a prediction of a friction coefficient between wheels and rails because measuring a friction coefficient at the moment of running vehicle movement is very difficult. One of the ways to solve this task is to use noise spectrum analysis for friction coefficient detection. This noise phenomenon has not been clearly studied and analyzed. In this paper, we propose an adhesion control system of railway vehicles based on an observer, which allows one to determine the maximum tractive torque based on the optimal adhesive force between the wheels (wheel pair) of a railway vehicle and rails (rail track) depending on weight load from a wheel to a rail, friction conditions in the contact zone, a lateral displacement of wheel set and wheel sleep. As a result, it allows a railway vehicle to be driven in a tractive mode by the maximum adhesion force for real friction conditions...|$|R
50|$|The coal is {{cut from}} the coalface by a machine called the shearer (power loader). This machine can weigh 75-120 tonnes {{typically}} and comprises a main body, housing the electrical functions, the <b>tractive</b> motive <b>units</b> to move the shearer along the coalface and pumping units (to power both hydraulic and water functions). At {{either end of the}} main body are fitted the ranging arms which can be ranged vertically up down by means of hydraulic rams, and onto which are mounted the shearer cutting drums which are fitted with 40-60 cutting picks. Within the ranging arms are housed very powerful electric motors (typically up to 850 kW) which transfer their power through a series of lay gears within the body and through the arms to the drum mounting locations at the extreme ends of the ranging arms where the cutting drums are. The cutting drums are rotated at a speed of 20-50 revs/min to cut the mineral from coal seam.|$|R
40|$|As future LTA {{vehicles}} will be doomed {{right from the}} start if they do not fill a real need, some differences in transport philosophy between design engineers {{on the one hand and}} freight forwarders on the other are discussed. Watching rising costs of energy necessary to transport our cargo from A to B, and realizing that this price of energy is always included in the product's selling price at B, the apparent correlation between installed specific <b>tractive</b> force per <b>unit</b> of cargo weight and pure freighting cost are contemplated. Very speedy and progressive Airship designs are mistrusted, because the key to any low cost transport tool is to design it for its given task only, without any unnecessary sophistication...|$|R
40|$|Motor {{vehicles}} {{are one of}} the largest sources of air pollutants worldwide. Despite their importance, motor vehicle emissions are inadequately understood and quantified. This {{is due in part to}} large variations in individual vehicle emissions with changing operating conditions, and to significant differences between vehicles. To better relate emissions with operating conditions, a new parameter termed “specific power ” (SP) is presented. SP is the instantaneous <b>tractive</b> power per <b>unit</b> vehicle mass. This parameter has three main advantages: it can be calculated from roadside measurements, it captures most of the dependence of light-duty vehicle emissions on driving conditions, and it is directly specified in emissions certification cycles. The dependence of CO, HC, and NOx emissions on SP is better than on several other commonly used parameters, such as speed, acceleration, power, or fuel rate. Using SP as the basic metric allows meaningful comparisons to be made between data from different remote sensing sites, dynamometer driving cycles, and emission models. Modern U. S. {{vehicles are}} likely to operate under commanded enrichment when SP exceeds th...|$|R
