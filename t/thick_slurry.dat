A combined cycle uses highly pressurized fluidized bed boiler to provide steam above critical temperature to drive steam-turbine cycle while the flue-gas is injected into gas turbines. The present round also shows that gains over usual BIG/GT (Biomass In-tegrated Gasification/Gas Turbine) are very likely mainly due to the practicality of feeding the biomass as slurry that can be pumped into the pressurized boiler chamber.

5000|$|Bounded by {{impoundment}}s (an impoundment is a dam), these dams typically use [...] "local materials" [...] {{including the}} tailings themselves, {{and may be}} considered embankment dams. Traditionally, the only option for tailings storage was {{to deal with a}} tailings slurry. This slurry is a dilute stream of the tailings solids within water that was sent to the tailings storage area. The modern tailings designer has a range of tailings products to choose from depending upon how much water is removed from the slurry prior to discharge. The removal of water not only can create a better storage system in some cases (e.g. dry stacking, see below) but can also assist in water recovery which is a major issue as many mines are in arid regions. In a 1994 description of tailings impoundments, however, the U.S. EPA stated that dewatering methods may be prohibitively expensive except in special circumstances. Subaqueous storage of tailings has also been used.Tailing ponds are areas of refused mining tailings where the waterborne refuse material is pumped into a pond to allow the sedimentation (meaning separation) of solids from the water. The pond is generally impounded with a dam, and known as tailings impoundments or tailings dams. It was estimated in 2000 that there were about 3,500 active tailings impoundments in the world. The ponded water is of some benefit as it minimizes fine tailings from being transported by wind into populated areas where the toxic chemicals could be potentially hazardous to human health; however, it is also harmful to the environment. Tailing ponds are often somewhat dangerous because they attract wildlife such as waterfowl or caribou as they appear to be a natural pond, but they can be highly toxic and harmful to the health of these animals. Tailings ponds are used to store the waste made from separating minerals from rocks, or the slurry produced from tar sands mining. Tailings are sometimes mixed with other materials such as bentonite to form a <b>thicker</b> <b>slurry</b> that slows the release of impacted water to the environment.|$|R
40|$|Ice pigging {{is a novel}} pipe {{cleaning}} concept, patented {{and developed}} at the University of Bristol, where <b>thick</b> ice <b>slurry</b> is pumped through a pipeline forming an 'ice pig' capable of displaying both solid and fluid like properties. The ice pig is able to displace material within a pipeline and apply elevated levels of shear stress at the pipe wall compared to simple water flushing, whilst still being able to negotiate complex topologies. Ice pigging has been demonstrated to show increased cleaning capability over equivalent water flushing. The work carried out for this thesis has been funded by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to assess the feasibility of using ice pigging as a decommissioning technique. Due {{to the nature of}} the decommissioning process it is important to understand the rheological properties of ice slurry in order to be able to engineer the composition of the ice pig for the desired application. A fully instrumented laboratory rig, developed over the duration of the thesis, allowed a series of experiments to be undertaken on simple horizontal pipe sections in order to determine the wall shear stress exhibited by flowing ice slurries of varying ice fraction and flow velocity. Results were obtained for flowing ice slurries above 35 % ice fraction for which no data currently exists within the literature. Increasing ice fraction to a maximum of 50 %, it was found that the wall shear stress increased with an exponential like fashion. A series of field experiments were also undertaken measuring pressure drop in large potable water pipes. Results are presented that can be used to help optimise the process for effective pipeline cleaning. Interesting flow characteristics were observed in the largest diameter pipe where pressure drop reduced significantly at very high flow rates. It is suggested that the 'operational limit' of the ice pig for that particular situation had been exceeded. This thesis has demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture and handle <b>thick</b> ice <b>slurry</b> in excess of 35 % ice fraction, capable of delivering pipeline wall shear rates in the order of 10 to 500 times that of simple water flushing. Ice pigging presents a new, low risk innovative solution for pipeline cleaning in the nuclear industry. vEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Amylase production on the complex medium containing beef extract or {{corn steep liquor}} was higher than on semisynthetic medium containing peptone (0. 4 %). The synthetic medium, however, did not provide a good yield of extracellular amylase. Among the carbohydrates which favored the production of amylase are, in order starch > dextrin > glycogen > cellobiose > maltohexaose-maltopeptaose > maltotetraose and maltotriose.

40|$|Ice pigging is {{a method}} of {{cleaning}} pipes using a <b>thick</b> ice <b>slurry,</b> consisting of ice particles and an aqueous solution. The rheological properties of the ice slurry are such that both liquid and solid characteristics are observable, depending on the flow conditions. In 2007 this method was adopted by Bristol water, under trial conditions, to re- move sediment from large diameter pipes. Over 50 trials were carried out, principally on the Bristol Water network Two mathematical models were developed to predict the ice slurry performance given a range of operating parameters. Outlet monitor- ing equipment was developed {{for the purpose of}} investigating the ice slurry behaviour, allowing the mathematical models to be compared to actual data from trials. The model was found to provide an acceptable fit to the range of trial data, despite the difficulties in estimating the exact conditions. The outlet equipment was also developed to provide real time information on the current condition of flow exiting the hydrant, allowing a PLC system to advise on operational decisions. Numerous observations concerning operational conditions required for optimal pigging were made, including: valve configurations and timing; importance of the Froude Number for various stages of flow; and breakthrough or percolation of push water through the ice pig as flow along the pipe occurs. A website and server were set up allowing access to the model from any location, without large computer processing power being required. The results of the model were interpreted to provide realistic and usable suggestions to improve the performance of the ice pigging procedure for the conditions provided. A brief discussion of ice pigging rig development is given, describing the transition from manually operated ice slurry production, conditioning and dispensing, to a user friend unit which can be operated with a reduced understanding of the process.

The amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (ALAB) Lactobacillus plantarum A 6 and Lactobacillus fermentum Ogi E 1 were able to change the consistency of <b>thick</b> sticky gelatinized <b>slurries</b> of these starchy fruits and tubers into semiliquid to liquid products. Consequently, a decrease in apparent viscosity and an increase in Bostwick flow were observed. These changes and the production of maltooligosaccharides confirmed starch hydrolysis. Sucrose in sweet potato was not fermented by strain A 6 and poorly fermented by strain Ogi E 1, suggesting possible inhibition of sucrose fermentation. In all 3 starchy plants, rapidly digestible starch (RDS) was higher than slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) represented between 17 % and 30 % dry matter (DM). The digestibility of plantain was not affected by fermentation, whereas the RDS content of breadfruit and sweet potato decreased and the RS content increased after fermentation. Practical Application: The characteristics resulting from different combinations of gluten free starchy plants (plantain, breadfruit, sweet potato) and amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (ALAB) offer opportunities to develop new functional fermented beverages, mainly for breadfruit and sweet potato, after further investigation of their formulation, sensory attributes, nutritional, and prebiotic characteristics...|$|R

Recovering germ as intact as possible is necessary to prevent any oil contamination in the final products. Attrition mills like Disk mill is used to coarse grind the softened corn kernels. The grinding is slow and the elements used to grind are blunt to ensure intact removal of germ. Water is added to the ground material to make a <b>thick</b> <b>slurry</b> of macerated kernels and whole germ. 40-50% of crude oil in germ makes it less dense than other particles and as a result germ floats in the mixture. The mixture is then passed through germ hydrocyclones with an over and underflow. Overflow will be composed majorly of germ and water and underflow will have fiber, starch, protein and water. The overflow is passed through the hydroclone multiple times since 100% separation cannot be achieved in single pass. The separated germ is cleaned, dried and passed through germ press to extract oil from it. Solvent extraction can also be used alternatively. The solid particles remaining after oil extraction is called germ meal which is further dried.Use of germ meal: It is a good source of amino acids and is carrier of micro-ingredients in animal food formulations.

Therefore, before filtration is started, a filter aid, such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away {{from the surface of the}} filter cloth and facilitates filtration. However, filter aid is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of filter aid needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.|$|E

The ‘icon’ is a typical two - storey local authority suburban house, designed and constructed, like thousands of others, in Dublin during and after the 1930 ’s. The publication coincides with an exhibition at Collins Barracks, where a full - size installation of the iconic house façade is temporarily housed in the finest space, Clarke Square. In the biting introduction by Mick Wilson, the motives of the authors as artists are discussed, and it is posited that the museum has offered a ‘public space’ to them for making claims and counterclaims ‘to foment a debate’ in relation to urbanism and Dublin. Wilson pointedly hopes that this discussion can ‘throw some stones into the <b>thick</b> <b>slurry</b> of contemporary Irish journalism and political commentary’...|$|E
40|$|Knot rejects {{obtained}} from pulp screening after sulphite pulping {{are difficult to}} dewater, which makes landfilling expensive and burning inefficient. The rejects were found to contain up to 50 % cellulose, which is very susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis to glucose. Knot rejects were hydrolyzed at 20 % consistency in a laboratory peg mixer with cellulase enzyme. The <b>thick</b> <b>slurry</b> was liquefied within the first hour of mixing and resulted in a glucose concentration of over 100 g/L after 24 hours of reaction. This solution was fermented by yeast to give an ethanol concentration of over 5 %. The laboratory results were confirmed at pilot scale with a mortar mixer (high consistency) or stirred tank reactor (medium consistency) at the 400 L and 6000 L scales, respectively. It was found that washing the knots with ammonia resulted in increased glucose conversion. Enzyme costs could be lowered by separating the enzyme from the hydrolyzed sugars by membrane ultrafiltration and recycling the enzyme to the subsequent batch of substrate. The combination of high-consistency hydrolysis and enzyme recycling minimizes capital investment, energy requirements, and enzyme costs, which are significant factors in the overall economic viability of cellulose conversion to ethanol...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} before the processing and manufacturing industries is disposal of the residual waste products. Pond ash and red mud are one {{of the major}} waste products of any aluminum industry. The pond ash and red mud sample are acquired form BALCO, Korba where they are disposed off using the <b>Thick</b> <b>Slurry</b> Disposal System, which enables quick consolidation of the slurry once disposed at the ash and red mud pond sites. The project work focuses on the suitability of pond ash and red mud obtained hereby to be used for construction of embankment. The ash and red mud samples are characterized and analyzed for the various geotechnical properties. The various experimental works include in situ density test using core cutter method, Standard Proctor density test to obtain the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content, and specific gravity test. Using the OMC and MDD results, Direct Shear Box test and Triaxial tests of the samples were carried out in 2 -D and 3 -D load conditions to obtain the shear strength parameters, c and Ф. The samples were also tested for their permeability characteristics using both falling head and constant head permeameter to obtain the coefficient of permeability, κ. After characterization of the ash and red mud samples for their individual geotechnical parameters, the samples were mixed in various proportions to get a mix having optimum characteristics. The samples were mixed in the proportions of 90...|$|E
40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the fate of microorganisms in root canals of teeth with infected pulps and periapical bone lesions with and without the use of calcium hydroxide medication. Methodology Endodontic samples were cultured and microorganisms were counted and identified in 4 3 teeth before (sample 1) and after (sample 2) treatment during the first visit and before (sample 3) and after (sample 4) treatment during the second visit. In the first visit teeth were instrumented and half of the teeth were filled with a <b>thick</b> <b>slurry</b> of calcium hydroxide in sterile saline, The other teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and AH- 26 seater. After 4 weeks the teeth with calcium-hydroxide were accessed again and after microbiological sampling they were obturated with gutta-percha and AH- 26 sealer. Results The mean total colony forming unit (CFU) counts of positive samples dropped significantly as a result or canal preparation during the first visit from 1. 0 X 10 (6) to 1. 8 x 10 (3) (between samples 1 and 2) but increased to 9. 3 x 10 (3) in the period between the two visits (sample 2 and 3). There was no difference in mean total CFU counts of positive samples between the end of the first (sample 21) and the end of the second visit (sample 4). The most frequently isolated species were Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga spp [...] Actinomyces odontolyticus, Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus micros. Conclusions Although a calcium hydroxide paste was placed in the prepared canals. the number of positive canals had increased in the period between visits. However, the number of microorganisms had only increased to 0. 93 % of the original number of CFU (sample 1). It is concluded that a calcium hydroxide and sterile saline slurry limits but does not totally prevent regrowth of endodontic bacteria...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{significant}} difficulties before the processing and manufacturing industries is disposal of the lingering waste products. Red mud and pond ash are one of {{the significant}} waste results of any aluminum industry. The red mud sample is collected from Vedanta Aluminum Ltd., Lanjigarh and pond ash sample is collected from Rourkela Steel Plant, Rourkela. They disposed the waste material using the <b>Thick</b> <b>Slurry</b> Disposal System, which empowers fast consolidation of the slurry once disposed at the red mud and pond ash site. The undertaking work concentrates on the suitability of red mud and pond ash obtained are to be utilized for construction of dyke and filling material. Several attempts {{have been made in the}} past for using red mud as design of tailing dam and pond ash as land filling. In the present work, emphasis has been given on application of red mud and pond ash mix as construction of embankment and as filling material. In the present work, initially red mud and pond ash are examined for the different geotechnical properties.
