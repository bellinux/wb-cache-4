The 1562 Loci Communes became a standard textbook in Reformed <b>theological</b> <b>education.</b> He was popular especially with English readers of theology {{in the seventeenth}} century.

More of Vermigli's works were found in the libraries of seventeenth-century Harvard divinity students than those of Calvin.

40|$|An {{international}} {{survey was}} conducted to assess <b>theological</b> higher <b>education</b> via distance learning as perceived by graduates of Trinity College and Theological Seminary's (Trinity) doctoral programs. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine student-perceived strengths and weaknesses of Trinity's doctoral-level distance education theology programs. Also, the future of distance-learning mediated programs of <b>theological</b> higher <b>education</b> was speculated. A random sample of 400 doctoral recipients was selected from the population of 802 doctoral recipients who graduated from Trinity between the years of 1969 and March 1998. A mailed questionnaire was used to collect data. A total of 203 (50. 0 %) were returned. Frequency counts, percentage distributions, and chi-square tests of goodness-of-fit were employed to analyze the data. A profile of the modal type of student who would participate in <b>theological</b> distance <b>education</b> at the doctoral level was developed from the demographic variables queried. Responses to questions regarding respondents' educational experiences and coursework were solicited as well. Respondents identified five primary strengths of Trinity's distance education doctoral programs as: the convenience of the program; the immediate application of course content to personal and professional endeavors; the quality of education provided; the Biblical groundedness of the curricula, the materials, and the faculty; and the required reading and research. The three predominant weaknesses of Trinity's distance education doctoral programs as identified by program graduates include: the lack of interaction between students and faculty; the lack of regional accreditation; and course repetitiveness meaning that some courses offered repeated content from prior studies at a lower educational level. It was concluded that the future of <b>theological</b> higher <b>education</b> via distance learning is promising. Trinity has emerged as a dominant distance learning institution as a result of its continued exploration and advancements. However, Trinity and other similar distance education institutions must continually and consistently evaluate their programs and their students' expectations in an effort to transition <b>theological</b> distance <b>education</b> into the 21 st century...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{prevailing}} notions within American culture {{is the idea that}} women are prevalent in leadership positions within business, politics, and higher education. The reality, however, is that while women make up slightly more than 50 % of the popUlation, we are under-represented in these institutions. There are fewer than 20 female CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies. Women make up only 35 % of the 2009 Congress and as of 2006 represented fewer than 10 % of chief executive officers in <b>theological</b> higher <b>education.</b> The traditional views of <b>theological</b> higher <b>education</b> have been in favor of men {{but the reality is that}} more women are entering ministry and religious-oriented professions. The professional, political, and pastoral landscape is changing in favor of more women. The challenge facing institutions of <b>theological</b> higher <b>education</b> is the development of a model that is reflective of general trends. Much of the current data suggests that women tend to lead from an others-centered paradigm. One of the primary differences between men and women is that collaborative models of leadership characterize the latter. This article will examine collaborative leadership theory as a way of viewing female leadership in <b>theological</b> higher <b>education.</b> I cannot say I think you are very generous to the ladies; for, whilst you are proclaiming peace and good will toward men, emancipating all nations, you insist upon retaining an absolute power over wives. But you must remember that arbitrary power is like most other things which are very hard, very liable to be broken; and, notwithstanding all your wise laws and maxims, we have it in our power, not only to free ourselves, but to subdue our masters, and without violence, throw both your natural and legal authority at your feet (Abigail Adams as cited in Withey, 1981) ...|$|R

25|$|In December 1960, Edward Paget ordained Tutu as an Anglican {{minister}} at St Mary's Cathedral.

He earned 72.50 rand a month, which was two-thirds of what his white counterparts were given. In 1962, Tutu was transferred to St Philip's Church in Thokoza, where he was placed in charge of the congregation and developed a passion for pastoral ministry. Many in South Africa's white-dominated Anglican establishment felt the need for a greater number of indigenous Africans in positions of ecclesiastical authority; to assist in this, Aelfred Stubbs proposed that Tutu be trained as a theology teacher at King's College London (KCL) in Britain. Funding was secured from the International Missionary Council's <b>Theological</b> <b>Education</b> Fund (TEF), and the government agreed to give the Tutus permission to move to Britain.|$|E

25|$|The Elder Sampson had {{converted}} from Anglicanism to Orthodoxy {{at the age}} of 14.

He later became a priest. In 1929 he was arrested again and was released in 1934. He was arrested again in 1936 and sentenced to ten years in prison. He served these years as a prison doctor in Central Asia, and for this reason the authorities did not wish to release him due to the need for his service when his term came to an end in 1946. He escaped and wandered through the desert, while successfully avoiding capture. He went on to do pastoral work without any legal papers. He died in 1979, and was remembered as a saint by those who knew him.|$|E
25|$|In 1795, {{the kings}} of Travancore and Cochin entered into {{tributary}} alliance with the British East Indian Company to repel the attacks from Tipu Sultan. The states soon became client regimes of the Company: both were forced to disband their military. The political order of the states also began to collapse. Saint Thomas Christians were hit hard {{by the loss of}} their privileged military role, their kalari network was dissolved and many families lost their livelihood. The trading class, as well as the office bearers, also suffered the setback and many Europeans who visited the states between 1801 and 1820 noted the poor and depressed condition of Saint Thomas Christians of the Puthiyakoottukar. Some partisan fund allocation for the churches by the British officials triggered a breakdown in the relationship between Saint Thomas Christians and prominent Hindu castes, at least temporarily. In 1815, the British Resident, Colonel John Munro, founded a seminary in Kottayam, for the <b>theological</b> <b>education</b> of Jacobite Christian priests and invited the Anglican missionaries to teach there.
