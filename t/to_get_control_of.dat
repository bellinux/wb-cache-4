5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E

25|$|In 1911-12 the Kreuger family match {{factories}} in Kalmar, Fredriksdal and Mönsterås run {{by his father}} Ernst Kreuger, uncle Fredik Kreuger and his brother Torsten Kreuger, encountered financial problems. Kreuger was then advised by his banker Oscar Rydbeck to turn the {{factories in}}to a stock corporation {{in order to raise}} more capital. This was the starting point for the reformation of the Swedish match industry as well as the major match companies in Norway and Finland.

25|$|The {{methods used}} in a typical pirate attack have been analyzed. They show that while attacks can be {{expected}} at any time, most occur during the day; often in the early hours. They may involve two or more skiffs that can reach speeds of up to 25 knots. With the help of motherships that include captured fishing and merchant vessels, the operating range of the skiffs has been increased far into the Indian Ocean. An attacked vessel is approached from quarter or stern; RPGs and small arms are used to intimidate the operator {{to slow down and}} allow boarding. Light ladders are brought along to climb aboard. Pirates then will try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the bridge to take operational control of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|When a goaltender blocks or stops a {{shot from}} going into his goal net, that action {{is called a}} save. Goalies often use a {{particular}} style, but in general they make saves any way they can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position ('scoring on a rebound'), or to allow the goalie's own team <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the puck. Goalies may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goalie may choose {{to hold on to}} the puck (for a second or more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goalie holds on to the puck for too long without any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute delay of game penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goalies have been restricted as to where they can play the puck behind the net.|$|E
40|$|For {{quite a few}} years, {{scientific}} and technological advances have made commonplace the possibility of encoding information in the modulation of light beams. Several techniques have been investigated to optimise such methods in the temporal domain or in its dual counterpart, i. e. in the radiation spectrum, with a procedure similar to encoding information in our voice. On the other side, encoding information in space is an everyday task we accomplish, with a wealth of technical means, when we "write". It all amounts <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> a homogeneous support, and breaking its translational symmetry with suitable procedures and tools (e. g. a pen {{on a sheet of}} paper, a photographic impression on a photosensitive surface) [...] . ...|$|R
