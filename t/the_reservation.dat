40|$|The article {{proposes a}} new reading of <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> regime {{to human rights}} treaties. The {{practice}} developed by states in relation to <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> regime is analysed and presented as a constitution-making process.

However, the article also proposes a wide reading of the practice of <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> dialogue using examples from the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Based on this analysis, the author formulates some proposals as to a more adequate development of <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> dialogue and <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> regime. A development which will favour the formation of inclusive international human rights as a basis for a future international constitution accepted as legitimate by all members of the international community...|$|R

5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} located on <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> The Court {{ruled that the}} state {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E
5|$|A {{settlement}} {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made a more accurate survey of <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} east bank that {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. His plan was to stake a pre-emption claim at the falls. However, Franklin Steele also had plans to stake a claim. On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to the falls, built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's claim, as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} (1889), <b>the</b> White Earth <b>Reservation</b> covered 1,093 sq. mi.

It was located in the northeast part of <b>the</b> White Earth <b>Reservation</b> and was only a fraction of the original size. All other Minnesota Chippewa reservations were closed and emptied of Native Americans. The rebellion which occurred on <b>the</b> Leech Lake <b>Reservation</b> in 1898 saved Minnesota's Chippewa <b>reservations,</b> including <b>the</b> White Earth <b>Reservation</b> and probably <b>the</b> Red Lake <b>Reservation,</b> and <b>the</b> Chippewa <b>reservations</b> of Wisconsin.|$|R

The relatively peaceful Wichita Indians on <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> were targets of the hostile Indians because of their increasing positive status under pacification.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v.

In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed to the site of <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game.

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
