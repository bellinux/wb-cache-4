5|$|The {{state has}} always been a {{destination}} for mountaineering, hiking, and rock climbing in India. A recent development in adventure tourism in the region has been whitewater rafting in Rishikesh. Due to its proximity to the Himalaya ranges, the place is full of hills and mountains and is suitable for <b>trekking,</b> climbing, skiing, camping, rock climbing, and paragliding. Roopkund is a <b>trekking</b> site, known for the mysterious skeletons found in a lake, which was featured by National Geographic Channel in a documentary.

5|$|In {{the past}} Mérens horses {{were used for}} farm work, {{particularly}} on steep or difficult terrain, as packhorses and for draft work in mining or hauling timber or sledges. Today, following breeding selection towards a slightly taller and livelier type, they are used principally as saddle horses, especially for <b>trekking</b> in mountainous areas; but have also proved successful in carriage driving. Some {{have been used for}} vaulting, dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing.|$|E
5|$|Mount Guiting-Guiting in Sibuyan, the province's tallest mountain, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most difficult climbs in the Philippines, and is thus a major destination of local mountain climbers because of its steep and jagged summit.

Smith spent three months working with the local resistance movement before <b>trekking</b> westwards, across the Maritime Alps, with three other Allied personnel, hoping to join up with the Allied forces that had just invaded southern France.

5|$|To {{increase}} their incomes, many farmers have diversified; {{the average income}} from non-farming business activities on farms in Wales in 2013/2014 was £4,900. Tourism-related activities accounted for much of this; these included bed and breakfast accommodation, self-catering accommodation in redundant outbuildings or purpose-built units, bunkhouses for walkers and provision of food-related services in cafés, restaurants, farm shops, pick-your-own and farmer's markets. Indoor and outdoor leisure and recreational facilities are provided by some farmers including paint-balling, laser-combat games, pony <b>trekking,</b> mountain biking and many other activities. Caravans, camp sites and parking provide alternative uses for land, and wind turbines can provide extra income from land still farmed in the normal way.|$|E

5|$|Finnhorses {{are popular}} as {{recreational}} riding horses, and well-suited for use at riding schools, <b>trekking,</b> and riding therapy. Of the ten horses currently {{employed by the}} mounted police of Helsinki, two are Finnhorses, though they are considered a bit small for the job. They are also competitive in many disciplines, and in the 1970s separate competition classes for Finnhorses were established at horse shows, which also helped to increase {{the popularity of the}} breed. While in eventing and horse racing, Finnhorses are too slow to compete directly against Thoroughbreds and the sport horse breeds, they are a highly reliable mount for cross-country riding, particularly over difficult terrain; during the Continuation War, the breed successfully crossed any wetland with which it was confronted. In endurance riding. Uusi-Helinä, ridden by Ritva Lampinen, successfully finished the endurance riding world championship competition in Stockholm, Sweden in 1990, finishing 28th.|$|E

40|$|Two-pore domain {{potassium}} (K 2 P) channels modulate neuronal excitability {{throughout the}} entire CNS. The stretch-activated channel <b>TREK</b> 1 (K 2 P 2. 1) is expressed widely in brain and {{has been linked to}} depression, neuroprotection, pain perception, and epilepsy. Little, however, is known about the regulation of <b>TREK</b> 1 expression on the transcriptional and translational level or about its trafficking to the plasma membrane. Here we have used PCR techniques to identify a splice variant of <b>TREK</b> 1 expressed in the brain, which encodes a heavily truncated <b>TREK</b> 1 protein retaining a single transmembrane domain. Functional expression of this splice variant <b>TREK</b> 1 ΔEx 4 in tsA 201 cells in {{the presence or absence of}} wild type <b>TREK</b> 1 revealed that <b>TREK</b> 1 ΔEx 4 has no channel activity itself but reduced <b>TREK</b> 1 whole cell current amplitude. Confocal analysis of the expression of fluorescently tagged <b>TREK</b> 1 variants revealed that <b>TREK</b> 1 ΔEx 4 is translated, but it is retained in the intracellular compartment. Additionally, <b>TREK</b> 1 ΔEx 4 reduced the level of <b>TREK</b> 1 expression in the plasma membrane. Long and short forms of <b>TREK</b> 1 derived from alternative translation initiation are differentially affected by <b>TREK</b> 1 ΔEx 4, with the short form (lacking the first 41 amino acids at its N terminus) unaffected. This differential regulatory role of <b>TREK</b> 1 ΔEx 4 will alter the functional profile of <b>TREK</b> 1 current in neurons where they are expressed. These results indicate that the N-terminal domain and first transmembrane domain of <b>TREK</b> 1 are likely to be important for channel dimerization and trafficking to the plasma membrane...|$|R
50|$|In 1990 <b>Trek</b> {{developed}} a new category of bicycle that combined the comfort features of a mountain bike with the quick ride of a road bike: MultiTracks, <b>Trek's</b> first line of hybrid bikes, were born.

In addition to showcasing a full line of <b>Trek</b> products, the <b>Trek</b> Store served as a hands-on sales training center for employees from <b>Trek's</b> headquarters who lacked retail experience.

5|$|In November 2003, Webber {{organised}} and {{competed in}} a 10-day trek across Tasmania {{to raise funds}} for children's cancer research charities. Starting in Marrawah on the state's west coast, the trek involved 1,000km of cycling, kayaking and <b>trekking</b> along the southern coast and finished at Coles Bay in the east. Four teams of four competitors each started the trek, with only two teams (including Webber's) completing the entire journey. Along the way, Australian sporting stars Pat Rafter (tennis), Steve Waugh (cricket), Cathy Freeman (athletics), James Tomkins (rowing), Guy Andrews (iron man), and actor Joel Edgerton completed certain parts of the trek. The challenge concluded with a black tie dinner and auction to raise funds.
