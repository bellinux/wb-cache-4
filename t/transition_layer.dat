We use a different method to prove {{the existence of a}} single pulse. The existence of multiple spikes and <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> is a new result. The new method is a topological shooting plan consisting of various shooting arguments. The main technical advance of this plan is that it provides a setup for proving the existence of not only a single pulse, but also multiple spikes and <b>transition</b> <b>layers.</b> The proof of the existence of spikes and <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> involves more delicate estimates in order to assure the existence of certain types of solutions necessary in the topological shooting arguments.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{singularly}} perturbed reaction diffusion equation in degenerate spatially inhomogeneous media. We introduce bifurcation parameter into the spatial inhomogeneity {{to study the}} similarities and the differences of bifurcation of <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> and bifurcation of the zeros of the spatial inhomogeneity. Liapunov-Schmidt reduction technique is the main tool {{to the construction of}} equilibrium layers as a perturbation of some good approximate solution {{in the direction of the}} principal eigenfunction. Reduced bifurcation equation is the pivotal equation to prove the existence of bifurcation of <b>transition</b> <b>layers.</b> The derivation of the reduced bifurcation relies on careful study of a singularly perturbed linearized eigenvalue problem. Even though, it is found that the form of the reduced bifurcation equation inherits mostly from the form of the spatial inhomogeneity, there are subtle differences between the two. We have found explicit examples where bifurcation of <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> and that of zeros of the spatial inhomogeneity are different in terms of imperfectness. For the <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> problem, there are at least two natural ways to introduce imperfectness. One way is through adding higher-order variations to spatial inhomogeneity. Imperfectness comes into higher dimensional reaction diffusion problem naturally even if spatial inhomogeneity is radially symmetric, perfect pitchfork normal form. ...|$|R
40|$|The weakly {{nonlinear}} {{development of}} large-amplitude Goertler vortices {{in a small}} neighborhood of the neutral stability position given by the linear theory is considered. It is shown that if the basic state and the wall curvature satisfy a certain condition, the Goertler vortices will grow until they become so large as to drive a mean flow correction {{as large as the}} basic state. Attention is then given to the further downstream evolution of these large-amplitude vortices, and it is shown that the vortices have a triple layer structure which consists of a region of vortex activity bounded by two <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> over which the amplitude of the harmonic part of the vortex decays to zero exponentially. The positions of the two <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> are found to be governed by a free boundary problem, which is solved for a number of curvature distribution cases.

40|$|The use of {{chemical}} vapor deposition diamond as a substrate for gallium nitride (GaN) to form GaN- on-diamond {{has the potential to}} allow for higher linear power densities in GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). The increase in GaN HEMT power density on diamond has been limited to date by the electrical leakage in GaN-on-diamond substrates.

40|$|Applied MathematicsIn this article, we {{consider}} a convection-diffusion equation {{with a small}} diffusion coefficient. It is a version of a linearized Navier-Stokes equation. Due to the small parameter multiplied to the highest order of differential operators, the so-called turning point <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> are displayed where flows in opposite directions collide. For example, a turning point can be observed where the Kuroshio and Kurile Currents meet, from opposite directions, in the North Pacific. Unlike boundary <b>layers,</b> turning point <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> occur where the convective flows collide and more delicate analysis is necessitated. Especially, {{we consider}} a single turning point with multiple-orders in one-dimensional spaces and provide sharp estimations for the solution with compatible conditions. A main difficulty when solving the problem arises {{from the fact that}} the diffusion coefficient is very small in comparison with other terms and it causes a singularity in the solution. We use the asymptotic analysis that is different from typical methods in the singular perturbation problem considered here. The matching technique has been typically used, but this method brings about the difficulty in constructing a globally matched solution. Our method is relatively easy to analyze, and turning point <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> are systematically and easily constructed. ope...|$|R
40|$|The {{ratio of}} the {{emission}} line fluxes for the C II and C IV lines in the lower transition regions (T = 30, 000 to 100, 000 K) between stellar chromospheres and <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> is shown to depend mainly on the temperature gradient in the line emitting regions which can therefore be determined from this line ratio. From the observed constant (within the limits of observational error) {{ratio of the}} emission line fluxes of the C II (1335 A) and C IV (1550 A) lines it is concluded that the temperature gradients in the lower <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> are similar for {{the large majority of}} stars independently of T sub eff, L, and degree of activity. This means that the temperature dependence of the damping length for the mechanical flux must be the same for all these stars. Since for different kinds of mechanical fluxes the dependence of the damping length on gas pressure and temperature is quite different, it is concluded that the same heating mechanism must be responsible for the heating of all the lower <b>transition</b> <b>layers</b> of these stars, regardless of their chromospheric activity.
