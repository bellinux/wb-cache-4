40|$|An {{increasing}} concern affecting {{a growing}} aging population is working memory (WM) decline. Consequently, {{there is great}} interest in improving or stabilizing WM, which drives expanded use of brain training exercises. Such regimens generally result in temporary WM benefits to the trained tasks but minimal <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> to untrained tasks. Pairing training with neurostimulation may stabilize or improve WM performance by enhancing plasticity and strengthening WM-related cortical networks. We tested this possibility in healthy older adults. Participants received 10 sessions of sham (control) or active (anodal, 1. 5 mA) tDCS to the right prefrontal, parietal, or prefrontal/parietal (alternating) cortices. After ten minutes of sham or active tDCS, participants performed verbal and visual WM training tasks. On the first, tenth, and follow-up sessions, participants performed transfer WM tasks including the spatial 2 -back, Stroop, and digit span tasks. The results demonstrated that all groups benefited from WM training, as expected. However, at follow-up 1 -month after training ended, only {{the participants in the}} active tDCS groups maintained significant improvement. Importantly, this pattern was observed for both trained and transfer tasks. These results demonstrate that tDCS-linked WM training can provide long-term benefits in maintaining cognitive training benefits and extending them to untrained tasks...|$|E

40|$|Hearing aids (HAs) only {{partially}} restore {{the ability of}} older hearing impaired (OHI) listeners to understand speech in noise, {{due in large part}} to persistent deficits in consonant identification. Here, we investigated whether adaptive perceptual training would improve consonant-identification in noise in sixteen aided OHI listeners who underwent 40 hours of computer-based training in their homes. Listeners identified 20 onset and 20 coda consonants in 9, 600 consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) syllables containing different vowels (/ɑ/, /i/, or /u/) and spoken by four different talkers. Consonants were presented at three consonant-specific signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) spanning a 12 dB range. Noise levels were adjusted over training sessions based on d' measures. Listeners were tested before and after training to measure (1) changes in consonant-identification thresholds using syllables spoken by familiar and unfamiliar talkers, and (2) sentence reception thresholds (SeRTs) using two different sentence tests. Consonant-identification thresholds improved gradually during training. Laboratory tests of d' thresholds showed an average improvement of 9. 1 dB, with 94 % of listeners showing statistically significant training benefit. Training normalized consonant confusions and improved the thresholds of some consonants into the normal range. Benefits were equivalent for onset and coda consonants, syllables containing different vowels, and syllables presented at different SNRs. Greater training benefits were found for hard-to-identify consonants and for consonants spoken by familiar than unfamiliar talkers. SeRTs, tested with simple sentences, showed less elevation than consonant-identification thresholds prior to training and failed to show significant training benefit, although SeRT improvements did correlate with improvements in consonant thresholds. We argue that the lack of SeRT improvement reflects the dominant role of top-down semantic processing in processing simple sentences and that greater <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> would be evident in the comprehension of more unpredictable speech material...|$|E
40|$|Unilateral neglect is a {{disabling}} syndrome frequently observed following {{right hemisphere}} brain damage. Symptoms range from visuo-motor impairments through to deficient visuo-spatial imagery, but impairment can also affect the auditory modality. A {{short period of}} adaptation to a rightward prismatic shift of the visual field is known to improve {{a wide range of}} hemispatial neglect symptoms, including visuo-manual tasks, mental imagery, postural imbalance, visuo-verbal measures and number bisection. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess whether the beneficial effects of prism adaptation may generalize to auditory manifestations of neglect. Auditory extinction, whose clinical manifestations are independent of the sensory modalities engaged in visuo-manual adaptation, was examined in neglect patients before and after prism adaptation. Two separate groups of neglect patients (all of whom exhibited left auditory extinction) underwent prism adaptation: one group (n = 6) received a classical prism treatment ('Prism' group), the other group (n = 6) was submitted to the same procedure, but wore neutral glasses creating no optical shift (placebo 'Control' group). Auditory extinction was assessed by means of a dichotic listening task performed three times: prior to prism exposure (pre-test), upon prism removal (0 h post-test) and 2 h later (2 h post-test). The total number of correct responses, the lateralization index (detection asymmetry between the two ears) and the number of left-right fusion errors were analysed. Our results demonstrate that prism adaptation can improve left auditory extinction, thus revealing <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> to a sensory modality that is orthogonal to the visual, proprioceptive and motor modalities directly implicated in the visuo-motor adaptive process. The observed benefit was specific to the detection asymmetry between the two ears and did not affect the total number of responses. This indicates a specific effect of prism adaptation on lateralized processes rather than on general arousal. Our results suggest that the effects of prism adaptation can extend to unexposed sensory systems. The bottom-up approach of visuo-motor adaptation appears to interact with higher order brain functions related to multisensory integration and can have beneficial effects on sensory processing in different modalities. These findings should stimulate the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at bypassing the affected sensory processing modality by adapting other sensory modalities. © The Author 2010...|$|E

METHODS A cross-sectional study with a sample of 132 families from the Metropolitan Region, Chile, stratified according to degree of social vulnerability, between September 2011 and January 2012. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with mothers of the studied families in public health facilities or their households. The variables studied were family structure, psychosocial risk in the family context and integrated benefits from the welfare system in families that fulfill the necessary requirements for <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> Descriptive statistics to measure location and dispersion were calculated. A binary logistic regression, which accounts for the sample size of the study, was carried out. RESULTS The groups were homogenous regarding family size, the presence of biological father in the household, the number of relatives living in the same dwelling, income generation capacity and the rate of dependency and psychosocial risk (p &# 8805; 0. 05). The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> was low in all three groups of the sample (&# 8804; 23. 0 %). The benefit with the best coverage in the system was the Single Family Subsidy, whose transfer was associated with the size of the family, the presence of relatives in the dwelling, the absence of the father in the household, a high rate of dependency and a high income generation capacity (p &# 8804; 0. 10). CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>transfer</b> was poor, especially in families that were extremely socially vulnerable.

30|$|Taking a {{close look}} at Table  1, we can see that new economic, social, and {{educational}} opportunities and benefits derived from integration into global markets have to be weighed against the risks of dependency, loss of control, and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> to third parties, such as traders in regional and global markets, particularly for the most vulnerable groups (such as marginal pastoralists and labour migrants). Orienting production towards global markets is risky for modern pastoralists primarily because market structures are designed to respond to cash and not the needs of the most vulnerable or ‘cashless’ members of society (Brinkman et al. 2009; Christian 2010; Darmon and Ferguson 2002). As such, integration into the market forces the poor to incur greater risk than they would under a system of subsistence only production. For example, producing milk for home consumption requires fewer labour inputs than producing steers for slaughter (Dietz et al. 2001) but is similarly subject to external shocks, such as drought (McPeak 2004).|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} are considering {{the option of}} reducing the share of mandatory health insurance (MHI) and to increasingly rely on voluntary (supplementary) health insurance (VHI) schemes to cover health care expenditures. It is well-known that competitive markets for VHI tend to risk-rated premiums. After discussing the determinants of riskrating in competitive VHI markets, we provide empirical evidence of the potential reduction of (risk-) solidarity caused by the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> from MHI to VHI coverage. For this purpose, we simulate several scenarios in which benefits covered by MHI are transferred to competitive markets for VHI. We use a dataset issued by the largest insurer in the Netherlands, in order to calculate the potential premium range for VHI resulting from this transfer. Our findings show that, by adding risk-factors, the minimum VHI premium decreases while the maximum increases. Moreover, we observe that risk-rating primarily affects the maximum premium. The reduction of solid arity is especially substantial for benefits such as medical devices and drugs. Finally we discuss some options to maintain a socially acceptable level of solidarity in VHI markets. solidarity, competition, risk-rating, supplementary health insurance, risk-adjustment. ...|$|R

Considering {{that there are a}} plethora of devices for stair climbing, how does a person decide which apparatus to use? Aside from issues of practicality, much of the decision could be based on the principles of specificity of training. That is, for maximum <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> from one activity to another, the activities should be compatible in the usage of energy systems, muscle groups, and patterns of coordination. As for the first two criteria of specificity, the choice is simple: Almost all stair climbing devices are beneficial to the aerobic energy system and the leg extensor muscles. However, for the criterion of coordination, the choice may be more difficult. First, the reasons for exercising on stairs are diverse: They can range from cross-training for the serious athlete who wishes to gain a competitive advantage to reconditioning for the injured or elderly person who wishes to safely negotiate the staircase at home.

Fuel treatments can occur in the landscape or adjacent to houses. Location of the prescribed burns can significantly alter the risk of house loss.

One way to {{lower the cost of}} electricity is to move consumption from peak price hours to low price hours, a sort of inter-temporal substitution were the net energy use is unaffected. By simulating one example of inter-temporal substitution in the Swedish spot market during 2008 - 2010, we show that the general welfare effects are small in terms of a more efficient energy production, but that the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> resources from producers to consumers is large. Whether the welfare effect is positive or negative is highly dependent on future electricity prices, the introduction of renewable energy resources, and the price of the new technology needed for the demand side regulation.

By contrast, {{in this paper we}} look at the governance of sovereign wealth funds {{from the perspective of the}} competing political interests embedded in the sponsor—the domestic political claims on funds and the principles and practice of governance used to discipline those interests in favour of a long-term perspective that emphasizes the conservation of wealth and the intergenerational <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> It is noted that there is an ever-present temptation that faces the nation-state sponsors of sovereign wealth funds: the option of spending the assets for current political advantage and legitimacy.
