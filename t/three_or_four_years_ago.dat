[...] Gareth McLean from The Guardian said the use of [...] "Peggy's Theme" [...] was a [...] "suitably sentimental sendoff" [...] for the character, but said that [...] "in hindsight, Peggy should have left Walford <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> her character trapped in a cycle of increasingly samey stories that reduced her to a parody of her former self", describing her efforts {{to put out the}} flames as [...] "like a very sooty clockwork mouse". James McCarthy of Welsh newspaper Western Mail said Windsor's [...] "final emotional scene will doubtless remain the stuff of EastEnders legend for years to come," [...] and Jim Shelley from the Daily Mirror said [...] "It was a good way to go." [...] However, Shelley's colleague Polly Hudson said Peggy's exit was a [...] "non event", as [...] "Peggy just left, nonsensically and at complete odds with everything we've learnt about her character over the last 15 years." ...|$|E

60|$|This was {{the last}} drachm {{required}} to turn the scale of her indecision. Declare the past to him {{by word of mouth}} she could not; but there was another way.

6000|$|I was {{surprised}} to hear a queer sort of laugh, and saw Davidson standing unsteadily {{in the middle of}} the room, with a dazzled look on his face. My first impression was that he was drunk. He did not notice me. He was clawing out at something invisible a yard in front of his face.

Many a shilling had he been paid for the nests he found, but in a few years the birds became rare; and he added that he had not now seen one for a very long time.|$|E

60|$|Muriel did not answer.

60|$|In the morning, having fairly scudded {{before the}} gale, we arrived {{by the middle}} of the day at the Sauce posta. On the road we saw great numbers of deer, and near the {{mountain}} a guanaco. The plain, which abuts against the Sierra, is traversed by some curious gulleys, of which one was about twenty feet wide, and at least thirty deep; we were obliged in consequence to make a considerable circuit before we could find a pass. We stayed the night at the posta, the conversation, as was generally the case, being about the Indians. The Sierra Ventana was formerly a great place of resort; and <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> there was much fighting there.

They cost fifteen and twenty dollars; and girls that I know have one or two every season, besides all sorts of quilled and embroidered and ruffled and tucked and flounced ones.

Coming from Berwickshire in {{the mail}} coach he met with a {{passenger}} who seemed more like a military man than anything else. They talked on all sorts of subjects, at length on politics.

[...] This gentleman had got engaged in the radical business (the only real gentleman by the way who did), and harangued the weavers of Dundee with such emphasis that he would have been tried and sent to Botany Bay had he not fled abroad. He was outlawed, and only restored to his status on a composition with Government. It seems to have escaped Mr. Kinloch that the conduct of a man who places a lighted coal in the middle of combustibles, and upon the floor, is a little different from that of one who places the same quantity of burning fuel in a fire-grate![298] ...|$|E
