2500|$|In 1951, E. W. Kettering wrote a {{paper for}} <b>the</b> <b>ASME</b> entitled, History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine, which goes into great {{detail about the}} {{technical}} obstacles that were encountered during {{the development of the}} 567 engine (these same considerations apply to the 645 and 710). The 567's designers started with a tabula rasa,"In time most of the early bugs were cleaned up, but it was becoming more evident that to make a substantial gain in the durability of the 201A engine a major redesign would be in order. The diesel locomotive was rapidly proving itself and to the more optimistic it looked like {{it was going to be}} a good business, so it was decided that the engine would be redesigned for railroad use only. The design would not be handicapped by requirements for marine, Navy, or stationary application. Most of the Winton experimental design group moved to Detroit where the redesign was to be made. After settling in Detroit we took a large piece of paper and on one side wrote down all of the troubles which were known in the 201A engine at that time. On the other side we were going to write down parts of the engine which had been satisfactory. These items were based on the four years experience in the field and the test work at Winton and General Motors Research. It did not take long to fill in one side of the sheet. In fact, the more we looked into what we could salvage of the 201A design to correct all of these troubles the more apparent it was that we should start with a clean piece of paper and forget the 201A." [...] systematically eliminating each of the 201A's many deficiencies which were preventing the earlier design from becoming successful in freight service, although the 201A was relatively successful in the less-demanding passenger and switching services. The 567 design had nothing in common with the 201A except the two-stroke cycle itself: each and every component of the 201A was replaced with a new design, even the [...] "dipstick", to paraphrase one of Kettering's off-handed comments. The 567 proved to be exceptionally successful in passenger, switching, freight, marine and stationary services, and, counting its two successors, the 645 and 710, which are not materially different from the 567 (all have the same external dimensions, differing mainly in per cylinder displacement), collectively have given nearly 80 years of exceptionally reliable service to those applications. As but one example of the achievements of the tabula rasa design: whereas the Winton 201A was doing very well with a [...] piston lifetime, the 567 immediately achieved a [...] piston lifetime, and in at least one case, reached a [...] piston lifetime, a 10:1 to 20:1 improvement."A brief comparison can be drawn as to life of pistons in passenger service. These comparisons must be based on passenger operation as there never were any 201As in any other service than passenger and switcher. The 201A aluminum piston at the very beginning did not run 50,000 miles and the later 201A pistons ran a questionable 100,000 miles in hard service. The average life of the first 567 piston was in the range of 400,000 to 500,000. On one major railroad the average life of the current design two-piece piston is at least one million miles (Fig. 24)." ...|$|E
