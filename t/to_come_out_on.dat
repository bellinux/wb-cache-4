5|$|The {{game was}} delayed {{numerous}} times before its actual release. Work {{on the game}} was extended because the development staff wanted to perfect the game due to high expectations from the fans and because the team only consisted of about 35 people. Before its release, it was ranked as the most wanted game in Japan and Square, knowing about Dragon Quest VII's release, moved Final Fantasy IX <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a later date. Horii stated {{in an interview that}} the team focused more on puzzle solving than the game's story. Being the first game in the series to include 3D graphics, the team was also initially reluctant to include CG movies and cinematics due to letters written to Enix by fans fearing that doing so would change the overall feeling of the series.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} revolutionary {{products}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the market was the company's disposable Pampers diaper, first test-marketed in 1961, the same year Procter & Gamble came out with Head & Shoulders. Prior to this point, disposable diapers were not popular, although Johnson & Johnson had developed a product called Chux. Babies always wore cloth diapers, which were leaky and labor-intensive to wash. Pampers provided a convenient alternative, albeit at the environmental cost of more waste requiring landfilling.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, EastEnders {{clashed with}} Coronation Street {{for the first}} time. EastEnders won the battle with 8.4 million viewers (41% share) whilst Coronation Street lagged behind with 7.3 million viewers (34 percent share). On 21 September 2004, Louise Berridge, the then {{executive}} producer, quit following criticism of the show. The following day the show received its lowest ever ratings at that time (6.2 million) when ITV scheduled an hour-long episode of Emmerdale against it. Emmerdale was watched by 8.1 million people. The poor ratings motivated the press into reporting viewers were bored with implausible and ill-thought-out storylines. Under new producers, EastEnders and Emmerdale continued to clash at times, and Emmerdale tended <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top, giving EastEnders lower than average ratings. In 2006, EastEnders regularly attracted between 8 and 12 million viewers in official ratings. EastEnders received its second lowest ratings on 17 May 2007, when 4.0 million viewers tuned in. This was also the lowest ever audience share, with just 19.6 percent. This was attributed to a conflicting one hour special episode of Emmerdale on ITV1. However, ratings for the 10pm EastEnders repeat on BBC Three reached an all-time high of 1.4 million. However, {{there have been times}} when EastEnders had higher ratings than Emmerdale despite the two going head-to-head.|$|E

[...] Van Peebles stated that [...] "story-wise, I {{came up with an}} idea, why not the direct approach.

[...] Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times called the song [...] "catchy [...] makes you want to grab some glow sticks and hit the clubs" [...] and added that the Femme Fatale era [...] "already shows an undeniably more confident Spears."

2500|$|Starting on September 1, Gould and Fisk {{put their}} plot into motion by {{purchasing}} $1.5 million in {{gold in the}} names of Corbin and Butterfield. The two conspirators would make $15,000 ($263,000 in 2016) for every dollar rise in gold. By September 6, the price of gold had risen by $4.50 to $137 an ounce.
