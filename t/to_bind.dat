5|$|Advancements in {{computer}} modeling have allowed scientists to identify compounds that can treat prion-caused diseases, {{such as one}} compound found <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> a cavity in the PrPC and stabilize the conformation, {{reducing the amount of}} harmful PrPSc.|$|E
5|$|For {{about the}} next –, the excess {{electrons}} remained too energetic <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> with atomic nuclei. What followed is a period known as recombination, when neutral atoms were formed and the expanding universe became transparent to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have been}} identified <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> cNTnC with low affinity and act as troponin activators: DFBP-O (a structural analog of levosimendan), 4-(4-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-3-pyridinamine (NCI147866), and bepridil. The calmodulin antagonist, W7, has also been found <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> to cNTnC {{to act as a}} troponin inhibitor. All of these compounds bind to the hydrophobic patch in the open conformation of cNTnC, with troponin activators promoting interaction with the cTnI switch peptide and troponin inhibitors destabilizing the interaction.|$|E
50|$|Carbohydrate-binding module family 49 (CBM49) {{is found}} at the C-terminal of cellulases and in vitro binding studies have shown it <b>to</b> <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> {{crystalline}} cellulose.|$|R
50|$|Several {{regulatory}} sequences in the promoter {{region of}} the human insulin gene <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> transcription factors. In general, the A-boxes <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> Pdx1 factors, E-boxes <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> NeuroD, C-boxes <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> MafA, and cAMP response elements to CREB. There are also silencers that inhibit transcription.|$|R
50|$|The C-terminal SH3 domain <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> {{peptides}} {{conforming to}} a P-X-I/L/V/-D/N-R-X-X-K-P motif that allows it <b>to</b> specifically <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> proteins such as Gab-1.|$|R
5|$|The medical {{management}} of iron toxicity is complicated, and can include {{use of a}} specific chelating agent called deferoxamine <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> and expel excess iron from the body.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is not necessary <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> the trustee's hands.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
5000|$|NGF <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> TrkA, BDNF and NT-4 <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> TrkB and NT-3 <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> TrkC. In {{addition}} NT-3 also <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> and activates TrkA and TrkB {{but it does}} so less efficiently.|$|R
50|$|ESAT-6 {{has been}} shown <b>to</b> {{directly}} <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the TLR2 receptor, inhibiting downstream signal transduction.|$|R
5000|$|Cromolyn is {{also being}} tested as a drug to treat insulin-induced lipoatrophy. [...] Cromolyn is also known <b>to</b> <b>binds</b> S100P protein and {{disrupts}} the interaction with RAGE.|$|R
5|$|Damage to DNA {{alters the}} spatial {{configuration}} of the helix, and such alterations can be detected by the cell. Once damage is localized, specific DNA repair molecules bind {{at or near the}} site of damage, inducing other molecules <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> and form a complex that enables the actual repair to take place.|$|E
5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|In some enzymes, no {{amino acids}} are {{directly}} involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> and orient catalytic cofactors. Enzyme structures may also contain allosteric sites where the binding of a small molecule causes a conformational change that increases or decreases activity.|$|E
5000|$|STING is an {{endoplasmic}} reticulum resident protein {{and has been}} shown <b>to</b> directly <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> {{a variety of different}} cyclic-di-nucleotides.|$|R

5000|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon (PAH), when activated <b>to</b> diol-epoxides can <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> DNA and form adducts.|$|R
5|$|Several {{copies of}} his death mask were made and a replica of one is still held at Moyse's Hall Museum. Artefacts from the trial, {{some of which were}} in Corder's possession, are also held at the museum. Another replica death mask is kept in the dungeons of Norwich Castle. Corder's skin was tanned by surgeon George Creed and used <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> an account of the murder.|$|E
5|$|The {{object in}} view is to {{ascertain}} whether the Crown has such an interest in that which would be interfered with if the provision in question were held <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> the corporation that the interference would be, for a legal reason, an interference with some right, interest, power, authority, privilege, immunity or purpose belonging or appertaining to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|These {{symptoms}} may {{be severe}} enough to warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and activated charcoal may be administered early on <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> residual toxin. Intravenous fluids may be required if dehydration has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly. Once gastric contents are emptied, metoclopramide {{may be used in}} cases of recurrent vomiting.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of binding domains include Zinc finger, which <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> DNA, and EF hand, which <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> calcium.|$|R
5000|$|Hanatoxin <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> {{several types}} of {{voltage-gated}} ion channels. While the affinity is the highest for the Kv2.1 and Kv4.2 channels, {{it has been shown}} that the toxin may also <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> α1A voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (...) [...] Hanatoxin <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the S3-S4 link of K+ channel-subunits, specifically the S3b segment ( [...] , [...] ), and may <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> multiple subunits in a single ion channel [...]|$|R
50|$|IF2 <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> an {{initiator}} tRNA {{and controls}} {{the entry of}} tRNA onto the ribosome. IF2, bound <b>to</b> GTP, <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the 30S P site. After associating with the 30S subunit, fMet-tRNAf <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the IF2 then IF2 transfers the tRNA into the partial P site. When the 50S subunit joins, it hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and Pi, causing a conformational change in the IF2 that causes IF2 to release and allow the 70S subunit to form.|$|R
5|$|Uranium hexfluoride is {{a highly}} {{corrosive}} substance. It is an oxidant and a Lewis acid which is able <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> to fluoride. It reacts with water to form a solid compound, and {{is very difficult to}} handle on an industrial scale.|$|E
5|$|When a T-cell {{encounters}} a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor. This {{is essentially a}} signaling device that allows the T-cell <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> to the active form of vitamin D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|While diving, {{the emperor}} penguin's oxygen use is {{markedly}} reduced, as its heart rate {{is reduced to}} as low as 15–20 beats per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. Its haemoglobin and myoglobin are able <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in loss of consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|In liver cells, {{adrenaline}} <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the β adrenergic receptor, which changes conformation {{and helps}} Gs, a G protein, exchange GDP to GTP. This trimeric G protein dissociates to Gs alpha and Gs beta/gamma subunits. Gs alpha <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> adenyl cyclase, thus converting ATP into cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A: Protein kinase A phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase. Meanwhile, Gs beta/gamma <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the calcium channel and allows calcium ions {{to enter the}} cytoplasm. Calcium ions <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> calmodulin proteins, a protein present in all eukaryotic cells, which then <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> phosphorylase kinase and finishes its activation. Phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, which then phosphorylates glycogen and converts it to glucose-6-phosphate.|$|R
50|$|The N-terminal SH3 domain <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> proline-rich {{peptides}} and can <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the Ras-guanine exchange factor SOS.|$|R
2500|$|Type III nuclear receptors (principally NR {{subfamily}} 2) {{are similar}} to type I receptors in that both classes <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> DNA as homodimers. [...] However, type III nuclear receptors, in contrast <b>to</b> type I, <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> direct repeat instead of inverted repeat HREs.|$|R
5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind {{in the active}} site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, {{but it seems}} to involve conformational changes in complex I that cause the protein <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E
50|$|Prokaryotic {{initiation}} factor-2 <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> an initiator tRNA {{and controls}} {{the entry of}} that tRNA into the ribosome. IF2, bound <b>to</b> GTP, <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the 30S P site. After associating with the 30S subunit, fMet-tRNAf <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the IF2 then IF2 transfers the tRNA into the partial P site. When the 50S subunit joins, it hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and Pi, causing a conformational change in the IF2 that causes IF2 to release and allow the 70S subunit to form.|$|R
50|$|Compared <b>to</b> levetiracetam, which <b>binds</b> at {{the same}} site, seletracetam <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> SV2A with ten times higher affinity.|$|R
50|$|Mirror-image phage {{display is}} a similar method {{that can be used}} to screen large {{libraries}} of D-peptides that <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> target L-proteins. More precisely,since D-peptides can not be expressed in bacteriophages, mirror-image phage display screens L-peptides that <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> immobilized D-proteins that are previously chemically synthesized. Because of the mirror properties of D-peptides, the D-enantiomer of an L-peptide that <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> a D-protein will <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the L-protein.|$|R
