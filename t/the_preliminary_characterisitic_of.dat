It is shown that string spectra from lattice simulations are consistent with universal predictions of the leading operators from the derivative expansion of a Poincare invariant effective string Lagrangian with reparameterization symmetry.

In the Plains region, this probability is increasing in land under cultivation, ethnically based social affiliations and consultative norms. Overall, these results, which are robust after testing for the likely reverse causality of land under cultivation, support the finding that ethnically based and participatory social affiliations act as forms of social capital in the adoption decision. social capital, technology adoption, Tanzania...|$|R

The nonlinear dynamics of the cavitation bubbles are modeled by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.

Two different flow regimes are found from the steady state solutions and are termed: quasi-steady and quasi-unsteady.

The quasi-unsteady solutions correspond to flashing flow. Bifurcation occurs as the flow transitions from one regime to the other.
