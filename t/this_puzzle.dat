25|$|In popular culture, <b>this</b> <b>puzzle</b> was the Puzzle No.142 in Professor Layton and Pandora's Box {{as one of}} {{the hardest}} solving puzzles in the game, which needed to be {{unlocked}} by solving other puzzles first.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, {{there was}} a major puzzle in that the density of baryons as {{calculated}} by Big Bang nucleosynthesis was much less than the observed mass of the universe based on measurements of galaxy rotation curves and galaxy cluster dynamics. <b>This</b> <b>puzzle</b> was resolved in large part by postulating the existence of dark matter.|$|E
25|$|Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss {{was born}} on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick (Braunschweig), in the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (now part of Lower Saxony, Germany), {{as the son of}} poor working-class parents. His mother was {{illiterate}} and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the Feast of the Ascension, which itself occurs 39 days after Easter. Gauss later solved <b>this</b> <b>puzzle</b> about his birthdate in the context of finding the date of Easter, deriving methods to compute the date in both past and future years. He was christened and confirmed in a church near the school he attended as a child.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the true}} {{identity}} of Archie's killer is kept a secret between Max and Stacey for several months, Max's daughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) becomes suspicious in November 2010 when Max tells her Bradley was innocent. Lauren suspects Max killed Archie as she becomes paranoid about his anger. Jossa {{said in an}} interview with website Digital Spy: [...] "'s thinking about Archie's murder and realising that if Bradley didn't do it, it must have been someone else. As far as she knows, her dad is the only person who knows that Bradley didn't do it, so she's trying to put <b>this</b> <b>puzzle</b> together and it's all adding up to Max being the killer, because everything he does seems to lead to a lot of aggression." [...] However, Lauren soon works out that Stacey is the murderer after speaking to her. Jossa said she was excited that her character was one of only a select few to know the true identity of Archie's killer.|$|E
500|$|Putnam cited {{examples}} from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties. The answer to <b>this</b> <b>puzzle</b> had to be that mental states were realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about {{such things as the}} nervous systems of alien beings, artificially intelligent robots and other silicon-based life forms. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack the same neurochemistry as humans. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an [...] "ambitious" [...] and [...] "highly implausible" [...] conjecture which could be disproven with one example of multiple realizability. This argument is sometimes referred to as the [...] "likelihood argument".|$|E
500|$|For another twenty years, the {{mechanism}} by which ATP is generated remained mysterious, with scientists searching for an elusive [...] "high-energy intermediate" [...] that would link oxidation and phosphorylation reactions. <b>This</b> <b>puzzle</b> was solved by Peter D. Mitchell {{with the publication of}} the chemiosmotic theory in 1961. At first, this proposal was highly controversial, but it was slowly accepted and Mitchell was awarded a Nobel prize in 1978. Subsequent research concentrated on purifying and characterizing the enzymes involved, with major contributions being made by David E. Green on the complexes of the electron-transport chain, as well as Efraim Racker on the ATP synthase. A critical step towards solving {{the mechanism}} of the ATP synthase was provided by Paul D. Boyer, by his development in 1973 of the [...] "binding change" [...] mechanism, followed by his radical proposal of rotational catalysis in 1982. More recent work has included structural studies on the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation by John E. Walker, with Walker and Boyer being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1997.|$|E

500|$|The team {{developed}} the game's puzzles by first assuming the player was their [...] "worst enemy", and made puzzles as devious as possible, but then scaled back their difficulty or added visual and audible aids {{as if the}} player was a friend. One example given by Carlsen is a puzzle involving a spider early in the game; the solution requires pushing a bear trap to snare the spider's legs in it. Early designs of <b>this</b> <b>puzzle</b> had the bear trap on the same screen as the spider, and Playdead found playtesters focused {{too much on the}} trap. The developers altered the puzzle to put the trap in a tree in an earlier off-screen section when facing the spider; the spider's actions would eventually cause this trap to drop to the ground and become a weapon against the spider. Carlsen stated that this arrangement created a situation where the player felt helpless when initially presented with the deadly spider, but then assisted the player through an audible cue when the trap had dropped, enabling the player to discover the solution.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with some}} of his other movies, Kubrick ends The Shining with a {{powerful}} visual puzzle that forces the audience to leave the theater asking, [...] "What was that all about?" [...] The Shining ends with an extremely long camera shot moving down a hallway in the Overlook, reaching eventually the central photo among 21 photos on the wall. The caption reads: [...] "Overlook Hotel-July 4th Ball-1921." [...] The answer to <b>this</b> <b>puzzle,</b> is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re-embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries.|$|E
2500|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, grief is perplexing because it appears costly, {{and it is}} not clear what benefits it provides the sufferer. Several researchers have proposed functional explanations for grief, attempting to solve <b>this</b> <b>puzzle.</b> Sigmund Freud argued that grief is a process of libidinal reinvestment. The griever must, Freud argued, disinvest from the deceased, which is a painful process. But this disinvestment allows the griever to use libidinal energies on other, possibly new attachments, so it provides a valuable function. John Archer, approaching grief from an attachment theory perspective, argued that grief is a byproduct of the human attachment system. [...] Generally, a grief-type response is adaptive because it compels a social organism to search for a lost individual (e.g., a mother or a child). However, in the case of death, the response is maladaptive because the individual is not simply lost and the griever cannot reunite with the deceased. Grief, from this perspective, is a painful cost of the human capacity to form commitments.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to having Barbatus fighting in Samnium the inscription records him as taking Taurasia (probably in the Tammaro valley in the modern province of Benevento) and Cisauna (unknown location), rather than Bovianum and Aufidena. There is the further complication by the Fasti Triumphales (a record of Roman triumphal celebrations), recording Gnaeus Fulvius’ triumphs against both the Samnites and the Etruscans. Forsythe {{points out that the}} consulship is the only public office Barbatus is mentioned as having held which gave him command of a legion. Modern historians have proposed various alternative scenarios wherein {{one or both of the}} consuls campaigned against both the Samnites and Etruscans, but without satisfactory conclusions. Cornell says that such an assumption could reconcile the sources, but [...] "if so, neither Livy nor the inscription would emerge with much credit. Once again the evidence seems to show that there was a great deal of confusion in the tradition about the distribution of consular commands in the Samnite Wars, and that many different versions proliferated in the Late Republic."

2500|$|In 1913 Niels Bohr had {{proposed}} {{what is now}} called the Bohr model of the atom, but despite this it remained a mystery as to why electrons do not fall into their nuclei. According to classical ideas, the fact that an accelerating charge loses energy by radiating implied that an electron should spiral into the nucleus and that atoms should not be stable. This problem of classical mechanics was nicely summarized by James Hopwood Jeans in 1915: [...] "There would be a very real difficulty in supposing that the (force) law [...] held down to the zero values of [...] For the forces between two charges at zero distance would be infinite; we should have charges of opposite sign continually rushing together and, when once together, no force would tend to shrink into nothing or to diminish indefinitely in size" [...] This resolution to <b>this</b> <b>puzzle</b> came in 1926 with Schrodinger's famous equation. This equation explained the new, non-classical, fact that as an electron moves close to a nucleus its kinetic energy necessarily increases {{in such a way that}} the minimum total energy (kinetic plus potential) occurs at some positive separation rather than at zero separation; in other words, that zero-point energy is essential for atomic stability.|$|E
2500|$|In typical themed American-style crosswords, {{the theme}} is created first, {{as a set of}} {{symmetric}} long Across answers will be needed around which the grid can be created. Since the grid will typically have 180-degree rotational symmetry, the answers will need to be also: thus a typical 15×15 square American puzzle might have two 15-letter entries and two 13-letter entries that could be arranged appropriately in the grid (e.g., one 15-letter entry in the third row, and the other symmetrically in the 13th row; one 13-letter entry starting in the first square of the 6th row and the other ending in the last square of the 10th row). The theme must not only be funny or interesting, but also internally consistent. In the April 26, 2005 by Sarah Keller mentioned above, the five themed entries contained in the different parts of a tree: SQUAREROOT, TABLELEAF, WARDROBETRUNK, BRAINSTEM, and BANKBRANCH. In <b>this</b> <b>puzzle,</b> CHARTER OAK would not be an appropriate entry, as all the other entries contain different parts of a tree, not the name of a kind of tree. Similarly, FAMILY TREE would not be appropriate unless it were used as a revealer for the theme (frequently clued with a phrase along the lines [...] "...and a hint to..."). Given the existing entries, SEED MONEY would also be unacceptable, as all the other theme entries end in the part of a tree as opposed to beginning with it, though the puzzle could certainly be changed to have a mix of words in different positions.|$|E
