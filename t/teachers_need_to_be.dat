Third culture kids are being educated in a culture that is not their own. Schools and <b>teachers</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of the culture differences these students face. Studies have found that educators and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students.

Both learner and <b>teacher</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> humble, because they learn and teach what ultimately belongs to God (DDC, prooem. 7-8; 1 Cor. 4:7). Humility is a basic disposition of the interpreter of the Bible. The confidence of the exegete and preacher arises from the conviction that his or her mind depends on God absolutely (DDC, 1.1.1). Augustine argues that the interpreter of the Bible should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (DDC, 2.41.62).|$|R

In some college syllabi, there is cultural sensitivity and multicultural competence. However, a lot of them lack the design to prepare teachers with consistent ways of the defining principles of multicultural education and preparation of teaching multicultural education authentically (Gorski, 2008). [...] Multicultural education is a complex subject with many concepts. It is important for teachers to be fully knowledgeable of its depth and open to learn more about it as time goes on so they can create a safe space for their students. It is also important to see that although multicultural education is becoming more known and taught, there is still so much to learn and discover within this topic, and there always will be more to learn as we evolve.

5000|$|According to Contiga (2015), {{culture is}} the third issue that {{may not always be}} {{recognized}} in a mainstream classroom. Many teachers overlook culture and try to jump right into English and content knowledge without knowing their students' backgrounds. <b>Teachers</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> open to learning new cultures and having their students embrace all cultures in the classroom. By making efforts to learn about each other's values and beliefs, the teacher and student would not only maximize the effectiveness of ESL but make it a successful learning experience for all involved. A student who is shy or reluctant to answer questions may be more outspoken when talking about their own values that tie in with their home life. An ESL teacher, in a study called [...] "Losing Strangeness to Mediate ESL Teaching", [...] "connects culture to religious celebrations and holidays and the fusion invites students to share their knowledge". This will encourage students to open up and talk about their cultural backgrounds and traditions within their family. [...] "Teachers who encourage CLD students to maintain their cultural or ethnic ties promote their personal and academic success". Students should not lose their identity but gain knowledge from their culture and the world around them. Therefore, it is beneficial to bring culture into the ESL classroom in order for the students to feel a sense of worth in school and in their lives.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that goal {{orientation}} is linked to outcomes and performance. Much of this research has been centered on outcomes in schools and job performance. When examining research on learning environments and curriculum design, {{one could argue that}} there is significant alignment with LGO and ideal learning environments. When designing learning environments, there are some essential principles that should be in place. These principles were outlined by the National Research Council in their 2000 report entitled How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience and School. First, classrooms and school need to be learner centered. By this, <b>teachers</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of the strengths, skills, attitudes and knowledge that students bring with them when they enter school. This should include acknowledging cultural differences and creating a place for the inclusion of their everyday lived experiences in the classroom.Second, teachers should strive to create a knowledge-centered classroom by focusing on what is taught, why it is taught and what competence or mastery looks like. The emphasis here should be placed on learning with understanding. One way students can demonstrate this understanding is by successfully transferring content and skills to novel situations and problems. This also relates back to metacognitive skills that have been demonstrated to be linked to learning goal orientation.Next, {{it is important to remember}} that formative assessments are essential in learning environments. This type of ongoing assessments allows teachers to assess where students are and design their instruction accordingly. Lastly, it is very important to look at the environment in which learning takes place. The teacher wants to create an environment that nurtures a learning goal orientation as opposed to a performance goal orientation. This means encouraging a community of learners who are willing to take risks and make mistakes for the sake of learning.Teachers should create environments that emphasize mastery over performance. Performance is primarily focused on learning in the moment and a demarcated demonstration of understanding. Mastery implies skill development over a period of time that includes experience and practice. Authentic learning occurs when students can not only demonstrate understanding but apply it in multiple settings and to novel situations or problems.|$|E
