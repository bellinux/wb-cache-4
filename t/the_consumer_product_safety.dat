25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Safety</b> Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 is a United States law {{signed on}} August 14, 2008 by President George W. Bush. The {{legislative}} bill {{was known as}} HR 4040, sponsored by Congressman Bobby Rush (D-Ill.). On December 19, 2007, the U.S. House approved the bill 407-0. On March 6, 2008, the U.S. Senate approved the bill 79-13. The law—public law 110-314—increases the budget of <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Safety</b> Commission (CPSC), imposes new testing and documentation requirements, and sets new acceptable levels of several substances. It imposes new requirements on manufacturers of apparel, shoes, personal care products, accessories and jewelry, home furnishings, bedding, toys, electronics and video games, books, school supplies, educational materials and science kits. The Act also increases fines and specifies jail time for some violations.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, a major investigative {{piece by}} Schwarz {{evidenced}} what were called glaring lapses {{in the safety}} standards for football helmets among players of all ages. The story prompted an investigation by <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Safety</b> Commission, the introduction of bills {{in both houses of}} Congress covering football helmet safety and a call for inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission for false and misleading advertising by manufacturers. The article led directly to Inez Tenenbaum, chairman of the C.P.S.C., to push to partner with the N.F.L. to replace unsafe football helmets in underfunded youth leagues.|$|E

25|$|Pure {{plastics}} {{have low}} toxicity {{due to their}} insolubility in water {{and because they are}} biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Safety</b> Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens. Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{federal law}} exempts {{low-speed}} electric bicycles from Dept. of Transportation and NHTSA motor vehicle regulations, {{and they are}} regulated under federal law {{in the same manner}} as ordinary bicycles. <b>The</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Safety</b> Act defines the term low speed electric bicycle as a two- or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts (1 horsepower), whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by such a motor while ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds, is less than 20mph (15 U.S.C. 2085(b)). At the present time, neither the DOT nor the NHTSA restrict the assembly of e-bikes for use on public roads, although commercially manufactured e-bikes capable of speeds greater than 20mph are considered motor vehicles and thus subject to DOT and NHTSA safety requirements. Consequently, the laws of the individual state and/or local jurisdiction govern the type, motor wattage, and speed capability of e-bikes used on public roadways (see Electric bicycle laws). As long as the bicycle is capable of pedal propulsion, most U.S. states currently do not distinguish between designs that may be self-propelled by the electric motor versus pedal assist designs in which the electric motor assists pedal propulsion by the rider.|$|E
25|$|Mary Bono {{served in}} Congress for 15 years, {{where she worked}} on {{legislation}} and issues related to intellectual property, energy, health, telecommunications, privacy and more. Her legislative work includes a bill that calls for country-of-origin labeling for fresh fruits and vegetables, {{as well as several}} energy-saving bills to reward companies for utilizing clean burning fuel technologies and increase the energy-efficiency of federal buildings. In 2000, Bono helped pass legislation that established the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument in the Palm Springs region. The House of Representatives passed her Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass (SPY ACT), which would protect an individual's personal information on the Web. Bono secured federal recognition of Frank Sinatra Day, which was to be every subsequent May 13. Also, Bono has sponsored legislation that provides funding for obesity studies and improved nutrition programs nationwide, autism research, and Federal funding under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Act. In 2011, her bill, H.R. 2715, was signed into law with bipartisan support to amend and improve <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Safety</b> Improvement Act of 2008.

2500|$|The {{medical device}} {{engineering}} area {{is among the}} most heavily regulated fields of engineering, and practicing biomedical engineers must routinely consult and cooperate with regulatory law attorneys and other experts.

Stein writes that Smith [...] "was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie."
