5|$|In 1984, Aerosmith {{embarked}} on a reunion tour called the Back in the Saddle Tour, {{which led to the}} live album Classics Live II. While concerts on the tour were well-attended, it was plagued with several incidents, mostly attributed to drug abuse by band members. Their problems still not behind them, the group was signed to Geffen Records and began working on a comeback. Despite the band signing on to a new record company, the band's old label Columbia continued <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> the benefits of Aerosmith's comeback, releasing the live companion albums Classics Live I and II and the collection Gems.|$|E
5|$|October 5, 1841—No {{work was}} done today, as all the people have it to gather their own crop—It is a rule which we have, to give all the negroes {{one day in the}} spring to plant, and one day in the fall <b>to</b> <b>reap,</b> and as there is a rule on Sea Island {{plantations}} fixing the tasks required each day to be done, it occurs, during the long days of summer, that the hand is generally done his task by 2 p.m., often sooner, so they have abundance of time to work their own crop, fish, etc., etc.|$|E
5|$|The South Dakotas {{were able}} <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> the {{benefits}} of developments in radar technology during World War 2. By {{the end of the}} war, the ships were equipped with air and surface-search radars and radar fire-control. When commissioned, the ships were equipped with the SC air-search radar. This radar would eventually get replaced by the SK and SK-2 air-search radar. The main battery directors were fitted with Mark 3 fire-control radar, which were replaced by the Mark 8 starting in 1942. This radar gave these ships a significant advantage over the Japanese, which for the most part relied on optical systems.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to get from Bangkok <b>to</b> Siem <b>Reap</b> via Poipet. The road from Poipet <b>to</b> Siem <b>Reap</b> is newly paved and sealed as of 2013. If travelers take a taxi from Bangkok to Poipet and from Poipet <b>to</b> Siem <b>Reap,</b> it {{is possible}} to complete the whole journey in 6-10 hours, depending on border-crossing times. This journey is also possible by bus and minibus. Tickets can be bought online via the official Nattakan website. Getting <b>to</b> Siem <b>Reap</b> from Bangkok is also possible by train via the Aranyaprathet station to the border with Cambodia and later via shared mini-buses or taxis <b>to</b> Siem <b>Reap.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>reaping</b> less economic benefits, Laos {{will also}} likely {{have to deal}} with disproportionate social and environmental costs, people monitoring the project say.

5|$|In the {{meantime}} Leo Phokas, heavily outnumbered by the Arab army, decided to rely once more on his proven ambuscade tactics, and occupied {{a position in}} the Arabs' rear, awaiting their return. Leo had been joined by the remaining forces of the adjoining provinces, including the theme of Cappadocia under its strategos, Constantine Maleinos, and occupied the narrow pass of Kylindros on the eastern Taurus Mountains. The Byzantine troops occupied the local fort, and hid themselves along the steep sides of the pass. According to the Arab chronicler Abu'l-Fida, this was the same pass that Sayf al-Dawla had crossed to begin his expedition, and many of his commanders advised against using it for the return as well; nevertheless, the Hamdanid prince, confident of his ability and judgment, had grown haughty, and refused to heed any advice, seeking <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> the glory for this expedition alone.|$|E
5|$|Nickell {{continued}} {{to maintain her}} innocence after her trial. An appeal based on jury-tampering and judicial misconduct issues {{was rejected by the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1989. A second appeal, beginning in 2001 was filed by Nickell's new attorney, Carl Park Colbert, based on evidence obtained by private detectives Al Farr and Paul Ciolino, requesting a new trial on the basis of new evidence having been discovered that the FBI may have withheld documents from the defense. The appeal was denied, though Nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence. She claimed that her daughter Cynthia lied about Nickell's involvement in the case in order <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> the $300,000 of reward money being offered. Cynthia Hamilton eventually collected $250,000 of that money. Nickell also alleges, among other things, that the evidence actually points to another person as the killer, and that the testimony about various smaller details in the case, such as the store owner who testified about her having purchased Algae Destroyer, was influenced by promises of payment.|$|E

25|$|On 24 October Essex retired, leaving Charles {{to claim}} victory and <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> its results. The Royalists reoccupied Banbury and Oxford, and by 28 October Charles was marching down the Thames valley on London. Negotiations were reopened, and a peace party rapidly formed itself in London and Westminster. Yet, field fortifications sprang up around London, and when Rupert stormed Brentford and sacked it on 12 November, the trained bands moved out {{at once and}} took up a {{position}} at Turnham Green, barring the King's advance.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to slogans the Blackwell Company used promotions to increase sales of Bull Durham Tobacco. One promotion Blackwell ran gave soap to the merchants that sold their product. The company offered {{a bar of}} soap for each pound of tobacco a salesman purchased or 30 bars of soap for every 25 pounds purchased. Merchants could offer promotions in their own store, sell the soap, or use the soap themselves. Salesmen bought Bull Durham in bulk in order <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> the rewards of the soap, in turn increasing the total sales of Bull Durham.|$|E

25|$|Romney {{aspired to}} start a new business, and in 1983, Bill Bain offered him the chance to head a new venture that would buy into companies, have them benefit from Bain {{consulting}} techniques, and allow the venture's partners <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> higher rewards than consulting fees. He initially refrained from accepting the offer, and Bain re-arranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure so that there was no financial or professional risk to Romney. Thus, in 1984, Romney left Bain & Company to co-found the spin-off private equity investment firm, Bain Capital.|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} 15 {{years of his}} career, Burley was very heavily {{involved}} {{in the affairs of}} the Arundel dynasty, its affinity within Shropshire and its work on behalf of the House of Lancaster. His commitment to the FitzAlan earls can only have become more complete with the death of Stafford, another major client, at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. However, it never induced him to give up his work for other clients. Burley seems to have been trusted from the outset by new Lancastrian régime as politically and ideologically reliable, and he began <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> the rewards of loyalty.|$|E

25|$|Usually, in {{response}} to any proposed economic development, French settlers would marshal their influence in order <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> the major benefits. For many French, such benefits were the raison d'être for their living in Tunisia. If the local French administrator on occasion decided against them, they would hasten to appeal to their political contacts in Paris. These they carefully cultivated, e.g., through the large, political pressure group Parti-Colonial. A growing conflict naturally emerged between {{the interests of the}} settlers and those of Tunisians; a struggle which became increasingly sour. The French officials themselves were sometimes uncomfortably divided as to which course to take, and exactly how to take it.|$|E
25|$|The investors of the Virginia Company of London {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> rewards {{from their}} speculative investments.

It fell to the third president of the Council Captain John Smith to deliver a bold and much-needed wake-up call in response to the investors in London, demanding practical laborers and craftsmen who could help make the colony more self-sufficient.|$|E
25|$|This new navy {{would only}} be truly tested in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, as England was the Republic's only naval rival in these years, and neither country was keen to test the other so soon after the first war, that had been so costly to both sides. Besides, the Commonwealth was soon embroiled in a war with Spain, joining the Franco-Spanish War (1635) on the French side, in which the Republic {{remained}} neutral, content <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> the commercial benefits from the new-won Spanish friendship. However, the new navy proved useful in the smaller conflicts in which the Republic became soon engaged in Scandinavia and Portugal.|$|E
