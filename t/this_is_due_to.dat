5|$|Damage to the abducens nerve (VI) {{can also}} result in diplopia. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{impairment}} in the lateral rectus muscle, which is innervated by the abducens nerve.|$|E

5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the satellites' low density and their surfaces lying {{close to the edge}} of their Roche spheres.|$|E

50|$|The artistic {{literature}} often {{resorted to}} archaisms {{and did not}} respect the natural development of the spoken language. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> attempts to reach the prestige literal styles.|$|R

5|$|All six Category5s in October and November {{reached their}} intensities {{in the western}} Caribbean, a region that Atlantic hurricanes {{strongly}} gravitate toward late in the season. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the climatology of the area, which sometimes has a high-altitude anticyclone that promotes rapid intensification late in the season, as well as warm waters.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} part of their range, the Arctic tern has been reducing in numbers. Much of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> lack of food. However, most of these birds' range is extremely remote, with no apparent trend in the species as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The result will be an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the events}} of the Russian {{revolution}} of 1917 and the subsequent Russian civil war.|$|R

5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{an increase in the}} refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived. The historian Barbara Yorke has maintained that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the destruction of the kingdom's monasteries and the disappearance of both of the East Anglian sees, which were caused by Viking raids and later settlement.|$|E
5|$|In {{day-to-day life}} {{all of us}} observe that a stream of water {{emerging}} from a faucet will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted from the faucet. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a phenomenon called the Plateau–Rayleigh instability, which is entirely {{a consequence of the}} effects of surface tension.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Lexical {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which {{had served as}} names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.|$|E
5|$|Non-{{professional}} phagocytes {{are more}} limited than professional phagocytes {{in the type}} of particles they can take up. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their lack of efficient phagocytic receptors, in particular opsonins—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes do not produce reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{years have}} seen changes as bigger leaner {{carcasses}} were demanded. This issue of size featured in Galloway circles causes great debate. Some of the adjustments made was the adoption of AI and Embryo Transfer. Today the breed's original characteristics are now back in demand. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the demand of high quality meat that requires economical production.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the 4th-century army diverge widely, ranging from ca. 400,000 to over one million effectives (i.e. from roughly the same size as the 2nd-century army to 2 or 3 times larger). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> fragmentary evidence, unlike the much better-documented 2nd-century army.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus {{still remains}} relatively unsettled. The taxonomy has proved very complex {{and difficult to}} resolve, particularly for the Pseudonarcissus group. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a number of factors, including {{the diversity of the}} wild species, the ease with which natural hybridisation occurs, and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} {{responsible}} for more snakebite fatalities than any other African snake. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a combination of factors, including its wide distribution, common occurrence, large size, potent venom that is produced in large amounts, long fangs, their habit of basking by footpaths and sitting quietly when approached.|$|E
5|$|WIN Television in South Australia and Griffith, {{as well as}} Southern Cross in Port Pirie are {{the only}} {{stations}} that broadcast in digital but do not provide a high-definition service. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> multiple services using the same digital frequency: WIN Television, WIN Ten and WIN Nine in SA, WIN Television and Prime in Griffith or GTS/BKN, SC10, SC9 and ELEVEN in Port Pirie.|$|E
5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets). In {{much of the}} developed world, such deficiencies are rare; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency {{and a number of}} different disorders.|$|E
