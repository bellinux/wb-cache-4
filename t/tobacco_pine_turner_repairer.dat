40|$|Even {{when several}} genetic loci {{are used in}} {{molecular}} evolutionary studies, each locus is typically analyzed independently of the others. This type of approach {{makes it difficult to}} study mechanisms and processes that affect multiple genes. In this work we develop a statistical approach for the joint analysis of two or more loci. The tests we propose examine whether or not nucleotide substitution rates across evolutionary lineages have the same relative proportions at two loci. Theses procedures are applied to 33 genes from the chloroplast genomes of rice, <b>tobacco,</b> <b>pine,</b> and liverwort. With the exception of five clearly distinct loci, we find that synonymous substitution rates tend to change proportionally across genes. We interpret these results to be consistent with a ``lineage effect'' acting on the entire chloroplast genome. In contrast, nonsynonymous rates do not change proportionally across genes, suggesting that locus-specific evolutionary effects dominate patterns of nonsynonymous substitution...|$|R
5000|$|Moseley {{became a}} planter, lawyer, surveyor, and politician, with {{extensive}} land holdings (at least 55,000 acres) and numerous slaves for {{the labor of}} cultivating <b>tobacco,</b> <b>pine</b> trees, rice, and other crops. Known for his generosity to community and church, Moseley may be best remembered for his detailed map of the North Carolina colony, which he published in 1733. [...] A revised version was drawn by the original engraver, John Cowley (cartographer) of London, in 1737. [...] Both were lasting contributions to the settlement of the colony. East Carolina University's Special Collections house perhaps the original copy of the map of 1733, owned by Moseley himself in Greenville, and it held quite a history of its own. [...] An earlier map of the Albemarle (1708) made by Moseley was recently discovered by Dr. Larry Tise of East Carolina University in a publication of treasures from the Lambeth Palace Collection of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.|$|R

50|$|In 1910, cotton {{was still}} {{important}} {{to the economy and}} Fortune magazine ranked Valdosta as the richest city in America by per capita income. Soon after that, the boll weevil invaded the South, moving east through the states and killing much of the cotton crop in this area in 1917. Agriculture in this area turned to <b>tobacco</b> and <b>pine</b> timber. In January 1913, the South Georgia State Normal College opened in Valdosta on the edge of town. Over the course of the following century, it evolved into Valdosta State University. The school gradually became a regional center of higher education that has drawn many to the city.|$|R

60|$|The {{papers of}} the coaster {{did not give}} a more {{detailed}} description of her character and pursuits, than that which is contained in this verse. It is certain that the log-book of the Coquette was far less explicit. The latter merely said, that 'a coaster called the Stately <b>Pine,</b> John <b>Turner,</b> master, bound from New-York to the Province of North Carolina, was boarded at one o'clock, in the morning, all well.' But this description was not of a nature to satisfy the sea men of the cruiser. Those who had been actually engaged in the expedition were much too excited to see things in their true colors; and, coupled with the two previous escapes of the Water-Witch, the event just related had no small share in confirming their former opinions concerning her character. The sailing-master was not now alone, in believing that all pursuit of the brigantine was perfectly useless.|$|R
50|$|In 1865 the Savannah, Florida, and Western railway was completed, and a depot {{was built}} {{about a mile}} north of the town center. Businesses and homes {{migrated}} toward the railroad, and eventually the current town was established along that line. The town grew in earnest between 1890 and 1930 with a rich trade in turpentine, <b>tobacco,</b> cotton, and <b>pine</b> lumber. Jasper reached its pinnacle in the 1920s with a booming population of over 2,000. Most of Jasper's present buildings were built during this 40-year period.|$|R

PETRO focused on projects that had systems to create biofuels from domestic {{sources such as}} <b>tobacco</b> and <b>pine</b> trees for half their current cost. REACT funded early-stage technology alternatives that reduced or eliminated the dependence on rare earth materials by developing substitutes in two key areas: electric vehicle motors and wind generators. HEATS funded projects that promoted advancement in thermal energy storage technology. GENI focused on funding software and hardware that could reliably control the grid network. Solar ADEPT accepted projects that integrated power electronics into solar panels and solar farms to extract and deliver energy more efficiently.|$|R

Recent analysis demonstrates {{that the impact of}} environmental change and frequent occurrence of natural disasters on complex host–parasite relationships for vector-borne diseases is clear [1, 2]. Vector-borne diseases remain a serious threat to humans, livestock, and plants, and thus the control of such diseases is of great economic and healthcare concern.|$|R
40|$|A {{putative}} promoter {{fragment of}} a Pinus radiata gene encoding a multi-functional O-methyltransferase (AEOMT) was isolated from genomic DNA. Sequence analysis revealed {{a number of}} putative cis elements, including AC-rich motifs common in promoters of genes related to the phenylpropanoid pathway. The isolated promoter was fused to the GUS reporter gene and its expression profile analyzed in transgenic tobacco and in transient transformation experiments with P. radiata embryogenic and xylogenic tissue. The promoter conferred weak expression in embryogenic tissue but caused strong GUS activity in both ray parenchyma cells and developing tracheary elements of xylem strips. Histochemical analysis in transgenic tobacco plants revealed that the AEOMT promoter induced GUS expression in cell types associated with lignification, such as developing vessels, phloem and wood fibers and xylem parenchyma {{as well as in}} non-lignifying phloem parenchyma. The isolated promoter was activated by challenge of the tissue with a fungal pathogen. Our results also indicate that the control of lignin-related gene expression is conserved and can be compared in evolutionarily distant species such as <b>tobacco</b> and <b>pine...</b>|$|R
50|$|Over {{the first}} few years in the village Archie gained a {{reputation}} as a somewhat unreliable character: he was paid to fix the boiler in the local public house The Woolpack but after he supposedly repaired it became faulty and nearly released gas into the air; and he was also paid by Alan <b>Turner</b> to <b>repair</b> the motor on his car, but Archie ended up tampering with the brakes, nearly causing Alan to have an accident. However Nick began to lead Archie astray and one evening they went joyriding in Hotton and ended up in the cells for a night. They also frequently caused trouble in The Woolpack, by winding up other customers and arguing over the prices that pub landlord Amos Brearly was selling the alcohol at. The trouble eventually ceased when Archie and Nick were warned by Amos, who threatened to bar them. Nick is the first person who finds out that Archie worked at a slaughterhouse prior to his arrival in the village, and that he was sacked after an accident with a band saw.|$|R
40|$|Parsley (Petroselinum crispum L.) {{is known}} to respond to {{ultraviolet}} irradiation by the synthesis of flavone glycosides, whereas fungal or elicitor stress leads to the synthesis of furanocoumarin phytoalexins. We tested how these defensive pathways are affected by a single ozone treatment (200 nL L- 1; 10 h). Assays were performed at the levels of transcripts, for enzyme activities, and for secondary products. The most rapid transcript accumulation was maximal at 3 h, whereas flavone glycosides and furanocoumarins were maximally induced at 12 and 24 h, respectively, {{after the start of}} ozone treatment. Ozone acted as a cross-inducer because the two distinct pathways were simultaneously induced. These results are consistent with the previously observed ozone induction of fungal and viral defense reactions in <b>tobacco,</b> spruce, and <b>pine...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ravelo {{recently}} reported {{the results of}} surgical repair of {{coarctation of the aorta}} in eight patients with Turner's syndrome. * Three of these patients had serious hemorrhagic complications. At Texas Children's Hospital, we have operated on four patients with Turner's syndrome and coarctation of the aorta without complications. Of the 12 patients in both series, nine patients had uncomplicated courses when they had Dacron aortoplasty (4 / 12) or end-to-end anastomosis (5 / 12). The three other patients with end-to-end anastomoses had significant perioperative hemorrhage. Whereas Ravelo reported serious complications in 38 % (3 / 8), the combined series suggest that only about 25 % (3 / 12) of patients with <b>Turner's</b> syndrome undergoing <b>repair</b> of coarctation of the aorta may experience significant perioperative hemorrhage. We conclude, as did Ravelo, that attention to technical details should keep surgical morbidity in these patients to a minimum...|$|R
2500|$|Although Jordan's School of Anatomy {{may have}} broadened {{the scope of}} its courses since foundation, {{it was not as}} {{comprehensive}} in coverage as that opened by Thomas <b>Turner</b> on <b>Pine</b> Street in 1824. <b>Turner's</b> <b>Pine</b> Street medical school was based in a former warehouse close to the Manchester Infirmary. It offered all of the courses demanded for the LSA and MRCS qualifications, rather than a subset of them, and it was based on his experiences in delivering occasional lectures at the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society (ML) since 1822 as he sought to promote his theories of medical education. Turner was able to call upon the support of previously cultivated contacts, including John Dalton {{and other members of the}} ML, and these people in turn attracted other luminaries. He is credited with [...] "creating the first more or less complete provincial medical school in England" [...] and his success was noted by others. Schools that emulated his were soon opened in others towns and cities, such as Sheffield (1827), Birmingham and Bristol (1828), Leeds (1830) and Liverpool (1834).|$|R
5000|$|On 21 March, the {{destroyer}} resumed station off Vietnam. This time, however, {{off the coast}} of North Vietnam. Instead of supporting American and South Vietnamese troops directly through shore bombardments, she did so by interdicting enemy logistical efforts in Operation [...] "Sea Dragon". Though primarily directed at the enemys water-borne logistics, [...] "Sea Dragon" [...] also struck wherever possible at the enemys overland supply lines. During her 26 days on station engaged in [...] "Sea Dragon" [...] operations, Turner Joy fired on a number of shore targets in addition to an even larger number of enemy waterborne logistics craft. On 7 April, while firing on some enemy craft beached near Cap Mui Ron, {{the destroyer}} came under the fire of a North Vietnamese shore battery. During that exchange, she suffered a direct hit on the fantail and a near-miss air burst above the forward mast. The hit astern penetrated the deck to the supply office, damaging records therein as well as pipes and cables in the overhead. Several rounds of 5 inch VT fragmentation projectiles in mount 53 ammunition stowage area also suffered damage and had to be discarded. Shrapnel from near misses wounded a member of <b>Turner</b> Joys <b>repair</b> party and peppered her bow while the air burst above the forward mast put her air-search radar out of service except for its IFF aspect. The damage, however, was not severe enough to curtail her tour of duty; and she remained on station until relieved by HMAS Hobart on 16 April.|$|R
40|$|In the U. S., where {{heavy use}} of {{insecticides}} has been commonplace for years, {{the development of}} proper integrated insect pest control cannot get underway {{unless there is a}} changed use pattern for such chemicals. A changed use pattern, however, cannot be accomplished without much study to establish the requirements for integrated control for each major crop situation. In this paper recent developments in a number of crop areas in the U. S. in which the necessary study has been begun are reviewed. Important phases in the development of integrated control programs include: the single tactics phase, the multitactic phase, phase, the biological monitoring phase, the modeling phase, the management and optimization phase, and the implementation phase. Several crops are discussed in relation to how far along we are in the development of practical programs of insect pest control. These are cotton, apples, alfalfa, soybeans, citrus, corn, cereal grains, <b>tobacco</b> and <b>pine</b> forests. Several of these programs have already made substantial headway, e. g., those for cotton, alfalfa, apples, tobacco, and soybeans, although the accomplishments have not been even or parellel with respect to the phases of development where progress has been good. The review of developments in these crops suggests that programs of control for individual crops and perhaps for complexes of associated crops will be developed according to specific needs of the crop, the geographic area and the pests, the technologies available and the socioeconomic and political factors of relevance. The tendency will be toward greater use of science in pest control decision-making, with extensive use of biological monitoring to establish realistic levels of threatened damage to the crop, and greater concern given to possible profit reductions and environmental disturbances of applying an insecticide, as well as the possible gain from doing so...|$|R
