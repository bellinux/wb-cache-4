At its current velocity, the {{seamount}} will be destroyed within a few million years, as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate. It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> features is still being investigated.|$|E
5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E

25|$|Prior to his father’s death, Nathan of Gaza began {{studying}} under Jacob Hagiz. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two religious devotees would continue for many years. In fact, Nathan of Gaza would spend {{a majority of}} his life – up until about 1664 – with his teacher at a rabbinic college. During this academic period, documents were written that described his interest in and persistence towards academic work. It is {{said that he was}} “…an extremely gifted student, of quick apprehension and a brilliant intellect. His talents… noteworthy for their rare combination of intellectual power and capacity for profound thinking with imagination and strong emotional sensitivity…” In and of itself, Nathan of Gaza was an extremely gifted pupil. His intellectual brilliance and his intense focus on his studies, however, did not limit or prevent him – as occurs with most intensely devoted religious individuals –from experiencing many of the Jewish rites of passage. In fact, at the age of nineteen or twenty, he married the daughter of an affluent Jew named Samuel Lissabona. The nuptials were believed to have taken place {{before the end of the}} year 1663, when he joined his wife’s family in Gaza. There, he was able to focus considerably on his religious studies.|$|E
25|$|Golden eagles, being {{habitual}} scavengers at carrion, {{come into}} conflict with scavenging birds as well. They may encounter corvids at carrion sites and the large passerines are often highly cautious, either feeding {{some distance from the}} eagle or waiting until the eagle is done eating, lest they be predaceously grabbed. Occasionally, however, corvids may behave more boldly around golden eagles. In one case, a group of three black-billed magpies were observed to rob a golden eagle of its prey. Golden eagles also usually dominate both New World and Old World vultures. Smaller species like black vulture (Coragyps atratus) in North America and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in Eurasia are known to be occasionally hunted by golden eagles. Besides the Steller's sea eagle, the larger species of Old World vulture and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) are the only noticeably larger raptorial birds that a golden eagle may encounter. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> large vultures and golden eagles can be highly contentious, with most sources favoring victory for the eagle due to its more aggressive disposition, much stronger feet and sharp talons. In one case, a colony of griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) was exceptionally able to displace a pair golden eagles from a cliff where they were trying nest so they could nest there themselves. On the other hand, a 5-year-old griffon vulture reintroduced into the wild in Bulgaria was thought to have been killed by a golden eagle. The golden eagle is a potential predator of the lammergeier which is often attracted to much the same habitat and prey as the eagle but often feeds largely on bone marrow from carcasses. It has been observed that both golden eagles and lammergeiers will readily pirate food away from each other. In the Southwestern United States, several conflicts between huge California condors and golden eagles have been observed. At carrion, victory during conflicts can go either way apparently. Recent observation have suggested that the critically endangered condors do not seem to actively defend their nesting territories from golden eagles but have been recorded gaining incidental protection from prairie falcons and common ravens, which both aggressively displaced the eagles from their own adjacent territories. The golden eagle is considered an occasional predator of California condors (especially fledglings) but there seems to be {{little in the way of}} eyewitness accounts to confirm this. It is possible that (as in the Bulgarian griffon vultures) the California condors have lost their natural cautiousness around eagles due to having been reintroduced from captivity.|$|E
