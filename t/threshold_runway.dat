50|$|The pilot {{stated that}} during line up, the lights {{surround}} the turn pad were very bright and affected his forward vision {{for a short}} time. It was common practice in Halim to lineup at the turn pad beyond the <b>threshold</b> <b>runway</b> 24. The air traffic controller then observed if there was another aircraft or a vehicle in the runway. Because they didn't see any other aircraft in the runway, Flight 7703 then cleared for take off by Halim Tower. While taking off, the First Officer then {{realized that there was}} an object in the runway (the ATR 42), the Captain quickly took over the control and applied a right rudder input immediately. The Boeing 737-800's winglet then slammed into the ATR 42, at a speed of 80 knots.|$|E
