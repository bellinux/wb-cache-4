40|$|In the United Staes, until recently, the {{inheritance}} tax has been employed principally {{as a war}} measure. The first one imposed was the stamp act of July 6, 1797, which was repealed five years later. The war revenue act of July 1, 1862, was repealed July 14 1870. The revenue act of August 27, 1894 was declared unconstitutional because of its income <b>tax</b> <b>feature.</b> The war revenue act of June 13, 1989 was repealed April 13, 1902. The present federal estate tax was formed September 8, 1916. It was later amended March 3, 1917, and was altered appreciably in the revenue act of October 3, 1917. The amendment increased the rates of the tax. The revenue acts of 1918, 1921, and 1924 changed the rates in varying ways and also changed many of the fundamental provisions. The revenue act of 1926, however, contains a retroactive provision which {{has the effect of}} nullifying the rates of the 1924 act and makes the rates of the 1921 act applicable until the effective date of the act of 1926 after which lower rates apply...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{multi-level}} taxation is currently highly relevant to two issues – European tax harmonisation {{and local government}} taxation in the UK. This paper presents a general economic analysis of multi-level government and taxation and the characteristics that might make a particular tax appropriate as a regional or local tax. In applying this analysis to European tax harmonisation {{it is clear that}} there is little harmony in the meaning of the term and a classification is presented. The main driving force for EU tax harmonisation has been the promotion of economic efficiency in the form of free trade in order to achieve the establishment and functioning of the European internal market. Differing regional needs and preferences regarding public sector expenditure and taxation may not always be properly recognised. It is suggested that a greater emphasis be placed on equity as an economic criteria in developing European tax harmonisation. Applying the analysis specifically to local government in the UK, it is clear that taxes on property meet most of the criteria relating both to taxes in general and lower level taxes in particular. However {{as in the case of}} European tax harmonisation, there seems to have been insufficient account taken of matters of equity as compared to economic efficiency. It has been the issue of equity that caused the demise of local authority domestic rates and the community charge in turn and continues to raise difficulties with the present council tax. It is therefore suggested that coverage of the income <b>tax</b> <b>feature</b> of council tax – council tax rebates – be extended. The experience to date suggests equity as well as economic efficiency is important in the successful development of both European tax harmonisation and UK local government finance and perhaps should be given greater prominence in the development of systems of multi-level taxation more generally. ...|$|E

30|$|To date, we {{find only}} a handful of papers that include {{concrete}} <b>tax</b> law <b>features</b> in their analysis. 28 We believe that the analysis of more specific tax law regulations may be an interesting avenue for future research as they relate to the agency conflict between firm owners and managers. For instance, consider special tax law provisions regarding severance payments compared to other forms of managerial remuneration. Accounting for such <b>tax</b> <b>features</b> can be important, as prior theoretical literature indicates that severance payments are a critical component of managerial compensation contracts, particularly in turbulent times when CEO turnover decisions occur more frequently. 29 Another interesting topic might be divergent tax bases that distort optimal decision making as they create profit shifting incentives. Recently, the European Commission put forward a series of ideas geared towards the removal of tax-related business obstacles. These ideas ultimately aim at the introduction of a Common Corporate Consolidated Tax Base (CCCTB). 30 The CCCTB would directly affect the corporate tax burden of multinationals and thereby also influence the managerial behavior. While Martini et al. (2016) provide first answers to questions related to this topic, we think that future literature could expand on this.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} for optimal taxation when agents can earn their income both in traditional activities, where private and social products coincide, and in rent-seeking activities, where private returns exceed social returns either because they involve the capture of pre-existing rents or because they reduce the returns to traditional work. We characterize Pareto optimal income taxes that do not condition on {{how much of an}} individual's income is earned in each of the two activities. These optimal <b>taxes</b> <b>feature</b> an externality-corrective term, the magnitude of which depends both on the Pigouvian correction that would obtain if rent-seeking incomes could be perfectly targeted and on the relative impact of rent-seeking externalities on the private returns to traditional and to rent-seeking activities. If rent-seeking externalities primarily affect other rent-seekers, for example, the optimal correction lies strictly below the Pigouvian correction. A calibrated model indicates that the gap between the Pigouvian and optimal correction can be quantitatively important. Our results thus point to a hefty informational requirement for correcting rent-seeking externalities through the income tax code...|$|R
40|$|The chapter {{presents}} {{a review of}} the literature on tax incentives to long-term saving (exemptions for pension fund and social security contributions, specific saving instruments targeted for retirement) and tax incentives to borrow (mortgage and consumer credit deductibility, special subsidies for housing finance). The chapter places special emphasis on the importance of saving instruments that are available in middle-income countries with relatively developed financial markets (as several Latin America and East-Asian countries), and refer to the most industrialized countries for comparison and empirical evidence. In very poor countries households rely on informal markets for credit transactions, so government intervention has a limited role in shaping household saving and portfolio choice. A careful review of the international tax codes reveals that the most important and widely available household financial assets that are targeted by the tax system are long-term, retirement saving instruments.
