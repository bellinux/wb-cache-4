50|$|Dasolampanel (INN, USAN, {{code name}} NGX-426) is an orally {{bioavailable}} analog of <b>tezampanel</b> and thereby competitive antagonist of the AMPA and kainate receptors which was under development by Raptor Pharmaceuticals/Torrey Pines Therapeutics {{for the treatment}} of chronic pain conditions including neuropathic pain and migraine. It was developed as a follow-on compound to <b>tezampanel,</b> as <b>tezampanel</b> is not bioavailable orally and must be administered by intravenous injection, but ultimately neither drug was ever marketed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tezampanel</b> (INN, USAN) (code names LY-293,558, NGX-424) {{is a drug}} {{originally}} developed by Eli Lilly which acts as a competitive antagonist of the AMPA and kainate subtypes of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, with selectivity for the GluR5 subtype of the kainate receptor. It has neuroprotective and anticonvulsant properties, the former of which may, at least in part, occur via blockade of calcium uptake into neurons.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tezampanel</b> has a {{range of}} effects which may be useful for {{medicinal}} purposes, {{as well as its}} applications in scientific research. It suppresses both the withdrawal symptoms from morphine and other opioids, and the development of tolerance, as well as having antihyperalgesic and analgesic effects in its own right. It also has anxiolytic effects in animal studies and has been suggested as a candidate for the treatment of anxiety in humans.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{evaluated}} the epidural administration of <b>tezampanel,</b> a non-Nmethyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, in a rat model for postoperative pain. We {{sought to determine}} if this drug affects nociception when administered epidurally by testing its effects on responses to heat in normal rats. The effects of epidural <b>tezampanel</b> on pain-related behaviors in rats that underwent plantar incision were also studied. METHODS: Rats were anesthetized and epidural catheters were placed. One day after epidural catheterization, the baseline heat withdrawal latency was measured. Epidural <b>tezampanel</b> or morphine was tested for analgesia by examining their effects against heat withdrawal latency. Motor function was also tested. Comparisons to subcutaneous drug administration were made. Other rats underwent plantar incision after epidural catheterization to assess pain behavior caused by incision. The effects of epidural <b>tezampanel</b> on the cumulative pain scoring, based on guarding, the withdrawal threshold to von Frey filament application, and the withdrawal latency to heat, were measured. The effects of epidural <b>tezampanel</b> on arterial blood pressure and heart rate were also tested...|$|E
30|$|Some {{glutamate}} antagonists (<b>tezampanel,</b> LY- 293558, and ADX 10059) {{have shown}} effectiveness versus placebo in the acute treatment of migraine without aura. ADX 10059 was studied in a multicentre migraine prevention study that was terminated early following {{the emergence of}} a higher than expected rate of liver enzyme abnormalities (Chan and MaassenVanDenBrink 2014).|$|E
40|$|For {{almost three}} decades {{intrathecal}} baclofen therapy has been the standard treatment for spinal cord injury spasticity when oral medication is ineffective or produces serious side effects. Although intrathecal baclofen therapy has a good clinical benefit-risk ratio for spinal spasticity, tolerance and the life-threatening withdrawal syndrome present serious problems for its management. Now, in an experimental model of spinal cord injury spasticity, AMPA receptor blockade with NGX 424 (<b>Tezampanel)</b> {{has been shown to}} reduce stretch reflex activity alone and during tolerance to intrathecal baclofen therapy. These results stem from the observation that GluA 1 receptors are overexpressed on reactive astrocytes following experimental ischaemic spinal cord injury. Although further validation is required, the appropriate choice of AMPA receptor antagonists for treatment of stretch hyperreflexia based on our recent understanding of reactive astrocyte neurobiology following spinal cord injury may lead {{to the development of a}} better adjunct clinical therapy for spasticity without the side effects of intrathecal baclofen therapy...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{migraine}} (CM), {{the suffering}} of 15 or more headache days with at least 8 of these migraine days, afflicts 1. 3 %- 5. 1 % of the global population. CM {{is the most common}} disorder faced by experts in tertiary headache centers. When resistant to conventional medical treatment and prophylactic medication this condition is known as refractory chronic migraine (RCM). RCM {{is one of the greatest}} challenges in headache medicine. Areas covered: State-of-the-art and future medical treatments of chronic migraine include: OnabotulinumtoxinA, antiepileptic drugs (Levetiracetam, Magnesium valproate hydrate, Lacosamide, BGG- 492), 5 -HT agonists (Lasmiditan, NXN- 188, novel delivery systems of Sumatriptan, a well-established drug treatment for acute migraine), CGRP receptor antagonists (BMS- 927711), ML- 1 agonists (Ramelteon), orexin receptor antagonist (MK- 6096), plant-derived compound (LLL- 2011) and other multitarget drugs such as <b>Tezampanel,</b> Tonabersat, intranasal carbon dioxide and BOL- 148. The role for neuromodulation, the application of targeted electrical stimulation, will be examined. Expert opinion: Medication overuse headache (MOH) is now recognized to be a major factor in many cases of both chronic and refractory chronic migraine. MOH must be addressed prior to evaluating the effectiveness of new preventative and prophylactic treatment approaches. Innovative new drugs and electrical neuromodulation are promising CM treatments. Future studies must carefully screen patients and acquire data that can lead to personalized, tailored treatment strategies. Â© 2012 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Organophosphorous (OP) Nerve agents (NAs) {{are known}} as the deadliest {{chemical}} warfare agents. They are divided into two classes of G and V agents. Most of them are liquid at room temperature. NAs chemical structures and mechanisms of actions are similar to OP pesticides, but their toxicities are higher than these compounds. The main mechanism of action is irreversible inhibition of Acetyl Choline Esterase (AChE) resulting in accumulation of toxic levels of acetylcholine (ACh) at the synaptic junctions and thus induces muscarinic and nicotinic receptors stimulation. However, other mechanisms have recently been described. Central nervous system (CNS) depression particularly on respiratory and vasomotor centers may induce respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Intermediate syndrome after NAs exposure is less common than OP pesticides poisoning. There are four approaches to detect exposure to NAs in biological samples: (I) AChE activity measurement, (II) Determination of hydrolysis products in plasma and urine, (III) Fluoride reactivation of phosphylated binding sites and (IV) Mass spectrometric determination of cholinesterase adducts. The clinical manifestations are similar to OP pesticides poisoning, but with more severity and fatalities. The management should be started as soon as possible. The victims should immediately {{be removed from the}} field and treatment is commenced with auto-injector antidotes (atropine and oximes) such as MARK I kit. A 0. 5 % hypochlorite solution as well as novel products like M 291 Resin kit, G 117 H and Phosphotriesterase isolated from soil bacterias, are now available for decontamination of NAs. Atropine and oximes are the well known antidotes that should be infused as clinically indicated. However, some new adjuvant and additional treatment such as magnesium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, gacyclidine, benactyzine, <b>tezampanel,</b> hemoperfusion, antioxidants and bioscavengers have recently been used for OP NAs poisoning. </p...|$|E
