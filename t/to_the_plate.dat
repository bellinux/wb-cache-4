5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, the Indians {{opened up the}} game. Boudreau and Joe Gordon hit {{back-to-back}} singles, which brought Keltner <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home run of the season to put the Indians ahead, 4–1. Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with {{the top of their}} lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out. Boudreau then stepped up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and hit his second home run of the night to make the score 6–1.|$|E
5|$|Baseball America rated Humber as the 50th-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} {{heading into the}} 2005 season. Humber entered spring training in 2005 with the Mets. There, he clashed with Mets' pitching coach Rick Peterson, who wanted Humber to adopt a different training regimen and change the manner with which he threw the ball <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> The Mets front office supported Humber, telling him to pitch how he felt comfortable.|$|E
5|$|Serevi's first tournament {{as coach}} was the Singapore {{leg of the}} IRB Sevens Series; Fiji was {{defeated}} by England in their semi-final. The last two legs of the 2004–05 IRB Sevens Series were played in London and Paris. There he coached Fiji <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plate</b> victory, and a final loss respectively. His first major trophy as coach came when Fiji won gold in the 2005 World Games in Germany.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Monte Irvin {{was hit by}} a pitch between outs by Mueller and Whitey Lockman. Bobby Thomson then hit a home run to put the Giants up, 2–1. After the third out, the Dodgers came back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> Reese {{grounded}} out, but Snider and Robinson hit back-to-back singles. Campanella grounded into a double play to end the inning. The Giants got one man on base {{in the top of the}} fifth inning, when Stanky singled with two outs. Pafko reached on an error to start off the bottom of the fifth, but was caught stealing second base; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth. The only hit in the sixth inning was a single by Lockman, and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Paciorek, {{who was the}} {{starting}} right fielder, began {{the day with a}} walk in the second inning. He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had a walk in the sixth, and ended the day with a leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 134 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He had a perfect major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 {{as a result of his}} performance that day, something no one else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done.|$|E
5|$|As a pinch hitter, Caballero {{came through}} with hits in clutch situations, notably against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 30. Behind 6–3 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, the Phillies sent Caballero <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> to pinch {{hit in the}} top of the seventh inning. He led off the inning with a single, scoring the first run of a seesaw come-from-behind rally that ended with a 9–8 Phillies victory, closer Jim Konstanty's 13th of the season. Caballero {{displayed}} his running skills again in September, replacing Goliat in the ninth inning of another game against the Cardinals, and scoring a late-inning run in place of Lopata against the Cincinnati Reds several days later to tie a close game that the Phillies eventually lost in 18 innings. On September 26, Caballero scored another crucial run against the Boston Braves when he pinch-ran for outfielder Dick Sisler. Waiting on third base after advancing from first on a Del Ennis single to center field, Jones hit a high ground ball to Boston shortstop Sibby Sisti, who booted the ball and allowed Caballero to score the game-tying run; the Phillies won, 8–7.|$|E

40|$|Under heating, a {{hydrated}} egg lecithin multilamellar {{sample in}} a planar geometry (lamellae normal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates)</b> shows a periodic striation instability, followed at higher heating by the so-called « ear-like » domains. We first demonstrate that a normal lamellae contraction under heating can result into a lamellar undulation instability in a planar sample, {{as well as}} in a homeotropic geometry. Assuming a strong anchoring of the lamellae on <b>the</b> <b>plates,</b> with <b>the</b> force free condition on the lamellae outer surface, the undulations are localized close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b> <b>The</b> spatial period and the threshold are estimated. Observations of hydrated DLL samples of various thicknesses allow us <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> periodic striations with this localized undulation instability...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} inning, after {{striking}} out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem {{gave up a}} solo home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came {{into the bottom of}} the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|Tomb 4 was {{set into}} the floor of Structure 2B in the 8th century AD and is the richest burial known from Calakmul. The tomb {{contained}} a male skeleton wrapped in textiles and jaguar pelts that were partially preserved with resin. The tomb contained rich offerings that included jade ear ornaments handed down from the Early Classic, a jade mosaic mask, shell and bone beads, spiny oyster shells, eccentric obsidian blades, fine ceramics {{and the remains of}} wooden objects. One of the ceramics was a plate with a hieroglyphic text that specifically named king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak' as its owner. The remains and the offering were placed in an arched wooden bier carved with elaborate decoration and hieroglyphs that was painted in a variety of colours. The bier has almost completely decayed but left an impression in the mud packed around it. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and the possible association of Stelae 115 and 116 with the burial the tomb is believed to be that of the late 7th-century king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak'.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} fixture for supporting an elongated specimen for crush testing. The fixture comprises a base plate, four guiding rods, a sliding plate, four support rods and two collars. The guiding rods connect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base <b>plate</b> and extend {{in a direction}} substantially perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base <b>plate.</b> <b>The</b> sliding <b>plate</b> has linear bearings which encircle the guiding rods and enable translation of <b>the</b> sliding <b>plate</b> along <b>the</b> axis of each guiding rod. The four supporting rods mount <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base <b>plate</b> and also extend in a direction substantially perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base <b>plate.</b> Each support rod has a keyway for a wedge which contacts the elongated specimen and holds the specimen in place during crushing. Each collar lies above <b>the</b> sliding <b>plate</b> and holds a pair of support rods on their ends opposite <b>the</b> ends connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base <b>plate.</b> A spherical bearing sits on top of <b>the</b> sliding <b>plate</b> and transfers an applied load <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sliding <b>plate,</b> which moves downward and crushes the elongated specimen...|$|R

25|$|The Audion is an {{electronic}} amplifier device {{and was the}} forerunner of the triode, in which the current from the filament <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> was controlled by a third element, the grid. A small amount of power applied to the grid could control a larger current from the filament <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> allowing the Audion both to detect radio signals and to provide amplification. The Audion tube was invented by Lee De Forest in 1906.|$|E

30|$|Using slip vectors {{of large}} {{interplate}} earthquakes along <b>the</b> PHS <b>plate</b> boundary and <b>the</b> {{constraints of the}} motion with the Pacific and Caroline plates, Seno et al. (1993) estimated the motion of <b>the</b> PHS <b>plate</b> relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eurasian <b>plate</b> as 40 – 45 [*]mm/year toward NW (about N 50 ° W). However, western Japan is considered <b>to</b> belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Amurian <b>plate,</b> not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eurasian <b>plate.</b> From GNSS data, Heki et al. (1999) showed that <b>the</b> Amurian <b>plate</b> moves eastward relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eurasian <b>plate</b> {{at a rate of}} about 10 [*]mm/year. On the other hand, Heki and Miyazaki (2001) showed that <b>the</b> Amurian <b>plate</b> converges <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North American (NA) plate in E-W direction as fast as 20 [*]mm/year, which means that <b>the</b> NA <b>plate</b> moves westward {{at a rate of about}} 10 [*]mm/year relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eurasian <b>plate.</b> Hence, if central Japan converges <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NA <b>plate</b> at a rate of about 10 [*]mm/year, then there is almost no relative motion between central Japan and <b>the</b> Eurasian <b>plate.</b> It is thus considered that the estimate of Seno et al. (1993) may be feasible as a convergence rate between <b>the</b> PHS <b>plate</b> and central Japan, even though <b>the</b> Amurian <b>plate</b> is not taken into account in their model.|$|R

25|$|ESL in {{industrial}} capacitors is {{mainly caused by}} the leads and internal connections used to connect the plates to the outside world. Larger capacitors tend to higher ESL than small ones, because the distances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> are longer and every millimeter increases inductance.|$|E

25|$|Eventually the {{technique}} of neutralization was developed whereby the RF transformer connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> (anode) would include an additional winding in the opposite phase. This winding would be connected back to the grid through a small capacitor, and when properly adjusted would cancel the Miller capacitance. This technique was employed {{and led to the}} success of the Neutrodyne radio during the 1920s.|$|E
