40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the way William Wilkinson, a Levant Company member, perceives two Romanian countries {{situated at the}} edge of the Ottoman Empire, one of the British Oriental Others, in his An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Various Political Observations Relating to Them, published in London in 1820 and written after several years of official residence mainly in Bucharest (1813 - 1816). Since the book has not been previously analyzed, except for the theme of religion by Professor James Brown, this article proposes to approach it from several different points of view: the author, the Company and the image of the Turks; economic opportunities, prohibition, organization; Romanian history; cities, monuments, <b>travelling</b> <b>system,</b> inhabitants. What this study wishes to demonstrate is that, through both criticism and appreciation, Wilkinson’s book is one of sympathy and mercy towards the Romanian people – a pledge for their freedom...|$|E

This thesis examines the reengineering of the <b>travel</b> management <b>system</b> {{and implementation of}} the Defense <b>Travel</b> <b>System</b> at the Naval Postgraduate School. A review of the reengineering process with different goals and principles is provided as background for understanding the reengineering process. Also, the reengineering process and private sector <b>travel</b> <b>systems</b> are reviewed. Eight steps for reengineering the <b>travel</b> <b>system</b> and a model for the <b>travel</b> <b>system</b> are then proposed. This is followed by a historical overview of the travel reengineering process at the Naval Postgraduate School, a Defense <b>Travel</b> <b>System</b> test site, for designing a new <b>travel</b> <b>system.</b> Data were collected from the current <b>travel</b> <b>system,</b> historical records, and personal interviews. The data analysis is completed with a discussion of the Naval Postgraduate School reengineering process and travelers' views on the reengineered <b>travel</b> <b>system</b> from a random questionnaire survey. The research provides conclusions and recommendations regarding the reengineering process, with directions for future research. Major, United States Marine Corp...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{theory of}} bifurcations of {{dynamical}} systems {{is used to}} investigate the behavior of travelling wave solutions in an entire family of shallow water wave equations. This family is obtained by a perturbative asymptotic expansion for unidirectional shallow water waves. According to {{the parameters of the}} system, this family can lead to different sets of known equations such as Camassa-Holm, Korteweg-de Vries, Degasperis and Procesi and several other dispersive equations of the third order. Looking for possible travelling wave solutions, we show that different phase orbits in some regions of parametric planes are similar to those obtained with the model of the pressure waves studied by Li and Chen. Many other exact explicit travelling waves solutions are derived as well, some of them being in perfect agreement with solutions obtained in previous works by researchers using different methods. When parameters are varied, the conditions under which the above solutions appear are also shown. The dynamics of singular nonlinear <b>travelling</b> <b>system</b> is completely determined for each of the above mentioned equations. Moreover, we define sufficient conditions leading to the existence of propagating wave solutions and demonstrate how and why travelling waves lose their smoothness and develop into solutions with compact support or breaking waves.

Another benefit of a <b>travel</b> <b>system</b> is that the detached chassis (generally an umbrella closing chassis) when folded will usually be smaller than other types, to transport it in a car trunk or boot. Also, the baby seat will snap into a base meant to stay in an automobile, becoming a car seat.

GAO's testimony is based on the preliminary results of that audit and focuses on the following three key questions: (1) Has DOD effectively tested key functionality in DTS related to flights and fare information? (2) Will DTS correct the problems related to DOD travel previously identified by GAO and others? and (3) What challenges remain in ensuring that DTS achieves its goal as DOD's standard <b>travel</b> <b>system?</b> In addition, the Subcommittee asked that GAO provide a description of the intellectual property rights of DOD in DTS.

The thesis starts off with a brief introduction of travel at NPS, and is followed by a section on the Defense <b>Travel</b> <b>System</b> to include NPS's history with electronic <b>travel</b> <b>systems.</b> The third chapter highlights NPS's current travel process to include the Commercial Travel Office and GSA City Pair Program. Next I outline the process whereby NPS would use a combination of the City Pair Program and restricted airfare to reduce travel expenditures. Specifically, this section discusses obstacles to effectively using restricted fares and how to overcome those obstacles such as gaining approval from CNO's office (OPNAV N 413 B) to designate NPS as a test platform, using a decision matrix to help customers decide if a restricted fare is right for their trip, implementing the process with assistance from the DTS program office, reporting requirements and evaluation for determining if the process should be implemented for all of DoD. Finally, the thesis closes with a recap and some recommendations for improving DTS to increase stakeholder and customer satisfaction. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
