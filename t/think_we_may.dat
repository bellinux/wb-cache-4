But we won't do this forever, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> have one final run left in our bones." [...] Asked specifically whether he intended {{to run for president}} in 2012, he declined to comment. The article generated significant speculation about a likely Huntsman 2012 presidential bid.|$|E
500|$|After the battle, Hussein proclaimed, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> reach a {{position}} where we are all fedayeen". The Palestinians used the battle's wide acclaim and recognition in the Arab world to establish their national claims, and the following period witnessed an upsurge of support from Arab countries to the fedayeen in Jordan. However, as the PLO's strength began {{to grow in the}} aftermath, the fedayeen began to speak openly of overthrowing the Hashemite monarchy, and the ensuing tensions eventually precipitated in their expulsion to Lebanon by Jordan during the events of Black September in 1970.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Dave Alizadeth from Las Vegas outlasted a {{field of}} 109 {{participants}} {{to become the first}} [...] "Dealers World Poker Championship". While other Dealer Tournaments had a reputation for sloppy play, the first Dealer Championship was noted for the seriousness with which the players approached the game. In the end, however, the winner was not determined by the deal of the cards, but by a deal at the table. According to initial reports, the deal was only achieved because [...] "a World Series bracelet was not available for negotiation, the players decided to take their money and go home." [...] Other sources, however, indicate that the event was always intended to be a bracelet event. Either way, the official WSOP standings, credits Alizadeth with winning a WSOP bracelet at this event. By contrast the final three contestants at the 2003 Championship were doing Kamikaze shots. [...] "We were all having such a great time," [...] the winner David Lukaszewski said, [...] "sitting around playing poker that I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> have forgotten about the prize money and the bracelet." ...|$|E

500|$|The American Youth Congress {{was formed}} in 1935 to {{advocate}} for youth rights in U.S. politics, and was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S. Congress. Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC {{eventually led to the}} formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that [...] "I live in real terror when I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> be losing this generation. We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary." [...] In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League. Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C. Joseph P. Lash was one of her boarders. On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as First Lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico. The President admonished them to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships. The President was reportedly booed by the group. Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization. Among them was Joseph Cadden, one of Roosevelt's overnight boarders. Later in 1940, despite Roosevelt's publication of her reasons [...] "Why I still believe in the Youth Congress," [...] the American Youth Congress was disbanded. The NYA was shut down in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|At a press conference, Hart defiantly stated, [...] "I {{said that}} I bend, but I don't break, and believe me, I'm not broken." [...] Hart {{identified}} the invasive media coverage, and its need to [...] "dissect" [...] him, as his reason for suspending his campaign, [...] "If someone's able {{to throw up}} a smokescreen and keep it up there long enough, you can't get your message across. You can't raise the money to finance a campaign; there's too much static, and you can't communicate....Clearly, under the present circumstances, this campaign cannot go on. I refuse to submit {{my family and my}} friends and innocent people and myself to further rumors and gossip. It's simply an intolerable situation." [...] Hart paraphrased Thomas Jefferson and warned, [...] "I tremble for my country when I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may,</b> in fact, get the kind of leaders we deserve." [...] Hart later recalled, [...] "I watched journalists become animals, literally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to Austria's {{delay in}} writing the ultimatum, the element of {{surprise}} that Germany had counted upon in the war against Serbia was lost. Instead, the strategy of [...] "localization" [...] was adopted, which meant that when the Austro-Serbian war began, Germany would pressure other powers not to become involved even at the risk of war. On 19 July, Jagow published a note in the semi-official North German Gazette warning other powers [...] "that the settlement of differences which may arise between Austria-Hungary and Serbia should remain localized". Asked by Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to Germany, how he knew about the contents of the Austrian ultimatum as he had revealed in the North German Gazette, Gottlieb von Jagow pretended to be ignorant of it. Sir Horace Rumbold of the British Embassy in Berlin reported: [...] "We do not know the facts. The German government clearly do know. They know what the Austrian government is going to demand... and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> say with some assurance that they had expressed approval of those demands and promised support should dangerous complications ensure... the German government did not believe that there is any danger of war." ...|$|E
