40|$|Composition of Venezuelan honeys from stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponinae) and Apis mellifera L. (Vit Olivier, Patricia; Bogdanov, Stefan y Kilchenmann, V.) Abstract Forty stingless-bee and 21 Apis mellifera honeys from Venezuela were {{analysed}} for their essential composition. The stingless bees comprised 3 Melipona and 5 Trigona species. The moisture content of <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> from <b>the</b> different stingless-bee species {{was significantly higher}} than that of <b>the</b> A mellifera <b>honeys.</b> Generally, <b>the</b> stingless-bee <b>honeys</b> had a higher acidity than <b>the</b> A mellifera <b>honeys.</b> <b>The</b> <b>honeys</b> from <b>the</b> Melipona species had lower diastase activity than the Trigona species. There were also differences in the acidity and the ash and nitrogen content of <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> of <b>the</b> different stingless-bee species, but these differences might also be due to a different floral origin. While <b>the</b> A mellifera <b>honeys</b> fulfilled <b>the</b> quality requirements set by the Codex Alimentarius, <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> from <b>the</b> stingless bees failed to do so for several parameters, especially the quality factors such as water content, reducing sugars, acidity, and ash content. vit@ula. veStefan.

40|$|Abstract Background Honey {{has been}} shown to have wound healing {{properties}} which can be ascribed to its antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity can be effective against a broad spectrum of bacterial species especially those of medical importance. It has also been shown that there is considerable variation in the antimicrobial potency of different types of honey, which is impossible to predict. With this in mind we tested the antimicrobial activity of honeys produced from plants grown in South Africa for their antibacterial properties on selected standard strains of oral micro-organisms. Methods <b>The</b> <b>honeys</b> used were produced from the blossoms of Eucalyptus cladocalyx (Bluegum) trees, an indigenous South African plant Leucospermum cordifolium (Pincushion), a mixture of wild heather shrubs, mainly Erica species (Fynbos) and a Leptospermum scoparium (Manuka) honey. Only pure honey which had not been heated was used. <b>The</b> <b>honeys</b> were tested for their antimicrobial properties with a broth dilution method. Results Although <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> produced some inhibitory effect on the growth of the micro-organisms, no exceptionally high activity occurred in <b>the</b> South African <b>honeys.</b> <b>The</b> carbohydrate concentration {{plays a key role in}} the antimicrobial activity of <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> above 25 %. However, these honeys do contain other antimicrobial properties that are effective against certain bacterial species at concentrations well below the hypertonic sugar concentration. The yeast C. albicans was more resistant to <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> than <b>the</b> bacteria. The species S. anginosus and S. oralis were more sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> than <b>the</b> other test bacteria. Conclusion <b>The</b> <b>honeys</b> produced from indigenous wild flowers from South Africa had no exceptionally high activity that could afford medical grade status. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of nine unprocessed Australian honeys was investigated for {{the applicability of}} the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) model. The viscosity of <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> was obtained over a range of shear rates (0. 01 - 40 s(- 1)) from 2 degrees to 40 degreesC, and all <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> exhibited Newtonian behaviour with viscosity reducing as the temperature was increased. <b>The</b> <b>honeys</b> with high moisture were of lower viscosity, The glass transition temperatures of <b>the</b> <b>honeys,</b> as measured with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), ranged from - 40 degrees to - 46 degreesC, and four models (WLF. Arrhenius, Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF), and power-law) were investigated to describe the temperature dependence of the viscosity. The WLF was the most suitable and the correlation coefficient averaged 0. 999 +/- 0. 0013 as against 0. 996 +/- 0. 0042 for the Arrhenius model while the mean relative deviation modulus was 0 - 12 % for the WLF model and 10 - 40 % for the Arrhenius one. With the universal values for the WLF constants, the temperature dependence of the viscosity was badly predicted. From non-linear regression analysis, the constants of the WLF models for <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> were obtained (C- 1 = 13. 7 - 21. 1 : C- 2 = 55. 9 - 118. 7) and are different from the universal values. These WLF constants will be valuable for adequate modeling of the rheology of <b>the</b> <b>honeys,</b> and they can be used to assess the temperature sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>honeys.</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of rheological measurements conducted on three types of Polish honey: rape, multi-floral, and buckwheat <b>honeys.</b> <b>The</b> investigations involved identification of the properties of <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> in both liquefied (by heating) as well as crystallised states. Both steady shear as well as dynamic rheological tests were performed. As a result, it was possible to show that <b>the</b> liquefied <b>honeys</b> behave like Newtonian fluids. Good agreement of the results between the rotary shear and oscillation rotary tests was observed, thus fulfilling the Cox-Mertz rule. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> was subjected to qualitative scrutiny by analysing photographs of the crystals taken in the conditions of shearing interferometry. The quantitative analysis was made by presenting a numerical distribution of crystal colonies with reference to the maximum dimensions of individual crystals. The geometric measurements of the crystals were carried out using analiSIS software. In the crystallised form, the media showed a thixotropic effect, and their apparent viscosity was many times higher than the dynamic viscosity in the liquid state. After plasticising by deformation with an increasing shear rate of up to 450 s− 1, the equilibrium melting curves of <b>the</b> crystallised <b>honeys</b> were described by the Ostwald-de Waele model. One particular reason for the research was to show that the results obtained for <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> crystallised by <b>the</b> steady shear method, were qualitatively different from the results obtained in the dynamic measurements.
