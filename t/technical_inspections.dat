2500|$|These days [...] Scillonian III [...] runs between Penzance and Hugh Town, St. Mary's {{for about}} eight months only, from early spring (March/April) until autumn (October/November).

First, the power plant's status must be thoroughly evaluated by <b>technical</b> <b>inspections</b> and economic evaluations conducted by a committed group of nuclear power experts with experience in preservation management. Second, the IAEA mission advised the Philippines government on the general requirements for starting its nuclear power program, stressing that the proper infrastructure, safety standards, and knowledge be implemented. The IAEA's role did not extend to assessing whether the power plant is usable or how much the plant may cost to rehabilitate. On February 1, 2010, NAPOCOR started evaluating the financial plan of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), assessing that it may cost US$1 billion to rehabilitate the nuclear plant.|$|E
5000|$|Before the pre-qualifying session, FISA {{conducted}} <b>technical</b> <b>inspections</b> of all cars involved {{which led}} to a regulatory issue. If the stewards had found that the Andrea Moda C4B simply remained very similar to the Coloni C4 used by Coloni in 1991 (the only significant difference between the two chassis being the rear suspension system), they would have declared the car complied with the regulations. However, the governing body of Formula One found that the company that Sassetti bought from Coloni was not the one which constructed World Championship cars. Andrea Moda could thus no longer claim to be the continuation of the Coloni team, but a new team; in this case, their cars were no longer consistent with the regulations since the [...] "Concorde Agreement" [...] stipulated that a new team must use an original chassis. FISA therefore decided to exclude Andrea Moda Formula from the World Championship.|$|E
