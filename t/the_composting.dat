25|$|Composting toilets {{greatly reduce}} human waste volumes through psychrophilic, {{thermophilic}} or mesophilic composting. Keeping <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> chamber insulated and warm protects <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> process from slowing due to low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>composting</b> chamber can be {{constructed}} above or below ground level. It can be inside a structure or include a separate superstructure.|$|E
25|$|Composting toilets {{usually do}} not divert urine. Offering a {{waterless}} urinal {{in addition to the}} toilet can help keep excess amounts of urine out of <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> chamber.|$|E

40|$|The {{conclusion}} of a previous experiment showed that <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> quantity was <b>the</b> most determining parameter for the production volume of mushrooms, despite the addition of hemi cellulose as carbon source to <b>the</b> <b>compost.</b> <b>The</b> present experiment focuses on the mycelium action {{with regard to the}} carbon availability in <b>the</b> <b>compost.</b> Two factors were studied: (1) The effect of breaking the mycelium at a predetermined depth in <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> layer and before the first mushrooms flush. The hypothesis was that mycelium which is no longer in contact with the mycelium in the casing material would free the carbon nutrition in <b>the</b> lower <b>compost</b> layer. This increased amount of free carbon would be beneficial during the budding. It was expected that breaking <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> layer during <b>the</b> growth of the mycelium would increase the amount of buds. The observed effect of breaking the mycelium is that the formation of buds is delayed in comparison with the reference. (2) The effect of distributing <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> in a longer layer which remains partly uncovered by casing material. <b>The</b> <b>compost</b> is distributed into a thin layer with 2 - 3 times the surface area of the reference. The casing material just covers the same surface area of <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> as in <b>the</b> reference. The hypothesis is that the mycelium can exploit <b>the</b> total extended <b>compost</b> layer and increase the mushroom production in correlation with <b>the</b> volume of <b>compost</b> accessible, but independent of the surface of the casing material. The observed effect is that <b>the</b> longer <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> layer is, <b>the</b> lower the production gets. In summary, the depth of <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> layer is <b>the</b> most determining factor for yield...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study is to develop the biomass furnace {{combustor}} which can effectively use <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> as a fuel. Here, <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> which is made from pig's waste and has the calorific value of 2000 kcal/kg, is employed here. Emphasis is placed on the optimum conditions of fuel and air flow rates, moisture content of <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> and <b>the</b> corresponding combustion gas components and combustion gas temperature in the combustor. It is found from the study that (i) the self-combustion takes place less than 40 % of <b>the</b> <b>compost's</b> moisture content, (ii) the effective combustion is induced using the fine particles of <b>compost,</b> i. e., <b>the</b> pulverized <b>compost,</b> and (iii) <b>the</b> steady-state combustion is maintained by the relationship of air and compost rate...|$|R
25|$|Urine-diverting {{composting}} toilets {{are similar}} to UDDTs in that they also collect urine and feces separately. Treatment is achieved through <b>the</b> <b>composting,</b> a process quite different from pathogen removal by dehydration.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} gases may be emitted during <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> {{process that}} takes place in composting toilets: hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia, nitrous oxide (N2O) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These gases can potentially lead to complaints about odours. Some methane may also be present, but it is not odorous.|$|E
25|$|Recyclable {{materials}} {{include many}} kinds of glass, paper, and cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles, and electronics. <b>The</b> <b>composting</b> or other reuse of biodegradable waste—such as food or garden waste—is also considered recycling. Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>compost</b> {{obtained}} from composting organic fraction of Municipal solid waste, Paper & Pulp mill sludge and saw dust using different initial mix ratios (1 : 3, 1 : 6, 1 : 9) {{was used to}} evaluate phytotoxicity of green gram (Vigna radiata) using a seed germination method. The tests were repeated for <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> {{obtained from}} organic fraction of MSW and saw dust without the addition of sludge. The control germination test was carried out using deionised water. The results showed that <b>composting</b> generally reduced <b>the</b> phytotoxicity of the mixtures.

30|$|The {{organic matter}} content of <b>the</b> test <b>compost</b> was 18.06 % lesser than that of <b>the</b> control <b>compost</b> (21.17 %) after 28  days. Organic matter content {{decreases}} with <b>composting</b> as <b>the</b> degrading organisms utilize the organic carbon for energy generation and biosynthesis. This reduction of organic matter in <b>the</b> test <b>compost</b> explains <b>the</b> reduction in volume and mass of <b>the</b> <b>compost.</b>|$|R
30|$|At maturation, <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> {{material}} assumes dark {{to brown}} coloration, becomes nonsticky and odorless. At this stage, the moisture content of <b>the</b> <b>composted</b> materials is {{brought down by}} stopping the application of water. <b>The</b> <b>compost</b> materials are then sieved, and the worms remaining above the sieve are transferred to another vermicompost bed which is kept ready with partially decomposed mixture of organic waste. Since the numbers of earthworms increase considerably {{during the period of}} vermicomposting, the amount of organic waste can be increased accordingly under successive compostings. In case of larger production of composts, sometimes high intensities of light are provided from the top of <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> heap. Since most earthworms do not like high intensity of light, they tend to migrate from upper surface to lower depth of the heap. Vermicompost may then be harvested {{from the top of the}} heap. However, sieving will ensure availability of uniform-sized granular particles. This will also reduce the possibility of less matured materials to be mixed with <b>the</b> <b>compost.</b>|$|R
25|$|It can be {{beneficial}} to select the cover material carefully in order to not only cover the feces but also to inoculate them with beneficial soil microbes. In that case, finished compost {{could be used as}} cover material, although {{it is important that the}} users either do not touch this cover material with their bare hands or that <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> process is sufficiently controlled such that no pathogens remain in the material.|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale composting reactor was constructed for systematic {{studies of the}} effects of oxygen levels and temperature on carbon and nitrogen turnover in household waste <b>compost.</b> <b>The</b> reactor was equipped for independent control of oxygen level and temperature. The results presented showed that the performance of the reactor concerning uniform regulation of temperature and O 2 level in <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> matrix, gas and over time was good. The effect of three temperature regimes performed at the constant level of 16 % O 2 in <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> gas was studied in eight experimental runs in <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> reactor. <b>The</b> effect of reduced O 2 levels of 2. 5 and 1 % in <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> gas was studied in two experimental runs for one of the above temperature regimes. It was found that the highest rate of degradation was achieved when the temperature was actively regulated to below 40 °C during a low pH phase. The lowest degradation was obtained when the temperature was already regulated to 55 °C from the start. It was further found that reduced O 2 levels of 2. 5 and 1 % in <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> gas reduced <b>the</b> degradation rate and enhanced methane emission...|$|R
30|$|Combinations {{of waste}} {{materials}} {{played a major}} role in favoring microbial succession.

2500|$|Composting toilets {{differ from}} pit latrines and arborloos, which use less {{controlled}} decomposition {{and may not}} protect groundwater from nutrient or pathogen contamination or provide optimal nutrient recycling. They also differ from urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) where pathogen reduction is achieved through dehydration (also known by the more precise term [...] "desiccation") and where the feces collection vault is kept as dry as possible.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on the {{sorption}} of the sparingly water-soluble pesticide linuron in various types of soil with different levels of organic matter. The sorption isotherms of the pesticide were obtained in bath-equilibrium experiments and the data were fit to Freundlich and Dual Reactive Domain Models. In general, the sorption was the highest for the soil with greatest content of soil organic matter. The study also points out the global problem of handling the sewage sludge at wastewater treatment plants. We studied <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> made in Torun's Wastewater Treatment Plant during sludge fermentation. To characterise <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> organic matter UV-Vis and 13 C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy were used. Consequences of <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> use in agriculture are also discussed here.

2500|$|The $50-million {{building}} was {{designed in the}} interests of sustainability. It has a green roof and a reed water garden to reduce pollutants and improve drainage of storm water from the building.

2500|$|... "Self-contained" [...] {{composting}} toilets compost in {{a container}} within the toilet unit. They are slightly larger than a flush toilet, but use roughly the same floor space. Some units use fans for aeration, and optionally, heating elements to maintain optimum temperatures to hasten <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> process and to evaporate urine and other moisture. Operators of composting toilets commonly add {{a small amount of}} absorbent carbon material (such as untreated sawdust, coconut coir, peat moss) after each use to create air pockets to encourage aerobic processing, to absorb liquid and to create an odor barrier. This additive is sometimes referred to as [...] "bulking agent." [...] Some owner-operators use microbial [...] "starter" [...] cultures to ensure composting bacteria are in the process, although this is not critical.|$|E

40|$|Using {{denaturing}} gradient {{gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) and simultaneously measure the enzymatic activity of chitinase, we could link genetic and functional {{diversity of the}} indigenous microbial communities in compost samples. Two types of compost, a garden/park waste compost (D-Gro A) and a source separated organic household waste compost (Biovækst), showed different genetic diversity as measured by PCR-DGGE of total DNA extracted from <b>the</b> <b>composts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>composts</b> also had different chitinase activity, 0. 46 and 3. 97 µmole 4 MU/hour x g dry matter for the D-Gro A and Biovækst composts, respectively.
