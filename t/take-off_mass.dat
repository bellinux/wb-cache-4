40|$|Long-range {{hypervelocity}} {{vehicles are}} studied {{in terms of}} their motion in powered flight. Powered flight is analyzed for an idealized propulsion system which approximates rocket motors. Unpowered flight is characterized by a return to earth along a ballistic, skip, or glide trajectory. Only those trajectories are treated which yield the maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight. Aerodynamic heating is treated {{in a manner similar to}} that employed previously by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (NACA rep. 1381), with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles. As a final performance consideration, it is shown that on the basis of equal ratios of <b>mass</b> at <b>take-off</b> to <b>mass</b> at the end of powered flight, the hypervelocity vehicle compares favorably with the supersonic airplane for ranges in the neighborhood of and greater than one half the circumference of the earth. In the light of this and previous findings, it is concluded that the ballistic and glide vehicles have, in addition to the advantages usually ascribed to great speed, the attractive possibility of providing relatively efficient long-range flight...|$|R
40|$|Criteria is {{presented}} to assess {{the relative merits of}} different propulsion systems. Previous references focus mainly on subsonic or low supersonic flight speeds. The main focus here is on a higher range, from low supersonic to orbital velocities. Air breathing propulsion systems for hypersonic flight persent the engine designer with circumstances that differ in important fundamental ways from those encountered in engines designed for operation at subsonic or low supersonic speeds. This analysis highlights the importance of various features of hypersonic engine design. Since the performance of hypersonic engines are energy limited, unlike low speed engines which are stagnation pressure limited, the efficient use of the energy of the fuel used is critical to minimize the <b>take-off</b> fuel <b>mass</b> fraction of the vehicle. Furthermore, since the required energy increase of a vehicle per incremental speed change increases with speed, the engine must be designed to operate efficiently at high speed. An analysis of engine performance in terms of entropy changes of the flow passing through the engine allows comparison of various engine designs as well as a convenient method to determine the effect of individual engine component efficiencies on overall engine performance...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, the {{diffusion}} of telecommunications services has been considerably affected {{by the presence of}} critical mass and network externalities, and thus has shown the so-called "late take-off" phenomenon. However, as telecommunications networks evolve from circuit switching to packet switching, especially IP networks, and thus enabling diverse new services, it seems these traditional telecommunications diffusion patterns are changing. By comparing {{the diffusion}} of IP-based services with those of circuit-based services and durable goods, we have found the late take-off phenomenon is not involved in {{the diffusion of}} newly introduced IP-based services. Moreover, we concluded that the diffusion of IP-based services is much faster than that of durable goods, thus showing an "early take-off" phenomenon. Based on this empirical result, we suggest that telcos (telecommunications companies) and (ISPs) Internet service providers should pay as much attention to the growth stage as the introduction stage in their development, in order for their IP-based services to be successful in the market.

40|$|Conspicuous {{ornaments}} {{with little}} apparent cost are ubiquitous in nature, but their function and evolutionary origins are poorly understood. Most evolutionary models predict that ornament expression {{is associated with}} a cost and correlated with individual quality. I investigated ornamentation in the Least Auklet (Aethia pusilla), a seabird that displays multiple ornaments and a highly variable degree of ventral mottling. Phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the ancestral state is likely ventrally white for most seabird clades, but only mostly white in auklets. I measured several novel indicators of quality, including measures of take-off performance, and their relations to plumage and ornamentation. Power and acceleration, 0. 17 s after take-off were the most repeatable measures (repeatability= 75 %and 72 %, respectively). AIC-based model selection revealed significant interactions in the relationships of two low-cost ornaments (bill knob and auricular plume) with indicators of individual quality (hematocrit, leucocrit, mass/condition, and <b>take-off</b> acceleration). <b>Mass</b> was positively related to both bill knob and auricular plume size in subadults but not in adults, and inversely related to ventral plumage mottling in adults but not in subadults. I rejected the individual recognition hypothesis, which predicts a deviation from a multivariate normal distribution of ornaments that was not found in this study. The birds with less mottling are more conspicuous on land-where predation is a constant threat. Predation by Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) could be a vulerability handicap that ensures the reliability of the plumage as a social signal. Gulls attacked experimentally-whitened model auklets significantly less often than darkened models (P = 0. 036), as predicted if mottling is dependent on physical fitness and acts as a signal of escape potential. Also in accordance with prediction, auklets on a different island without aerial predators had significantly lighter plumage (P < 0. 001), suggesting a lower cost to conspicuousness in the absence of aerial predators. I did not observe a correlation between take-off acceleration and plumage mottledness, however. My results suggest that ornaments are related to condition in subadults, and that plumage functions as a vulnerability handicap in interactions with gulls...|$|R
40|$|Radar {{observations}} {{have consistently}} shown that high-altitude migratory flight in insects generally occurs after <b>mass</b> <b>take-off</b> at dusk or after take-off over a more extended period {{during the day}} (in association {{with the growth of}} atmospheric convection). In this paper, we focus on a less-studied third category of emigration – the ‘dawn take-off’ – as recorded by insect-monitoring radars during the summer months in southern England. In particular, we describe occasions when dawn emigrants formed notable layer concentrations centred at altitudes ranging from ca. 240 m to 700 m above ground, very probably due to the insects responding to local temperature maxima in the atmosphere, such as the tops of inversions. After persisting for several hours through the early morning, the layers eventually merged into the insect activity building up later in the morning (from 06. 00 – 08. 00 h onwards) in conjunction with the development of daytime convection. The species forming the dawn layers have not been positively identified, but their masses lay predominantly in the 16 – 32 mg range, and they evidently formed a fauna quite distinct from that in flight during the previous night. The displacement and common orientation (mutual alignment) characteristics of the migrants are described...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a new {{approach}} to the selection of key fan design parameters is presented and a methodology to optimise engine operation for minimum take-off noise is developed. These techniques are applied to the detailed design of a fan system for the Cambridge-MIT Silent Aircraft Initiative engine to which ultra low noise is the principle design objective. Reduction of jet mixing noise is identified as being crucial to the design process leading to jet area at take-off having to be increased significantly compared to current trends. Whilst increasing the number of engines from two to three and optimisation of the departure profile reduced this area increase, the introduction of variable cycle technology is required in order to deliver low cruise fuel burn. A variable area nozzle, identified as the most promising technology, is linked to operation of the fan through a simple model. This is used to show {{that it is possible to}} enable large increases in exit nozzle area at take-off without compromising fan performance at cruise. For the fan design, stage loading is shown to be a critical parameter as it impacts competing requirements. Increasing loading increases efficiency and part speed capacity but makes designing fixed outlet guide vanes harder. The method to optimise the departure profile was combined with the completed fan design and extended to include fan and airframe noise sources. The results of this show that by modifying the nozzle area at all times during <b>take-off</b> to maximise <b>mass</b> flow rate, the final podded SAI design is estimated to have a noise footprint of approximately 65. 5 dBA outside the baseline airport at take-off. This leads to an ICAO take-off certification noise level of approximately 73 EPNdB at both flyover and sideline, 23 dB below existing requirements at each measuring location.

40|$|In the {{conceptual}} design {{phase of a}} turboprop aircraft, the configuration is determined and primary components like the wing, fuselage and propulsion are sized. Exact subsystem performance remains unknown. Propeller performance is estimated to size the aircraft propulsion. This thesis explores the consequences on the aircraft’s maximumtake-off mass if the propeller estimation is removed {{in favor of a}} higher fidelity design approach. The influence is determined by implementing an optimization routine whichminimizes aircraft maximum <b>take-off</b> <b>mass</b> by adjusting the propeller design. A rapid conceptual design tool is used to establish the interdependence between propeller and aircraft: ‘The Aircraft Design Initiator’. This tool is able to quickly conceive realistic aircraft designs to investigate the effect of new technologies and aircraft configurations. The Initiator is employed to create a design objective. This objective contains the information needed to achieve an optimumbetween propeller aerodynamic efficiency and its implication on the mass of the propulsion unit. These two factors determine the fuel required for the mission, as well as the mass of the propeller engine combination. In turn, these masses impact the maximum <b>take-off</b> <b>mass</b> of the aircraft. To establish a propeller design, a set of tools is developed. Aerodynamic performance is calculated from blade element momentum theory. Mass estimation is performed by a class II sizing approach. A limited structural tool is used to size the propeller blade root. Propeller optimization is performed with two strategies: a gradient descent optimization and a genetic algorithm. It is concluded that the propeller design space features a lot of local minima and is poorly suited for gradient based optimization. Genetic optimization is better suited for propeller design. This strategy results in certain conclusions regarding propeller design influences on the aircraft’smaximumtake-off mass. The influence of the propeller on the maximumtake-off mass is determined to be less than 1 % compared to initial performance estimations. The applicability to conceptual aircraft design is therefore limited. However, the results do clearly show the influence of the propeller design parameters on the aircraft’s maximum <b>take-off</b> <b>mass...</b>|$|E
