5|$|This {{species is}} {{characterized}} by its very small peridia (dimensions 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth x 2–4mm tall) with a color that may range from white to grey to pale buff, but never yellow – helping distinguish it from C. laeve. The peridia are , thin-walled (150–180µm at the lip, approximately 300µm thick {{at the edge of}} the lip), <b>tomentose</b> on the outer side and smooth on the inner side, and taper to a narrow base. The peridioles range in width between 0.5–1.25mm broad. Basidiospores have dimensions of 4–5 by 7–8µm.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} <b>tomentose</b> to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E
5|$|In all {{subspecies}} but the type, {{the lower}} stamens are also hairy. In subsp. crassifolium, the hairiness is less dense and often {{absent from the}} upper part of the anthers, while lower leaves are hardly decurrent and have longer petioles. In subsp. giganteum, the hairs are densely white <b>tomentose,</b> and lower leaves strongly decurrent. Subsp. crassifolium also differs from the type in having slightly larger flowers, which measure 15–30mm wide, whereas in the type they are 12–20mm in diameter. Both subsp. giganteum and subsp. crassifolium were originally described as species. Due to its morphological variation, V.thapsus has had a great many subspecies described. A recent revision led its author to maintain V.giganteum but sink V.crassifolium into synonymy.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on the stem. B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half of the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or <b>tomentose</b> cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E
25|$|Quercus agrifolia var. oxyadenia. Southwesternmost California (San Diego area), Baja California. Leaves {{that are}} <b>tomentose</b> abaxially, with densely {{interwoven}} hairs. It prefers granitic soils; hybrids with Q. kelloggii known.|$|E
500|$|Peridia are 3–7mm in {{diameter}} x 3–8mm tall, cup-shaped, short and cylindrical with roughly parallel side walls. The <b>tomentose</b> exterior surface is tan to yellow when young and whiter in age. Young specimens have a coarsely <b>tomentose</b> epiphragm (membranous cover) that soon disappears. [...] The peridioles are 1–2mm broad, tan to white in color, disc-shaped, and wrinkled when dry. This species grows on material like twigs, lignin-rich vegetable debris, wood chips, old matting, or manure.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} [...] high. The conical cap is [...] high and [...] wide at the widest point. The cap surface {{features}} pits and ridges, {{formed by the}} intersection of 16–22 primary vertical ridges and frequent shorter, secondary vertical ridges, with occasional sunken, horizontal ridges. The cap {{is attached to the}} stipe with a sinus about 2–4mm deep and 2–4mm wide. The ridges are smooth or very finely <b>tomentose</b> (covered with densely matted filaments). They are initially pale yellowish, becoming pale tan, then grayish brown in maturity, eventually darkening to nearly black when dried. They are flattened when young but sometimes become sharpened or eroded in maturity. The pits are somewhat elongated vertically (particularly when mature). They are finely <b>tomentose,</b> yellowish when young, becoming pale tan to pale grayish brown. Fruit bodies are often found in a transitional stage where {{the upper part of the}} cap has turned dark while the lower part remains light.|$|E
500|$|The cap is {{initially}} convex, {{but as it}} matures the center forms a depression and the outer edges rise until it assumes {{the shape of a}} shallow funnel; its final width is typically between [...] The cap margin is strongly curled inward; when young, it is <b>tomentose</b> (covered with a thick matting of hairs), forming a veil-like structure that partly covers up the gills. This tomentum diminishes with age. The cap surface is at first similarly <b>tomentose,</b> but eventually the hairs wear off, leaving the surface more or less smooth. The surface starts off somewhat sticky with clear concentric rings of darker shade (a zonate pattern); these rings, especially the outer ones, usually fade in maturity. The cap color is pinkish-orange to pale dull pink, becoming orange to whitish toward the margin as the pink gradually fades. The white to flesh-colored flesh is firm and brittle, but becomes flaccid in age. The latex that is produced when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured is white to cream, and does not change color with prolonged exposure to air, nor does it stain the gills. It has an acrid taste, with a slight to pungent odor.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Phellodon species have caps and stipe, and thus {{fall into the}} general {{category}} [...] "stipitate hydnoid fungi". The cap surfaces are initially velvety to <b>tomentose,</b> eventually becoming matted. The surface is rough, with pits and ridges, and sometimes with concentrical zones of color or texture. The color can vary considerably, from cream to yellowish, brownish, greenish, greyish or black. Neighboring fruitbodies can fuse together, forming intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. Alexander H. Smith wrote of P.tomentosus, [...] "It often occurs in large mats of fused caps almost producing a ceiling over {{large areas of the}} moss under conifers." [...] Phellodon fruitbodies can envelop nearby grass or twigs. The stipe is thickly <b>tomentose</b> or smooth, typically the same color as the cap or darker. In P.niger, the outer covering of the stipe is a thick felty layer of mycelium that absorbs water like a sponge. [...] The hymenophore (the fertile, spore-bearing surface) is {{on the underside of the}} cap. The spines become grey at maturity. In conditions of high humidity, P.niger can form striking drops of black liquid on the actively growing caps.|$|E
500|$|Banksia prionotes grows as a tree up to [...] high in {{southern}} parts of its distribution, but in northern parts {{it is usually}} a shorter tree or spreading shrub, reaching about [...] in height; it diminishes in size as the climate becomes warmer and drier further north. It has thin, mottled grey, smooth or grooved bark, and <b>tomentose</b> young stems. The alternate dull green leaves are [...] long, and [...] wide, with toothed leaf margins made up of triangular lobes, and often a wavy surface.|$|E
500|$|The second through fourth dorsal segments, or terga, are {{elongated}} {{and parallel}} {{to each other}} in orientation, separated by deep grooves. [...] There are <b>tomentose</b> hairs in much of these grooves. [...] There is white banding along the sides of the segments, towards the sides and posterior. [...] The first tergum has a light covering of pale, erect hairs. [...] It is more dense and <b>tomentose</b> at the lateral aspects. [...] There is pale, barely noticeable pubescence on the second through fifth terga. [...] There are depressions along the sides of the apical margin, which lack fascia. [...] There are well defined punctate markings on each tergum. [...] These are deep and distinctive and of variable size. [...] They are close together along the sides and towards the back of the dorsal segments. [...] They are uniformly distributed and coarse textured on the fifth tergum. There are pale hairs covering the posterior edge of the sixth segment densely enough to hide the surface. [...] Yellowish-white modified scopal hairs for carrying pollen yellowish-white [...] hairs, which are pale initially, darken in color along 6th sternal segment. [...] Deep, coarse puncture marks on the sterna are uniformly distributed and closely spaced. [...] The apical margins have a hyaline appearance and are depressed.|$|E
500|$|The cap of B.auripes has a convex shape before {{flattening}} {{somewhat in}} maturity, and attains {{a diameter of}} [...] The cap surface is dry, with a texture ranging from finely <b>tomentose</b> (hairy) to nearly smooth, and colored yellowish brown to chestnut brown or grayish brown. The cap color fades with age. Similarly, the flesh—initially yellow—fades to whitish in maturity. Unlike some other Boletus species, in B.auripes neither the surfaces nor the internal tissue turns blue when injured or exposed to air. The odor and taste of the mushroom are not distinctive.|$|E
500|$|Lactarius alnicola is {{classified}} in subsection Scrobiculati of section Piperites in the genus Lactarius. Species in this subsection {{are characterized by}} having a milk-white to creamy or whey-like latex that soon turns yellow upon exposure to air, and which may stain freshly cut surfaces of the fruit body yellow. Further, the cap margin is bearded, [...] (covered with sharp, straight, and stiff hairs), and coarsely <b>tomentose</b> or woolly when young. Other species in the subsection include L.subpaludosus, L.delicatus, L.torminosus, L.payettensis, L.gossypinus, L.pubescens, L.resimus and L.scrobiculatus (the type species of the subsection).|$|E
500|$|Exsudoporus floridanus {{differs from}} E.frostii {{in having a}} lighter cap color and in {{the texture of the}} cap surface: it is <b>tomentose</b> (covered with dense, short, soft, matted hairs) or [...] (like velvet), {{compared}} to the relatively smooth surface of E.frostii. Singer notes that although the physical characteristics between the two taxa may be blurred and are hard to define, the area of origin can reliably distinguish them: E.floridanus is found on shaded lawns and scrubland in open oak stands in non-tropical regions of Florida, typically on grassy or sandy soil, where it fruits between May and October.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Morchella sextelata are [...] high with a conical cap that is [...] high and [...] wide at the widest point. The cap surface {{features}} pits and ridges, {{formed by the}} intersection of 12–20 primary vertical ridges and frequent shorter, secondary vertical ridges, with occasional sunken, horizontal ridges. The cap {{is attached to the}} stipe with a sinus about 2–4mm deep and 2–4mm wide. The ridges are smooth or very finely <b>tomentose</b> (covered with densely matted filaments). They are initially colorless, becoming pale tan, then dark grayish brown in maturity, eventually darkening to nearly black. They are flattened when young but sometimes become sharpened or eroded in maturity. The pits are somewhat elongated vertically. They are smooth, brownish to yellowish tan to pinkish to buff.|$|E
500|$|Hydnellum diabolus (the species epithet {{is given}} the neuter diabolum in some publications) has a very similar appearance, {{so much so that}} some {{consider}} it and H.peckii to be synonymous; H.diabolus is said to have a sweetish pungent odor that is lacking in H.peckii. The differences between the two species are amplified in mature specimens: H.diabolus has an irregularly thickened stem, while the stem of H.peckii is thickened by a [...] "definite spongy layer". Additionally, old specimens of H.peckii have a smooth cap, while H.diabolus is <b>tomentose.</b> The related species H.pineticola also exudes pink droplets of liquid when young and moist. Commonly found growing under conifers in northeastern North America, H.pineticola tastes [...] "unpleasant", but not acrid. Fruit bodies tend to grow singly, rather than in fused clusters, and, unlike H.peckii, they do not have bulbous stems.|$|E
500|$|The cap of Volvopluteus michiganensis {{is between}} [...] in diameter, {{more or less}} ovate or conical when young, then expands to convex or flat. It can have low, broad umbo at center in old specimens; the surface is {{markedly}} viscid in fresh basidiocarps and covered with radially arranged fibrills; the cap is ash gray, similar {{to the color of}} Tricholoma terreum. The gills are crowded, free from the stipe, ventricose, up to [...] broad; white when young turning pink with age. The stipe is [...] long and [...] wide, club-shaped with a bulbous base; the surface is white, smooth or <b>tomentose.</b> The volva is sac-like, white and has a smooth surface. The context is white in the stipe and cap and it does not change when bruised or exposed to air. The smell was recorded as [...] "earthy, fragrant"; the taste was not recorded. The spore print color was not recorded, but it is assumed to be pinkish-brown.|$|E
500|$|The cap of {{the fruit}} body (technically an apothecium) is up to [...] high by [...] wide and is reddish brown, and {{somewhat}} saddle-shaped with 2–4 lobes. It frequently develops blackish-brown spots on the surface. During {{the development of the}} mushroom, the periphery of the cap grows into the stipe below, to form a hollow, roughly bell-shaped structure with the fertile spore-bearing surface (the hymenium) on the outside; as the surface growth of the hymenium continues to expand even after joining to the stipe, the hymenium can no longer follow and it arches up into folds and pads. The stipe, typically between [...] high and [...] thick, can be various colors from reddish brown to whitish or even bluish, but is typically lighter colored than the cap. The stipe is minutely <b>tomentose</b> – covered with a layer of very fine hairs. The context is thin (1–2mm) and brittle. G.infula does not have any appreciable odor or taste.|$|E
500|$|The gills have an adnate, , or shallowly decurrent {{attachment}} to the stem, and are initially closely spaced before becoming well-spaced at maturity. They have a whitish to pale gray color, and will stain gray when they are bruised. There are three or four tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) interspersed between the gills. The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, and tapers upward so that the stem apex is slightly thinner than the base. It can be straight or curved, has cartilage-like flesh, and is hollow in maturity. When growing on soft, well-decayed wood, the stem often penetrates deeply into the substrate. The stem is pinkish-brown in color, and the lower half is <b>tomentose</b> – densely covered with white, woolly hairs. The mushroom has a yeast-like odor and a mild taste; its edibility is unknown, {{but it is not}} considered poisonous.|$|E
500|$|The pores on the {{underside}} of the cap are yellowish and angular, measuring [...] wide, and formed by tubes that extend [...] deep. These pores have a slightly decurrent attachment to the stem (extending down its length). Young specimens have a whitish fibrous partial veil that protects the developing pores; as the cap expands it rips the veil, which remains as a grayish ring on the stem. The stem is [...] long, and [...] thick, roughly cylindrical in shape, or sometimes with a bulbous bottom so as to be somewhat club-shaped. The stem surface is <b>tomentose,</b> with scales at the top, and a ring on the upper half of the stem. Below the ring the stem is fibrillose, covered with a mat of soft hairs. Its color at the top is yellow, but with wine-red to reddish-brown scales below, underlaid with a pale yellow to grayish color. The stem is usually solid, rarely hollow. The tissue of all parts of the fruit body—cap, pores, and stem—will turn brownish shortly after being bruised or injured.|$|E
500|$|Suillellus luridus is a stout fungus {{with a thick}} yellow-olive to olive-brown convex cushion-shaped {{cap that}} can reach [...] in diameter. The cap colour tends to darken with age, and regions of red, orange, purple, brown, or olive-green can develop in maturity. The cap surface is <b>tomentose</b> (velvety), {{becoming}} smoother with old age, and sticky in wet weather. The pore surface is initially dark red before turning orange-red, and has a lighter-coloured zone encircling the margin. There are 2–3 circular pores per millimetre, and the tubes are [...] deep. The tubes are shorter around the cap margin {{and close to the}} stem, where they form a circular depression. Initially pale yellow, the tubes gradually become olive-yellow and then bluish-green upon exposure to air. A characteristic feature is the presence of a maroon layer between the tubes and the flesh. The thick stem is [...] tall and [...] wide, and bears a distinctive orange-red meshlike pattern on a paler yellowish or ochre background. The flesh is yellowish, with red marks in the cap, and stains an intense dark blue when bruised or broken. There is a faint sour smell, and the taste is described as mild.|$|E
500|$|The metasomal segment {{the first}} tergum is densely covered in long, white hairs. [...] There are {{circumscribed}} {{areas on the}} second and third terga which are covered very slightly with pale and barely noticeable hairs. [...] At the 4th and 5th terga, these pale hairs are more evident, longer and stiffer. [...] The first three tergal segments are banded with white stripes along lateral apical aspects. [...] There are deep grooves at the bases of all but the first tergum. [...] These segments also show white banding. [...] The margins are keel-like at the base. [...] The apices have yellowish, hyaline appearance. The first and last terga have Punctate markings, which are sharply demarcated and closely spaced together. [...] In between, coarse puncture marks are present of the other terga. [...] They are deep and spaced at regular intervals, with spacings roughly one diameter of a puncture mark away from then next. [...] The sixth tergum has small punctate marks close enough together that they are essentially contiguous, particularly towards the midline. [...] The sixth tergum segment is vertically arranged. [...] It is banded with white fascia at the base. [...] It is covered elsewhere in pale <b>tomentose</b> hairs which darken medially. [...] The seventh tergal segment is present transversely, but not appreciated medially. [...] The first three sternal segments are clearly visualized and swollen at the edges. [...] The apical margins are close covered with dense long white hairs. The fourth segment is unmodified but retracted, so non-apparent.|$|E

2500|$|V. rotundifolia is a {{sprawling}} shrub that can grow {{as tall as}} 1.5 m though it typically ranges from 0.5 to 1 m in height. As a product of its rapid nodal rooting, the plant can form dense mats reaching in excess of 10 m from the parent plant. New stems are green, square and fleshy initially before maturing brown and woody. Older, large-diameter stems are covered with heavily fissured bark. Running horizontal stems produce frequent upright branches. Leaves are strongly aromatic, intensifying when crushed. The majority of leaves are simple, but they can occasionally be palmate trifoliate or 2-leaved. Leaves measure 2 to 6.5cm in length and 1-4.5cm in width. Leaf margins are entire. The leaf shape varies from ovate to obovate with acute bases and obtuse apexes. Occasionally, leaf apexes are acute or emarginate. Upper leaf surfaces are dark green whereas lower leaf surfaces range in color from silver to white to light green; all leaf surfaces are <b>tomentose.</b> Petiole bases are typically somewhat purple and measure 0 to 1cm in length. Blades are cupped downward slightly. Leaf veins are lighter green than surrounding tissue. Flowers are borne in indeterminate panicles that may be terminal or axillary. Infloresences measure 3 to 7cm in length. The calyx is cup-shaped and 4 to 4.5cm long. Flowers are zygomorphic, purple to blue-purple, and short pedunculate. They are two-lipped and funnel-form (measuring 8mm in length). Four stamens are didynamous and extend beyond the corolla tube (measuring 9 to 10mm). The style extends beyond the stamens (total length: 12mm). Pollen is tricolpate. Ovaries consist of two carpels with each containing two single seeded locules. Fruits are globose drupes that are green while immature but turn yellow and red before maturing to bluish black. The fruits are frequently incorrectly characterized in the literature as [...] "seeds or berries". Each drupe contains a maximum of four seeds though there are usually fewer {{as a result of}} seed abortion. Each seed is encapsulated in a separate compartment. Endosperm is absent. Seeds germinate into tender seedlings that bear two cotyledons and quickly develop two red-margined true leaves. Ploidy level is 2n = 32, 34*.|$|E
