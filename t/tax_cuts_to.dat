Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E
5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E
40|$|Motivated by the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) of 2003, {{the effects}} of capital income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> are {{investigated}} in an economy with heterogeneous households and a representative, mature firm. Dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> contrary <b>to</b> capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> lead <b>to</b> a decrease in investment and capital. This is because they increase {{the market value of}} existing capital and households require a higher return to hold this additional wealth. In line with empirical evidence, the model predicts substantial increases in dividends and stock prices. Overall, the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> lead <b>to</b> a welfare reduction equivalent to a consumption drop of 0. 5...|$|R

40|$|We {{test whether}} {{executive}} stock ownership affects firm payouts using the 2003 dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> identify an exogenous {{change in the}} after-tax value of dividends.

25|$|For the {{advanced}} economies, {{while there was}} much talk of reforming the international financial system after the Asian crises, {{it was not until}} the market failure of the 2000 dot-com bubble that there was a significant shift away from free market policies. In America there was a return by the government of George W.

40|$|Recent {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to enact either a temporary or a permanent capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> The former would probably gain revenue in the first 2 years but lose that revenue and more, most likely within the following 3 years. H. R. 3090, passed by the House, would lower the top tax rate from 20 % to 18 % for assets held at least a year. The Senate Finance Committee version of H. R. 3090, does not reduce capital gains taxes. A capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> appears the least likely of any permanent <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> stimulate the economy in the short run; a temporary capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is unlikely <b>to</b> provide any stimulus. Permanently lower capital gains taxes can contribute to economic efficiency in some ways and detract from it in others.

Reverting to Clinton-era tax rates for these taxpayers would mean increases in the top rates to 36% and 39.6% from 33% and 35%. This would raise approximately $850 billion in revenue over a decade. It would also mean raising the tax rate on investment income, which is highly concentrated among the wealthy, to 20% from 15%.|$|E
25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics {{that you had to}} offer <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> win; everyone from Mike Harris to Bill Clinton had campaigned on reducing the tax burden on the middle class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public health care and education services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking your opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.|$|E
25|$|Muldoon {{initially}} opposed indirect consumer taxation on {{the basis}} that it would penalise poor people and increase inflation due to compensatory wage increases. However, in May 1979 he attempted to increase tax revenue by levying 10–20% taxes {{on a wide range of}} goods, including petrol, lawnmowers, caravans and boats. The taxes were criticised for being discriminatory, ineffective and a quick means of raising more revenue for the government without any accompanying fundamental reform of the taxation system – there were no income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> reflect the shift to indirect taxation. The immediate result of the boat and caravan levy, in particular, was the decimation of both industries as potential buyers could not afford to pay the 20% tax on top of the construction costs; the tax also had the additional effect of adding to the numbers of unemployed as boat and caravan builders could not pay their employees because of the order cancellations.|$|E
