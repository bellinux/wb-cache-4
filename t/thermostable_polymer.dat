40|$|Deep {{submicron}} Al-AlOx-Nb tunnel junctions {{and single}} electron transistors with niobium islands were fabricated by {{electron beam gun}} shadow evaporation. Using stencil masks consisting of the <b>thermostable</b> <b>polymer</b> polyethersulfone (PES) and germanium, high quality niobium patterns with good superconducting properties and a gap energy of up to 2 Delta = 2. 5 meV for the niobium were achieved. The I(U) characteristics of the transistors show special features due to tunneling of single Cooper pairs and significant gate modulation in both the superconducting and the normal state.

40|$|We have {{developped}} a novel lift-off {{process for}} fabrication {{of high quality}} superconducting submicron niobium structures. The process makes use of a <b>thermostable</b> <b>polymer</b> with a high transition temperature T_{g}= 235 C and an excellent chemical stability. The superconducting critical temperature of 100 nm wide niobium lines is above 7 K. An example of shadow evaporation of a Nb-Cu submicron hybrid structure is given. A potential application {{of this process is}} the fabrication of very small single electron devices using refratory metals.

40|$|Hyperbranched polyesters {{containing}} labile triazene {{units in}} the main chain have been characterized according to their photochemically and thermally induced decomposition behavior. Irradiation with UV light results in a first order decomposition behavior with half-time of 6 to 48 min depending {{on the structure of}} the repeating unit. Thermal decomposition starts at about 160 C, and about 50 % mass loss are achieved after 15 min at 250 C. Homogeneous incorporation of these globular, functional polymers in <b>thermostable</b> <b>polymer</b> matrices (polyimides and benzocyclobutane-based polymers) was possible. Smooth films from blends of thermostable matrix and up to 50 % hyperbranched polymers could be prepared. The hyperbranched component could be destroyed selectively, and the resulting porous matrix has been studied as insulating material for microelectronic multilayer applications.

40|$|Abstract. Two {{kinds of}} β-glucan were {{extracted}} from barley flour and bran, with {{the purity of}} 75. 3 % and 76. 2 % respectively. Molecular size characterization was caarried out with high performance size exclusion chromatograhy combined with a multi-angle laser light scattering and a refractive index detector (HPSEC-MALL), the molecular weight (Mw) of β-glucan from barley flour and bran was 2. 262 × 104, 7. 128 × 104. X-ray diffraction and thermodynamics tests indicated that all β-glucans were noncrystalline but <b>thermostable</b> <b>polymers.</b> Differential scanning of calorimetry (DSC) showed the presence of peak related with water loss, confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis(TGA), the β-glucan from barley bran had higher onset temperature(T 0 = 49. 89 ˚C) and peak temperature(TP= 197 ˚C). In scanning electron microscope（SEM）observations, the β-glucan from barley bran showed more tight surface,which could be caused by higher molecular weight...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFluorinated {{polymers}} {{are usually}} synthesized by radical (co) polymerization of fluoroalkenes. These interesting materials have outstanding properties such as thermal stability, chemical inertness (to solvents, oils, water, acids, and bases), low refractive index, permittivity, dissipation factor and water absorptivity, {{as well as}} excellent weatherability, durability, and resistance to oxidation. Actually, two families of fluorinated polymers can be considered: (1) in first group, the fluorinated groups are located on the polymer backbone and their chemical inertness, thermal stability, low refractive index, and dielectric constant are explored, and (2) the second group contains a fluorinated dangling group that induces enhanced surface properties. Various strategies of synthesis via radical conventional or controlled copolymerizations are proposed; {{some of them are}} well-architectured fluoropolymers (block, graft, alternated, and so on) just like their properties and applications ranging from energy-related-materials (fuel cell membranes, separators for lithium ion batteries, piezoelectric devices) to original fluorinated elastomers, thermoplastic elastomers, surfactants, <b>thermostable</b> <b>polymers,</b> and optical devices...|$|R
40|$|Epoxy resins are an {{important}} class of <b>thermostable</b> <b>polymers,</b> widely used in structural applications or as adhesives. However, the low fracture resistance is their main weakness in many applications. Due to this fact, this study aims to modify a polymer matrix based on a novolac epoxy resin with an organo siloxane (AMS). The final properties of cured epoxys resins {{are affected by the}} curing process and the coatings modified in this study with AMS and cured with acid catalyst presented greater resistance to thermal decomposition compared to that cured with Aradur, demonstrating a higher content of crosslinking in the siloxane polyether and the novolak epoxy resin chains. This epoxy matrix modified was used to prepare coatings whose films applied to 1020 steel surfaces presented a resistance of 1010 Ohm-cm- 2. This resistance value is one order of magnitude greater than that of epoxy resins films modified by siloxanes in published studies, which demonstrates a potential economy in terms of maintenance costs of metal structures and machines used in power plants (UTE). To obtain the developed inks in pilot plant scale, it was used an aromatic polyamine as curing agent, characterizing the product obtained as an epoxy bi-component paint for commercial use...|$|R
40|$|We have {{proposed}} free-standing centimeter-sized ultra-thin films (nanosheets) for biomedical applications. Such nanosheets exhibit unique properties such as transparency, flexibility, and good adhesiveness. However, {{they are only}} easily adhered to broad and flat surfaces due to their dimensions. To this end, we recently proposed an innovative nanomaterial: the nanosheets fragmented into submillimeter-size pieces. Intriguingly, such fragmented nanosheets could be adhered to uneven and irregular surfaces in addition to flat surfaces in a spread-out “patchwork” manner. We herein review the fabrication procedure and characterization of fragmented nanosheets composed of biodegradable polyesters and <b>thermostable</b> bio-friendly <b>polymers,</b> and their biomedical applications in burn therapy and antithrombotic coating using a “patchwork coating”...|$|R
40|$|Luminescent {{thin films}} {{composed}} of <b>thermostable</b> lanthanide coordination <b>polymers</b> on glass electrodes were prepared using a novel combination of micelle reactions and electrochemical deposition techniques. The micelle-encapsulated luminescent polymers {{were obtained by}} the polymerization of [Eu(hfa) (3) ] (hfa=hexafluoroacetylacetonate) with bridging phosphine oxide ligands in micelles using a redox-active ferrocenyl-containing surfactant in water. Films were electrochemically deposited on indium tin oxide coated glass electrodes by potentiostatic polarization of micelle-encapsulated Eu-III coordination polymers. The luminescence properties of the electrochemically deposited films were characterized by measuring their emission spectra, emission lifetimes and emission quantum yields...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We have studied, by X-ray {{absorption}} {{near edge}} spectroscopy (XANES), {{the properties of}} untreated and chromium metallized surface of polyphenylquinoxaline (PPQ). Using reference compounds such as 22 -biquinoline, we {{point out that the}} terminal phenyl rings of the polymer are normal to the surface of pristine PPQ. Moreover, it is shown that chromium/polymer interaction induces a reorientation of these terminal phenyl rings parallel to the polymer unit mean plane. <b>Thermostable</b> insulating <b>polymers</b> have become widely studied materials in microelectronics [l]. In particular, multichip modules based on 3 D copper wiring networks insulated by thin polymer layers are the subject of very active research [2]. Polyphenylquinoxaline (PPQ) (Fig. l), because of its remarkable dielectric properties (EC~, tanBe 10 - 3) [3] is especially suitable for this kind of device. Chemical structure of polyphenylquinoxaline. To improve the relatively poor adhesion of copper on PPQ, we have considered two different ways of surface preparation prior to copper deposition. The first one consists in a plasma treatment of the polymer surface prior to metallization (Cu/PPQ plasma systems) [4]. The consequences of such a treatment on the XANES spectra of the polymer have been discussed elsewhere 151. The second one consists in evaporating a thin chromium layer prior to copper deposition (Cu/Cr/PPQ systems). XANES results corresponding to the first step of Cr deposition are reported hereafter. XANES spectra were recorded for two X-ray incidence angles using two detection modes. For their interpretation, we have also studied reference molecuIes such as 2, 2 '-biquinoline (Fig. 2) or benzene [6]. Article published online by EDP Sciences and available a...|$|R
