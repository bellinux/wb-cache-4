Further, there are expressions as 'three joints' and 'nine resemblances' (of the dragon), to wit: from head to shoulder, from shoulder to breast, from breast to tail. These are the joints; as to the nine resemblances, they are the following: <b>his</b> antlers resemble <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a stag, <b>his</b> head that <b>of</b> a camel, <b>his</b> eyes <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a demon, <b>his</b> neck that <b>of</b> a snake, <b>his</b> belly that <b>of</b> a clam (shen, 蜃), <b>his</b> scales <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a carp, <b>his</b> claws <b>those</b> <b>of</b> an eagle, <b>his</b> soles <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a tiger, <b>his</b> ears <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a cow.
