On the January 28 episode of Impact!, Gayda came down to ringside during a Jarrett versus Jay Lethal match, to hand an audio tape to Kim. She then left, with a {{confused}} Kim soon following.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} style also rates highly; {{writing in}} The Guardian, Mark Lawson called the pilot [...] "glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work". Wry reference {{is made to}} Deed and Jo's relationship, with Lawson writing that Deed [...] "is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC". Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian calls it [...] "talkative in the way television plays used to be when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to say. But it is notable that, in a profession famous for obfuscation, Deed uses only the most pellucid English". Banks-Smith has also drawn attention to the masculine skew the programme has; [...] "Judge John Deed [...] is catnip to the ladies. These are [...] called Georgie, Charlie, Jo and—when Rita defies abbreviation—Coop".|$|E
500|$|Peel's {{view was}} contested by Anderson's and Cull's {{belief that the}} series, with its bespectacled main {{character}} of Joe McClaine, can increase the self-confidence of young viewers who wear glasses: [...] "Suddenly they were proud because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> in common with Joe 90." [...] Since the series' first appearance, the epithet [...] "Joe 90" [...] has become a popular term of endearment for both children and adults with glasses reminiscent of Joe's (such as snooker player Dennis Taylor). During UK repeats in the 1990s, similarities were drawn between Joe and then-Prime Minister John Major, also known for wearing large spectacles. Jeff Evans, writer of The Penguin TV Companion, criticises the plot element of the glasses, writing, [...] "Joe simply dons a pair of scientific glasses, making him look like the class swot than a secret agent." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the {{initiation}} of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike on November 5, 2007, Abrams, himself a WGA member, told Variety that while he would not render writing services for the film and intended to walk the picket line, he did not expect the strike to impact his directing of the production. In the final {{few weeks before the}} strike and start of production, Abrams and Lindelof polished the script for a final time. Abrams was frustrated that he was unable to alter lines during the strike, whereas normally they {{would have been able to}} improvise new ideas during rehearsal, although Lindelof acknowledged they could dub some lines in post-production. Orci and Kurtzman were able to stay on set without strikebreaking because they were also executive producers on the film; they could [...] "make funny eyes and faces at the actors whenever they had a problem with the line and sort of nod when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> better". Abrams was able to alter a scene where Spock combats six Romulans from a fistfight to a gunfight, having decided there were too many physical brawls in the film.|$|E
500|$|... "The Return of Harmony" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the second season. According to Thiessen, the Hub and its parent company Hasbro had [...] "approved the season two before we were done with season one; they knew <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> good on their hands." [...] He explained, [...] "they saw [...] of the show early on, which is [...] rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it {{because they want to}} know what the numbers are, but they, I guess, a bit of a risk on their behalf, but I'm glad they did." [...] The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie [...] According to Thiessen, the joke was an [...] "afterthought"; originally, there was going to be a more {{elaborate}} ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created. During the animation stage, one of the directors noted that the scene was [...] "kind of like the ending to A New Hope" [...] and so, the decision was made to create [...] "scene for scene" [...] parody of the original.|$|E
2500|$|... (2007) Experts {{studied the}} {{protective}} properties of full face masks. The measurements {{showed that the}} workers were adequately protected. The duration of the measurements was 1–3 hours. In these circumstances, of the 52 measurements, in 2 cases, the workers had removed the mask (because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> {{to say to each}} other) - and these results were not taken into account in the analysis. However, use of respirators intermittently drastically reduces their efficiency. This shows how important to correctly organize the use of respirators, and to provide workers with the intercom stations (if necessary).|$|E

2500|$|It was whilst at Birmingham (1905 to 1911) Boughton was {{presented}} with many new opportunities and made many friends. He proved an excellent teacher and an outstanding choral conductor which won him much recognition. He was drawn into socialist ideas through the writings of John Ruskin, William Morris, Edward Carpenter and George Bernard Shaw, the last with whom he developed a lifelong relationship. It was also during those years that he became attached to the young art student, Christina Walshe, who was later to become his partner and artistic [...] "right-hand man" [...] for his Glastonbury projects. His friendship with Shaw had begun when Boughton had been turned down from his invitation to collaborate on an opera. Shaw initially refused {{to be associated with}} any of Boughton's music but Boughton would not be dissuaded and eventually Shaw realised <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> in common that was to endure.|$|E
2500|$|Sex blogger Violet Blue {{has been}} mentioned, interviewed and once contributed at Boing Boing. On 23 June 2008, Blue posted on her blog, Tiny Nibbles, that all posts {{related to her}} had been deleted from Boing Boing, without explanation. The Los Angeles Times {{featured}} an interview that cast the silence {{on the part of}} Boing Boing on the matter as [...] "inexplicable", causing a controversy as Boing Boing [...] "has often presented itself as a stalwart of cultural openness". A heated debate ensued after a brief statement on the Boing Boing site regarding this action stated: [...] "Violet behaved {{in a way that made}} us reconsider whether we wanted to lend her any credibility or associate with her. It's our blog and so we made an editorial decision, like we do every single day". In commentary attached to that blog entry, [...] "many commenters surmised that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to do with Blue's suing to stop a porn star from also using the name Violet Blue," [...] and many commenters found the removal troubling, but Xeni Jardin said that she hoped she would not have to make the reasons public.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{became a}} Christian {{following}} a divorce, {{and later became}} an elder in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Johnson recounts that on sabbatical in England he sought, through prayer, inspiration for {{what he should do}} with the rest of his life, and then received an epiphany after he read Richard Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker (1986) and Michael Denton's [...] (1985). Johnson later said, [...] "Something about the Darwinists' rhetorical style made me think <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to hide." [...] Despite having no formal background in biology, he felt that could add insight into the premises and arguments. [...] Johnson stated that he approaches the creation evolution dispute not as a scientist but as an academic lawyer by profession, with a specialty in analyzing the logic of arguments and identifying the assumptions that lie behind those arguments. He noted that what people think about evolutionism depends very heavily on the kind of logic they employ and the kind of assumptions they make. Further, he pointed out that four of the eleven members of the special committee appointed by the National Academy of Sciences to prepare its official booklet titled Science and Creationism were lawyers. Since the publication of the first edition of Darwin on Trial in 1991, he has become a prominent critic of evolutionary theory.|$|E

2500|$|For the music, Uchikoshi {{wrote down}} {{directions}} about the mood and {{concept of the}} game, describing it as [...] "sad and lonely, like a worn-out record", and [...] "dark and visceral". Hosoe described the music as generally less melodic: {{because they could not}} make the music hit on queue like in film, they decided during the planning stage to include silence in the soundtrack, so Hosoe created atmospheric tracks to be used as background noise. Because the Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors characters Junpei and Akane and the Virtue's Last Reward characters Sigma and Phi appear in the game, Uchikoshi decided to have arrangements of songs from those two games included in the soundtrack. He also had the songs [...] "Digital Root" [...] and [...] "Trepidation", which had been used in both previous games, be included, as he saw them as a sort of theme songs that tie the games together as a series, similarly to [...] "The Imperial March" [...] from the Star Wars films. Hosoe received a list of what songs were to be rearranged and how they were to be used within the game, and was asked to compose a total of 45 songs; he did however end up composing nearly 70 songs, ensuring that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> that fit every situation in the game. For the ending theme, Hosoe incorporated several callbacks to songs from the previous games as [...] "a sendoff for the series", leading into [...] "Morphogenetic Sorrow".|$|E
