40|$|The Theory of Characteristic Modes {{provides}} a convenient tool for designing multi-antennas for MIMO applications, as it enables orthogonal radiation patterns {{to be excited}} in a given antenna structure. Moreover, the frequency behavior of the modes reveals interesting wideband properties of the structure. However, the <b>tracking</b> of <b>characteristic</b> modes over frequency remains a challenge, especially when differences between modes are limited to high currents in small regions of the structure. The common approach of <b>tracking</b> <b>characteristic</b> modes is through correlating the modal currents over frequency, this leads to multiple eigenvalues being mapped to the same eigencurrent. In this work, we propose {{a new approach to}} <b>track</b> <b>characteristic</b> modes by means of cross correlating far-field patterns, which effectively eliminates the mode mapping ambiguity...|$|R

40|$|The North Atlantic eddy-driven jet {{exhibits}} latitudinal variability, {{with evidence}} of three preferred latitudinal locations: south, middle and north. Here we examine the drivers of this variability and the variability of the associated storm track. We investigate {{the changes in the}} storm <b>track</b> <b>characteristics</b> for the three jet locations, and propose a mechanism by which enhanced storm track activity, as measured by upstream heat flux, is responsible for cyclical downstream latitudinal shifts in the jet. This mechanism is based on a nonlinear oscillator relationship between the enhanced meridional temperature gradient (and thus baroclinicity) and the meridional high-frequency (periods of shorter than 10 days) eddy heat flux. Such oscillations in baroclinicity and heat flux induce variability in eddy anisotropy which is associated with the changes in the dominant type of wave breaking and a different latitudinal deflection of the jet. Our results suggest that high heat flux is conducive to a northward deflection of the jet, whereas low heat flux is conducive to a more zonal jet. This jet deflecting effect was found to operate most prominently downstream of the storm track maximum, while the storm track and the jet remain anchored at a fixed latitudinal location {{at the beginning of the}} storm track. These cyclical changes in storm <b>track</b> <b>characteristics</b> can be viewed as different stages of the storm track’s spatio-temporal lifecycle...|$|E
