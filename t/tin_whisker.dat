5000|$|Tin {{whiskers}} don't {{have to be}} airborne {{to damage}} equipment, as they are typically already growing {{in an environment where}} they can produce short circuits. At frequencies above 6 GHz or in fast digital circuits, tin whiskers can act like miniature antennas, affecting the circuit impedance and causing reflections. In computer disk drives they can break off and cause head crashes or bearing failures. Tin whiskers often cause failures in relays, and have been found upon examination of failed relays in nuclear power facilities. Pacemakers have been recalled due to tin whiskers. Research has also identified a particular failure mode for tin whiskers in vacuum (such as in space), where in high-power components a short-circuiting <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> is ionized into a plasma that is capable of conducting hundreds of amperes of current, massively increasing the damaging effect of the short circuit. [...] The possible increase in the use of pure tin in electronics due to the RoHS directive drove JEDEC and IPC to release a <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> acceptance testing standard and mitigation practices guideline intended to help manufacturers reduce the risk of tin whiskers in lead-free products.|$|E
50|$|The {{first product}} {{launched}} was the RP10 Herald. In common {{with many of}} their 1960s designs, this was built into a wooden case covered in leathercloth, with foam padding under {{the front and rear}} panels and a turntable to enable the set to be rotated for best reception (the internal ferrite rod aerial being highly directional). It featured a large (5 inch by 8 inch) 30Ω loudspeaker, and was powered by two PP9 batteries. Initial sets used Ediswan transistors; later sets used Mullard devices, including the AF117, which unfortunately went on to suffer from <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> formation within the encapsulation.|$|E
5000|$|Tin is also {{widely used}} in the {{electronics}} industry because {{of its ability to}} protect the base metal from oxidation thus preserving its solderability. In electronic applications, 3% to 7% lead may be added to improve solderability and to prevent the growth of metallic [...] "whiskers" [...] in compression stressed deposits, which would otherwise cause electrical shorting. However, RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) regulations enacted beginning in 2006 require that no lead be added intentionally and that the maximum percentage not exceed 1%. Some exemptions have been issued to RoHS requirements in critical electronics applications due to failures which are known to have occurred as a result of <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> formation.|$|E

They are microscopic conductive fibers emanating from pure tin surfaces, and they pose a serious problem to electronics of all types. These whiskers can form electrical paths, which affect {{the operation of the}} subject device.

The backup control processor {{had suffered a}} previously undetected anomaly, and PanAmSat {{was not able to}} regain control of the spacecraft. Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20, 1998. Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> growth, a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder, causing an electrical short circuit. Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder, allowing whiskers to develop. The satellite manufacturer, Hughes, has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs, adding 45 to 90 kg per payload.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{analysis}} {{conducted on}} Toyota’s {{electronic engine control}} system including accelerator pedal position sensors (APPSs) in 2011 showed {{the presence of a}} significant number of tin whiskers. Tin whiskers are elongated or needle-like structures of pure tin that grow from pure tin and tin alloy surfaces. Toyota's APPS were found to use tin finishes. These tin finishes can produce conductive tin whiskers capable of creating unintended electrical failures such as short circuits. The use of tin finish in Toyota's APPS is therefore a cause for concern. Similarly in 2013, materials used in an automotive engine control unit (ECU) from a 2008 Toyota Tundra truck were analyzed. It was found that pure tin with a nickel underlayer was used as the connector finish in the unit, and analysis revealed tin whiskers on the connector surface. Further testing under a standard temperature-humidity cycling showed <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> growth, raising additional reliability and safety concerns. These studies show that poor design choices, {{such as the use of}} tin finishes, result in unintended failures.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{thicknesses}} of tin coating towards <b>tin</b> <b>whiskers</b> formation and growth in 30 °C/ 60 %RH environmental condition had been studied. Electroless plating method {{was used to}} coat a layer of tin onto copper, Cu substrates. Three different thicknesses were obtained by controlling the plating times of immersion tin. 8 minutes, 12 minutes, and 20 minutes of plating times produced 1. 2 μm, 1. 5 μm, and 2. 3 μm thickness of tin coating respectively.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the global {{transition}} to lead (Pb) -free electronics, pure tin and high tin lead-free alloys have been widely adopted by the electronics part manufacturers as the materials of terminal finishes. However, electrically conductive tin whiskers have been found to develop in pure tin or high tin alloy finished surfaces, resulting in a reliability concern. Experimental results and observation appear to support the hypothesis that the driving forces for whisker formation is compressive stress. However, no accepted model and accelerated factors are available to describe and predict whisker growth. Though the issue of metal whiskers has been studied for over 60 years, currently there is no an industry-wide accepted methodology to quantify <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> risk. In this dissertation, a <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> risk assessment algorithm, which mainly focuses on bridging risk, is developed. The goal of this risk assessment algorithm is to provide a practical methodology for the electronics industry to quantify the failure risks posed by tin whiskers on tin-plated electronic products. This algorithm assessES <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> bridging risk quantitatively as a function of time. Probabilistic and statistical methods are applied to quantify the risk parameters, such as whisker density and length, related to assess <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> risk. Monte Carlo technique is the basic tool to sample the whiskers and assess the bridging risk. Two experiments are designed and conducted to simulate bridging failures caused by fixed and broken free whiskers. The methods to collect the information of the risk parameters are demonstrated. Prediction of whisker growth and <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> bridging risk is conducted based on the collected information. Error analyses on the differences between simulation and experimental results are provided...|$|E

40|$|Though it is {{generally}} known that whisker often springs from tin, the tin plated film on nickel does not provide the <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> growth under high temperature storage. But under thermal shock stress <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> grows even if the nickel film is formed under tin plated film. Then we have investigated the trend of growth and reliability evaluation about the <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> under thermal shock stress. As a result, we confirmed that the <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> under thermal shock stress did not cause short-circuit failure in field. Key words: <b>tin</b> <b>whisker,</b> thermal shock stress, lead-free. 1. troduction With the promotion of lead-free solder in these years, the conversion of solder-plating technology of electronics components from current methods to pure Sn or Sn-system plating is widely pursued. It {{is generally}} said that Sn is a metal easily generating whiskers in high temperature atmosphere, and each concerned manufacturer, etc. has made research about this type whickers 1). We have also conducted the 50 °C high temperature storage test of products with Sn plate on Ni under-plate and confirmed {{that this type of}} whiskers are not generated on our products for a time period of 18 years 2). However, it has been lately found that, if a thermal stress shock is charged on a product with Sn plate on Ni under-plate, it generates lint-like deposition products (i. e. we call them “whiskers ”) 3). As these whiskers have lint-like sinuous shape, some of which grow to few score micrometers, there is a concern that they may cause short-circuit failure between electrodes on electronics components. Therefore, we have performed stress analyses in order to investigate, in what conditions, these whiskers generated under the thermal shock stress grow and how they affect product reliability, and estimated the reliability level of electronics components used in the market environment in respect of the whisker generation. This paper reports the results of these research...|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} movement towards lead-free (electroplated pure tin) {{electronic component}} lead finishes re-introduces a familiar {{problem to the}} high reliability electronics community, <b>tin</b> <b>whiskers.</b> This movement to eliminate lead from electronic assemblies is driven by legislation in the EU (WEEE and ROHs) and in Japan to eliminate lead from electronic products by 2006.

50|$|With the {{adoption}} of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) regulations in Europe, and similar regulations elsewhere, traditional lead/tin solder alloys in electronic devices have been replaced by nearly pure tin, introducing tin pest and related problems such as <b>tin</b> <b>whiskers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The ban on lead in {{electronic}} industry caused manufacturers {{to search for}} alternative ways to replace lead without affecting the performance of electronic products. Among lead-free alternative surface finishes, pure tin plating has attracted greater attention as potential candidate to replace hot air solder levelling (HASL) {{in electronic}} application. However, <b>tin</b> <b>whiskers</b> were reported to form on tin surface finishes and have caused the failure to electronic components. The study regarding whiskers phenomenon is important especially with the miniaturisation of electronic components in the electronic industry because whiskers from adjacent area may touch each other, causing short circuit. The main objective {{of this research is}} to study <b>tin</b> <b>whiskering</b> behaviour of immersion tin plating after being exposed under two different temperatures and relative humidity conditions: normal condition (30 oC/ 60 %RH) and severe condition (55 oC/ 85 %RH). Tin layer was deposited by using immersion process. The effect of external stress on whiskers growth was investigated by applying indentation at 2 N load on tin surface. In addition, a nickel underlayer on copper substrate was deposited by electroless plating prior to tin plating to investigate the effectiveness of nickel underlayer in mitigating whiskers formation. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to observe the behaviour of <b>tin</b> <b>whiskers</b> and intermetallic compound (IMCs), Energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) was used to determine chemical composition and image analyser was used to measure coating thickness of <b>tin,</b> nickel and <b>whiskers</b> length based on micrographs obtained from FESEM. The results showed that whiskers have formed on immersion tin surface finish exposed under normal and severe conditions. These whiskers formed in various types including straight, bent, kinked, and spiral with striations along their circumference. The <b>tin</b> <b>whiskers</b> length was directly proportional to the exposure time for both conditions; normal and severe. However, under normal condition exposure, whiskers have grown longer than severe condition due to formation of small and irregular shape of IMCs. Indented area of tin surface showed shorter whiskers formed than non-indented area indicating that the whiskers grow longer at lower external stress concentration. The deposition of nickel underlayer on copper was effective in mitigating whiskers formation as no whiskers were observed under both conditions up to 12 weeks...|$|R

The current study has investigated the effect of an electrochemically produced oxide on <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> growth, for both Sn-Cu electrodeposits on Cu and pure Sn electrodeposits on brass. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{has been used to}} investigate the effect of the applied electrochemical oxidation potential on the oxide film thickness.

The XPS studies show that the thickness of electrochemically formed oxide film is directly influenced by the applied potential and the total charge passed. Whisker growth studies show that the electrochemical oxidation treatment mitigates whisker growth for both Sn-Cu electrodeposits on Cu and pure Sn electrodeposits on brass. For Sn electrodeposits on brass, the electrochemically formed oxide greatly reduces both the formation of zinc oxide at the surface and the formation of intermetallic compounds, which results in the mitigation of <b>tin</b> <b>whisker</b> growth.
