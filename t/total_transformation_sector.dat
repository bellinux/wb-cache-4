50|$|The energy {{measures}} {{above are}} gross final energy consumption. Another broader measure, {{primary energy consumption}} also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels (the energy sector) and energy lost in <b>transformation</b> (the <b>transformation</b> <b>sector,</b> i.e. converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants) as well as gross final energy consumption for end users. In 2013 Denmark’s total final energy consumption was 607 PJ whilst its primary energy consumption was 763 PJ. Most of the approximately 25% difference is accounted for in losses in the <b>transformation</b> <b>sector.</b> These losses {{are likely to be}} most prevalent in thermal electricity sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and <b>transformation</b> <b>sectors</b> as well as those in final consumption.

30|$|The {{production}} sectors were {{assumed to}} maximize profits under multi-nested constant elasticity substitution (CES) functions and at each input price. Energy <b>transformation</b> <b>sectors</b> input energy and value-added as a fixed coefficient, whereas energy end-use sectors have elasticities between energy and value-added. They were treated {{in this manner}} to deal appropriately with energy conversion efficiency in the energy <b>transformation</b> <b>sectors.</b> Power generated from several energy sources was combined by a logit function, although a CES function is often used in other CGE models. We chose this method for the consideration of the energy balance because the CES function does not guarantee a material balance (Schumacher and Sands 2006). Household expenditure on each commodity was described by a linear expenditure system (LES) function. The saving ratio was endogenously determined to balance saving and investment, and capital formation for each item was determined using a fixed coefficient. The Armington assumption was used for trade, and the current account {{was assumed to be}} balanced.|$|R

Combining the {{definition}} of 0 -Hecke monoids with that of Kiselman semigroups, we define what we call Kiselman quotients of 0 -Hecke monoids associated with simply laced Dynkin diagrams. We classify these monoids up to isomorphism, determine their idempotents and {{show that they are}} J-trivial. For type A we show that Catalan numbers appear as the maximal cardinality of our monoids, in which case the corresponding monoid is isomorphic to the monoid of all order-preserving and order-decreasing <b>total</b> <b>transformations</b> on a finite chain. This, in particular, implies a presentation for the latter monoid. Finally, we construct various representations of these monoids by matrices, <b>total</b> <b>transformations</b> and binary relations. 1.
