25|$|A form of telepharmacy {{has been}} in use by Australia's Royal Flying Doctor Service since 1942. Medical chests {{containing}} medications and equipment are placed in remote communities {{where they can be}} administered to patients during a <b>telehealth</b> consultation. Some 3,500 chests were distributed around Australia as of 2006. In one year, Queensland recorded 21,470 <b>telehealth</b> consultations, of which 13.7% resulted in administration of a medication from a medical chest. The medication types administered most often are antibiotics, analgesics and gastrointestinal medications. This system improves access to both emergency and routine medical care in remote parts of Australia and reduces the need for patients to travel to seek medical care.|$|E

2500|$|The Malaysian {{government}} places {{importance on}} the expansion {{and development of}} health care, putting 5% of the government social sector development budget into public health care—an increase of more than 47% over the previous figure. This has meant an overall increase of more than RM 2billion. With a rising and ageing population, the Government wishes to improve in many areas including the refurbishment of existing hospitals, building and equipping new hospitals, expansion {{of the number of}} polyclinics, and improvements in training and expansion of <b>telehealth.</b> A major problem with the health care sector is the lack of medical centres for rural areas, which the government is trying to counter through the development of and expansion of a system called [...] "tele-primary care". Another issue is the overperscription of drugs, though this has decreased in recent years. Since 2009 the Malaysian Health Ministry has increased its efforts to overhaul the system and attract more foreign investment.|$|E
2500|$|Benefis' {{separation}} from Providence Services was finalized on September 30, 2006. Benefis {{was forced to}} make a donation of $10 million to cover goodwill, and repay loans made to the company by Providence Services. Both the Vatican and the Montana Attorney General's Office approved the disaffiliation. The company said it saved $100,000 a month in corporate overhead costs, although it incurred {{an equal amount of}} cost because it now had higher interest payments on its debt. The same year, Benefis founded the Northcentral Montana Healthcare Alliance, a consortium of 14 hospitals and long-term care facilities whose goal was to promote the general economic well-being of its member institutions. Benefis also gave Cascade County [...] near [...] on Benefis Court in exchange for [...] of land near 15th Avenue South and 25th Street in September 2006. A month later, the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development grant program awarded $380,000 to Northcentral Montana Healthcare Alliance to expand <b>telehealth</b> throughout the area, a grant which was matched by a $700,000 grant from Benefis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Telehealth</b> is {{a modern}} form of health care delivery. <b>Telehealth</b> breaks away from {{traditional}} health care delivery by using modern telecommunication systems including wireless communication methods. Traditional health is legislated through policy {{to ensure the safety}} of medical practitioners and patients. Consequently, since <b>telehealth</b> is a new form of health care delivery that is now gathering momentum in the health sector, many organizations have started to legislate the use of <b>telehealth</b> into policy. In New Zealand, the Medical Council has a statement about <b>telehealth</b> on their website. This illustrates that the medical council has foreseen the importance that <b>telehealth</b> will have on the health system and have started to introduce <b>telehealth</b> legislation to practitioners along with government.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telehealth</b> is {{sometimes}} discussed interchangeably with telemedicine. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) distinguishes <b>telehealth</b> from telemedicine in its scope. According to HRSA, telemedicine only describes remote clinical services; such as diagnosis and monitoring, while <b>telehealth</b> includes preventative, promotive and curative care delivery. This includes the above-mentioned non-clinical applications like administration and provider education which make <b>telehealth</b> the preferred modern terminology.|$|E

50|$|Theoretically, {{the whole}} health system stands {{to benefit from}} <b>telehealth.</b> In a UK <b>telehealth</b> trial done in 2011, it was {{reported}} that the cost of health could be dramatically reduced with the use of <b>telehealth</b> monitoring. The usual cost of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) per cycle would be around $15,000, with <b>telehealth</b> it was reduced to $800 per patient. In Alaska the Federal Health Care Access Network which connects 3,000 healthcare providers to communities, engaged in 160,000 <b>telehealth</b> consultations from 2001 and saved the state $8.5 million in travel costs for just Medicaid patients. There are indications <b>telehealth</b> consumes fewer resources and requires fewer people to operate it with shorter training periods to implement initiatives.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Telehealth</b> (or telerehabilitation) is a {{developing}} form of physical therapy {{to respond to}} the increasing demand and high cost of typical physical therapy treatment. [...] <b>Telehealth</b> is online communication between the clinician and patient either live or in prerecorded sessions. The benefits of <b>telehealth</b> include improved accessibility in remote areas, more cost efficient services, improved convenience for the home-bound and physically disabled. Some considerations for <b>telehealth</b> are limited evidence to prove effectiveness and compliance more than in-person therapy, licensure and payment policy issues, compromised privacy. Studies are controversial as to the effectiveness of <b>telehealth</b> in patients with various conditions, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis and lower back pain.|$|E

This report is titled “Multi-State <b>Telehealth</b> Practice” and summarizes the current state of physician and nurse licensure issues.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefits}} {{posed by}} <b>telehealth</b> challenge the normative means of healthcare delivery set in both legislation and practice. Therefore, the growing prominence of <b>telehealth</b> {{is starting to}} underscore the need for updated regulations, guidelines and legislation which reflect the current and future trends of healthcare practices. <b>Telehealth</b> enables timely and flexible care to patients wherever they may be; although this is a benefit, it also poses threats to privacy, safety, medical licensing and reimbursement. When a clinician and patient are in different locations, {{it is difficult to}} determine which laws apply to the context. Once healthcare crosses borders different state bodies are involved in order to regulate and maintain the level of care that is warranted to the patient or <b>telehealth</b> consumer. As it stands, <b>telehealth</b> is complex with many grey areas when put into practice especially as it crosses borders. This effectively limits the potential benefits of <b>telehealth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{excitement}} of <b>telehealth</b> and telemedicine remained, enthusiasm waned in the 1980s. <b>Telehealth</b> projects underway {{before and during the}} 1980s would take off but fail to proliferate mainstream healthcare.

As a result, this period of <b>telehealth</b> history is called the [...] "maturation" [...] stage and made way for sustainable growth.|$|E

It is a business-oriented group which focuses on providing members with information and tools to facilitate {{the success of their}} <b>telehealth</b> activities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telehealth</b> {{requires}} a strong, reliable broadband connection. The broadband signal transmission infrastructure includes wires, cables, microwaves and optic fibre, {{which must be}} maintained {{for the provision of}} <b>telehealth</b> services. The better the connection (bandwidth quality), the more data can be sent and received. Historically this has priced providers or patients out of the service, but as the infrastructure improves and becomes more accessible, <b>telehealth</b> usage can grow.|$|E
50|$|The rate of {{adoption}} of <b>telehealth</b> services in any jurisdiction is frequently influenced by {{factors such as}} the adequacy and cost of existing conventional health services in meeting patient needs; the policies of governments and/or insurers with respect to coverage and payment for <b>telehealth</b> services; and medical licensing requirements that may inhibit or deter the provision of <b>telehealth</b> second opinions or primary consultations by physicians.|$|E
