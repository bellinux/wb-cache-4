40|$|Migratory {{shorebirds}} show regulated seasonal {{increases in}} body mass (BM) even in captivity, consisting primarily, but not exclusively, of fat. We examined whether captive red knot (Calidris canutus) exhibited seasonal alterations in mitochondrial volume (liver, pectoral muscle) and/or succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity (liver, pectoral muscle, heart, small intestine) during three distinct life-cycle stages: stable BM, spring peak in BM, and as BM rapidly declined after the spring peak. Mitochondrial volume in liver and pectoral muscle and SDH activity in liver and heart did not alter with life-cycle stage. However, red knot undergoing premigratory fattening exhibited significantly lower pectoral muscle SDH activity {{in concert with}} significantly elevated activity in the small intestine compared {{with the other two}} time-points, suggesting that tissue metabolic rate alters with life-cycle stage. The increased intestinal SDH activity may indicate an elevation in energy assimilation at a time when intestine hypertrophy occurs, thus maximizing BM increase prior to putative migration. The concomitant decrease in pectoral muscle activity may act to reduce overall metabolic rate, or at least help counter the elevation in intestinal mass-specific metabolic rate. Both <b>tissues</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> prior to migration in wild red knot, but hypertrophy of the intestine precedes that of pectoral muscle. Indeed, it appears that the intestinal mass undergoes atrophy by the time pectoral muscle hypertrophy occurs in wild red knot.

40|$|The {{development}} of cardiac hypertrophy and other changes were examined during sub-chronic ethanol intoxication in Sprague-Dawley rats. Several experimental manipulations were evaluated: adrenal medullectomy, peripheral sympathectomy {{and the administration}} of adrenergic antagonists, prazosin and metoprolol. Ethanol, given by gavage every eight hours for up to 96 hours, maintained the rats in an ataxic state. It was found that adrenal cortical <b>tissue</b> <b>hypertrophied</b> after ethanol exposure. The release of adrenal medullary catecholamines was stimulated, producing a decline in contents, particularly of adrenaline, which was reflected in elevations in urinary catecholamines. Cardiac noradrenaline levels were reduced. These changes were paralleled by cardiac hypertrophy which reached 20 percent after 96 hours of intoxication.;Adrenal medullectomy attenuated the {{development of}} cardiomegaly. A small degree of hypertrophy did occur after 96 hours as did slight increases in urinary noradrenaline of extra-adrenal origin. Ethanol treatment after peripheral, non-adrenal sympathectomy, using 6 -hydroxydopamine, provoked a greater cardiotrophic response from treatment-induced cardiac supersensitivity. Treatment with ethanol and prazosin augmented adrenal catecholamine release {{and the development of}} hypertrophy and reduced cardiac noradrenaline contents by more than 70 percent. Beta adrenoceptor blockade with metoprolol completely abolished the cardiotrophic response. Metoprolol treatment of control animals induced a slight regression of heart size. Estimations of catecholamine turnover rates in various peripheral tissues revealed that the adrenal medulla was virtually selectively stimulated.;The cardiotrophic response correlated directly with the excretion of urinary catecholamines. Peripheral sympathectomy provoked a parallel shift of the cardiotrophic response curve to the left, indicating increased sensitivity, whereas metoprolol shifted it to the right, reflecting decreased responsivity to catecholaminergic stimulation. Prazosin did not produce a shift in this curve. Taken together, these results suggest a strong association between the development of cardiac hypertrophy during sub-chronic ethanol intoxication and stimulation of cardiac beta- 1 adrenergic receptors by catecholamines predominantly of adrenal medullary origin.
