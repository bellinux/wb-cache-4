5|$|In the United Kingdom, the public, through newspapers, {{followed}} Baden-Powell's {{struggle to}} hold Mafeking, {{and when the}} siege was broken, {{he had become a}} national hero. This rise to fame fuelled the sales of the small instruction book he had written in 1899 about military scouting and wilderness survival, Aids to Scouting, that owed much <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> learned from discussions with Burnham.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{took up the}} {{practical}} art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He {{spent much of his}} time at Staffordshire dye works mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, such as the red derived from madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.|$|E
5|$|Challenged by Lakers' coach Phil Jackson {{to be more}} {{assertive}} while Bryant recovered from offseason knee surgery, Gasol started the season's first week averaging 25.3 points on 52.5 percent shooting, 10.3 rebounds, and five assists per game as the Lakers started 3–0. He was named Western Conference Player of the Week. He earned his third straight All-Star selection and his season averages of 19 points and 10 rebounds were nearly identical <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> put up as a Laker the previous three seasons. Pau's play also merited him All-NBA second team honors {{for the first time}} in his career. In the playoffs, Gasol only averaged 13 points on 42% shooting over 10 games, and the Lakers were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. Gasol had the worst post season performance of his career. Lakers Hall of Famer and ESPN analyst Magic Johnson cited Gasol as a possible trade option for the Lakers to acquire Magic center Dwight Howard. Gasol ignored the false reports about his relationship status with his girlfriend as the cause of his poor performance and has accepted the criticism of his play as valid. During the 2011–12 NBA season, Gasol and teammate Lamar Odom were subjected to trade rumors involving former New Orleans Hornets guard Chris Paul. After the trade fell through, Gasol vowed that it would not affect the way he played. Odom, on the other hand, was angry at the Laker organization and was traded to the 2010–11 NBA champion Dallas Mavericks for a future first round pick. After Lakers co-captain Derek Fisher was traded in March 2012, Gasol joined Bryant as co-captains of the team. He won the 2011–12 seasonlong NBA Community Assist Award.|$|E

25|$|On October 21, 1743, {{according}} to popular myth, a storm {{moving from the}} southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a lunar eclipse. Franklin {{was said to have}} noted that the prevailing winds were actually from the northeast, contrary <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> expected. In correspondence with his brother, Franklin learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel {{in the direction of the}} prevailing wind, a concept that greatly influenced meteorology.|$|E
25|$|Emerson {{was poor}} {{when he was}} at Harvard, and later {{supported}} his family for much of his life. He inherited a fair amount of money after his first wife's death, though he had to file a lawsuit against the Tucker family in 1836 to get it. He received $11,600 in May 1834, and a further $11,674.49 in July 1837. In 1834, he considered that he had an income of $1,200 a year from the initial payment of the estate, equivalent <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> earned as a pastor.|$|E

500|$|In January 1971, having {{retired from}} his {{teaching}} career, Skirth {{began work on}} a handwritten memoir which described his conduct and experiences during the First World War, and in particular his experience of disillusionment. [...] Although he initially intended to focus on {{his relationship with his}} wife Ella, touching on the war only briefly, he soon felt under a [...] "compulsion" [...] to write more about his war experiences. [...] He worked on the memoir for over a year, eventually filling five green ring binders with many hundreds of pages, and over the next few years, despite suffering two strokes, he repeatedly went back to the material, editing, amending and adding <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> written.|$|E
500|$|Historically, {{the press}} had enjoyed {{considerable}} prestige and respect to that point, though some Republicans complained of bias. But in his Des Moines speech, Agnew attacked the media, complaining that immediately after Nixon's speech, [...] "his words and policies {{were subjected to}} instant analysis and querulous criticism... by {{a small band of}} network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed {{in one way or another}} their hostility <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to say... It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance." [...] Agnew continued, [...] "I am asking whether a form of censorship already exists when the news that forty million Americans receive each night is determined by a handful of men... and filtered through a handful of commentators who admit their own set of biases".|$|E

According to Cook, the executive was given a two-hour beating and ordered to lick a bathroom floor for at least 30 minutes. She testified that Marc Yager and Guillaume Lesevre, two of Scientology's most senior executives, were pressured to state that they had had a homosexual affair and were beaten until they [...] "confessed". According to another executive, Tom De Vocht, Miscavige pushed Yager to the ground and told a black executive, [...] "By the way, [...] thinks black people are niggers, and he doesn't want Scientology to help blacks. Go kick him.' So [...] is down on the ground and she's kicking him." [...] Both Yager and the other executive have denied this account.|$|E

500|$|McCain also harshly criticized Obama for {{scrapping}} {{construction of}} the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland, declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> proposed in the past, and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan. McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy towards gays. Factors involved in McCain's new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain's campaign edge being slow to wear off.

500|$|According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster {{who uses}} wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end {{disputes}} verbally instead of by force. He walks {{with a slightly}} drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: [...] "That's {{got to be the}} best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: [...] "So it would seem", in sharp contrast <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> previously proclaimed: [...] "You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of".

500|$|While {{the chiefs}} conferred, Northern Rhodesia became {{independent}} Zambia on 24 October 1964, emulating Nyasaland, which had achieved statehood as Malawi three months earlier. Reasoning {{that it was}} no longer necessary to refer to itself as [...] "Southern" [...] {{in the absence of a}} northern counterpart, Southern Rhodesia began calling itself simply Rhodesia. The same day, the commander of the Rhodesian Army, Major-General John [...] "Jock" [...] Anderson, resigned, announcing publicly that he was doing so because of his opposition to UDI, which he said he could not go along with because of his oath of allegiance to the Queen. Interpreting this as a sign that Smith intended to declare independence if a majority backed it in the referendum, Wilson wrote a stiff letter to Smith on 25 October, warning him of the consequences of UDI, and demanding [...] "a categorical assurance forthwith that no attempt at a unilateral declaration of independence on your part will be made". Smith expressed confusion as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done to provoke this, and ignored it.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of her debut single [...] "Locomotion" [...] in Australia, Minogue {{traveled}} to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, a successful British writing and production team. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] in forty minutes while she waited outside the recording studio. Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> learned about Minogue prior to her arrival. He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia, attractive and very talented, {{there had to be}} something wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills. After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera, Neighbours. After hearing the song, Waterman said [...] "I thought it was fantastic, so I ran over to the DJ and asked him what it was. He said 'Its Kylie Minogue - I Should Be So Lucky'." [...] He later said to Mike Stock that the song would be an instant smash hit.|$|E
500|$|Following Northern Rhodesia's {{independence}} as Zambia in October 1964—Nyasaland {{had been}} independent Malawi since July—Southern Rhodesia began referring to itself simply as Rhodesia, but Whitehall rejected this change. Perceiving Smith {{to be on}} the verge of a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI), Wilson issued a statement in October 1964 warning of dire economic and political consequences, and wrote to Smith demanding [...] "a categorical assurance forthwith" [...] that no UDI would be attempted. Smith ignored this, expressing confusion as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done to provoke it. The UK and Rhodesian governments exchanged often confrontational correspondence over the next year or so, each accusing the other of being unreasonable and intransigent. Little progress was made when two Prime Ministers met in person in January 1965, when Smith travelled to London for Sir Winston Churchill's funeral. The RF called a fresh election for May 1965 and, campaigning on an election promise of independence, won all 50 [...] "A"-roll seats (elected mostly by whites). Wilson's ministers deliberately stonewalled Smith during mid-1965, hoping to eventually break him down, but this only caused the Rhodesian hierarchy to feel yet more alienated. From June, a peripheral dispute concerned Rhodesia's unilateral and ultimately successful attempt to open an independent mission in Lisbon; Portugal's acceptance of this in September 1965 prompted British outrage and Rhodesian delight.|$|E

500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{in recent years}} have praised Tyler's foreign policy. Monroe credits him with [...] "achievements like the Webster–Ashburton treaty which heralded the prospect of improved relations with Great Britain, and the annexation of Texas, which added millions of acres to the national domain." [...] Crapol argued that Tyler [...] "was a stronger and more effective president than generally remembered", while Seager wrote, [...] "I find him to be a courageous, principled man, a fair and honest fighter for his beliefs. He was a president without a party." [...] Author Ivan Eland, in an update of his 2008 book Recarving Rushmore, rated all 44 US presidents by the criteria of peace, prosperity, and liberty; with the finished ratings, John Tyler was ranked the best president of all time. Louis Kleber, in his article in History Today, pointed out that Tyler brought integrity to the White House {{at a time when many}} in politics lacked it, and refused to compromise his principles to avoid the anger of his opponents. Crapol argues that Tyler's allegiance to the Confederacy overshadows much of the good he did as president: [...] "John Tyler's historical reputation has yet to fully recover from that tragic decision to betray his loyalty and commitment <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> once defined as 'the first great American interest'—the preservation of the Union." ...|$|E

Competition and weather affected testing and World Cup runs for the two-week time period.
