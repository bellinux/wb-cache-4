5|$|The {{price of}} slaves varied in {{accordance}} with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 drachmas; while a workman at major works was paid one drachma per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 drachmas each. Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available; in the 4th century BC they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market. A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. For instance, a large helot market was organized during the festivities at the temple of Apollo at Actium. The Acarnanian League, which {{was in charge of the}} logistics, received half of the <b>tax</b> <b>proceeds,</b> the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part. Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against latent defects; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been warned about it.|$|E
25|$|Some {{local governments}} {{in an effort}} to evade the two-thirds voter {{approval}} requirement for special taxes under Proposition 218 may express legally nonbinding intent to spend general <b>tax</b> <b>proceeds</b> for one or more specific purposes. This may be done in several forms such as the adoption of intention language before the tax election date, the formation of an advisory committee relating to the expenditure of the <b>tax</b> <b>proceeds,</b> or by placing a companion advisory measure on the same election ballot. The most frequent type of tax where this occurs is the local sales tax, but it can also occur with other local taxes such as utility user taxes, transient occupancy (hotel bed) taxes, business taxes, and various local excise taxes.|$|E
25|$|Since general {{taxes are}} not legally {{dedicated}} for specific purposes, they can generally be {{spent at the}} complete discretion of local politicians, including on public employee salaries and benefits. This means that local voters have to trust their local politicians to spend general <b>tax</b> <b>proceeds</b> in a wise and prudent manner. Whether local voters can trust their local elected officials to make wise and proper spending decisions {{is an important factor}} to consider in deciding whether to support a general tax measure.|$|E

25|$|Following their {{expulsion}} from Baghdad, Nasir al-Dawla, Ibn Shirzad and the Hamdanid army proceeded up the Tigris to Ukbara to regroup. After they arrived, Nasir al-Dawla sent an envoy to Mu'izz al-Dawla {{to sue for}} peace. Mu'izz al-Dawla agreed to the terms, and the war {{between the two sides}} came to an end. Mu'izz al-Dawla agreed to recognize the Hamdanid as ruler of the territory from Tikrit northwards, and to release him from the obligation of transmitting tax revenues from Mosul and the Diyar Bakr district. In exchange, Nasir al-Dawla was made responsible for forwarding the <b>tax</b> <b>proceeds</b> of Ikhshidid Egypt and Syria on to Baghdad, and promised to regularly send supplies to the city which were to be exempt from any taxes; in addition, he agreed to recognize al-Muti' as the legitimate caliph.|$|E
25|$|Between 1945 and 2005, the {{economic}} structure of Luxembourg changed significantly. The {{crisis of the}} metallurgy sector, {{which began in the}} mid-1970s and lasted till the late 1980s, nearly pushed the country into economic recession, given the monolithic dominance of that sector. The Tripartite Coordination Committee, consisting of members of the government, management representatives, and trade union leaders, succeeded in preventing major social unrest during those years, thus creating the myth of a “Luxembourg model” characterised by social peace. Although {{in the early years of}} the 21st century Luxembourg enjoyed one of the highest GNP per capita in the world, this was mainly due to the strength of its financial sector, which gained importance at the end of the 1960s. Thirty-five years later, one-third of the <b>tax</b> <b>proceeds</b> originated from that sector. The harmonisation of the tax system across Europe could, however, seriously undermine the financial situation of the grand duchy.|$|E

2500|$|Local governments {{frequently}} conduct opinion polling {{of their}} voters before {{deciding whether to}} place a local tax measure on the ballot. [...] Such polls are typically designed to determine voter support for a tax proposal, the appropriate duration of a tax (i.e., whether permanent or for some specified period of years), the amount/rate of a proposed tax, and how the <b>tax</b> <b>proceeds</b> will be spent if a tax for specific purposes (a special tax) is being proposed.|$|E
40|$|An {{agreement}} between Norway and the European Commission specifies {{an increase in}} the export tax on Norwegian salmon entering EU markets from 0. 75 % to 3. 00 % effective 1 July 1997. Further, Norway's exports are subject to a price floor and quantity ceiling, neither of which were binding over the evaluation period. Since the <b>tax's</b> <b>proceeds</b> are to be used by Norway to fund generic marketing of Atlantic salmon, {{it is possible that the}} agreement is winwin, i. e., benefits United Kingdom and Norwegian producers alike. To test this, we use an equilibrium displacement model to estimate the agreement's effects on prices, trade flows, and producer welfare.

The outcome of the thesis is that by consistent archiving of all proper evidence used on income tax, can significantly improve the proofing proces used on value added tax and vice versa.

50|$|In rem {{jurisdiction}} {{referred to}} jurisdiction over a {{particular piece of}} property, most commonly real estate or land. Certain cases, notably government suits for unpaid property <b>taxes,</b> <b>proceed</b> not against an individual but against their property directly. Under territorial jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction could be exercised by the courts of a state by seizing the property in question. Since an actual tract of land could not literally be brought into a courtroom as a person could, this was effected by giving notice upon the real property itself. In rem jurisdiction was thus supported by {{the assumption that the}} owner of that property, having a concrete economic interest in the property, had a duty to look after the affairs of their property, and would be notified of the pending case by such seizure. In rem jurisdiction was limited to deciding issues regarding the specific property in question.|$|R
2500|$|As public {{employee}} salary and benefit obligations increase over time, {{particularly with regard}} to pensions and {{public employee}} retiree healthcare, the impacts on the local government budget become more significant and can even lead to bankruptcy. [...] Local politicians end up having to reduce public services and/or raise taxes or other revenues such as fees and charges. [...] To the extent that taxes are raised, the <b>tax</b> <b>proceeds</b> will generally either directly or indirectly pay for public employee salary and benefit obligations.

2500|$|To {{the extent}} a local {{government}} {{has the power}} to levy a general tax and that a particular tax is not required to be levied as a special tax, a tax is general only when its revenues are placed into the general fund of the local government and are available for expenditure for any and all governmental purposes. [...] The courts have yet to interpret under what circumstances tax revenues placed into a general fund are a special tax by virtue of being “imposed for specific purposes” under the broad “special tax” definition. [...] As a result, the mere placement of local <b>tax</b> <b>proceeds</b> into a general fund does not automatically make the tax a “general tax” under Proposition 218.|$|E

40|$|Uncertainty {{about tax}} results is an ever-present {{obstacle}} to business transactions despite the extensive number of Internal Revenue Code sections and Treasury Regulations. Some insurance companies now provide an insurance product to protect taxpayers against adverse tax consequences from proposed transactions. Ironically, this new insurance product, labeled “tax insurance,” poses uncertain tax consequences itself This Article argues {{that if the}} adverse tax consequences arise (that is, the taxpayer has additional tax liability) and the insurance company is contractually required to cover that liability, the <b>tax</b> insurance <b>proceeds</b> are not includable in the insured’s gross income. As part of the reasoning that underlies this conclusion concerning tax insurance, the Article examines and develops a novel approach that provides a tax policy justification for excluding general liability insurance proceeds from the insured’s income. The Article concludes that the same justification also applies to exclude <b>tax</b> insurance <b>proceeds</b> from the insured’s gross income. The Article also examines whether the premiums paid for tax insurance coverage are deductible business expenses. Finally, the Article examines the appropriate tax treatment {{of other types of}} tax indemnity arrangements...|$|R

Not only was the money used for other things, it was later revealed by the federal government that Miami-Dade Transit could not actually afford to support and operate these lines even if their construction was 100% federally funded, as MDT's revenue and ridership forecasts assumed significant and regular increases in fare while assuming no loss in ridership. This, along with a more recent federal investigation and takeover in 2011 has led to Miami-Dade Transit's perception as an accountable organization.|$|E
