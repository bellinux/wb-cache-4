Instead of working with the amount of correlation between the residuum and the atoms directly as in SOber, the Dice algorithm computes combinations of these as dictated by the structure dictionaries in use (lines 3, 4). This way, the decision about the non-zero cycle frequencies (line 5) takes into account the structure of the CA. Additionally, instead of adding a single element <b>to</b> the <b>support</b> <b>set</b> per iteration, Algorithm 2 adds all indices <b>to</b> the <b>support</b> <b>set</b> that have a non-zero value in the selected dictionary word.

40|$|International audienceFrequent-regular pattern mining has {{attracted}} recently many works. Most of the approaches focus on discovering {{a complete set}} of patterns under the user-given support and regularity threshold constraints. This leads to several quantitative and qualitative drawbacks. First, it is often difficult <b>to</b> <b>set</b> appropriate <b>support</b> threshold. Second, algorithms produce a huge number of patterns, many of them being redundant. Third, most of the patterns are of very small size and it is arduous to extract interesting relationship among items. To reduce the number of patterns a common solution is to consider the desired number k of outputs and to mine the top-k patterns. In addition, this approach does not require <b>to</b> <b>set</b> a <b>support</b> threshold. <b>To</b> cope with redundancy and interestingness relationship among items, we suggest to focus on closed patterns and introduce a minimal length constraint. We thus propose to mine the top-k frequent-regular closed patterns with minimal length. An efficient single-pass algorithm, called TFRC-Mine, and a new compact bit-vector representation which allows to prune uninteresting candidate, are designed. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is efficient to produce longer -non redundant- patterns, and that the new data representation is efficient for both computational time and memory usage...|$|R
