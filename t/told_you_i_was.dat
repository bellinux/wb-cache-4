25|$|In 1975 Milligan fathered a son, James (born June 1976), in {{an affair}} with Margaret Maughan. Another child, a {{daughter}} Romany, is suspected {{to have been born}} at the same time, to a Canadian journalist named Roberta Watt. His last wife was Shelagh Sinclair, to whom he was married from 1983 to his death on 27 February 2002. Four of his children collaborated with documentary makers on a multi-platform programme called I <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> Ill: The Life and Legacy of Spike Milligan (2005), which then included an accompanying website (www.spikemilliganlegacy.com).|$|E
500|$|... "The New Cup" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many noting {{that both the}} episode's plot and songs were particularly strong. According to Nielsen Media Research, on its initial broadcast, [...] "The New Cup" [...] was watched by over 500,000 people. Two songs from the episode, [...] "Sugalumps" [...] and [...] "You Don't Have to be a Prostitute", received positive critical acclaim and were later included on the band's second album I <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> Freaky.|$|E
2500|$|One of the band's songs {{entitled}} [...] "Blow Your House Down" [...] {{was featured}} in a Hollywood CGI animated film Hoodwinked, from The Weinstein Company. An instrumental version of the song was played {{in the background of}} the Granny Xtreme skiing scene. The film's soundtrack was released under Rykodisc. Most animations and visuals of Hoodwinked were created and processed at Digital Eye Candy, Makati City. One of the head animators behind the Hoodwinked team, Gorio Vicuna, is the one who designed and directed the album cover and sleeve layout of [...] "Beautiful Machines” album. A line in the lyrics of the song says “no one <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> abroad”, which in turn, the song was actually used in an international movie.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't want a servant, Yussuf," [...] Edgar said. [...] "As <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a soldier, and {{soldiers}} {{do not have}} servants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{extremely}} natural, no doubt,--though I had not anticipated it. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very sorry. It will cause many heartburns, and some unhappiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Koane only {{answered}} sulkily: 'I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not going}} to drive them out at all. If I have to do without milk, they shall do without grass.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Milligan {{died from}} kidney failure, {{at the age}} of 83, on 27 February 2002, at his home in Rye, Sussex. On the day of his funeral, 8 March 2002, his coffin was carried to St Thomas Church in Winchelsea, East Sussex, and was draped in the flag of Ireland. He had once quipped that he wanted his headstone to bear the words [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ill." [...] He was buried at St Thomas' churchyard but the Chichester diocese refused to allow this epitaph. A {{compromise}} was reached with the Irish translation, Dúirt mé leat go raibh mé breoite and in English, [...] "Love, light, peace". The additional epitaph [...] "Grá mór ort Shelagh" [...] can be read as [...] "Great love for you Shelagh".|$|E
2500|$|Peter Sellers died on 24 July 1980, aged 54. Michael Bentine died on 26 November 1996, aged 74. Harry Secombe died on 11 April 2001, aged 79. Milligan {{claimed to}} be {{relieved}} that Secombe had died before him, because had he died before Secombe then Secombe {{would have been in}} a position to sing at his funeral. Terence [...] "Spike" [...] Milligan died on 27 February 2002, aged 83; Secombe ended up singing at his funeral anyway, as a recording. Two years later Milligan's wish to have the words [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ill" [...] inscribed on his gravestone was finally granted, although the church would only agree if the words were written in Irish, as Dúirt mé leat go raibh mé breoite.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not interested, and I beg you to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{perhaps as}} <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{interested}} in him, I can trespass so far upon your courtesy as to inquire {{into the nature}} of his ailment," [...] I said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Johann Wolff," [...] he repeated. [...] "That {{is not my}} name. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Ludwig Miller, and I {{know nothing}} of this matter beyond what <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> just a messenger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are strangely forgetful to-day," [...] he said. [...] "Surely {{your friend}} Mr. Julian Gray might have <b>told</b> <b>you?</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{astonished}} {{to hear that}} he has not had his private interview yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Pala. But, who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here? they, {{that told}} you that, may tell you more, for aught I know.|$|E
60|$|Aldo. Look you now, son Woodall, I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not mistaken; my rascal's in town, with {{a vengeance}} to him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was stupid}} of me. I {{ought to have}} come and <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so pleased and excited that I forgot.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must make}} your choice at once, darling, for as <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> off tomorrow. We will be married {{as soon as}} we get there, and you know you cannot stop here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Robah, {{the colonel}} says that I must go {{down with a}} sick party, tomorrow. As <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{determined}} to go up country with the troops. Of course, <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> in disguise. How do <b>you</b> think that <b>I</b> had better go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Knew--what I am," [...] she said; [...] "knew the impossibility. What, {{they have}} not <b>told</b> <b>you?</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the invalid, the cripple, with every one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, dear, for {{reminding}} {{you that}} I {{have not yet}} refused to offer my congratulations. I only <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> waiting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Five {{years are}} a long space of time, Plantagenet. Events will happen in five years, even at Cherbury. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> changed.' ...|$|E
60|$|CUSINS. No: he only {{provided}} the wine. I {{think it was}} Dionysos who made me drunk. [To Barbara] I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> possessed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Alack, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> no priest,' {{said the}} hermit; 'but for such as <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>I</b> bless <b>thee</b> {{with all my}} soul, thou fatherless lad,' and he laid {{his hand on the}} young lad's {{wondering}} brow, then bade him begone, since Simon and himself had much to say to one another.|$|R
5000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> once <b>was</b> a {{man with}} muscle, frame and health, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. There are {{the death}} duties, of course, but half my father's money {{goes with the}} place, and Lawrence will {{stay with us for}} the present, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first, of course, because, as <b>I</b> once <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{in a bit of a}} hole financially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now." ...|$|R
60|$|Knight's {{manner of}} {{returning}} to the matter in hand drew Stephen again into himself. 'No; I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to Endelstow,' he resolutely replied.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not to be}} interrupted," [...] said Allan, irritably. [...] "Good heavens! am I {{never to}} have done with them? Another letter!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{continues}} to smile, {{but she is}} watching him closely. 'I haven't been for a walk. Don't you remember where I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going, John?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} bitterly. [...] "Like yourself, Miss Rodd, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{the victim of}} {{circumstances}} and must {{make the best of}} them. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a penniless adventurer seeking my fortune in the rough places of the earth. Of course I might earn a livelihood in England, but that is of no use to me; I must win wealth, {{and a great deal of}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am awfully sorry," [...] Roger said. [...] "I {{never dreamed}} of such a thing. The princess has always been very kind to me, but I should never have thought of raising my eyes so high. Besides, as <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still scarce a man; and with us, one does not think of {{marriage}} until he is {{five or six years}} older than I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{she said}} hastily, {{with tears in}} her accents. [...] "I thought I--because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not respectable, <b>I</b> mean. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not respectable enough long ago--and on that account I didn't want to marry you, only--only you urged me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{she told}} you to shun me, to hate me? She <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a villain, a profligate, a demon? eh? eh? Was it not so, Venetia?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You ain't seen me cash in any chips or call a turn since I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> broke, {{a minute}} ago, have you? Friend, chase {{yourself}} away." ...|$|E
60|$|Algernon. Jack, {{you are at}} the muffins again! I {{wish you}} wouldn't. There are only two left. [Takes them.] I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{particularly}} fond of muffins.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{remember}} what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been,</b> and where <b>I</b> came from, ragged and lame, with the fierce wind and weather beating on my head?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I s'pose you {{remember}} that you saw me this afternoon, an' somebody <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> goin' to join the circus, didn't they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not rich}} enough to buy <b>you</b> out so <b>I</b> shall steal <b>you</b> as soon as I can arrange some means of getting away from here. Meantime it would be fatal to be seen {{together}} at night. We mustn't give ourselves away. We had better part at once. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mistaken just now; but if, as you say, that poor Mrs. Schomberg can't sleep of nights, we must be more careful. She would tell the fellow." ...|$|R
