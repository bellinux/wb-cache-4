5|$|In 1934, {{when the}} Crown {{prosecutor}} for Prince Albert resigned {{to become the}} Conservative Party's legislative candidate, Diefenbaker took his place as prosecutor. Diefenbaker did not stand in the 1934 provincial election, in which the governing Conservatives lost every seat. Six days after the election, Diefenbaker resigned as Crown prosecutor. The federal government of Bennett was defeated the following year and Mackenzie King returned as Prime Minister. Judging his prospects hopeless, Diefenbaker had declined a nomination to stand again against Mackenzie King in Prince Albert. In <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Bennett government, the Saskatchewan Conservative Party President was appointed a judge, leaving Diefenbaker, who had been elected the party's vice president, as acting president of the provincial party.|$|E
25|$|The fort {{remained}} in {{use during the}} Mughal era, and was used almost continuously until 1707, {{though it was not}} popular with the Mughal rulers since it lacked large gardens and the sort of grand architecture found at Mughal-era forts, such as at the Lahore Fort. Remilitarization of the fort occurred in <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Mughal empire, as the rival Sikh Empire began to expand in the region.

60|$|Nor did it {{take long}} for every stronghold to pour forth its cavalry, and every hamlet its footmen. Through the late autumn and the early winter every road and country lane resounded with nakir and trumpet, with the neigh of the war-horse and the clatter of marching men. From the Wrekin in the Welsh marches to the Cotswolds in the west or Butser in the south, there was no hill-top from which the peasant might not have seen the bright shimmer of arms, the toss and flutter of plume and of pensil. From bye-path, from {{woodland}} clearing, or from winding moor-side track these little rivulets of steel united in the larger roads to form a broader stream, growing ever fuller and larger as it approached the nearest or most commodious seaport. And there all day, and day after day, there was bustle and crowding and labor, while the great ships loaded up, and {{one after the other}} spread their white pinions and darted off to the open sea, amid the clash of cymbals and rolling of drums and lusty shouts of those who went and of those who waited. From Orwell to the Dart there was no port which did not send forth its little fleet, gay with streamer and bunting, as for a joyous festival. Thus in <b>the</b> season <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> <b>the</b> might <b>of</b> England put forth on to the waters.|$|R

The Free French 2nd Armored Division, under General Philippe Leclerc, landed in Normandy, and, in <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> summer 1944, led the drive toward Paris.

25|$|The US Standard Light Rail Vehicle was a {{light rail}} vehicle (LRV) built by Boeing Vertol in the 1970s.

The Intercept, questioning Freeh's impartiality, reported that nine days after Freeh's investigation cleared Kazeminy of wrongdoing, Freeh's wife received a one-half ownership stake from Kazeminy in a Palm Beach property valued at $3 million.

25|$|When he {{was elected}} by the ministers to succeed King Thado Minbya, Swa took over a small kingdom barely three years old, and one that still faced several {{external}} and internal threats. In the north, he successfully fought off the Maw raids into Upper Burma, a longstanding problem since <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Sagaing and Pinya kingdoms. He maintained friendly relations with Lan Na in the east, and Arakan in the west, placing his nominees on the Arakense throne between 1373 and 1385. In the south, he brought semi-independent kingdoms of Toungoo (Taungoo) and Prome (Pyay) firmly into Ava's orbit. But his attempts to extend control farther south touched off the Forty Years' War (1385–1424) between Ava and Pegu. After three defeats, Swa had {{to agree to a}} truce with King Razadarit of Pegu in 1391.|$|E
25|$|Then {{there was}} the debate within the Nader {{campaign}} over where to travel in <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the campaign. Some Nader advisers urged him to spend his time in uncontested states such as New York and California. These states – where liberals and leftists could entertain the thought of voting Nader without fear of aiding Bush – offered the richest harvest of potential votes. But, Martin writes, Nader – who emerges from this account as the house radical of his own campaign – insisted on spending {{the final days of}} the campaign on a whirlwind tour of battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Florida. In other words, he chose to go where the votes were scarcest, jeopardizing his own chances of winning 5 percent of the vote, which he needed to gain federal funds in 2004.|$|E
