5|$|Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades was {{announced}} on July 15, 2008, at the 2008 E3 conference, and released on November 16, 2008. Executive Producer David Nathanielsz stated that <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> between releases {{was to help}} give DS players the same depth of content as available to the console players of Guitar Hero. Additionally, Vicarious Visions incorporated the ability to share songs between {{different versions of the}} game through the wi-fi capabilities of the DS in order to expand the number of potential songs to more than 50.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> {{frame of}} the Manhattan Project, Hanford {{engineers}} produced many significant technological advances. As {{no one had ever}} built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, DuPont engineers installed ammonia-based refrigeration systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that the long journey and the siege had a {{detrimental}} effect on the Sultan's health. His death meant that any advances were postponed as the Grand Vizier had to return to Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan, Selim II. Even if Suleiman had lived his army could not have achieved much in <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> that remained between the fall of Szigeth and the onset of winter.

In <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> since Telpuk has transformed from night shift policewoman to pinup girl almost overnight.

Formby lost the case: his plea of ill-health was compromised by his accepting an engagement elsewhere at the same time.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|Sergeant Lope (Demián Bichir) is {{the ranking}} {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant {{who is married}} to Sergeant Hallett. Lope leads the excursion on the planet's surface to the crashed Engineer ship. On the journey back to the lander, Lope notices Hallett's condition deteriorating, which alarms him. Upon reaching the lander, the ship explodes and a Neomorph attacks while another bursts from his husband's throat. A Neomorph attacks Lope when David intervenes and leads the survivors to his base, where Lope discovers Shaw's corpse. He is attacked by a Facehugger, but he is quickly and seemingly saved by Cole, who manages to cut it off him, though his face is severely burned by acid in the process. As Cole is killed by a now mature Alien, Lope escapes with the other survivors to the cargo lander. Aboard Covenant, Lope receives medical treatment, but dies when an Alien erupts from his chest, revealing that despite <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> that the Facehugger was on him, it succeeded in impregnating him.|$|E
5|$|With the {{expansion}} of the electric supply industry in the early 1900s, power stations were built to supply homes with electric lighting. Around Newcastle upon Tyne this led to the construction of power stations at Lemington, The Close and Carville. Two supply companies built the stations, the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company (NESCo) to the east of Newcastle, and the Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company (DisCo) to the west. To meet an increasing demand for electricity, NESCo commissioned Dunston Power Station (later Dunston A Power Station) on the Derwent Haugh, a large flood plain to the west of Gateshead, to balance the supply of the Newcastle area with the Carville station. Construction of the new station began in 1908, the work undertaken by the company of Sir Robert McAlpine. They completed the construction in <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> of 20months, and this was to be their first in a large number of power station constructions, following the decline of the railway industry. In 1910, the station was opened and began generating electricity.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{toxicity}} testing of additional materials is presented. Relative toxicity data on polymers by generic type are presented and include wood, polyurethane flexible foam, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS), and polyisoprene (natural rubber). A second table gives relative toxicity data on fibers and fabrics including wool, nylon, rayon, polyester, and aromatic polyamide. Sulfur-containing materials seemed to exhibit <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>times</b> {{to death of}} laboratory animals. Some chlorine-containing polymers tended to exhibit <b>shortest</b> <b>time</b> to death also while some halogen-containing polymers gave <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>time</b> to incapacitation. Among fibers and fabrics, wool, silk, and polyester exhibited <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>times</b> to incapacitation and times to death. Difficulty in restricting generally accepted materials is discussed and attention is given to other factors important in comparing materials, such as backcoatings and relative weights...|$|R

Therefore, an appropriate choice of relocation technique should be made according to the current system situation: in periods of low usage, the most appropriate relocation technique is by inventory balancing whilst in periods of high usage, then <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>time</b> technique performs best [7, 10].|$|R
5|$|Docherty rebuilt {{confidence}} in the team and Villa {{went on to win}} five consecutive games and retained a place in the Second Division. In <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> that Docherty had been at the club, attendances rose significantly from a low of just over 12,000 against Charlton Athletic in December. In the summer of 1969 the first share issue since 1896 raised £200,000 for the club, £140,000 of which was spent on new players. In the following season, however, Villa took ten games to register a win. By Christmas 1969, Villa were {{at the bottom of the}} Second Division and Docherty was sacked. His successor, Vic Crowe, was unable to prevent Aston Villa from being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in its history in the 196970 season. Despite finishing fourth in the Third Division in the 197071 season, Villa reached the League Cup final after beating Manchester United in the semi-final. They were defeated in the final by Tottenham Hotspur 20. The 197172 season saw the club return to the Second Division as champions with a then divisional record 70 points. They were invited to take part in the 1972 FA Charity Shield but lost 1–0 to Manchester City. In the autumn of 1972, there was a revolt in the boardroom and four of the five directors voted to oust Doug Ellis from the board. Within 43days though, Ellis was reinstated as chairman after he received the support of the largest shareholder Pat Matthews, and the supporters at an EGM, who also voted to replace the existing directors. Their first season back in the Second Division in 197273 saw Villa narrowly miss out on a second successive promotion when they finished third. However, the following season Villa finished 14th and Ellis sacked Crowe, replacing him with Ron Saunders.|$|E
5|$|So the {{production}} could be managed in <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> available, the movie's development was separated into three phases, with each phase being {{dedicated to a}} particular part of {{the production}} process and run by a different unit director answering to Nozue. The movie went through multiple phases {{of trial and error}} until the final product was solidified. Kingsglaive was kept a secret until 2016 when it was near completion, as the developers felt that they had announced its parent video game too early. So as to remain close to the development of Final Fantasy XV, the lead staff of Kingsglaive moved from Visual Works to Business Division 2, the department of Square Enix responsible for the game's development. This was part of an overall shift in development methods when the game was changed from a spin-off to a mainline entry. In addition to the staff of Advent Children, Western companies in gaming and movie production were involved: Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the Assassin's Creed series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including Jurassic World (2015) and the television series Game of Thrones. According to Nozue, around 50 different companies were involved in the film's production: among these was Europe-based company Puppetworks Animation Studio. The internal team was estimated at around 50 people. The cooperation of studios overseas meant that work on the movie could proceed continuously. Without this external aid, Nozue estimated that they would have needed a staff of five hundred people to complete the film in the given timeframe.|$|E
