5|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism {{from the time}} of David I, not only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers.

5|$|In {{the period}} c. 1150 to 1300, the warm dry summers and less severe winters of the Medieval Warm Period allowed {{cultivation}} at much greater heights {{above sea level}} and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying {{areas such as the}} Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. The feudalism introduced under David I, particularly in the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. Barons, who held feudal tenures, had the right to hold baronial courts, which could deal with matters of land ownership. However, <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> feudalism continued to sit beside existing systems of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers.

5|$|The feudalism {{introduced}} under David I, {{particularly in}} the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships, often based on castles, and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms, which overlay the pattern of administration by local thanes.

It also saw the English earl and Latin comes begin to replace the mormaers in the records.

In the event of war with a superior naval power and <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> a naval blockade, the Sachsen-class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack the blockaders. They also had the task of breaking up landing attempts. The German railway network linked the bases so ground forces could be transferred to the sites of enemy landings.|$|E
5|$|Drapier's Letters is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} series of seven pamphlets written between 1724 and 1725 by the Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, Jonathan Swift, to arouse public opinion in Ireland against <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> a privately minted copper coinage that Swift believed to be of inferior quality. William Wood was granted letters patent to mint the coin, and Swift saw the licensing of the patent as corrupt. In response, Swift represented Ireland as constitutionally and financially independent of Britain in the Drapier's Letters. Since the subject was politically sensitive, Swift wrote under the pseudonym M. B., Drapier, to hide from retaliation.|$|E
5|$|During 1548, England {{was subject}} to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various {{religious}} and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose from <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.|$|E

5|$|Edward's reign {{was marked}} by {{economic}} problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with Scotland, at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and Boulogne-sur-Mer in exchange for peace. The transformation of the Church of England into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. Although his father, HenryVIII, had severed {{the link between the}} Church and Rome, HenryVIII had never permitted the renunciation of Catholic doctrine or ceremony. It was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was established {{for the first time in}} England with reforms that included the abolition of clerical celibacy and the Mass and <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> compulsory services in English.|$|E

He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E

40|$|In {{everyday}} conversation, much {{communication is}} achieved using indirect language. This {{is particularly true}} when we utter requests. The decision to use indirect language is influenced {{by a number of}} factors including deniability, politeness, and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> on <b>the</b> receiver <b>of</b> a request. In this paper we report the results of an eye-tracking experiment examining the influence on reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> a request. We manipulate whether context describes a situation in which <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> on <b>the</b> receiver <b>of</b> the request is high (which thus motivates the use of indirect language) with one in which <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> is low (and thus does not motivate the use of indirect language). We compare the comprehension of statements that are phrased indirectly with the comprehension of statements that are phrased more directly. We find that statements phrased indirectly are read more quickly in contexts where <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> on <b>the</b> receiver is high versus when <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition</b> is low. In contrast, we find the processing of statements phrased directly does not vary as a function <b>of</b> level <b>of</b> <b>imposition.</b> This indicates that readers use pragmatic knowledge to guide interpretation of indirect requests. Our data provide an insight into the interface between pragmatic and semantic processing...|$|R
