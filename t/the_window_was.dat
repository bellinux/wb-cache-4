Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the houseâ€”standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving {{the back door of}} the house with a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
5|$|Howell's body later washed ashore and was {{returned}} to Australia for burial; Fraser's remains were never discovered. Howell was accorded a funeral with full military honours, which took place at Warringal Cemetery, Heidelberg on 22 April 1920, with several hundred mourners in attendance; his widow, parents and sister were chief among these. A firing party of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery led the gun carriage bearing the coffin to the cemetery. Captains Adrian Cole, Frank Lukis and Raymond Brownell acted as pallbearers along with five other officers who had served in either the Royal or Australian Flying Corps. On 12 February 1923, a stained-glass window dedicated {{to the memory of}} Howell was unveiled by General Sir Harry Chauvel at St. Anselm's Church of England in Middle Park; Howell {{had been a member of}} the congregation there in his youth. Following the closure of St. Anselm's in 2001, <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> moved to St. Silas's Church, Albert Park, which is now also the parish church for the former parish of St. Anselm.|$|E

5|$|The {{central and}} largest {{room in the}} house is the great hall which was the {{original}} dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the service rooms. The staircase {{to the north of the}} hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E

25|$|The ballet {{became famous}} for Nijinsky's leap {{through one of}} the two large windows {{at the back of the}} stage. The height of the leap was an {{illusion}} though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The skirting board (base board) under <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it actually was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one in the audience saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would soar on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the penultimate chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.|$|E

Her father never allowed other people in the house, forbade any interaction between Genie and her mother, and forced his son to assist with carrying out his abuse while otherwise preventing him from being in Genie's presence. He did not permit them to speak, and especially not to or around Genie, so any conversations they had were out of Genie's earshot, keeping her from hearing any meaningful amount of language.|$|E

The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximize on headroom when leaving the seats. Crash padding was provided along the inner side of the racks in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range.|$|E
25|$|In 1908 the Arkansas Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started {{raising funds}} for a stained-glass window in Dodd's honor. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> made by the Charles F.

Dodd window was unveiled at the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia, on November 7, 1911, where it was displayed for several years. In 1988 it was found in storage and moved back to Arkansas. The window debuted at the Arkansas Museum of Science and Industry in January 1990, and was returned to Richmond in 1998. In January 2004 the Museum of the Confederacy again loaned the Dodd window to Arkansas to commemorate the 140th anniversary of Dodd's trial at the renamed MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History (formerly the Little Rock Arsenal).|$|E

The upper panels depict a nativity scene surmounted by eight angels, the leftmost panel showing Lewis Carroll himself accompanied by Alice Liddell. The windows incorporate symbolic panels relating to Carroll's life, including the Cheshire wheatsheaf, the arms of Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford, and mathematical instruments. Across the base of the window are five panels which include characters from the Alice books together with words from Carroll's poem Christmas Greetings. The characters are based on the illustrations by John Tenniel. On the south wall are windows designed by Trena Cox depicting The Flight into Egypt and The Annunciation which were donated to the church in 1960 in memory of the Broome family of Preston-on-the-Hill.|$|E
25|$|It {{is notable}} that this most {{impressive}} of British victories had, in essence, been proclaimed within only {{five months of}} the cessation of large-scale daylight air battles, and without reference to Hitler and the OKW's reasoning for not proceeding with Operation Sea Lion. The continuing post-war popularity of the Battle of Britain is in fact directly attributable to the Air Ministry's latter-1940 air communiques, the media in turn broadcasting or publishing RAF aircraft claims. Noted above, this in turn led to the March 1941 pamphlet, which inspired {{a wide range of}} cultural responses to the Few, and the Battle of Britain. The Air Ministry built upon this with the development of the Battle of Britain Sunday commemoration, also supported the Battle of Britain clasp for issue to the Few in 1945, and from 1945 Battle of Britain Week. The Battle of Britain window in Westminster Abbey was also encouraged by the Air Ministry, Lords Trenchard and Dowding on its committee. By July 1947 when <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>was</b> unveiled, the Battle of Britain had already attained central prominence as Fighter Command's most notable victory, the Few alone credited with preventing invasion in 1940. Although given widespread media coverage in September and October 1940, RAF Bomber and Coastal Command raids against invasion barge concentrations had already been forgotten by war's end.|$|E
500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence.
