Jouett has retained some recognition locally, including Jouett Elementary School in Louisa County, Virginia and Jack Jouett Middle School in Albemarle County named in his honor. Many contend that his ride was {{far more important than}} that of Paul Revere, however, Revere's ride had the benefit of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem to enshrine it in the American consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Warm {{temperature}} {{in the range of}} 23-28 Celsius and the high relative humidity (>80%) are optimal environments for Clavibacter michiganesis subsp. michiganesis, a tomato bacterial canker symptom development.

25|$|The FLN force {{took the}} low-lying Oued Boulbane, but was {{dominated}} from higher ground by the French paratroopers: 3rd, 4th and Support Companies {{from the north}} of it and 1st and 2nd Companies plus the Headquarters from the south. In a series of running battles over an area of some 30 square kilometres that lasted 48 hours, Commando 41 {{and at least two}} other katibas made several vigorous counterattacks which came to hand-to-hand fighting. Despite support from tactical aircraft, the paratroopers were too thinly stretched to maintain a tight cordon; around 200 FLN fighters managed to slip away <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to changing regulations, {{changes in the}} industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and OCC. Offices have been closed, supervisory regions have been merged, staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut. The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle {{to keep up with}} the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for more problems slipping <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks,</b> potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{material}} started oozing {{out between the}} outer stones of the first construction period below the 150-foot mark, and was referred to by tourists as [...] "geological tuberculosis". This {{was caused by the}} weathering of the cement and rubble filler between the outer and inner walls. As the lower section of the monument was exposed to cold and hot and damp and dry weather conditions, the material dissolved and worked its way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> between the stones of the outer wall, solidifying as it dripped down their outer surface.|$|E

500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept looking around the room, {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were in the room. When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept looking around the room. Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able to look <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|E
500|$|Sissoi Veliky was {{repaired}} by Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée. The French engineers openly ridiculed {{the quality}} of Russian workmanship manifested in a [...] open seam between the belt armour and the ship's hull. This could have completely negated the battleship's protection if a shell had struck it. The Russian investigators reported a horrifying number of less obvious faults and deemed the ship unfit for sailing. The internal decks of the secondary armament casemates were particularly dangerous since the 152mm shells easily fell <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> and holes in the deck. The Saint Petersburg admirals dismissed these concerns, arguing that the gap between armour plates was an inevitable feature of the design, and that the decks and other faults could be fixed by the crew [...] "in their spare time".|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I {{think that was the}} biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the depth}} of the water in Lake Missoula increased, the {{pressure}} {{at the bottom of the}} ice dam increased enough to lower the freezing point of water below the temperature of the ice forming the dam. This allowed liquid water to seep into minuscule cracks present in the ice dam. Over a period of time, the friction from water flowing through these cracks generated enough heat to melt the ice walls and enlarge the cracks. This allowed more water to flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks,</b> generating more heat, allowing even more water to flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks.</b> [...] This feedback cycle eventually weakened the ice dam so much that it could no longer support the pressure of the water behind it, and it failed catastrophically. This process is known as a glacial lake outburst flood, and many such events have occurred in recorded history.|$|E

30|$|The {{indication}} of how well the repaired specimen prevents chloride ion ingress, is called seepage. Seepage {{is measured by the}} volume of water that passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracked</b> concrete. It is suggested that the least amount of water that passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack,</b> <b>the</b> better the rebar of the deck is protected. Several tests are used to check for seepage. One test involves forming a barrier around the top of the concrete core sample, after the sides are waterproofed; water is poured into the barrier on top of the core sample. The water height is kept constant while the rate in which water passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> core is recorded. The number of leaks before <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> were sealed is compared to the number of leaks, after <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> are sealed. This test is mainly used in the field to give an {{indication of}} the success of the repair.|$|R

2500|$|In his 2015 book, Farage {{reflected}} {{that based on}} his experiences, [...] "the NHS is so over-stretched {{that if you can}} afford private health care, you should take it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine. In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks.</b> The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} {{method for}} calculating the leakage flow rate {{through a crack}} in a pressurized pipeline is presented. Calculations of the flow inside, and leakage from, a pipeline with a running crack are performed. For the case of single-phase flow, <b>the</b> flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> can also be calculated using choked-flow theory. The two methods are compared and identical results obtained. The advantage of the present method {{is that it does not}} rely on analytical expressions for <b>the</b> flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack,</b> and it is therefore thought to be applicable for two-phase flow, including phase transition. Hence it may be of use in the development of coupled fluid-structure models for the assessment of running ductile fracture in carbon dioxide transport pipelines...|$|R
