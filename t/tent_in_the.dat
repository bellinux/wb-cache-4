5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life Constantine made plans for a {{campaign}} against Persia. In a letter written to the king of Persia, Shapur, Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well. The letter is undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of a church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the Jordan River before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–337, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off, however, when Constantine became sick in the spring of 337.|$|E
5|$|Chris pays a visit {{during his}} nightly jog, and Ann leaves with him {{so they can}} clear the air. Over dinner, Chris once again acts so optimistic while {{discussing}} the break-up that Ann thinks their relationship is back on and tries to kiss him, severely embarrassing her. Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her to get some sleep. With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big ideas that are well received by Chris.|$|E

When working on small pieces for an oven stove in the tent, Yossarian sees his work as arduous and highly unnecessary as the pieces are too small for anything of real concern, yet at the end while using his stove, he realizes the intricate simplicity of improving the stove's performance. Although this tinkering drives Yossarian mad, any idea of harming Orr is so absurd that Yossarian can't follow through with it.|$|E

500|$|Gjems-Onstad {{was active}} in the boy scouts before the invasion, and he was because of his {{experience}} there asked to instruct in map and compass for a volunteer military training program in late 1939. He thereafter became scout leader as the former leader went to fight in the Winter War. Due to the war in Europe, the scout exercises became increasingly serious, and the scout movement arguably had a big part in the early organisation of the Norwegian resistance. In the winter of 1939/40, Gjems-Onstad commenced training in orienteering and signaling during the night. The weekend before the invasion, he and a friend prepared [...] "for war" [...] by training and sleeping in a <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snow in the forest Vestmarka, which was seen as unusual to do at the time.|$|E
500|$|Karađorđe soon {{joined the}} Filiki Eteria, a Greek {{nationalist}} secret society that intended {{to launch a}} pan-Balkan uprising against the Ottomans. The Filiki Eteria promised Karađorđe a position of military leadership in the planned uprising and offered to smuggle him into the Pashalik of Belgrade. Karađorđe secretly entered the Pashalik on , crossing the Danube together with his servant, Naum Krnar. He then contacted his kum, Vujica Vulićević, who offered him an abode in the oak forest of Radovanjski Lug, near Smederevo. Unbeknownst to Karađorđe, Vulićević was on Obrenović's payroll. After escorting Karađorđe and his servant to a <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest, Vulićević informed Obrenović of Karađorđe's whereabouts through a courier. Shortly thereafter, he {{received a letter from}} Obrenović telling him that Karađorde was to be killed. Vulićević enlisted one of his close confidantes, Danilo Novaković, to take Karađorđe's life. The following morning, just before sunrise, Novaković snuck into Karađorđe's tent and axed him to death while he slept. He then went to the riverside and shot Krnar with a rifle as he was gathering water. Karađorđe's lifeless body was beheaded. His severed head was taken to Belgrade and presented to Marashli Ali Pasha, who had been appointed the governor of the Pashalik two years prior. Ali Pasha had the head flayed, stuffed and sent to the Sultan himself.|$|E

According to Hasan-e Fasa'i's' Farsnama-ye Naseri, during Agha Mohammad's stay in Shusha, one night [...] "a quarrel arose between a Georgian servant named Sadeq and the valet Khodadad-e Esfahani. They raised their voices to such a pitch that the shah became angry and ordered both to be executed. Sadeq Khan-e Shaghaghi, a prominent emir, interceded on their behalf, but was not listened to. The shah, however, ordered their execution to be postponed until Saturday, as this happened to be the evening of Friday (the Islamic holy day), and ordered them back to their duties in the royal pavilion, unfettered and unchained, awaiting their execution the next day. From experience, however, they knew that the King would keep to what he had ordered, and, having no hope, they turned to boldness. When the shah was sleeping, they were joined by the valet Abbas-e Mazandarani, who was in the plot with them, and the three invaded the royal pavilion and with dagger and knife murdered the shah." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "that {{the group}} {{woke up in}} a panic (...) and cut their way out the tent either because an {{avalanche}} had covered the entrance to their tent or because they were scared that an avalanche was imminent (...) (better to have a potentially repairable slit in a tent than risk being buried alive in it under tons of snow). They were poorly clothed {{because they had been}} sleeping, and ran to the safety of the nearby woods where trees would help slow oncoming snow. In the darkness of night they got separated into two or three groups; one group made a fire (hence the burned hands) while the others tried to return to the tent to recover their clothing, since the danger had apparently passed. But it was too cold, and they all froze to death before they could locate their <b>tent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness. At some point some of the clothes may have been recovered or swapped from the dead, but at any rate the group of four whose bodies were most severely damaged were caught in an avalanche and buried under 4 metres (13 ft) of snow (more than enough to account for the 'compelling natural force' the medical examiner described). Dubinina's tongue was likely removed by scavengers and ordinary predation." ...|$|E

As well as experimenting with new, different forms of theatre and presentation, they would perform [...] "under canvas" [...] (a circus <b>tent)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer {{and with the help of}} the Arts Council they was able to take performing arts to places that were without a theatre. English's wife, Mollie Randle later mentioned in an interview that the Arena Theatre's main practice was [...] "of touring Birmingham parks in the summer and halls around the country in the winter, the theatre performed a range of popular plays and classics for adults and children's plays". The first performance took place in Pype Hayes Park in August 1948, and their second in Sparkhill Park. They performed every summer in Cannon Hill Park from 1949 to 1961.
