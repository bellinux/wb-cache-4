5|$|The main German {{attack was}} {{to be made by}} the 50th Reserve Division of the XXIII Reserve Corps, a Prussian {{division}} that had been involved in the Spring Offensive from the outset. It had a few days' rest before the advance was delayed by the Allies at Albert and Dernancourt, and its morale was still high. The right prong of the attack would be made by the 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment (RIR) advancing through the 9th Reserve Division north of Dernancourt against the sector held by the 48th Battalion. The left prong would consist of the 230th RIR, advancing from the area of Morlancourt through Dernancourt against the 47th Battalion and 2nd Tyneside Pioneers. In this sector, I Battalion of the 230th RIR (I/230 RIR) would cross the Ancre and seize Dernancourt, then III/230 RIR would assault <b>the</b> <b>embankment.</b> After the capture of <b>the</b> <b>embankment,</b> the assaulting troops would push northwest over the Albert–Amiens road, then advance west towards Amiens. II/230 RIR was to follow up the assault of III/230 RIR. Both regimental commanders considered that the plan could only succeed if <b>the</b> <b>embankment</b> was weakly held, and made representations to their brigade commander, but to no avail. The German artillery preparation was to last only 45 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>embankment</b> {{began on}} September 16, 1968 using the {{hydraulic}} fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, <b>the</b> <b>embankment</b> was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, {{protection}} against flooding is not only determined by the height of <b>the</b> <b>embankments,</b> but merely by the strength of <b>the</b> <b>embankments.</b> Most of <b>the</b> weak spots in <b>the</b> <b>embankments</b> collapse {{because of a lack}} of strength with regard to stability or internal erosion rather than be flooded. The key to a better utilization of <b>the</b> existing <b>embankments</b> and thereby reduction of the flood risks is to find ways to determine the very processes which undermine <b>the</b> strength of <b>embankments</b> with a high degree of certainty. The system must ultimately be able to sense weaknesses in tens of thousands of kilometers of embankments.|$|R

40|$|Two access {{embankments}} to {{a railway}} bridge, having a maximum height of 18 m, experienced a continuous and severe heave shortly after construction. Vertical displacements reached 120 mm in a 2 -year period. <b>The</b> <b>embankments</b> were designed, by including soil–cement-treated transition wedges, {{to provide an}} increasingly rigid support as the trains approach the stiff bridge abutments. A grid of 10 m deep jet-grouting columns was also built, {{with the purpose of}} stabilising <b>the</b> <b>embankments.</b> Instead, a sustained swelling deformation, which extended to depths of 8 – 10 m, was activated. The compacted soil was low-plasticity clayey material, with a variable percentage of gypsum. <b>The</b> <b>embankments</b> suffered a massive ettringite–thaumasite attack, which was triggered by the simultaneous presence of cement, clay, sulfates and an external supply of water (rain). The paper describes the field extensometer and inclinometer records, the long-term laboratory tests performed, some mineralogical observations and the reactions leading to the growth of expansive crystals, and presents a model that simulates the measured heave. Forces acting against the bridge, which was seriously damaged, were estimated. Remedial measures include removal of the active upper zone of <b>the</b> <b>embankments,</b> and <b>the</b> construction in stages of slabs supporting the rails and founded on piles built on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>embankments.</b> <b>The</b> case is considered unique because of the magnitude of the reaction developed in <b>the</b> <b>embankments,</b> and its damaging action on the nearby bridge structure.

5|$|From {{before midnight}} on 27 March, the tired 12th Brigade {{had been holding}} the railway line between Albert and Dernancourt, having {{relieved}} the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the salient held by the 12th Brigade were along the railway line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–Laviéville road passed under the railway. A mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked the railway line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where the railway line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as if the line there was overrun, the enemy {{would be able to}} fire into the rear of the troops lined out along the railway in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold the railway line; if it was not garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind <b>the</b> <b>embankment.</b> A further difficulty arose from the fact that if an attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce the railway line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from the railway line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along the railway line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the near side of <b>the</b> <b>embankment,</b> but the only way for them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of <b>the</b> <b>embankment,</b> thus exposing themselves to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving motor coach, had headed down <b>the</b> <b>embankment,</b> and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} <b>the</b> <b>embankment.</b> The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down <b>the</b> <b>embankment.</b> All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E

5|$|The 47th Battalion's {{sector was}} also being heavily {{attacked}} by II/229 RIR, {{and apart from}} the initial penetration by the 6th Company, they also held the German assault, with assistance from the Lewis guns of the 48th Battalion on their left, who caught the advancing Germans in enfilade. On one occasion a party of the left forward company of the battalion charged over <b>the</b> <b>embankment,</b> chasing the Germans back across the flats into some buildings, and then forcing them out of that cover. Exposed to heavy fire, this small force withdrew back to the railway embankment by noon. When he received reports of the German assault, Imlay sent two platoons of his right support company forward to reinforce the right flank of the battalion front line. However, the exposed slope between the two positions was swept by German machine gun fire and shell fire, and the men could only be sent forward in rushes, well spread out, so this took some time and they suffered casualties. Soon after their arrival, the right forward company inflicted heavy casualties on another German attempt to rush <b>the</b> <b>embankment.</b> Imlay later sent another platoon to reinforce the left flank, and a carrying party with a resupply of hand grenades. In the meantime, Gellibrand placed the 45th Battalion at Imlay's disposal, although they did not immediately move forward from their position behind the 106th Brigade. German engineers attempted to place pontoon bridges across the Ancre north of Dernancourt to allow assembling troops to cross, but the pontoons were soon riddled and many engineers killed and wounded by guns of the 12th Machine Gun Company. When Imlay became aware of this concentration of German troops, he ordered a company of the 45th Battalion to move to his support lines. During the day, the 47th Battalion suffered 75 casualties.|$|E
5|$|The 48th Battalion {{returned}} to its former positions on the railway embankment {{on the night of}} 3 April, in their absence the line had been subjected to two more German attacks which had been beaten off fairly easily. On this occasion, despite his usual reticence to congest his forward positions with troops, Leane asked for permission to use two companies forward on the railway embankment, and another forward in a series of posts on the extreme left of the battalion sector. These posts were on either side of a gully just south of the Albert–Amiens road. He held his fourth company in a trench called Pioneer Trench, that had been dug on the high ground overlooking <b>the</b> <b>embankment.</b> He was also given a company of the 46th Battalion which he held in reserve near his headquarters. On 4 April, the commander of the 4th Division, Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan decided the main line of defence would be the railway embankment, rather than the high ground behind it. While this did not change the dispositions of the 48th Battalion, it caused Gellibrand to issue an order that <b>the</b> <b>embankment</b> must be held at all costs, which had significant consequences for the coming battle. On the same day, word was received that a German attack was to be expected the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} {{to cross the}} trench during the night but repeatedly failed.
