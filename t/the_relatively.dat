40|$|Recently we {{proposed}} relative observability for {{supervisory control}} of discrete-event systems under partial observation. Relative observability is closed under set unions and hence there exists <b>the</b> supremal <b>relatively</b> observable sublanguage {{of a given}} language. In this paper we present a new characterization of relative observability, based on which an operator on languages is proposed whose largest fixpoint is <b>the</b> supremal <b>relatively</b> observable sublanguage. Iteratively applying this operator yields a monotone sequence of languages; exploiting the linguistic concept of support based on Nerode equivalence, we prove for regular languages that the sequence converges finitely to <b>the</b> supremal <b>relatively</b> observable sublanguage, and the operator is effectively computable. Moreover, {{for the purpose of}} control, we propose a second operator that in the regular case computes <b>the</b> supremal <b>relatively</b> observable and controllable sublanguage. The computational effectiveness of the operator is demonstrated on a case study...|$|R

50|$|Cubanops is a nopinae genus (i.e., have subsegmeted tarsi). These West Indian spiders show {{two other}} unusual leg {{characters}} {{that are often}} found in nopine genera: the ventral translucent keel on the anterior metatarsi, and the translucent extension of the membrane between the anterior metatarsi and tarsi. However, these species differ from the other nopines with these leg modifications in having a distinctively patterned carapace, a greatly widened labium, and a bisegmented metatarsi IV. Two species groups are recognized within the genus: ludovicorum group, with <b>the</b> embolus <b>relatively</b> short and wide, and <b>the</b> female receptaculum <b>relatively</b> low. alayoni group, with <b>the</b> embolus <b>relatively</b> long and narrow, and <b>the</b> female receptaculum <b>relatively</b> high (see Sánchez-Ruiz et al. 2010).|$|R

5|$|According to Schwarz et al., seven traits unite K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae, and {{separate}} them from other species referred to Theriosuchus.

Additionally, K. langenbergensis differs from other species in lacking teeth with low crowns; having a longer maxillary symphysis; having a crest {{on the side of}} the downward-projecting process of the postorbital; having overlap between the postorbital and the front of the squamosal; and a rectangular parietal that does not form part of the supratemporal fenestra.|$|E
