5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} door into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E
25|$|The {{church was}} rebuilt on medieval {{foundations}} between 1905 and 1937. <b>The</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> of the Lady chapel depicts the Tree of Jesse {{made in the}} Abbey's own workshops in Byzantine style mosaic.|$|E

25|$|At 17:00 on 24 July 1943 the 28 {{members of}} the Grand Council met around a massive U-shaped table in the parrot room (the {{anteroom}} of the globe saloon, the office of Mussolini) in Palazzo Venezia. The Duce’s seat was a high chair, and his table was decorated with a red drape with the fasces. From the ceiling was hanging an enormous wrought iron luster. The walls were decorated with blue velvet tapestries and large paintings, and in <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> were etched inscriptions with {{the date of the}} restoration, Year VII of the Fascist calendar.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} with any {{certainty}} whether this symbol was placed in <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> at Wewelsburg before or during the National Socialist Regime. There remains speculation {{as to whether the}} symbol was placed in the hall by the Nazis or whether it was there previously but there is no definitive proof either way. The book sold by the Wewelsburg museum {{on the history of the}} castle from 1933 to 1945 makes no mention of who put it there. The plans for the North Tower by SS architect Hermann Bartels make no mention of it. Scholars today are reluctant to say with any certainty why it was put there, or by whom.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: {{the light from}} the left, <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor.</b> (A. Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with Nicolaes Maes, who produced genre works in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. Balthasar de Monconys visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to Hendrick van Buyten, a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.|$|E
50|$|During {{the above}} time period, {{students}} {{were required to}} wear black footwear, no higher than 1 1/2", and the shoes had to have rubber soles {{so as not to}} scratch or mark-up <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>flooring</b> that was throughout the hallways and general areas.|$|R

25|$|The house {{underwent}} a major renovation starting in 1999, including {{work on the}} exterior wood, tile, and terra cotta brick, and rebuilding the purple slate roofs. Restoration and preservation brought the house and grounds back to the state {{that they were in}} between 1881 and 1891, when the Clemenses most loved the house. <b>The</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> in the front hallway {{underwent a}} historic restoration, and specialists re-stenciled and painted the walls and ceilings and refinished the woodwork to recover the Tiffany-decorated interiors. Restoration was funded in part by two federal Save America’s Treasures grants totaling $3 million. Scanning computers were also used in the restoration. The home today contains 50,000 artifacts: manuscripts, historic photographs, family furnishings, and Tiffany glass. Many of the original furnishings remain at the house, including the Clemens' ornate Venetian bed, an intricately carved mantel from a Scottish castle, and a billiard table.|$|E
500|$|The {{ground floor}} holds the main banking room (the Portland branch of U.S. Bank), and a grand room {{measuring}} [...] with [...] ceilings. [...] The interior is extensively decorated with highly textured materials. Square columns of polished marble topped by Corinthian capitals that incorporate an eagle motif line all four {{sides of the}} main public space. The coffered ceiling is intricately detailed. <b>The</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> is patterned, and the teller windows are divided by Hauteville-marble pillars detailed with bas reliefs. A recessed mezzanine floor runs along {{the north and south}} sides, behind the columns. The bank vaults are in the basement, where the public space also has a marble floor.|$|E
500|$|Ma {{initially}} {{kept the}} Red Guards {{out of the}} museum by organizing his employees as fake Red Guards, and protected the relics by painting Maoist slogans over the display cases. However, {{some of his own}} staff were soon swept by the revolutionary fervour. The extremist faction of the museum workers seized Ma along with other senior officials, and imprisoned him in a storage room for nine months. Trying to coerce the officials into confessing that they were [...] "traitors", the extremists repeatedly lifted them up and dropped them onto <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor.</b> Several of Ma's colleagues died. Ma survived the torture, and was sent to a labour camp in Hubei province for five years.|$|E

The next morning, after rehearsing an Egyptian play, Caligula {{and his family}} are attacked in a coup headed by Chaerea. While leaving the stadium, Caligula's wife and daughter are murdered and Chaerea stabs Caligula in the stomach. With his final breath, he defiantly whimpers [...] "I live!"

2500|$|All {{the offices}} {{on the upper}} floors were removed, and new, larger offices installed. These ranged in size from [...] to [...] in size. The {{flooring}} and arched supports on the upper levels were removed, and replaced with [...] Styrofoam blocks which were covered with {{a thin layer of}} concrete. The women's parlor and the tellers' cages were removed, but the tellers' cage bronze grilles were salvaged and reused for the new tellers' counters. <b>The</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> was retained, as were the embossed bronze brackets, and all gold leaf and gilt inside the rotunda repaired and cleaned. The clear glass of the large windows on Euclid Avenue and E. 9th Street were replaced with smoked glass.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959 Robert, Sr. died, {{leaving his}} wife {{enough money to}} build the house and live comfortably. [...] The designs for the house by Robert, Jr. evolved over four years, but the {{architect}} noted only two indications of disagreement from his client. When the work was about three-fourths complete, {{she looked at the}} traditional 19th-century house next door and remarked [...] "Oh, isn't that a nice house." [...] She also rejected <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> in the dining area, considering it to be ostentatious, but relented as the house was nearing completion. Along with the Guild House, an apartment house for the elderly, also completed in 1964, the Vanna Venturi House was Venturi's first work as an independent architect.|$|E

5|$|The frescoes {{decorating the}} open arcade {{known as the}} Gallery of Hercules were altered by Rainier III, who {{imported}} works by Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli depicting mythological and legendary heroes. In addition many of the rooms were refurnished and redecorated. Many of <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floors</b> have been restored in the staterooms and decorated with intarsia designs which include the double R monogram of Prince Rainier III.|$|R
50|$|On the {{opposite}} side, a broken pediment above the segmental arched main entrance {{is supported by}} engaged columns. It has other classical detailing. Doors of glass and wrought iron open into a vestibule with <b>marble</b> <b>floors</b> and terra cotta bas-reliefs. <b>The</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floors</b> continue into <b>the</b> entrance hall, with a plaster ceiling designed by Thomas Hastings. All other floors are wooden parquet, {{with the exception of}} tile in the kitchen. Some of the doors retain their original Gorham knobs. Many of the original artwork and finishes also remain.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{the north}} side elevator was finally completed. With the elevators freed from the need to carry construction materials and workmen, the tower was finally opened to the public. A number of exterior projects remained, however: granite facing for the upper terrace walls, bronze trim for the main doors, bronze lighting standards for the portico, granite facing for the lower terrace walls, and granite facing for {{the back of the}} auditorium. Some interior work was also needed. For example, holes had been drilled in <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> of the memorial hall so that electric plugs could be installed for lighting fixtures. The unassigned seventh floor finally found a sponsor as well. [...] That year, the Grand Central Council of Cryptic Masonry agreed to sponsor the floor, and by year's end had raised half the funds necessary to complete and furnish the floor.|$|E
2500|$|The new capitol {{building}} was first {{occupied by the}} Alabama Legislature on October 1, 1851. [...] The clock over the portico was installed in February 1852. The clock, along with a bell, was purchased by the City of Montgomery and presented to the state in 1852. [...] In proportion to the {{capitol building}}, the clock appears as a square white box with black dials and crowned with a gabled roof. The dials are [...] in diameter with [...] minute hands and a [...] hour hands. [...] It has been criticized as architecturally inappropriate on various occasions since its initial installation. [...] With the secession of Alabama and six other Deep South states and subsequent formation of the Confederacy in February 1861, the building served as its first capitol until May 22, 1861. A commemorative brass marker {{in the shape of}} a six-pointed star is set into <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> of the front portico at the precise location where Jefferson Davis stood on February 18, 1861, to take his oath of office as the only President of the Confederate States of America.|$|E
2500|$|Wat Hin Maak Peng {{is located}} at Ban Thai Charoen, Tambon Phra Phutthabat near Nong Khai. Wat Hin Maak Peng borders the Mekong River. [...] The temple {{compound}} (sala) is spacious, clean and shady with various species of plants growing around <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> and tiled columns. On one side is a mural depicting a multi-headed snake (Nāga) protecting the Buddha while he is in meditation. Nearby are small wooden kutirs occupied by the monks. During the time of Ajahn Thate a gong would sound well before dawn to signal {{the time when the}} monks would begin their practise of prolonged concentration of the mind on a single point. Around dawn the monks would file out with their bowls to receive food from the villagers. This was taken back to the temple to be consumed as their only meal of the day. The rest of the day was spent sweeping the paths, studying scriptures or in spiritual discussion with Ajahn Thate. A cup of sugared tea was available at lunch and in the afternoon. Chanting took place in the temple after dark and before sleep meditation was again practised.|$|E
60|$|But {{he would}} explore his palace! He girded his sword about him; {{it was a}} scimitar of {{beautiful}} workmanship, and the scabbard was incrusted with precious stones.... From the court he passed into many wonderful rooms, one leading out of the other; there were rich carpets on <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floors,</b> and fountains played softly in the centre, the walls were inlaid with rare marbles; but he never saw a living soul.|$|R
50|$|In late 2003, {{the library}} {{was the site of}} two suicides. In {{separate}} incidents, students jumped from the open-air crosswalks inside the library and fell to <b>the</b> stereogram-patterned <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> below.|$|R

2500|$|All {{three large}} {{compositions}} show the banquet {{taking place in}} the open air or a loggia with a grand architectural setting but with the sky visible, and include a raised terrace closing off the back of the pictorial space. In the Palazzo Labia and Arkhangelskoye paintings (and the Paris and London modelli) there are steps in the foreground leading up to the dining table; although the Melbourne painting lacks these steps, the pattern of <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> gives a similar visual effect. [...] Only the two or three main figures are seated, but various attendants stand around them. [...] All the compositions show a clear debt to the grandly theatrical feast paintings of Paolo Veronese, nearly a century earlier, such as The Wedding at Cana (1563, Louvre) and The Feast in the House of Levi (1573, Accademia, Venice). [...] Venetian taste approved of such explicit reference to the city's artistic tradition. [...] In the Palazzo Labia the frescos were designed in conjunction with a scheme of trompe l'oeil architecture by Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna embracing the whole space. [...] The frescos come almost down to the floor, so that the steps bring the main scene up to a height where they could be seen across a crowded room.|$|E
2500|$|Early on {{the evening}} of August 6, with [...] {{anchored}} about 1,800 yards offshore, Captain Barclay ordered a landing party of 14 petty officers and men from Amphitrite, armed with rifles, pistols and a 6mm Colt machine gun under Ensign Kenneth M. Bennett, with Assistant Engineer David J. Jenkins, Naval Cadets William H. Boardman, Paul Foley and Pay Clerk O.F. Cato to reoccupy the Cape San Juan lighthouse. Almost immediately, a second boat of 14 armed petty officers and men under naval Lt. Charles N. Atwater with Assistant Surgeon A.H. Heppner was dispatched, with Atwater to take command of the landing parties. Atwater ordered Bennett's men to proceed ahead to reoccupy the lighthouse and light the lamp, while his boat squad first secured both boats before following them up to the lighthouse. Though no attack materialized the first night, Cadet Boardman was mortally wounded when his revolver dislodged from its faulty holster, fell to <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> and fired into his left inner thigh as he was entering the darkened lighthouse with three sailors. Assistant Surgeon Heppner initially believed it was a flesh-wound, although Boardman suffered a large loss of blood. He died two days later on the Amphitrite where he was evacuated that night after the ship's surgeon came ashore to accompany him and Dr. Heppner back to the ship. Boardman was one of only 23 combat-related U.S. Navy deaths during the entire Spanish–American War, two Navy deaths during Puerto Rican operations and the only Annapolis cadet to die out of 123 who served on ships in combat operations.|$|E

5000|$|The word {{derives from}} the Old French parchet (the {{diminutive}} of parc), literally meaning [...] "a small enclosed space". Large diagonal squares known as parquet de Versailles were introduced in 1684 as parquet de menuiserie ("woodwork parquet") to replace <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>flooring</b> that required constant washing, which tended to rot the joists beneath the floors. Such parquets en losange were noted by the Swedish architect Daniel Cronström at Versailles and at the Grand Trianon in 1693.|$|R
60|$|MARCHBANKS (softly and musically, but sadly and longingly). No, not a {{scrubbing}} brush, but a boat--a tiny shallop to sail away in, {{far from}} the world, where <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>floors</b> are washed by the rain and dried by the sun, where the south wind dusts the beautiful green and purple carpets. Or a chariot--to carry us up into the sky, where the lamps are stars, and don't need {{to be filled with}} paraffin oil every day.|$|R
50|$|During {{heavy rains}} and flash floods in 1621 and 1629, {{the walls of}} the Kaaba and the mosque {{suffered}} extensive damage. In 1629, during the reign of Sultan Murad IV, the Kaaba was rebuilt with stones from Mecca and the mosque was renovated. In the renovation of the mosque, a new stone arcade was added, three more minarets (bringing the total to seven) were built, and <b>the</b> <b>marble</b> <b>flooring</b> was retiled. This was the unaltered state of the mosque for nearly three centuries.|$|R
