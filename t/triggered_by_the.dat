5|$|Following the election, Mat Herben {{was chosen}} as LPF party leader as Fortuyn's successor. Together with the CDA and the VVD, the party formed part of the {{governing}} coalition, and supplied several members for the Balkenende cabinet. The party was granted four of fourteen cabinet seats, for immigration, economics, health and sports. But without its original leader and lack of a clearly defined organisational structure, the LPF soon succumbed to highly public internal squabbles. By October2002, the break-up of the government coalition was <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bickering of LPF Ministers Eduard Bomhoff and Herman Heinsbroek.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{precipitation}} {{during the}} Tauca phase was probably <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> southern {{movement of the}} ITCZ and the strengthening of the South America monsoon, possibly caused by chilling in the northern hemisphere. Combined with a southern shift of high pressure zones, increased moisture during late glacial times would have flowed from the Amazon. This change, which occurred from 17,400–12,400 years or 18,000–11,000 BP, is recorded in Bolivian Chaco and Brazilian cave records. The Tauca phase may have been <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> southern shift of tropical atmospheric circulation. Although another theory posits that vegetation changes and lake development would have decreased the albedo of the Altiplano, resulting in warming and moisture advection of moisture towards the Altiplano, but such positive feedback mechanisms were considered questionable in a 1998 study. Persistent La Niña climatic conditions {{may have contributed to}} the lake's filling. Conversely, a global climatic warming and a northward shift of the monsoon occurred around 14,500 years ago. The ideal conditions for the development of paleolakes in the Altiplano do not appear to exist during maximum glaciation or warm interglacial periods.|$|E
50|$|In this technique, {{one should}} {{pull the trigger}} to have the shot break {{as if it were}} a glass rod. When the {{compression}} of <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> finger reaches an appropriate point, the 'glass rod' of the trigger will break and discharge the firearm. The 'surprise break' of the 'glass rod' means the pistol remains aligned on the target while the muscles in the shooter's hand adjust from merely gripping the pistol to depressing the trigger at the same time. This disturbance in the muscles of the hand, while it attempts to move the trigger backwards while still holding the pistol steady, can cause the alignment of the firearm to shift, causing the shot to miss the target. The gradual compression of <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand muscles means the alignment may be observed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> eye during the process of compression and kept on the target, regardless of slight changes to <b>the</b> alignment introduced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> muscles of the hand starting to squeeze the trigger.|$|R

The neighborhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighborhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.|$|E

5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E

The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E
