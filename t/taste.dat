5|$|Potassium can be {{detected}} by <b>taste</b> because it triggers {{three of the five}} types of <b>taste</b> sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of potassium ions <b>taste</b> sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also salty to the <b>taste.</b> The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild <b>taste.</b> R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a <b>taste</b> reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid <b>taste,</b> and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E

40|$|Sweet" {{smells and}} <b>tastes</b> are {{perceptually}} similar, and physiological data indicate some commonality of central processing. However, sweet <b>tastes</b> and sweet smells {{do not provide}} interchangeable contexts in psychophysical experiments. The same sweet <b>tastes</b> are perceived as less intense when stronger sweet <b>tastes</b> are present, and they are perceived as more intense when weaker sweet <b>tastes</b> are present, as with sweet smells. However, complementary sets of sweet <b>tastes</b> and smells (e. g., weak sweet <b>tastes,</b> strong sweet smells) do not eliminate these differential context effects (DCEs). The present experiments examined, first, whether DCEs between sweet <b>tastes</b> and smells arise because of differences between odors and <b>tastes</b> {{in the way that}} sweetness scales with intensity as concentration rises, and, second, whether DCEs may be smaller for sweet <b>tastes</b> and smells, when contrasted with sweet <b>tastes</b> and nonsweet smells. The findings were clear: DCEs were consistently present, suggesting they are independent of perceptual similarity. These results imply that DCEs are probably not psychological in origin or centrally based; rather, they may have a subcortical locus. 10 page(s...|$|R
5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the <b>taste</b> of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter <b>taste,</b> a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (<b>taste</b> receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter <b>taste</b> has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any <b>taste</b> buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of <b>taste.</b> They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can <b>taste</b> saltiness.|$|E

After Kimball, Lancaster or Davison provides his or her thoughts on the different varieties, Bishop reveals the brands that Kimball, Lancaster or Davison <b>tasted</b> and compares his or her thoughts {{to those of the}} <b>tasting</b> panel. Bishop and Kimball frequently refer to a running joke that Kimball's <b>tastes</b> are often vastly different from the <b>tasting</b> panel's; as an example, in a segment <b>tasting</b> bottled waters, Kimball picked Boston tap water over all the brands of bottled water.

5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a mild <b>taste</b> with a {{slightly}} bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, it is not recommended, as it has a <b>taste</b> reminiscent of ivy. There {{are a number of}} other mushrooms that appear at the same time and in the same areas as L.subdulcis that are preferable to it, including L.mitissimus, meaning that L.subdulcis is not particularly useful as a foodstuff. The milk is one of distinguishing features, having a sweet <b>taste</b> that turns bitter in the mouth, with L.subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} <b>taste,</b> and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid <b>taste</b> can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid <b>taste</b> is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E

40|$|In the {{presence}} of local public goods differences in <b>tastes</b> are an important determinant {{of the way in}} which partnerships are formed.
