500|$|McGovern was {{assigned}} to Liberal Army Airfield in Kansas and its transition school to learn to fly the B‑24 Liberator, an assignment he was pleased with. McGovern recalled later: [...] "Learning how to fly the B‑24 was <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the training. It was a difficult airplane to fly, physically, because {{in the early part}} of the war, they didn't have hydraulic controls. If you can imagine driving a Mack truck without any power steering or power brakes, that's about what it was like at the controls. It was the biggest bomber we had at the time." [...] Eleanor was constantly afraid of her husband's suffering an accident while training, which claimed a huge toll of airmen over the course of the war. This schooling was followed by a stint at Lincoln Army Airfield in Nebraska, where McGovern met his B-24 crew. Traveling around the country and mixing with people from different backgrounds proved to be a broadening experience for McGovern and others of his generation. The USAAF sped up training times for McGovern and others due to the heavy losses that bombing missions were suffering over Europe. Despite, and partly because of, the risk that McGovern might not come back from combat, the McGoverns decided to have a child, and Eleanor became pregnant. In June 1944, McGovern's crew received final training at Mountain Home Army Air Field in Idaho. They then shipped out via Camp Patrick Henry in Virginia, where McGovern found history books with which to fill downtime, especially during the trip overseas on a slow troopship.|$|E

2500|$|B. cephalotes has {{two main}} ways of {{detecting}} prey: tactile cues and olfactory cues.

60|$|I had {{dispensed}} with the monkey, {{after trying to}} get along with the creature for an hour or two, and went around only with my music. I would rather manage an army of anti-renters than one monkey. With the hurdy-gurdy slung around my neck, therefore, I followed my uncle, who actually sold another watch before we reached a tavern. Of course we did not presume to go to Congress Hall, or the Eagle, for we knew we should not be admitted. This was <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> our adventures. I am of opinion my uncle made a mistake; for he ventured to a second-class house, under the impression that one of the sort usually frequented by men of our supposed stamp might prove too coarse for us altogether. I think we should have been better satisfied with the coarse fare of a coarse tavern, than with the shabby-genteel of the house we blundered into. In the former, everything would have reminded us, in a way we expected to be reminded, that we were out of the common track; and we might have been amused with the change, though it is one singularly hard to be endured. I remember to have heard a young man, accustomed from childhood to the better habits of the country, but who went to sea, a lad before the mast, declare that the coarseness of his shipmates--and there is no vulgarity about a true sailor, even when coarsest--gave him more trouble to overcome, than all the gales, physical sufferings, labor, exposures and dangers, put together. I must confess, I have found it so, too, in my little experience. While acting as a strolling musician, I could get along with anything better than the coarse habits which I encountered at the table. Your silver-forkisms, and your purely conventional customs, as a matter of course, no man of the world attaches any serious importance to; but there are conventionalities that belong to the fundamental principles of civilized society, which become second nature, and with which it gets to be hard, indeed, to dispense. I shall say as little as possible of the disagreeables of my new trade, therefore, but stick to the essentials.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the mechanical defenses of leaves eaten by Alouatta palliata from different social groups at Hacienda La Pacifica in Costa Rica. Leaves were sampled from the home-ranges of groups living in different microhabitats. Specimens were collected during the wet and dry seasons from the same tree, same plant part, and same degree of development as those eaten by the monkeys. The toughness of over 300 leaves was estimated using a scissors test on a Darvell mechanical tester. Toughness values were compared between social groups, seasons, and locations on the leaves using ANOVA. Representative samples of leaves were also sun-dried for subsequent scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analyses in an attempt to locate silica on the leaves. Both forms of mechanical defense (toughness and silica) were found to be at work in the plants at La Pacifica. Fracture toughness varied significantly by location within single leaves, indicating that measures of fracture toughness must be standardized by location on food items. Monkeys made some food choices based on fracture toughness by avoiding <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> leaves and consuming <b>the</b> least <b>tough</b> portions. Intergroup and seasonal differences in the toughness of foods suggest that subtle differences in resource availability can have a significant impact on diet and feeding in Alouatta palliata.

40|$|Current energy {{production}} {{is done in}} a way that cannot be sustained ultimately. Biomass is ideal as a sustainable alternative because it can be used in the existing energy infrastructure. For coal power plants verge grass is one of the products being considered for co-firing. The moisture content and its bioactivity currently prevent direct co-firing on a large scale. A very new and promising pre-treatment technique to counter this is wet torrefaction. Wet torrefaction does not evaporate the moisture, it allows a precise temperature and thus process control, high heat transfer and a combined washing out of unwanted salts. To predict the decomposition of verge grass during wet torrefaction a reaction model was set up. Hemicellulose and cellulose kinetic data was used from previous work on corn cob and pure cellulose. The model was tested with data from research on sugar maple wood meal decomposition. Wet torrefaction experiments showed that verge grass decomposes very rapidly in contrary to the model. Experiments done on xylan showed a very slow decomposition. Bagasse decomposition was very hard to monitor because very little decomposition products were detected. A possible explanation could be that grass is very young and thus has a low degree of polymerization. Xylan and bagasse on the other hand are already treated and therefore <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original material are being torrefied. Overall the biomass species had a very high solid mass loss. Verge grass and bagasse retained around 30 % of the original mass and no solid residue was found with xylan. The solid fraction and liquid fraction that could be accounted for is lower than half of the original mass. Although additional tests are needed to accurately predict the decomposition of verge grass a design was made for a pre-treatment plant. This facility was regarded as a stand-alone facility and consists of several parallel CSTR’s and a heat exchanger. The needed calculations are performed to compare wet torrefaction with alternatives.

40|$|As {{human capital}} {{is a major}} source of {{economic}} growth in today's organizations, {{there is a need for}} well-functioning human resource practices that are designed to guide and direct the effort of employees. This thesis investigates three relevant human resource practices: subjective performance evaluations, target agreements and intra-firm trainings. Four empirical papers are presented that reveal insights about biases in performance evaluations, gender differences in manager's evaluation behavior, the determinants and effects of using target agreements and the effects of intra-firm trainings. Chapter 2 examines the often claimed conjecture that subjective performance evaluations are biased due to personal preferences of supervisors towards their subordinates. It is hence empirically analyzed whether the social proximity in a supervisor-subordinate relationship implies lenient evaluations when holding the performance of individuals constant. Based on personnel records of a call-center it is shown, while controlling for objective performance measures and using fixed effects regressions, that employees in smaller teams receive more lenient evaluations compared to employees working in larger teams. Also, a repeated appraisal by the same supervisor implies a more positive evaluation as compared to evaluations in first-time supervisor-subordinate relations. The third chapter analyzes whether female and male managers show different behavior when evaluating their subordinates. In detail, the gender difference in differentiating between employees is investigated. Higher differentiation in evaluations increases the marginal return for effort and should hence improve the incentive setting for employees. While conducting fixed effects regressions and eliminating unobserved heterogeneity between work units it is revealed that units that are supervised by female managers receive more differentiated grades than units with male supervisors. Also, female managers seem to do well in <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> differentiation, namely in assigning poor grades to employees. In chapter 4, an empirical analysis on the determinants and the effects of using target agreements on firm's performance is presented. Based on a large-scale survey data set of firms (IAB Panel) for the years 2005 and 2007, the company and workforce characteristics that may determine the use of target agreements in firms are analyzed. Moreover, it is shown that the introduction of target agreements seems to positively affect firm's performance. In the last chapter, the effects of employees' training participation on their absence behavior and turnover probability are being studied. Human capital theory suggests that receiving training in general skills increases their market value for other firms and should imply an increased turnover probability if wages are not adequately matched. Furthermore, accumulating human capital through training increases the employees' opportunity cost of working. Absenteeism should hence decrease persistently. Based on personnel records of a multinational firm we find that, in contrast to human capital predictions, general training leads to a decreased turnover probability. Loyalty is hence even reduced as general training may be perceived as a signal of trust in the employee. Furthermore, only a short term decrease in absenteeism is found for trained employees suggesting that employees might temporarily reciprocate to firm-sponsored trainings...|$|R
