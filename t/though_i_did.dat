According to Moberly, his {{appearance}} was [...] "most repulsive... its expression odious. His complexion was dark and rough." [...] Jourdain noted [...] "The man slowly turned his face, which was marked by smallpox; his complexion was very dark.

A man later described as [...] "tall... with large dark eyes, and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat" [...] came up to them, and showed them the way to the Petit Trianon.|$|E

In {{a letter}} to the Jesuit Father Herman Heuser, Sheehan's American biographer, Holmes explained: [...] "I was at Doneraile and called every day after luncheon, that time being the best for him. He knew, and I feared, he was dying, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not admit it. He bade me go to his library and select a book.

"This feeling led me {{into the}} excess of being very rude to that zealous and most {{charitable}} man, Mr. Spencer, {{when he came to}} Oxford in January, 1840, to get Anglicans to set about praying for Unity.
