5|$|Bryant's {{personal}} {{papers were}} transferred to Bullitt, with whom they remained until their daughter, Anne, donated the collection <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> University in 2004. They exist as separate collections, the Louise Bryant Papers (MS 1840) and the William C. Bullitt Papers (MS 112) in the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale. The Louise Bryant Papers consists of about 19 linear feet (5.8 m) of letters, texts, photographs, art, and other materials that she created or collected between 1916 and 1936.|$|E
5|$|Carson bequeathed her {{manuscripts and}} papers <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> University, to take {{advantage}} of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Her longtime agent and literary executor Marie Rodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{hoped to}} attend Yale's law school {{beginning}} in 1935. Yale officials at first denied his {{admission to the}} law school because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 {{as a student at}} the University of Michigan Law School and was eventually admitted in the spring of 1938 <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> Law School. Ford earned his LL.B. degree in 1941 (later amended to Juris Doctor), graduating in the top 25 percent of his class.|$|E

5|$|Harold Melvin Agnew {{was born}} in Denver, Colorado on March 28, 1921, {{the only child of}} a pair of stonecutters. He {{attended}} South Denver High School and entered the University of Denver, where he majored in chemistry. He was a strong athlete who pitched for the university softball that won a championship. He left the University of Denver in January 1942, but had enough credits to graduate Phi Beta Kappa with his Bachelor of Arts degree in June, and he received a scholarship <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> University.|$|E
5|$|Harvard had cruised to a 91 {{record in}} conference play {{and then fell}} to 72 Princeton on March 1.

5|$|Lawrence {{followed}} Swann to the University of Chicago, {{and then}} <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> University in New Haven, Connecticut, where Lawrence completed his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in physics in 1925 as a Sloane Fellow, writing his doctoral thesis on the photoelectric effect in potassium vapor. He was elected {{a member of}} Sigma Xi, and, on Swann's recommendation, received a National Research Council fellowship. Instead of using it to travel to Europe, as was customary at the time, he remained at Yale University with Swann as a researcher.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to several}} {{academic}} commitments, work on Theory of Literature {{did not begin}} until 1945, after Wellek and Warren received a stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation {{over a period of}} two summers. Wellek and Warren began dividing their responsibilities, at first evenly, but with more work done by Wellek as Warren dealt with the illness, and later loss, of his wife Eleanor in 1946. During this period of writing Wellek transferred <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> University (1946) and Warren to the University of Michigan (1948), but collaboration continued.|$|E
5|$|After leaving office, Taft {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> as a professor, {{continuing his}} political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, President Harding appointed Taft as chief justice, an office {{he had long}} sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues, but under him, there were advances in individual rights. In poor health, he resigned in February 1930. After his death the next month, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen was curious and interested in learning.|$|E

5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard to study with Gray. Eaton later returned <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Shaughnessy {{traveled}} <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> University, {{which was}} considering three candidates for its vacant head coaching position. A month later, {{he said he}} was not interested in Yale, but that he might move to an unnamed Eastern school with little football tradition. Shaughnessy resigned in March 1942 to move to Maryland. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article reported that he decided to leave when he realized Stanford might discontinue its football program during World War II. He expressed disappointment about leaving, but believed the new job would provide a challenge. Maryland reportedly offered the same salary as Stanford, $9,000 ($ adjusted for inflation), and a position on its faculty.|$|E
5|$|In early 1914, Baker {{graduated}} from Princeton, majoring in history, politics, and economics, {{and finished with}} above-average grades. He was named the school's best football player, hockey player, and all-round athlete {{and the man who}} had done the most for Princeton. The football team had posted a record of twenty wins, three losses, and four ties in Baker's three seasons as a member; the hockey team fared equally well with a record of twenty wins and seven losses. By the end of his football career at Princeton, he had two notable achievements: he had never fumbled a punt, and had never lost <b>to</b> <b>Yale.</b>|$|E

Returning <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> for one more season, he improved to 41 points over 28 games, leading his team in scoring for the second consecutive year. Higgins earned ECAC Player of the Year (co-recipient with Cornell Big Red goaltender David LeNeveu) and First All-Star Team honors; he was also recognized regionally on the NCAA East All-American Team.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of {{elements}} of Portland's industrial laundry era, {{and its relation}} to the women’s labor movement {{and the rise of the}} middle class in the United States, are factors in the building's listing on the National Register. Built and first operated by businessman Charles F. Brown, the building was bought in 1927 by Home Services Company, a power-laundry consortium. American Linen Supply and then Perfect Fit Manufacturing, a maker of automotive fabrics, used the building after Home Services sold it in 1950. Acquired by Alter LLC in 2008, the building is home <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> Union (YU), a contemporary arts center.|$|E
5|$|Although Centre {{was known}} as one of Kentucky's {{foremost}} colleges, Cooper's father wanted him to broaden his education and, after one year at Centre, Cooper transferred <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> College in New Haven, Connecticut. At Yale, he was a classmate of his future U.S. Senate colleague, Stuart Symington. Cooper was active in many extracurricular activities at Yale, including the Sophomore German Committee, the Junior Promenade Committee, the Student Council, the Class Day Committee, the Southern Club, the University Club, and Beta Theta Pi. A member of the Undergraduate Athletic Association, he played football and basketball, becoming the first person in Yale history to be named captain of the basketball team in his junior and senior years. In his senior year, he was accepted into the elite Skull and Bones society but regretted not being accepted into Phi Beta Kappa. Upon graduation, he was voted most popular and most likely to succeed in his class.|$|E

5|$|For many years, Accum's {{establishment}} was {{the only}} significant institution in England that provided lectures on the theory of chemistry as well as training in laboratory practice. Amateurs were welcome to perform simple experiments on site to enhance their knowledge. Accum's teachings attracted various prominent students. These included the well-known London politician and later prime minister Lord Palmerston, the Duke of Bedford, and the Duke of Northumberland. Additionally, his laboratory {{was the first in}} Europe to be visited by students and scientists from the United States, among whom were Benjamin Silliman and William Dandridge Peck. When Silliman later became Professor of Chemistry at Yale College (precursor <b>to</b> <b>Yale</b> University) in New Haven, he ordered his first laboratory equipment from Accum in London. Accum's biographer, Charles Albert Browne, stated in his 1925 work that some of the older American colleges still had sales receipts from Accum's London business.|$|E
