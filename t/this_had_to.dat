The original capacity was 65,000 but <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be reduced in later years to 53,000 for safety reasons. 11,000 of these were on the East Terrace and the conversion to all-seater stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to 47,500.

5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, almost all of the compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E
5|$|The American {{official}} most {{associated with}} the conflict in Laos was Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who served from December 1964 until June 1969. He {{was also one of}} the most controversial. Considered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many, Sullivan was despised by the American high command (both Army and Air Force) in Saigon, Sullivan's demand that he alone maintain complete control over every aspect of American military operations in Laos and the stringent restrictions that he imposed upon those operations, earned him few friends among the military. Few of his detractors, however, considered the difficulties of the ambassador's position. He had to balance the competing interests of the CIA, the Seventh Air Force, MACV, and the Thais, and <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be done without alienating Souvanna Phouma, an ally in all but name who acquiesced to almost every U.S. action within his country, short of outright invasion.|$|E

5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with the modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced pump failure and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at liftoff due to a failure of the sustainer turbopump. Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the sustainer inlet valve to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed flight-worthy. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E
5|$|The convoys {{of wounded}} were met {{a few miles}} from El Arish by {{infantry}} with sandcarts lent by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, so the wounded who had endured the cacolets travelled in comfort to the receiving station, arriving at 04:00 on 25 December. The 52nd (Lowland) Division supplied medical stores and personnel to assist, but although arrangements were made for evacuation to the railhead two days later, evacuation by sea was planned. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be postponed due to a gale with rain and hail on 27 December and it was not until 29 December that the largest single ambulance convoy organised in the campaign, 77 sandcarts, nine sledges and a number of cacolet camels, moved out in three lines along the beach with 150 wounded.

5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Kingsglaive was based around {{a portion of}} the {{original}} opening of Final Fantasy XV, which would have shown the invasion of Insomnia by Niflheim's army. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be cut from the game due to concerns over the volume of content, but as the team still wanted to show this event, they incorporated it into the plot of Kingsglaive. To ensure a connection between the movie and the game, both projects used the same shared script as their core. That script was written by Saori Itamuro based on a draft by Kazushige Nojima. The team also wanted a proper cinematic experience that would appeal to a large audience, so they brought in a professional screenwriter, Takashi Hasegawa, to create a full-length cinematic script. Los Angeles-based company Hydra Entertainment assisted with creating the script alongside Hasegawa, in addition to writing assistance from Hollywood staff. The storyline was designed to complement and {{set the stage for the}} events of Final Fantasy XV without revealing major plot elements from the game. The movie was created for a primarily English audience, with the script translation handled by Square Enix's in-house localization team. As many team members were Final Fantasy fans, frequent nostalgic references to earlier entries in the series were included.|$|E
