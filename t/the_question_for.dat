5|$|Mayer was {{introduced}} to topology by his colleague Vietoris when attending his lectures in 1926 and 1927 at a local university in Vienna. He was told about the conjectured result {{and a way to}} its solution, and solved <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> the Betti numbers in 1929. He applied his results to the torus considered as the union of two cylinders. Vietoris later proved the full result for the homology groups in 1930 but did not express it as an exact sequence. The concept of an exact sequence only appeared in print in the 1952 book Foundations of Algebraic Topology by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod where the results of Mayer and Vietoris were expressed in the modern form.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

25|$|In June 2002 and February 2003 the Lithuanian Parliament amended Lithuania's laws on {{referendum}}s.

After the amendment only a simple majority of participants in favour was required for the referendum to pass, while still having the requirement for turnout to be over 50%. To help reach the turnout requirement, the voting hours were extended, postal voting was allowed for 11 days before the referendum, and a second voting day was added.

25|$|This {{argument}} has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. The point is that, in instances {{of some sort}} of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how could it be possible that every single time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the relationship between science literacy levels and some mental process skills of chemistry teaching undergraduates and to evaluate efficiency and mono and multi interaction of some chosen basic and causal mental processes. 6 open-ended questions covering different chemistry subjects and a semi-structured interview including 3 sub-questions relevant to those questions and that search efficiency of mental process have been prepared considering readiness level of the sample in order to determine efficiency of mental processes such as prediction, identifying variables, data collection and inference. The study sampling included 20 students chosen with random sampling method among the pre-service chemistry teachers studying at Ataturk University. From the interview results, there have been determined 97, 2 % efficiency level from <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> determining prediction skill; 67, 6 % efficiency level from <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> determining identifying variable process skill; 75 % efficiency level from <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> determining data collection and 80, 6 % efficiency level from <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> determining inference skill. According to this, the prediction mental process skill's having fairly higher efficiency level have mutually reinforcing mental process abilities of all active users a result of the like are not displayed, whereas, it can be said what a high level the front shorthand based on repeated experience present is. Consequently, there has been concluded that science literacy levels of the students in the sample is not high enough in terms of chosen and analyzed mental process skills...|$|R
