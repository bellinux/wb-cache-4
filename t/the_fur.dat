5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning <b>the</b> <b>fur,</b> untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into <b>the</b> <b>fur.</b> To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in <b>the</b> <b>fur.</b> When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E

5|$|It is a small, mouse-like rodent. It {{differs from}} the very similar eastern voalavo mainly in some measurements, such as a greater tail length. It also resembles small species of Eliurus, but <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> is darker {{and there is no}} tail tuft. <b>The</b> <b>fur</b> is soft, short, and thick, and appears dark gray on most of the upperparts, but more {{brownish}} on the sides. On the back, the cover hairs, which form the main part of <b>the</b> <b>fur,</b> are three-colored: most of the hair is gray, followed by a narrow light buff band and a black tip. The longer guard hairs are black. <b>The</b> <b>fur</b> of the underparts is not different in overall color, but the individual hairs are gray for about three quarters of their length and white at the tips, except for those at the chin, which are white throughout.|$|E

5|$|The first fur test allowed Sulley {{to run an}} {{obstacle}} course. Results were not satisfactory, as such objects would catch and stretch out <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> due to the extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> would go through the objects.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While his study of <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|During {{the short}} {{existence}} of the Council, it became involved with regulating <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> trade.

The Council invited people involved in <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> trade from Keewatin, Manitoba, and even the United States government to discuss the matter. The purpose of the meeting was to solicit testimony and gain {{the support of the}} industry, so that the Council could effectively draft, implement and enforce legislation.|$|E

5|$|Patrick Sinclair, the {{military}} governor at Fort Michilimackinac, organized the British expeditions {{from the north}} in present-day Michigan. Beginning in February 1780, he directed traders to circulate through their territories and recruit interested tribes for an expedition against St. Louis.

5|$|T. o. oryx (Pallas, 1766; Cape eland): {{also called}} alces, barbatus, canna and oreas. It {{is found in}} south and {{southwest}} Africa. <b>The</b> <b>fur</b> is tawny, and adults lose their stripes.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{northern}} <b>fur</b> seal's range overlaps {{almost exactly}} {{with that of}} Steller sea lions; occasional cohabitation occurs at reproductive rookeries, notably in the Kurils, the Commander Islands, and Tyulen'i Islands. <b>The</b> only other <b>fur</b> seal found in the Northern Hemisphere is <b>the</b> Guadalupe <b>fur</b> seal which overlaps slightly with <b>the</b> northern <b>fur</b> seal's range in California.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Furs</b> were {{valid for}} more than four centuries, until they were {{abolished}} by means of the Nueva Planta decrees signed by Philip V of Castile in 1707.

5|$|The Biddle House, one of {{the oldest}} {{structures}} on Mackinac Island, was built about 1780 and is interpreted in its role as a prosperous family home during the height of <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> trade in the 1820s.|$|E
5|$|The HBC {{drastically}} reduced the price paid for furs, by 50% in many cases. By this time, however, <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> trade was in decline, {{both on the}} coast and the continent, due to a general depletion of fur-bearing animals, along with {{a reduction in the}} demand for beaver pelts. A financial panic in 1837 resulted in a general slump in <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> and China trade, bringing an end to a half-century boom. During the 1840s, the HBC closed most of their coastal trading posts, leaving the coast trade to just Fort Simpson and the Beaver, with the new depot at Fort Victoria anchoring the southern coast.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fur,</b> {{which is}} soft, dense, and thick, is dark brown to gray on the upperparts, grading to black on the midback and {{yellowish}} brown on the sides. The underparts are sharply different in color. There, the hairs are dark gray at their bases and white at the tips, so that <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> appears grayish white. <b>The</b> <b>fur</b> is shorter and darker than in T.talamancae and softer and thicker than in H.alfaroi. Young animals have darker, finer, and softer fur. Pine separated the subspecies alleni and orinus {{on the basis}} of their darker fur, but Musser and colleagues could not confirm this pattern and found paler and darker specimens within the same geographical regions.|$|E

5|$|The impala has {{a special}} dental {{arrangement}} on the front lower jaw similar to the toothcomb seen in strepsirrhine primates, which is used during allogrooming to comb <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> {{on the head and}} the neck and remove ectoparasites.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. <b>The</b> <b>fur</b> {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in <b>the</b> <b>fur,</b> although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E
5|$|They have a {{moderately}} long single coat with no undercoat. Feathering of <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> {{appears on the}} chest, belly, ears and {{on the back of}} the legs. The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in <b>the</b> <b>fur.</b> Docked tails were often used in working dogs, as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. <b>The</b> <b>fur</b> consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. <b>The</b> <b>fur</b> is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on <b>the</b> <b>fur,</b> whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E
5|$|Arixeniina {{represents}} two genera, Arixenia and Xeniaria, with a {{total of}} five species in them. As with Hemimerina, they are blind and wingless, with filiform segmented cerci. Hemimerina are viviparous ectoparasites, preferring <b>the</b> <b>fur</b> of African rodents in either Cricetomys or Beamys genera. Hemimerina also has two genera, Hemimerus and Araeomerus, {{with a total}} of 11 species.|$|E
