The entire joint crew took part in a crew photo, which was followed by a joint crew news conference with U.S., Russian and Japanese media. Later in the day commander Alan Poindexter, mission specialists Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger, Stephanie Wilson and Clayton Anderson took time out to talk with students from Eastern Guilford High School in Gibsonville, North Carolina and with third and fourth graders from that school district.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer proteins (PI-TPs) catalyze {{exchange of}} phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylcholine (PC) between membrane bilayers in vitro. We find that Ser- 25, Thr- 59, Pro- 78, and Glu- 248 {{make up a}} set of rat (r) PI-TP residues, substitution of which effected a dramatic reduction in the relative specific <b>activity</b> for PI <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> without significant effect on PC <b>transfer</b> <b>activity.</b> Thr- 59 was of particular interest {{as it is a}} conserved residue in a highly conserved consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation motif in metazoan PI-TPs. Replacement of Thr- 59 with Ser, Gln, Val, Ile, Asn, Asp, or Glu effectively abolished PI transfer capability but was essentially silent with respect to PC <b>transfer</b> <b>activity.</b> These findings identify rPI-TP residues that likely cooperate to form a PI head-group binding/recognition site or that lie adjacent to such a site.

We measured the {{activity of}} cholesteryl ester transfer protein in plasma, designated cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> <b>activity,</b> as the rate of cholesteryl ester transfer between exogenous radiolabelled low-density and high-density lipoproteins. The effect of hypothyroidism on cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> was investigated in 13 athyreotic patients who were studied in the hypothyroid condition and in the euthyroid state, after they had received triiodothyronine supplementation for 33 to 67 days. During hypothyroidism plasma total cholesterol, very-low- plus low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein A 1 and B were significantly higher than in the euthyroid state. Cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> was 15 % lower during hypothyroidism (P < 0. 02), and an effect of treatment duration was observed. The changes in high-density lipoprotein total cholesterol (P < 0. 02), free cholesterol (P < 0. 001), triacylglycerol (P < 0. 05) and the free cholesterol/cholesteryl ester molar ratio in high-density lipoproteins (P < 0. 01) were inversely related to the changes in cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> <b>activity.</b> We concluded that thyroid hormone is involved in the regulation of cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> protein <b>activity,</b> and that cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> protein <b>activity</b> {{may play a role in}} the alterations in high-density lipoprotein lipids observed in hypothyroidism...|$|R

Of various CyDs, AF-liposomes associated with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CyD) (pDNA/γ-CyD/AF-liposomes) showed the highest gene <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> in HepG 2 cells without any significant cytotoxicity. In addition, γ-CyD enhanced the encapsulation ratio of pDNA with AF-liposomes, and also increased gene <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> as the entrapment ratio of pDNA into AF-liposomes was increased. γ-CyD stabilized the liposomal membrane of AF-liposomes and inhibited the release of calcein from AF-liposomes. The stabilizing effect of γ-CyD may be, at least in part, involved in the enhancing gene <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> of pDNA/γ-CyD/AF-liposomes. Therefore, these results suggest the potential use of γ-CyD for an enhancer of transfection efficiency of AF-liposomes...|$|R

The <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> was assayed by the ESR peak height increase when spin-labeled PC vesicles were incubated with egg yolk PC vesicles.

The partial purification resulted in a 405 -fold increase in the specific <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> {{compared with that of}} the hemolysate. The molecular weight of the PC transfer protein was estimated to be 23, 000 by gel filtration. The <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> was inactivated by heat-treatment at 75 °C for 10 min. Phospha-tidylserine vesicles strongly inhibited the activity. Half-maximal inhibition occurred on addition of 0. 24 mol % of phosphatidylserine vesicles to the incubation mixture.

Hydrogen bonding to these ether oxygens when these ligands are complexed is greatly decreased as a result of ionic Mn+-O bonding. <b>Transfer</b> <b>activity</b> coefficients of the barium complexes are found to be the same as those of the ligands.

40|$|AbstractThe {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of the ceramide transporter, CERT has been studied using a fluorescence assay. CERT {{is responsible for the}} in vivo non-vesicular trafficking of ceramide between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. In this study we have examined how the membrane environment surrounding the ceramide substrate, the membrane packing density and the membrane charge, are affecting the ceramide <b>transfer</b> <b>activity.</b> To examine this we have used an anthrylvinyl-labeled ceramide analogue. We found that if ceramide is in a tightly packed environment such as in sphingomyelin or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine containing membranes, the CERT <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> is markedly reduced. Ceramide in fluid membranes on the other hand are available for CERT mediated transfer. CERT also favors membranes that contain phosphatidylinositol 4 -monophospate, due to its binding capacity of the pleckstrin homology domain towards phosphatidylinositol 4 -monophospate. From this study we conclude that the membrane matrix surrounding ceramide, that is ceramide miscibility, is largely affecting the <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> of CERT...|$|R
