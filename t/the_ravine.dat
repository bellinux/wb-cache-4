5|$|Across {{the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> from Cave 1 on {{the other}} Stupa hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga shrine on the island.|$|E
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> {{were long}} closed {{off from the}} city. The road network either {{bypassed}} <b>the</b> <b>ravines,</b> or crossed bridges running above them. Many people travelling through the city by private motor vehicle can thus be entirely unaware of the sharp variations in topography. It is only {{in recent years that}} a concerted effort has been made to integrate <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> into a system of paths useful for pedestrians and cyclists. A number of <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> now have paved paths, well maintained bridges, and stairs. Many others do not have such amenities, and the city intends to leave most of these areas unspoilt. <b>The</b> <b>ravines</b> are today popular with hikers and bicyclists, to the extent that erosion and wildlife disruption are becoming a problem in certain areas. While suitable for hiking and cycling, the rivers and creeks running through <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> are still quite polluted and swimming and wading is inadvisable. There are many dangers for those exploring <b>the</b> <b>ravines.</b> Many areas are very rugged with poor paths and steep cliffs. There are few guardrails or stairs. Waterways are often fast moving and very cold, and can be deadly if one falls in. Poison ivy and nettles are also abundant.|$|R

The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck's artillery park had been in place since dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to the meadows beyond the Mühlberge, not <b>the</b> <b>ravine,</b> and had to be reset.

Five {{people were killed in}} Cuba, four of whom from drowning and one from electrocution. In nearby Haiti, flooding was worst in Les Cayes, where <b>the</b> <b>Ravine</b> River destroyed many homes and left 1,300homeless. Throughout the country, flooding severely damaged crops and wrecked bridges and roads. There were 21deaths in the Les Cayes area. In the Dominican Republic, there were 12deaths around Santo Domingo after mudslides buried people. Four towns were isolated after rivers exceeded their banks, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. Overall, the system caused 94deaths and $25million in damage.|$|E

At the time of its dedication, the fort was roughly complete. Round in shape and surrounded by trenches and abati, the fort's guns faced north, overlooking River Road. A service road crossed the trenches in the southern half of the fort, connecting with River Road behind the fort. Rifle pits extended northeast to Fort Reno and southwest to Fort Simmons. A small battery of guns, named Battery Bayard, was an outwork of the fort and covered a blind spot in <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> to the northwest of the fort.|$|E
50|$|Flatruet is a fell {{in north}} western Härjedalen, Sweden, between Mittådalen in Härjedalens kommun and Ljungdalen.

Conoley—Hanneken's {{battalion}} executive officer—quickly gathered a counterattack unit of 17 men, including communications specialists, messmen, a cook, and a bandsman. Conoley's scratch force was joined by elements of Hanneken's Company G, Company C, and a few unwounded survivors from Company F and attacked the Japanese before they could consolidate their positions {{on top of the}} ridge. By 06:00, Conoley's force had pushed the Japanese back off the ridge, effectively ending Oka's attack.

5|$|The {{habitat of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis lies within <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> {{at the base}} of the 167-foot-tall {{waterfall}} formed by Chittenango Creek as it flows north from its origin toward Oneida Lake. This north-south oriented ravine forms a deep gorge that is shaded or partially shaded throughout most of the growing season, resulting in a microclimate that stays relatively cool during the summer, and because of the creek flow and ice formations, is relatively warm in the winter compared to the surrounding area. Spring thaws and periodic major rainfall events tend to remove vegetation from significant portions of the primary Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat.|$|E

5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their Mesoamerican allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E

The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale <b>the</b> <b>ravine,</b> they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E
