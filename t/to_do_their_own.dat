5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|Vlad Ţepeş's only ally, Mihály Szilágyi, was {{captured}} in 1460 by the Turks while traversing Bulgaria. Szilágyi's men were tortured to death, while Szilágyi was killed by being sawed in half. Later that year, Mehmed sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay the delayed Jizya (tax on non-Muslims). Vlad Ţepeş provoked Mehmed by having the envoys killed and in a letter dated September 10, 1460, addressed to the Transylvanian Saxons of Kronstadt (today: Braşov), he warned them of Mehmed's invasion plans and asked for their support. Vlad Ţepeş had not paid the annual Jizya (tax on non-Muslims) of 10,000 ducats since 1459. In addition to this, Mehmed asked him for 1000 boys that were to be trained as janissaries. Vlad Ţepeş refused the demand, and the Turks crossed the Danube and started <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> recruiting, to which Vlad reacted by capturing the Turks and impaling them. The conflict continued until 1461, when Mehmed asked the Prince to come to Constantinople and negotiate with him.|$|E

Internet-based ridesharing or hitchhiking reduces {{but does}} not eliminate use of cars and all the related resources needed to maintain and operate them. Community bicycle programs and collectives facilitate community sharing of bicycles, restore found and broken bikes, and teach people how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> bike repairs. In the process, they aim to build a culture of skill and resource sharing, reuse wasted bikes and bike parts, and create greater access to green transport.|$|E

25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E
25|$|The tenants of the Redstone started {{organizing}} and formed the Redstone Tenants Association (RTA) in 1999 to coordinate organizing around possibly buying {{the building and}} making general improvements to the large property {{as part of a}} general concern about gentrification of the neighborhood resulting in evictions and rising rents. San Francisco was experiencing a hot rental market with the dot-com boom that created high-paying technical jobs and, in the process, displaced both commercial and residential renters with evictions and skyrocketing rents. With the help of the Mission Economic Development Association (MEDA) the tenants obtained a grant <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> economic analysis of the building with the intent to make a formal bid for purchase. A variety of entities were approached with the hope of finding a non-profit owner.|$|E
25|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of insects}} {{that live in}} colonies, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, {{has always been a}} source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner. Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called swarm intelligence.|$|E

500|$|Liber AL vel Legis {{does make}} clear some {{standards}} of individual conduct. The most primary {{of these is}} [...] "Do what thou wilt" [...] which is presented as {{the whole of the}} law, and also as a right. [...] Some interpreters of Thelema believe that this right includes an obligation to allow others <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> wills without interference, but Liber AL makes no clear statement on the matter. [...] Crowley himself wrote that {{there was no need to}} detail the ethics of Thelema, for everything springs from [...] "Do what thou Wilt". Crowley wrote several additional documents presenting his personal beliefs regarding individual conduct in light of the Law of Thelema, some of which do address the topic interference with others: Liber OZ, Duty, and Liber II.|$|E

He conceded, [...] "that's their business. Everybody needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> thing." [...] Critics generally enjoyed the characters and voice acting. People liked the cast, particularly George Segal. Saturday Morning Fever praised Jessie Bannon for her resemblance to Dr. Quest. Allan Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now {{old enough to be}} part of the action. He considered Jessie [...] "cool... she gives Jonny grief just because she can, and she's not afraid of the action." [...] He did not enjoy the [...] "toned down" [...] portrayal of Race Bannon. Some fans objected to Race's Western accent in the first season. Peter Lawrence defended the portrayal of Race as a [...] "man of action, not thought—though perfectly capable of deep thought", noting that his accent and mannerisms encouraged variety, surprise, and originality.|$|E

The final single was a double A-side, coupling [...] "Love Ain't Gonna Wait for You", from their fourth album Seeing Double, with a new ballad, [...] "Say Goodbye". Returning to the style of their first single, [...] "Say Goodbye" [...] saw vocals shared around the group. The single reached number-two in the UK, beaten to the top spot by R.

500|$|At the Ipatiev House, Olga and {{her sisters}} were {{eventually}} required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> laundry and {{learned how to make}} bread. The girls took turns keeping Alexandra company and amusing Alexei, who was still confined to bed and suffering from pain after his latest injury. Olga was reportedly deeply depressed and lost a great deal of weight during her final months. [...] "She was thin, pale, and looked very sick", recalled one of the guards, Alexander Strekotin, in his memoirs. [...] "She took few walks in the garden, and spent most of her time with her brother." [...] Another guard recalled that the few times she did walk outside, she stood there [...] "gazing sadly into the distance, making it easy to read her emotions." [...] Later, Olga appeared angry with her younger sister Maria for being too friendly to the guards, reported Strekotin. After late June, when a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the conditions of their imprisonment became even more stringent.|$|E

Their labor as a team was divided in that Wohlwend always did the art and Boxleiter the programming, as reflective of their skills at the time. The pair agreed to an assessment of their partnership as [...] "left-brain right-brain", and agreed that [...] "editing"—the process of iterating through revisions—was central to their joint work.

500|$|At Yekaterinburg, Tatiana {{occasionally}} {{joined her}} younger sisters in chatting {{with some of}} the guards over tea, asking them questions about their families and talking about her hopes for a new life in England when they were released. On one occasion one of the guards forgot himself and told the grand duchesses an off-color joke. The shocked Tatiana ran from the room, [...] "pale as death," [...] and her younger sister Maria scolded the guards for their bad language. She [...] "would be pleasant to the guards if she thought they were behaving in an acceptable and decorous manner," [...] recalled another of the guards in his memoirs. Later, when a new commander was placed in charge of the Ipatiev House, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the rules of their confinement became more strict. Tatiana, still the family leader, was often sent by her parents to question the guards about rules or what would happen next to the family.
