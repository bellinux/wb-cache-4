If it takes too long to switch from one <b>trading</b> <b>strategy</b> to another, then a sub-optimal <b>trading</b> <b>strategy</b> may be adopted. This paper proposes the first FPGA-based framework which supports multiple trend-following <b>trading</b> <b>strategies</b> to obtain accurate market characterisation for various financial market regimes. The framework contains a <b>trading</b> <b>strategy</b> kernel library covering a number of well-known trend-following strategies, such as “triple moving average”. Three types of design are targeted: a static reconfiguration <b>trading</b> <b>strategy</b> (SRTS), a full reconfiguration <b>trading</b> <b>strategy</b> (FRTS), and a partial reconfiguration <b>trading</b> <b>strategy</b> (PRTS). Our approach is evaluated using both synthetic and historical market data. Compared to a fully optimised CPU implementation, the SRTS design achieves 11 times speedup, the FRTS design achieves 2 times speedup, while the PRTS design achieves 7 times speedup. The FRTS and PRTS designs also {{reduce the amount of}} resources used on chip by 29 % and 15 % respectively, when compared to the SRTS design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Actionable <b>trading</b> <b>strategies</b> for <b>trading</b> agents {{determine}} {{the potential of}} the simu-lated models in real-life markets. The development of actionable strategies is a non-trivial task, which needs to consider real-life constraints and organizational factors in the market. In this paper, we first analyze such constraints on developing actionable <b>trading</b> <b>strategies.</b> Further we propose an actionable <b>trading</b> <b>strategy</b> development framework. These points are deployed into developing a series of actionable <b>trading</b> <b>strategies</b> through optimizing, enhancing, discovering and integrating actionable <b>trading</b> <b>strategies.</b> We demonstrate working case studies in market data. These approaches and their performance are evaluated from both technical and business perspectives. Actionable <b>trading</b> <b>strategies</b> have potential to supporting smart trading decision for brokerage firms and financial companies. In financial markets, traders always pursue profitable <b>trading</b> <b>strategies</b> (also called <b>trading</b> rules) to make good return on investment.

50|$|Historically, StatArb evolved out of {{the simpler}} pairs <b>trade</b> <b>strategy,</b> in which stocks are put into pairs by {{fundamental}} or market-based similarities. When one stock in a pair outperforms the other, the poorer performing stock is bought long {{with the expectation that}} it will climb towards its outperforming partner, the other is sold short. Mathematically speaking, the strategy is to find a pair of stocks with high cointegration (only high correlation is not enough). The time series of the two stocks must be non-stationary (Kalman filter can be used as for the test). This hedges risk from whole-market movements. Various statistical tools have been used in the context of pairs trading ranging from simple distance-based approaches to more complex tools such as cointegration and copula concepts.|$|E

50|$|Besides North American integration, {{the three}} {{countries}} in question could pursue (and have pursued in the past) several other policies which could be complimentary to North American integration, or in direct opposition to it. On the one hand, the countries in question could pursue economic nationalism or protectionism by reestablishing trade barriers between themselves. This type of policy is embraced by economic nationalist {{groups such as the}} Council of Canadians. As well, {{the three countries}} could eliminate barriers with countries outside the North American continent either individually or in concert, thereby eliminating North America as a distinct trade bloc, this is potentially the outcome of any trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific free trade agreement, or global trade liberalization through the World Trade Organization. Or by doing both of the above, a country could withdraw from North American integration while pursuing integration with other partners. As an example, before the 1940s Canada's <b>trade</b> <b>strategy</b> was often to pursue free trade within the British Empire, rather than North America.
