Coir fibers of two different average lengths were used, and the longer coir fibers were also treated with a 1 % NaOH solution for comparison. The fibers were combined with cementitious materials and chemical agents (dispersant, defoamer or wetting agent) to form CFRCC. The flexural properties of the composites, including elastic stress, flexural strength, toughness and <b>toughness</b> <b>index,</b> were measured. The effects of fiber treatments, addition of chemical agents and accelerated ageing of composites on the composites&# 039; flexural properties were examined. The {{results showed that the}} CFRCC samples were 5 - 12 % lighter than the conventional mortar, and that the addition of coir fibers improved the flexural strength of the CFRCC materials. Toughness and <b>toughness</b> <b>index,</b> which were associated with the work of fracture, were increased more than ten times. For the alkalized long coir fiber composites, a higher immediate and long-term <b>toughness</b> <b>index</b> was achieved.

40|$|In construction, {{shotcrete}} {{is sometimes}} used {{in lieu of}} conventional concrete for reasons of cost or convenience. Shotcrete is advantageous in applications of repair, underground excavations, slope and surface protection. Unreinforced shotcrete, like unreinforced conventional concrete, is a brittle material that experiences cracking and displacement when subjected to tensile stresses or strains. The addition of fibers to the shotcrete mixture adds ductility to the material as well as energy absorption capacity and impact resistance. In this work, different kinds of fibers included steel, polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were compared. Large fiber-reinforced shotcrete panels were cast in construction site. Beams and cylinders of specific size were obtained from those panels for experimental purposes. With the same mix, concrete specimens were prepared at the same time. A series of laboratory tests such as notched flexural test, <b>toughness</b> <b>index,</b> permeability, and shrinkage were conducted. This seminar will discuss the difference in shrinkage between shotcrete and concrete specimens. It will also discuss the reduction in shrinkage of fiber-reinforced beam constrained by steel I-beam and associated cracking induced. The tension-softening diagram and <b>toughness</b> <b>index</b> of cementitious composites containing different fibers will also be mentioned. It was found that shrinkage was roughly the same between shotcrete and concrete specimens. However the peak load of tension-softening diagram and <b>toughness</b> <b>index</b> were larger in shotcrete members than those in concreting. It was because the mixture had a better compaction by the shotcreting process. Also, higher fiber volume will increase the residual load in tension-softening diagram and <b>toughness</b> <b>index...</b>|$|E

For varying fibre proportions, these indices are obtained on the basis of the material's response curves as recorded both from pull-out tests and, as in earlier investigations, from three-point bending tests: the good agreement in the results obtained from the two different types of test substantiates the possibility of using pull-out tests for the in situ determination of <b>toughness</b> parameters. <b>Toughness</b> <b>indices</b> are seen to increase with increasing fibre content, confirming the favourable effects of fibres on the ductility of the composite...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Toughness</b> <b>index</b> is an {{important}} parameter {{of the quality of}} super-abrasive grits. In order to improve the design of the <b>toughness</b> <b>index</b> tester more reasonably and efficiently, we calculated the velocity of a steel ball in the capsule and simulated the impact process between the steel ball and the different capsule end faces with the ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The main results are as follows: (I) the maximum velocity of the ball is approximately 2. 0106 m/s. (II) with the increase of the curvature, the maximum value of normal stress declines while the effective area rises. (III) the maximum shear stress cannot cause diamond grits to break directly, but it can make small cracks and defects of the impacted grits propagate.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, <b>toughness</b> <b>index</b> of diamond was {{measured}} by <b>Toughness</b> <b>Index</b> Measurement Apparatus. Forces on diamond grits at different impact condition were analyzed theoretically. Post-impact diamond grits were divided into three types by screening: un-broken, micro-fractured and completely fractured diamond, which correspond to failure modes: no significant wear, micro-fractured and macro-fractured in diamond tools. Thus {{the correlation between the}} fracture types of impacted diamond and its failure modes in diamond tool was established. The effects of impact parameters on the fracture types were also studied. The results show that fracture types of diamond grits are related to the steel balls mass and impact frequency.

The w/c ratio used for the normal strength steel fiber reinforced concrete mixes (NSSFRC) was 0. 55, and the water-cementitious ratio (w/c+s) for the high strength fiber reinforced concrete mixes (HSSFRC) was 0. 31.

Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the use of different percentages of steel fiber (0, 1. 0, 1. 25, 1. 5, 1. 75 & 2 %) as vol. %.

The hybrid fibers can be considered as a promising concept and the replacement of a portion of steel fiber with palm fiber can significantly reduce the density, enhance the flexural strength and toughness. The results also indicates that the use of hybrid fiber (1. 5 % steel fiber+ 0. 5 % palm fiber) in specimens increases significantly the <b>toughness</b> <b>indices</b> and thus the use of hybrid fiber combinations in reinforced concrete would enhance their flexural toughness & rigidity and enhance their overall performances...|$|R

The first stage of experimental programme involves studying the static behaviour of flexural member under two point static loading to obtain the load deflection behaviour having sectional dimensions 150 Ã 230 mm with an effective span of 2000 mm. Three test beam specimens were tested at 100, 70 and 40 of the ultimate loads respectively to create flexural and shear cracks.

The analysis included the determination of various parameters for different sets of fiber reinforced concrete specimens, such as fiber reinforced concrete, first crack deflection, first crack <b>toughness,</b> <b>toughness</b> <b>indices</b> and residual strength factors...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effects of polyethylene (PE) fibers on the toughness and compressive and flexural strengths of engineered cementitious composite (ECC) cubes and slabs. In particular, this study discussed the reinforcing index (R. I.) as the main parameter. Tests were conducted in direct tension to evaluate the strain-hardening behavior of ECC with different PE fiber contents. Flexural toughness was also assessed following the ASTM C 1018 procedure and post-cracking strength technique (PCSm). Results showed that the compressive strength linearly decreased {{with the increase of}} the reinforcing index, which in turn decreased the first crack load and significantly increased the ultimate load and failure deflections, and the ultimate strength of slabs. The <b>toughness</b> <b>indices</b> 120 to I- 100 significantly increased with the increase in reinforcing index and even exceeded the considered limitations. Based on the observed results, a new definition for the ECC PE was proposed as an extension to the definition given in ASTM C 1018. All the residual strength factors increased when the reinforcing index increased, indicating a higher amount of the retained strength. Similarly, the retained strength had a higher amount when the PCS 24 values increased with increase in the reinforcing indices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
