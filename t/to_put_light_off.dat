In order to rethink both scholar policy and psicopedagogical practices we will go deep on two phenomena by treating them as problematics.

Moreover, the essay <b>puts</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> some crucial questions that arise:Do social media in Greece, as news platforms, extend freedom of expression and how do they accomplish that? Does the fact that social media empower journalists to provide journalism {{in more ways than one}} through tweets, postings, and video and photo uploads, enhance journalists’ freedom of expression and, in a wider sense, the freedom of the press?
