5|$|Before the 2003 season, both Jason Whittle and Mike Rosenthal {{left the}} Giants via free agency, leaving two {{starting}} positions {{open on the}} offensive line. By {{the start of the}} Giants' pre-season minicamp, Allen was considered the favorite <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> right tackle, but he remained in competition with four other players for the two starting roles. The newly constructed right side of the offensive line played poorly in the first preseason game against the New England Patriots, but Allen showed enough improvement the following week against the Carolina Panthers to be named the starter going into the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Indiana quarterback John Paci was the {{cornerstone}} of Indiana's offense, and completed 133 of 258passes for 1,796yards and eighttouchdowns during the regular season. During the team's regular-season game against Penn State, Paci completed the longest passing play in Indiana history, completing a 99-yard pass to wide receiver Thomas Lewis for a touchdown. That play in part helped make Paci's performance against Penn State the fourth-highest single-game passing total for an Indiana quarterback in school history. Paci suffered a separated shoulder during the regular season, but despite the injury, he was predicted <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> quarterback against Virginia Tech and undergo surgery following the Independence Bowl.|$|E

However, both cars failed technical inspection, meaning they had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> {{the rear of the}} field.

DeShazo threw an incomplete pass, then completed one for a nine-yard gain. Needing one yard for a first down, Tech fullback Bryan Edwards was stopped for a loss and the Hokies were forced to punt. Tennessee fair caught the ball at their 20-yard line, where the Volunteers' offense again began to work. A five-yard penalty pushed the Volunteers backward, but running back Jay Graham regained the lost five yards with a run on the next play and the clock ran out in the quarter.

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-6 was a Soviet {{long-range}} bomber {{developed from}} the Ilyushin Il-4 during 1942. Originally intended as a high-speed replacement for the Il-4, it was recast as a very long-range bomber with fuel-conserving diesel engines before production of the single prototype began in December 1942. Flight testing showed controllability issues when landing at high weights and the engines proved to be hard <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> low temperatures and were slow to respond to throttle movements. Further development was canceled in 1944.|$|E

Häkkinen was the second-fastest driver; Barrichello was third and Coulthard rounded out the top four.

5|$|Before the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, {{the number}} one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was {{acquired}} via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower; however, as the season unfolded, neither plans materialized as hoped. Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for {{the second week of}} January. On January 31, 2008, he was selected to be on the Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. Bosh missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to conclude the regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA Playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 found them guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later explained that he was giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E
5|$|Further west, {{supporting}} {{attacks were}} to be launched by the 13th Division, with the 15th Infantry Regiment (IR) assaulting across the Ancre towards the front line held by the 106th Brigade between Dernancourt and Buire-sur-l'Ancre and then exploiting success by driving west towards the village of Ribemont-sur-Ancre, and the 13th IR attacking the 104th Brigade at Marrett Wood. The German artillery preparation was <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> 05:15 on 28 March, with the assault to begin at 06:00. During the night of 27/28 March, {{the commander of the}} German 2nd Army apparently came to the same conclusion as the regimental commanders of the 50th Reserve Division, as at 03:00 he ordered the attack to be delayed until noon, and later further postponed it, but the orders did not reach the divisions in time.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{technical}} developments, Ferrari upgraded their engine for their home race by using {{three of their}} development tokens while Mercedes spent all seven of their remaining engine tokens. As a result of this, Mercedes became the first team in 2015 to use all their tokens, with both Honda and Ferrari having four tokens remaining and Renault having twelve tokens left for later in the season. Because of these changes both Mercedes cars were on their third powerplants, whilst both Ferrari cars were on their fourth power units. Additionally, Toro Rosso, Red Bull and McLaren received grid penalties for exceeding their parts usage, forcing them <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> {{the back of the}} grid. McLaren went back to using their snub nose design, which they had replaced earlier in the season ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, in order to achieve better aerodynamics and lower drag for the high-speed Monza circuit.|$|E
5|$|Some of Mighty Jill Offs {{gameplay}} is {{borrowed from}} the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while pointing in the direction that they want her to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> the most recent checkpoint—typically located at a change in room. There is only one level in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition is demonstrated by {{a change in the}} room's background colour. Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State touchback allowed Vick <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> his 20-yard {{line for}} Virginia Tech's second {{possession}} of the game. The possession began {{no better than the}} first one, as Virginia Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty on the first play. On subsequent plays, however, the Hokie offense began to move the ball with success. Vick completed a 12-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal, and the offense was aided by a 15-yard Florida State penalty, which gave the Hokies an automatic first down. Following the first down, Vick completed the first big Virginia Tech play of the game, throwing the ball 35yards downfield to Justin Harper, who caught it in Florida State territory. Two more plays pushed Virginia Tech {{to the edge of the}} Florida State red zone, but a penalty and another sack prevented the Hokies from advancing the ball further. Virginia Tech was forced to send in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 45-yard field goal. The kick was good, and Virginia Tech had tied the game 33 with 1:00 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
