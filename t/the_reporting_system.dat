Prior to evaluating the effectiveness of <b>the</b> Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> Hi-Rez Studios’ Player Behavior policy was examined to determine what mechanisms that underlie <b>the</b> Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> could determine <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>the</b> Player <b>Report</b> <b>System.</b> To determine how well developed Hi-Rez Studios’ Player Behavior policy is the Player Behavior policy of two other games got examined. Further, the Player Behavior policy of these other games was used to provide Hi-Rez Studios with recommendations on how to increase the effectiveness of <b>the</b> Player <b>Report</b> <b>System.</b> <b>The</b> effectiveness of Smite’s Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> has been analyzed by comparing the current effectiveness of <b>the</b> Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> with <b>the</b> desired effectiveness of <b>the</b> Player <b>Report</b> <b>System.</b> This research showed that <b>the</b> current Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> is ineffective in suspending the desired percentage of players that had exhibited suspension worthy toxic player behavior. Furthermore, {{this research}} showed that number of reports can be used as an indicator of whether a player has exhibited toxic player behavior, that it is inconclusive whether <b>the</b> Player <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> is effective in altering the behavior of those players who have been suspended, and that the more competitive/serious players are more likely to exhibit toxic player behavior than the more casual players. The factors, which can be influenced by policy, that determine the effectiveness of Hi-Rez Studios Player Behavior policy regarding the reduction of toxic player behavior are the number of cases that are reviewed, the amount of toxic player behavior that is exhibited and reported, whether reports are filed against players who exhibit toxic player behavior, the number of games of Smite a player has played, and the number of hours per game a player has played Smite. The recommendations provided can be sorted into two categories: proactive policy options, and retroactive policy options. The proactive policy options focus on preventing suspension worthy toxic player behavior to be exhibited, and the retroactive policy options focus on punishing those players who have exhibited suspension worthy toxic player behavior. The policy options that were recommended are: a player behavior alert system, communication restrictions, behavioral guidelines, an automated suspension/ban system for second- and third degree offenses, implementing a suspension notification, simplifying the Customer Support team case review tool, and possibly expanding the Customer Support team as well as increasing the amount of time they can spend on reviewing cases on a daily basis...|$|R

The Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative (PRHI), a regional coalition for healthcare quality improvement, has identified the elimination of medication errors and nosocomial infections as a primary goal. PRHI has facilitated the implementation and use of two different <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> in all 30 of its member hospitals designed to facilitate work toward this goal: 1) the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (NNIS); and 2) the US Pharmacopeia (USP) MedMARxB, a medication error <b>reporting</b> <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> aims {{of this study are}} to understand 1) how well <b>the</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> and their standards of use succeed in generating usable information; 2) how well feedback review <b>systems,</b> related to <b>the</b> <b>reporting,</b> function; and 3) the problem-solving systems through which knowledge is translated into organizational and inter-organizational learning. The methodological approach reflects a systems view, includes several levels of analysis, and utilizes triangulation of both qualitative and quantitative data.

50|$|The National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System was {{launched}} on August 12, 2005 by the International Association of Fire Chiefs. It was announced {{at a press}} conference in Denver, Colorado, after having completed a pilot program involving 38 fire departments across the country. The Near-Miss Reporting System aims to prevent injuries and save lives of other fire fighters by collecting, sharing and analyzing near-miss experiences. The near-miss experiences are collected by fire fighters who voluntarily submit them; the reports are confidential, non-punitive, and secure. After the reports are compiled, they are posted to the website where firefighters can access them and learn from each other's real life experiences. Overall these reports help to formulate strategies, reduce firefighter injuries and fatalities, and enhance the safety culture of the fire service. The program is based on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), which has been gathering reports of close calls from pilots, flight attendants, air traffic controllers since 1976. <b>The</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> is funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.
