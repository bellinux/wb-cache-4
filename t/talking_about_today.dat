5000|$|Later, NASCAR President Mike Helton {{spoke about}} Stewart and a waiver {{that he would}} receive, if he won at Atlanta or the {{following}} weekend at Richmond. With the waiver, Stewart would be eligible to make the Chase for the Sprint Cup. While Stewart had not attempted to qualify the last two races and, therefore, would have been ineligible, NASCAR {{had the ability to}} grant an exemption to a driver for [...] "unique circumstances". [...] "We made our decisions based on the circumstances we've got currently," [...] Helton said. [...] "And I think most everyone in this room understands at NASCAR, our effort, our scope of responsibility and authority is limited to the NASCAR community. We take the current circumstances that we are dealt with and make what we hope to be the best absolute conclusion.

5000|$|Cochran ran for Mayor of Austin three times, most {{recently}} in 2003. He earned a second-place finish in 2000, garnering 7.75% of the vote. He said {{his life on the}} streets advocating for police accountability was a good background for the job. He appeared with his boa and tiara at mayoral debates, but spoke about real issues. Cochran showed up for a mayoral campaign interview in 2003 wearing a women’s business suit. [...] "He looked like a stewardess from the golden age of air travel," [...] said the Austin Chronicle editor. Cochran talked about problems ahead for a city that was creative and fun, but growing so fast that it could become big and bland. [...] "He was talking about issues we are still <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>today,</b> nearly a decade later, as Austin has grappled with change. He had actually thought about real issues that were facing the city, and not all of his ideas were particularly out there. He certainly wasn't the craziest person I ever dealt with running for office, by a long shot." [...] If elected, Cochran promised to plant more trees and wear more conservative dresses to [...] "respect the office." ...|$|E
40|$|Since I started {{teaching}} drafting, I {{would like to}} think that I have continued to learn some lessons about teaching both the substance and the skills of transactional drafting. One of those lessons that I am going to be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>today</b> is one that I stumbled across by happy accident rather than one that I consciously sought. Specifically, I want to talk about and highlight the ways that law students can use law firm marketing materials to increase their understanding of both drafting and lawyering skills in law school and, hopefully, in practice...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{title of}} this talk is rather broad. Specically what I will be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>today</b> is relic density {{constraints}} on supersymmetric models, and I will focus in particular on bounds on minimal Supergravity (mSUGRA). I'll begin with a brief reminder of the notation of supersymmetry, then give an introduction to relic densities, how they are computed, {{and how we can}} use them to constrain models of low-energy supersymmetry. I'll then discuss coannihilation in general and show how it dramatically relaxes the cosmological upper bound on the mSUGRA masses. Finally, I'll give an example of constraints (on CP violating phases in mSUGRA) which are not relaxed by the weakened mass limits. 2. SUSY Since previous speakers have introduced the Supersymmetric Standard Model, I will give only a brief reminder, in order to present the particle content and parameters and to set the notation. Recall that SUSY essentially doubles the particle conte...|$|E

40|$|First off, {{like many}} you, we’re a bit {{skeptical of the}} {{emerging}} market of online reputation management and the path it is taking {{to deal with the}} challenges. Even the phrase “reputation management” implies that we have more control over our reputation than we may. Don’t get us wrong, we do believe we all should and are able to take {{a more active role in}} our online reputations, and that’s what we’re <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>today.</b> But we think it’s important to keep in mind, just as in the real world, and perhaps even more so online, we really only ever have influence over our reputations – rarely outright control. And that is where our competition is getting it wrong and where we think get it right. And if you remember anything today, we hope it’s that we are the company who is creating the software, which helps large numbers of people to become aware of and “see” their reputation - “see” the most important contributing factors to their reputation - in real time - so they can decide how to capitalize, or how to mitigate it, at the right time...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} our {{research}} is on how current and lifetime episodes of psychopathology influence adaptive functioning in early adulthood. Today, I {{would like to give}} you an overview of some of our recent efforts to incorporate a more dynamic and individual – centered approach to this task. Our approach emphasizes pathways or trajectories of psychopathology over time rather than static, one-point-in-time snapshots of disorder. Let me illustrate this emphasis concretely with examples drawn from two {{of the participants in the}} research I will be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>today.</b> [Figure 1 about here]. This is a timeline for one participant in our study. On the x axis time in years is displayed, and on the y axis are types of disorders. The visible window or "SNAPSHOT " displays disorders that are present around age 32, which is the time of the early adult assessments in the study I will be presenting. As you can see from the figure, this person was found to have Antisocial Personality Disorder and Substance Use Dependence at age 32. Let's take a quick look at another individual from the study. [Figure 2 about here]. This person is also experiencing current psychopathology, although of a different sort. This person has Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression.

40|$|It {{may come}} as a {{surprise}} to some that there are still villages of people throughout the world that have been unaffected by modern society. They live without running water, electricity, sometimes even schools. Their heat their homes, cook their food, do everything needed with burning wood. They have no idea of how harmful the carbon smoke is. Each family lives in a beautiful, hand-chiseled stone houses with flower gardens. There is no healthcare. The specific place we will be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>today</b> is exactly as I have described to you. It is a village in a remote valley in the Solu region of Nepal named Basa. Our guest today, with 2 other adventurers were only the third group of white people ever seen in this village of farmers. First they asked for education for their children, then electricity for their village. It is an amazing story and an ever more remarkable journey for our guest today.

40|$|In {{the spirit}} of the {{symposium}} generally, I want to step back a bit and not limit myself to Plessy v. Ferguson, which, frankly, is a turkey shoot. It 2 ̆ 7 s easy. Barry McDonald 2 ̆ 7 s got a very difficult job to defend it. Let me try to pull the camera back and talk more generally about what these cases that we 2 ̆ 7 re <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>today</b> have in common. To do that, I want to comment on what we might think of as the canon and the anti-canon of Supreme Court cases. Here I build upon thoughtful work by, among others, Professor Richard Primus. In so doing, in talking about canon and anticanon, I would like to preview my new book that 2 ̆ 7 s coming out, America 2 ̆ 7 s Unwritten Constitution, because I 2 ̆ 7 m going to be building on some of these ideas. It is a complement to the last thing that I did, America 2 ̆ 7 s Constitution: A Biography, that tries to take the reader through the written document, the canonical text. The Constitution is very compact. I try to take the reader really from start to finish: from the Preamble through every article, and then through every amendment. The thought of the new book is that the Constitution is not all that we believe it to be. It proclaims itself the supreme law of the land, and yet all of us understand that there is more to it than that. There is also a canon and an anti-canon of decisions...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} influx of {{insightful}} theoretical work on polar answers, {{we are still}} very much {{in the early stages of}} their description. • We’re at a point where we can use some of the most common components of their analysis to guide ongoing empirical investigation. • The project I am <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>today,</b> also in its earliest stages, takes this approach to the description of polar replies in embedded contexts. The common analytical component guiding this (mostly) descriptive study is the intuition that polar answers lead double lives: they are small utterances that evoke big structures. (A polar iceberg effect?) Specifically, minimal polar answers are now generally thought of as clausal, just as other fragment answers are. 1 Under such accounts: • Polar Response Particles (PRPs; e. g. yes/no) either move out of a TP that undergoes ellipsis (Postma and van der Wurff 2007, Sailor 2012) or are generated just above an elided TP (Laka 1990, Kramer and Rawlins 2009, Holmberg 2011) – Andprior to such ellipsis accounts, PRPswere often taken to be clausal anaphors. • Verbal answers have received similar treatment (Santos 2009, McCloskey 2011, a. o.) If such analyses are correct, we expect polar answers to distribute more or less like clauses. • This is trivially attested in bare answers: assumed to be root/matrix clauses. • But what about answers in embedded contexts? By and large, this empirical domain has not been looked at in detail. ∗Thanks toDaniel Büring, PeetKlecha,HildaKoopman,KeirMoulton, JessicaRett, Yael Sharvit, Tim Stowell, and the audience of ILLS 4 for helpful comments, and to the workshop organizers and reviewers. 1 There are of course alternatives – e. g. the “sub-sentential ” approach – but I leave these aside to pursue predictions made by clausal analyses. ...|$|E
40|$|Dave Serfling and {{his family}} live in Preston, Minnesota, which is just north {{across the border from}} Decorah. Dave {{graduated}} from ISU in 1981 in farm operations. Serflings have a 50 sow farrow-to-finish operation and 80 cows they feed out. They also have sheep, and they own about 350 acres. They love Iowa so much, Dave 2 ̆ 7 s wife even works in Iowa, so thanks for helping the economy. (laughter) Steve Williams and his wife live in Villisca, in Page County. Steve is a 1988 ISU business graduate. He has a total livestock operation with beef and a farrow-tofeeder pig operation. He feeds out a few. There are some interesting family ties and partnerships in Page County, and now his operation 2 ̆ 7 s up to about 300 sows in a very productive and unique arrangement, which we 2 ̆ 7 ll hear more about. Greg Vogel represents the ISU AG 450 Farm, which is located southwest of Ames, about a mile. This is actually a student-managed farm, and many of you are familiar with that concept that the students really manage it, for better or for worse. And they suffer all the advantages and perils of pure agriculture. Greg is the farm operator. He 2 ̆ 7 s also an ISU grad (ag business, 1978) and finished a master 2 ̆ 7 s in ag business in 1994. The farm is about 950 acres, and they have 200 sows out there. They run both outdoor and confmement operations. Last we 2 ̆ 7 ll hear from my good friend, Dick Thompson. Dick and Sharon, of course, farm in Boone County. Dick and Sharon recently were recognized as the 1996 Farm Agricultural Leaders of The Year by the Des Moines Register, which was a tremendous honor for them. There farm is a little under 400 acres, they have been the driving force behind and the inspiration behind Practical Farmers of Iowa. Dick and Sharon have served as mentors for many, many farm families, not only in Iowa but nationwide.
