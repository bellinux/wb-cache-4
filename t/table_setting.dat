The second chopstick is held like a pencil, using the tips of the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, and it is moved while eating, to pull food into the grasp of the chopsticks.

25|$|The {{traditional}} Japanese <b>table</b> <b>setting</b> has varied considerably {{over the}} centuries, depending {{primarily on the}} type of table common during a given era. Before the 19th century, small individual box tables (hakozen, 箱膳) or flat floor trays were set before each diner. Larger low tables (chabudai, ちゃぶ台) that accommodated entire families were gaining popularity {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century, but these gave way to Western-style dining tables and chairs by the end of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Japanese <b>table</b> <b>setting</b> is {{to place}} a bowl of rice on your left and to place a bowl of miso soup on your right side at the table. Behind these, each okazu is served on its own {{individual}} plate. Based on the standard three okazu formula, behind the rice and soup are three flat plates to hold the three okazu; one to far back left, one at far back right, {{and one in the}} center. Pickled vegetables are often served on the side but are not counted as part of the three okazu. Chopsticks are generally placed at the very front of the tray near the diner with pointed ends facing left and supported by a chopstick rest, or hashioki.|$|E
25|$|Sheila's baby died, {{unbeknownst to}} Scott, and she {{secretly}} switches Lauren's newborn {{with a black}} market baby, which Lauren named Dylan. Sheila began passing Lauren's baby off as her own, and Dylan eventually dies from meningitis. Sheila's mother, Molly Carter, found out about her daughter's crime and intended to tell Lauren the truth, but suffers a stroke that rendered her speechless. Sheila sent her mother to her farmhouse in Michigan before Molly could expose her. Lauren eventually {{found out about the}} baby switch, but not before Sheila kidnapped both Lauren and Molly, and almost succeeded in killing both women, when during a brief struggle Lauren accidentally kicked over a lantern on a coffee <b>table,</b> <b>setting</b> the farmhouse they were imprisoned in on fire. Lauren and Molly are rescued by Lauren's ex-husband, private investigator Paul Williams, and his secretary, Lynne Bassett. Sheila was never found, and authorities presumed that she perished in the fire when a body burned beyond recognition turned up in the ashes. The corpse {{turned out to be a}} meter man that had visited the house just before the fire started; Sheila had escaped from the burning building. Picking up a discarded newspaper in an area diner, she read about an opening working as a company nurse for the Forresters in Los Angeles. She left Wisconsin to travel to California. Meanwhile, Lauren is reunited with Scott and her real son, Scott Jr.|$|E

It didn't quite {{reach the}} high watermark of last week's instalment, {{but there was still}} a lot of great stuff here." [...] Steve Johnson of The Baltimore Sun noted, [...] "Instead of the heavy action of the season's first two hours, Sunday's Game of Thrones, called [...] "Oathbreaker," [...] was more about putting pieces on the chess board into place." [...] Sarah Larson of The New Yorker wrote in her review, [...] "Last week, we saw Jon Snow reënter life; this week, we may have been in proximity to him entering it, the first time, in the usual way." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com called the episode, [...] "Exhilarating".|$|E
500|$|On the December 30 {{episode of}} Raw, Lesnar {{returned}} with Heyman {{to announce his}} intentions to challenge {{the winner of the}} upcoming WWE World Heavyweight Championship match between Randy Orton and John Cena at the Royal Rumble. Lesnar then dared any wrestler who disapproved of that notion to challenge him, which was answered by Mark Henry, and a brawl would ensue, ending with Lesnar delivering an F-5 to Henry. The following week on Raw, Henry challenged Lesnar again, only to have Lesnar dislocate his elbow with the Kimura lock in storyline, which led Big Show to come out afterwards to confront Lesnar, thus starting a feud which was settled at the Royal Rumble on January 26, 2014, where Lesnar defeated Show after attacking him with a steel chair before the match began. On the February 24 episode of Raw, after Heyman stated that Lesnar had requested a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXX, instead receiving an open contract to face anyone else of his choosing, The Undertaker then returned and attacked Lesnar with a chokeslam through a <b>table,</b> <b>setting</b> up their match at WrestleMania XXX. On April 6, Lesnar defeated Undertaker after executing three F-5s, ending his undefeated WrestleMania streak at 21, a feat that was described by Sports Illustrated as being [...] "the most shocking result since the Montreal Screwjob".|$|E
