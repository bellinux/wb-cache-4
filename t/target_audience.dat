5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to its <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> in 1915. At that time, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to screen stag films in public theaters due to the Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E

5|$|The show's {{goals for}} {{outreach}} were addressed {{through a series}} of programs that first focused on promotion and then, after the first season, on the development of educational materials used in preschool settings. Innovative programs were developed because their <b>target</b> <b>audience,</b> children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.|$|E

5|$|After Si Ronda, Lie and Tan {{collaborated on}} three further films. Lie left Tan's in 1932, {{reportedly}} as his approach no longer matched Tan's low-class <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> and caused the works {{to go over}} budget. Effendi continued to work with Tan's until 1932, when he left to head the cinema magazine Doenia Film. Momo continued acting until 1941, first with Tan's and later with Standard Film. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> of young boys {{might not want}} to read a book written by a woman, her {{publishers}} asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool. The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz. Executives at Virgin Records {{thought that this was}} important to attract the <b>target</b> <b>audience,</b> who they believed no longer spent much time in record shops. They felt that similarities to the design of the first album, including Meat Loaf's name in Gothic typography, would entice consumers of the 1977 album to purchase this.The section from this episode about the marketing of Bat Out of Hell II, and the filming of this music video, has been reshown as part of BBC Learning Zone's media studies strand.|$|E

Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that the <b>target</b> <b>audience,</b> those easily able to move, would consult the book for advice on moving, but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational choices on the urbanized world.|$|E
5|$|The public's {{thirst for}} news and {{information}} was in part satisfied by news magazines, which were dedicated to reporting the war. They included amongst others The War Illustrated, The Illustrated War News, and The War Pictorial, and were lavishly filled with photographs and illustrations, regardless of their <b>target</b> <b>audience.</b> Magazines were produced for all classes, and ranged both in price and tone. Many otherwise famous writers contributed towards these publications, of which H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling were three examples. Editorial guidelines varied; in cheaper publications especially it was considered more important {{to create a sense}} of patriotism than to relay up-to-the-minutes news of developments of the front. Stories of German atrocities were commonplace.|$|E

After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its <b>target</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|Callaway {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by UPN's cancellation of Mercy Point because of their strong support of the show. He felt {{the decision was made}} {{in part because of the}} show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot at the same time as the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points <b>target</b> <b>audience.</b> To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{praised the}} manga for its {{creativity}} and {{described it as}} a quintessential shōjo manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the Seiun Award for Best Manga in 2001. The anime television series was praised for transcending its <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers. The artwork in the anime was also a focus of attention, described as above average for a late-1990s TV series, and Sakura's magic-casting scenes were complimented for being nearly unique because of the regular costume changes. The anime television series won the Animage Grand Prix award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of Cardcaptors, however, was heavily panned by critics for cutting out character backgrounds essential to understanding the plot.|$|E

5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the <b>target</b> <b>audience.</b> One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{leading up}} to the release of Tales of Symphonia Chronicles, Baba called Symphonia the most {{successful}} title in the series in the west thus far, although the series' main <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> was still in Japan. In an earlier interview, Baba commented that the team behind the series put a large amount of effort and development in keeping the series fresh while retaining the base elements across each installment. The positive reaction of gamers in the US to Symphonia influenced the way the various teams developed titles after that point. Speaking in 2014, production manager Denis Lee said that, since Symphonias release, the popularity of the series has grown. In response, Bandai Namco have focused on getting more entries out in western territories. Much of their research about what titles to release or develop in the future revolves around direct conversation with Tales series fans at gaming conventions and special events.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was {{not familiar with the}} Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of {{experience}} levels on consumers 2 ̆ 7 value perceptions in their use of a social marketing preventative health service. The study uses services thinking to investigate customer value in a social marketing consumption situation. Design/methodology/approach: An online, self-completion survey was conducted on n= 853 Australian women who were users of breastscreening services. Findings: Experienced users derived higher levels of functional and emotional value than novice users and reported higher levels of satisfaction and behavioural intentions to use the service again. However, path analysis indicated that satisfaction was a stronger driver of behavioural intentions for novice users. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need to understand and segment <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> in more meaningful ways beyond traditional demographic segmentation. There is a need to understand the value benefits that <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> seek and acknowledge that these value and service experience perceptions are likely to change over time as <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> transition from novice to experienced users. This is useful in allowing health services to consider ways of providing a degree of customisation to <b>target</b> <b>audiences,</b> resulting in higher levels of satisfaction, particularly amongst novice users, leading to behavioural intentions to return. Originality/value: Two novel approaches are used to understand social marketing behaviour: value theory and a services perspective. Through the examination of experience levels, this study acknowledges the enduring nature of many social marketing behaviours, allowing social marketers to examine differences in <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> 2 ̆ 7 experiences based on whether they are new to or familiar with a behaviour. This provides a fresh perspective in understanding <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> in social marketing through an understanding of their value perceptions which influence their behaviour, and how these value perceptions are likely to change over time...|$|R
