5|$|Development of an Ant-Man film {{began as}} early as the late 1980s, when Ant-Man co-creator Stan Lee pitched <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> New World Pictures, Marvel Comics' parent company at the time. However, Walt Disney Pictures was {{developing}} a film based on a similar concept, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and although Ant-Man went into development, nothing came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Kauffman and Crane began {{developing}} Friends {{under the}} title Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993. They presented <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including a title change to Six of One and Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends.|$|E
5|$|Production for Family Trade {{began with}} Lionsgate {{approaching}} the dealership proposing {{the idea of}} filming a reality show. The Stones eventually agreed to have Lionsgate film a fifteen-minute clip of various trades performed at the dealership. Lionsgate pitched <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> a few networks, such as History, but GSN eventually picked the series up after ordering a pilot show.|$|E

5|$|Show runner Mike Scully had pitched {{an idea to}} Dan Greaney on Marge forcing Bart {{to become}} Ralph Wiggum's friend. Scully gave <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> Greaney due to his ability to write Ralph's lines and actions well, and his overall liking of the character.|$|E
5|$|According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he {{intended}} to have him marry a second time, to Anna Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a monastery. However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov came up with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{advice from}} Bamford, Turpin visits Todd for grooming, intent on marrying Johanna. Todd shaves Turpin, preparing to slit his throat; they are interrupted by Anthony, who reveals {{his plan to}} elope with Johanna before noticing Turpin.

Mrs. Lovett gets <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> bake Todd's victims into pies. Anthony searches for Johanna, whom Turpin has sent to an insane asylum upon discovering her plans to elope with Anthony.|$|E

5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given {{more than a thousand}} times. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global warming, which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{was shown}} footage of James Cameron's Avatar which sold him on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> shoot Resident Evil: Afterlife in digital 3D. He shot in high-definition with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using Cameron's Fusion Camera System, or more {{specifically}} a Sony F35 camera. The crew {{spent two weeks}} in pre-production learning the 3D camera system. With a budget of about $60 million, principal photography took place for 55 days from September 29, 2009 to December. Filming in 3D added 20% to the budget. Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10, 2009. The final showdown scene was filmed for about six days. During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $100,000 camera.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attraction}} of the Andriyivskyy Descent is the baroque Saint Andrew's Church. It is located atop a hill overlooking the Podil neighborhood from the Andriyivskyy Descent. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> construct the Saint Andrew's Church came from the Russian Tsaress Elizabeth Petrovna. When she visited Kiev in 1747–1754, she laid the foundation brick of the church with her own hand, after which the church was constructed, to a design by the imperial architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli.|$|E

5|$|As well as Thunderhawks, Anderson {{developed}} {{other ideas}} for a remake. A 1976 concept, Inter-Galactic Rescue 4, {{was to have}} featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues on land and sea, in air and in space; Anderson pitched <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> NBC, who rejected it. This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, T-Force, which at first could not be pursued owing {{to a lack of}} funding. Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled GFI, using cel animation. But Anderson was disappointed with the results and the production was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Brenton {{came up with}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> show {{an episode}} dealing with a Muslim hero set out to stop a group of Islamic terrorists. Brenton and the {{producers}} researched elements of Islam {{in order to provide}} a balanced view towards the religion, as well as the nature of the plot and to show Muslims in the episode who oppose the extremists among their religion. Although much of the episode was set in Birmingham, it was filmed entirely in London. The episode sees the introduction of regular character Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker), and the return of Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who first appeared in the first episode and returned so that the character's role can be expanded.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> Vertigo Films, who suggested he watch In Search of a Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E

5|$|Farhan Akhtar {{conceived}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> {{remake the}} iconic 1978 {{film of the}} same name after listening to a remixed version of a song from the original film. In early 2005, media started reporting that Akhtar was planning to remake the film, but rather than confirming the news, he revealed that though he was writing the screenplay based on the film, he would take the final decision after completing the script. The director co-wrote the film with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original film with Salim Khan.|$|E
5|$|Herschel's {{proposed}} {{name was}} not popular outside Britain, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jérôme Lalande proposed {{that it be}} named Herschel in honour of its discoverer. Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the name Neptune, which was supported by other astronomers who liked <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet {{in the course of}} the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even Neptune George III or Neptune Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{announced plans}} to revisit <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> expand the playoffs to 14 teams, with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason. The two extra Wild Card games could also be scheduled on the weekend, creating triple-headers on both Saturday and Sunday. Goodell then suggested that they might instead be played on Friday and/or Monday, which may eventually cause scheduling conflicts with games of the new College Football Playoff.|$|E

The money for their startup came from the $5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America's Funniest Home Videos. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> make bacon spreadable came from a customer's request. Together, they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites to raise awareness of their company.|$|E

Stoppelman and Simmons pitched <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> Levchin who provided $1 million in initial funding.
