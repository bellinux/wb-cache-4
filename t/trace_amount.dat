5|$|Although {{thallium}} is a modestly abundant {{element in}} the Earth's crust, with a concentration estimated to be about 0.7mg/kg, mostly in association with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granites, thallium is not generally economically recoverable from these sources. The major source of thallium for practical purposes is the <b>trace</b> <b>amount</b> that is found in copper, lead, zinc, and other heavy-metal-sulfide ores.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is found}} in <b>trace</b> <b>amount</b> in {{numerous}} plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb. Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial organisms. Whether lithium has a physiological role {{in any of these}} organisms is unknown.|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the <b>trace</b> <b>amount</b> of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E

25|$|Slow {{reaction}} {{rates are}} common with chromium(III) complexes. The low reactivity of the d3 Cr3+ ion {{can be explained}} using crystal field theory. One way of opening CrCl3 up to substitution in solution is to reduce even a <b>trace</b> <b>amount</b> to CrCl2, for example using zinc in hydrochloric acid. This chromium(II) compound undergoes substitution easily, and it can exchange electrons with CrCl3 via a chloride bridge, allowing all of the CrCl3 to react quickly.|$|E

The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced that radioactivity levels exceeding legal limits had been detected in milk produced in the Fukushima area and in certain vegetables in Ibaraki. Measurements made by Japan {{in a number of}} locations have shown the presence of radionuclides such as iodine-131 (I-131) and caesium-137 (Cs-137) on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Because PCR amplifies {{the regions}} of DNA that it targets, PCR {{can be used to}} analyze {{extremely}} small amounts of sample. This is often critical for forensic analysis, when only a <b>trace</b> <b>amount</b> of DNA is available as evidence. PCR may also be used in the analysis of ancient DNA that is {{tens of thousands of years}} old. These PCR-based techniques have been successfully used on animals, such as a forty-thousand-year-old mammoth, and also on human DNA, in applications ranging from the analysis of Egyptian mummies to the identification of a Russian tsar and the body of English king Richard III.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{receiving}} a red {{card in the}} previous game, Ljungberg was ineligible to play the next Seattle Sounders game. As a result, All-Star coach Dominic Kinnear played Ljungberg for a full 90 minutes. At {{the end of the}} game, Ljungberg started to have impaired vision. When the game went to penalty kicks, he chose to sit it out due to his loss of vision after an on-set migraine. Unfortunately for Ljungberg, the initial five kicks ended in a draw. Kinnear, not fully understanding Ljungberg's condition, sent him out as the sixth kicker. Ljungberg, unable to see, took a chance and just tapped the ball in the center of net. However, Tim Howard caught it, resulting in Everton's win. Immediately following the game, Ljungberg was removed from the field on a stretcher. Later, Ljungberg told reporters that he ingested <b>trace</b> <b>amount</b> of red wine while in Utah, resulting in his second migraine within months.|$|E

2500|$|Carbon {{has three}} {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. About 99% of carbon on Earth is carbon-12 (12C), about 1% is carbon-13 (13C), and a <b>trace</b> <b>amount</b> is carbon-14 (14C). The [...] 12C and [...] 13C isotopes are stable, while 14C decays radioactively to nitrogen-14 (14N) {{with a half}} life of 5730 years. 14C on Earth is produced nearly exclusively by the interaction of cosmic radiation with the upper atmosphere. A 14C atom is created when a thermal neutron displaces a proton in 14N. Minuscule amounts of 14C are produced by other radioactive processes, and a significant amount was released into the atmosphere during nuclear testing before the Limited Test Ban Treaty.|$|E

2500|$|Legislation {{similar to}} the FQPA was drafted and {{presented}} to Congress in 1995 but was never acted on. In 1996, the political landscape had changed and new pressures to act on pesticide control reform surfaced. In 1991, a coalition of environmental groups sued the EPA for failing to enforce the Delaney clause. The Delaney clause, an amendment of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, banned all food that contained any <b>trace</b> <b>amount</b> of any pesticide that may cause cancer. Although the EPA argued that the legislation was outdated and should {{not apply to the}} current situation, the coalition won in 1995 and the EPA was slated to ban 80 pesticides in late 1996. Under these new, more urgent circumstances, Congress was able to pass a bill that was celebrated by both sides of the debate; farmers, food processors and pesticide manufactures were glad to see the Delaney Clause go, while environmental groups and consumer advocates were pleased to have a formalized safety standard with an added emphasis on children. John Cady, president of the National Food Processors Association, praised the legislation for being [...] "...based on modern, real-world science".|$|E
