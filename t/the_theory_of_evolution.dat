5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes described by <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> when considering macroevolution and microevolution {{as the former}} is simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An {{example of this is}} ring species.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> was formulated.|$|E
5|$|The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is {{well known}} as one of the first {{transitional}} fossils to be found, and it provided support for <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> in the late 19th century. Archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail, as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor.|$|E

5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought of <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> {{around the same time}} as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
5|$|When Darwin {{received}} Alfred Russel Wallace's {{paper that}} described natural selection, Hooker and Charles Lyell {{arranged for a}} joint reading of papers by Darwin and Wallace to the Linnean Society on July1, 1858. Since Darwin had nothing prepared, the reading included excerpts from his 1844 Essay and from a letter he had sent to Asa Gray in July 1857 outlining his theory {{on the origin of}} species. By that time, Darwin had begun writing his book On the Origin of Species. The correspondence with Gray was thus a key piece of evidence in establishing Darwin's intellectual priority with respect to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> by natural selection. Neither Darwin nor Wallace attended the meeting. The papers were published by the society as On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. By summer 1859 it was obvious to Gray and others working with Darwin that On the Origin of Species would be a ground-breaking book.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1950 {{there was}} no widely {{accepted}} fossil evidence of life before the Cambrian period. When Charles Darwin wrote The Origin of Species he acknowledged {{that the lack of}} any fossil evidence of life prior to the relatively complex animals of the Cambrian was a potential argument against <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution,</b> but expressed the hope that such fossils would be found in the future. In the 1860s there were claims of the discovery of pre-Cambrian fossils, but these would later be shown not to have an organic origin. In the late 19th century Charles Doolittle Walcott would discover stromatolites and other fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life, but at the time the organic origin of those fossils was also disputed. This would start to change in the 1950s with the discovery of more stromatolites along with microfossils of the bacteria that built them, and the publication of a series of papers by the Soviet scientist Boris Vasil'evich Timofeev announcing the discovery of microscopic fossil spores in pre-Cambrian sediments. A key breakthrough would come when Martin Glaessner would show that fossils of soft bodied animals discovered by Reginald Sprigg during the late 1940s in the Ediacaran hills of Australia were in fact pre-Cambrian not early Cambrian as Sprigg had originally believed, making the Ediacaran biota the oldest animals known. By the end of the 20th century, paleobiology had established that the history of life extended back at least 3.5 billion years.|$|E

25|$|Further {{confusion}} {{arose in}} 1980–1981, {{when there was}} a long debate in the pages of Nature about the scientific status of <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution.</b> Specifically, the argument was on the factors influencing and nature of the unit of selection in the genome, with one side positing natural selection, and the other, neutral mutation. Neither of the parties seriously doubted that the theory was both scientific and, according to current scientific knowledge, true. Some participants objected to statements that appeared to present <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> as an absolute dogma, however, rather than as a hypothesis that so far has performed very well, and both sides quoted Popper in support of their positions. Evolution critics such as Phillip E. Johnson took {{this as an opportunity to}} declare that <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> was unscientific.|$|E
25|$|Bryan {{was worried}} that <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> was gaining ground {{not only in the}} universities, but also within the church. Many colleges were still church-affiliated. The {{developments}} of 19th century liberal theology, and higher criticism in particular, had allowed many clergymen to be willing to embrace <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> and claim that it was not contradictory with their being Christians. Determined {{to put an end to}} this, Bryan, who had long served as a Presbyterian elder, decided to run for the position of Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the USA, which was at the time embroiled in the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy. (Under Presbyterian church governance, clergy and laymen are equally represented in the General Assembly, and the post of Moderator is open to any member of the General Assembly.) Bryan's main competition in the race was the Rev. Charles F. Wishart, president of the College of Wooster in Ohio, who had loudly endorsed the teaching of <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> in the college. Bryan lost to Wishart by a vote of 451–427. Bryan failed in gaining approval for a proposal to cut off funds to schools where <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> was taught. Instead, the General Assembly announced disapproval of materialistic (as opposed to theistic) evolution.|$|E
