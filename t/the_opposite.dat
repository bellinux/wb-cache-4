40|$|International audienceIn <b>the</b> present paper, <b>opposites</b> are {{examined}} and discussed, {{and a way}} of describing them from a cognitive perspective is suggested. Related research disagrees upon whether opposites are symmetrical, and whether concepts should be integrated in <b>the</b> relation of <b>opposites.</b> <b>The</b> Swedish <b>opposites</b> levande 'alive' and död 'dead' have been studied thoroughly in order to provide empirical data. Arguments are presented in favour of an analysis in which opposites show semantic symmetry to some extent. When it comes to distribution and domains, however, opposites do not show symmetry. Further, it is argued that concepts should be included in <b>the</b> relation of <b>opposites.</b> <b>The</b> asymmetries found are related to markedness, information value, Aktionsart and the prototype of the word connected to referent of the subject/NP that one of <b>the</b> <b>opposites</b> describes...|$|R

5|$|The prologue was a {{short and}} fairly flat circuit around Liège, with {{expected}} stage times to be about eight minutes. The start ramp was located at Avenue Rogier next to the Parc d'Avroy; the riders then headed north by the Boulevard d'Avroy and Boulevard de la Sauvenière. They then followed the Quai Roosevelt, along the Meuse, until the midway point when they returned on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> carriageway, before turning right towards Place Saint-Lambert, {{in front of the}} Palais des Princes-Évêques.

In British English, <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E
