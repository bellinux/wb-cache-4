5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

500|$|Many {{listeners}} were incredulous {{that such}} a young man (27 at the release of his first album) could have such [...] "a remarkably mature perspective". According to Black, [...] "To me, a song {{is more than just}} something <b>to</b> <b>sing.</b> <b>It's</b> something <b>to</b> learn from. It's somebody else's true feeling. I'm always trying to get at the meaning.|$|R
5|$|The {{lyrics of}} The Power of Four were {{circulated}} {{to all of}} the members of the British and Irish Lions tour squad and the song was pre-added to the playlists on their tour iPods. The song was not released as a single however it was permitted to be broadcast by radio stations and it was made available to download on the Internet. The British and Irish Lions players were shown the words of The Power of Four on the Saturday before their first game and it was expected that they would know the words by the time they had arrived in New Zealand. However it was mentioned by a British and Irish Lions spokesman that the players were under no obligation <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the week, ITV were {{uncertain}} if Vickers {{would be}} able to perform due to her continued illness, and raised the question of whether she should be given another week off if she was still too sick <b>to</b> <b>sing.</b> <b>It</b> was, however, later confirmed that she would appear.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, a {{complete}} Orthodox Christian service to Saint Rumwold was written {{along with a}} tone system (Orthodox musical system) with which <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> which also has more general application. The service is performed on his two feast days, which are 3 November (main feast) and 28 August (translation of relics). In 2005, the former church of Saint Rumwold in Lincoln, which is now a college, erected a plaque to celebrate the connection.|$|E

5000|$|McCartney also {{included}} [...] "Blackbird" [...] in his {{set at the}} Party at the Palace concert in June 2002. In 2009, McCartney performed the song at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, commenting prior <b>to</b> <b>singing</b> <b>it</b> on how it had been written {{in response to the}} Civil Rights Movement, and added, [...] "It's so great to realise so many civil rights issues have been overcome." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{band had}} been {{listening}} to Martha Wainwright's Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole during the sessions and were fans of it. Towards {{the end of the}} recording sessions, Lightbody wrote a duet with her in mind, hoping to get her <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it.</b> She liked the song and agreed to record it. Eugene Kelly and a few members from The Reindeer Section also appear as choir in various songs throughout the album. Simpson credited Lee for being supportive of the band, {{and at the same time}} critical, when necessary. Each band member used to come to him for opinion on work they were doing. Morale during the sessions was high, with the band feeling a sense of togetherness seeing the hard work everyone was doing.|$|E
25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words (Morgen ich leuchte) and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also {{that it is in}} fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) that they allow Walther <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it,</b> and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.|$|E
50|$|During {{a lecture}} at Chautauqua Institution, Julie Andrews stated that she {{considered}} this song too difficult <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> because <b>it</b> had no meaning behind it.|$|R
50|$|Upon Colm's return <b>to</b> <b>singing,</b> <b>it</b> didn't {{take long}} for Music {{to come to the}} fore of {{everything}} Colm did. He had his first stage experience, playing the lead role of Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls before being offered a scholarship opportunity for singing in University College Dublin. Colm entered UCD with a singing scholarship under the direction of Mr. Desmond Early and sang with UCD's Choral Scholars.|$|R
5000|$|... "I've {{always wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>sing,</b> <b>it's</b> {{something}} that has been in my heart for a long time. I come from a family of musicians where everyone plays the piano, so music is in my veins. I have been writing poetry since I was little and now I feel like I can put it to use. People inspire me, I love listening to their lives and their stories. I can write a song about anyone, anywhere." ...|$|R
25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not have to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it,</b> Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Night" [...] was {{a lullaby}} written by Lennon {{for his son}} Julian, and he {{specifically}} wanted Starr <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it.</b> The early takes featured just Lennon on acoustic guitar and Starr singing. Martin scored an orchestral and choral arrangement that replaced the guitar in the final mix, and also played the celesta.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{attempted}} {{recording the}} lead vocal {{only once a}} day. He said: [...] "I came into the studios early {{every day for a}} week <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> by myself because at first my voice was too clear. I wanted it to sound as though I'd been performing it on stage all week." [...] Lennon thought he should have sung it, remarking that it was more his style.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{get such}} {{nonsense}} into your head, but follow Miss Muir's well-bred example and don't be curious about other people's affairs. Ask her <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> tonight; <b>it</b> amuses me." ...|$|R

500|$|Originally, the song's chorus was [...] "set in stone," [...] so {{they asked}} Burgess <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> and write some more lyrics. The Chemical Brothers also {{wanted him to}} perform his vocals {{at the end of}} the track like his voice from earlier in his career, {{described}} by Burgess himself as [...] "weedy and soft," [...] singing lyrics like [...] "I'm a hustler, I'm a tiger." [...] The duo also stated that his vocal styling in the outcome sounds very different from the one of their previous collaboration. The Guardian Alexis Petridis compared it to a [...] "standard-issue mid-Atlannick accent." ...|$|E
500|$|Allen herself re-recorded {{the single}} in Simlish, the fictional {{language}} used in The Sims games, to help promotion. The Simlish version {{was used in}} the Sims expansion pack [...] soundtrack, and Allen also had her own character in the game. She declared: [...] "Recording 'Smile' was a great experience for me. Sometimes revenge can be fun. But getting <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> again [...] came very naturally and it was hilarious to practice! The silly language and whimsy of The Sims games are a perfect fit for the song. I was laughing the entire time!" [...] Also, an animated music video was made for the Simlish version.|$|E
500|$|Powter has {{performed}} the song on several television shows, including CD USA in February 2006, and Total Request Live on April 6, 2006.

5000|$|I wish {{indeed it}} might become the Women Voters' Hymn, as you suggest. People seem <b>to</b> enjoy <b>singing</b> <b>it.</b> And having the vote ought to diffuse {{a good deal}} of joy. So they should combine happily." ...|$|R
25|$|Saare Jahan Se Achcha has {{remained}} popular in India {{for nearly a}} century. Mahatma Gandhi is said <b>to</b> have <b>sung</b> <b>it</b> over a hundred times when he was imprisoned at Yerawada Jail in Pune in the 1930s.|$|R
500|$|Groups of ramblers often sang {{songs such as}} [...] "I'm Happy When I'm Hiking", as well as bawdy songs, ballads {{and radical}} American protest songs at their camps. MacColl {{published}} the [...] "Manchester Youth Song" [...] in 1933, singing of [...] "Workers in Cheetham, who slave every day / In waterproof factories at starvation pay". He also wrote the song [...] "Mass Trespass 1932", setting words like [...] "For the mass trespass {{is the only way}} there is / To gain access to the mountains once again" [...] to the old Scottish tune of [...] "The Road to the Isles". His friends used <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> as they rambled in the hills.|$|E
500|$|... "We had {{the song}} pitched {{to us and}} {{originally}} it wasn’t a duet. The more I {{was listening to the}} thing and learning the song, I realized it set itself up to be a duet if we wanted to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E
500|$|Then on 16 February Cole {{appeared}} at the 2010 BRIT Awards for a performance which began with Cole being [...] "catapulted" [...] on stage with her dancers. Cole and her dancers initially wore gold-trimmed white trench coats before revealing a hooded black bodysuit. The performance included a bridge sampled from song [...] "Be" [...] which features vocals from former X Factor contestant Rowetta Satchell. Satchell initially refused to allow Cole to use the sample and was disappointed {{that they had not}} asked her <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>it</b> despite Polydor Records stating they would not use the sample, reports later surfaced surrounding an alleged legal battle. Cole also received media attention for performing without her wedding ring, following reports that husband Ashley had cheated, as well as for allegedly miming the song.|$|E
5000|$|... "Understand Your Man" [...] {{was also}} the last song Cash ever {{performed}} {{in front of an}} audience. It was the last song in his performance at the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons, Virginia, on 5 July 2003. Prior <b>to</b> <b>singing</b> <b>it,</b> Cash told the audience that at that point he had not performed it live in 25 years. (It was not, however, the final song he ever sang as, despite failing health, he continued to make studio recordings until late August 2003, shortly before his death.) ...|$|R
