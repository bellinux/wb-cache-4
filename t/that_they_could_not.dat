5|$|Also, in 1900 Amico Bignami and Giuseppe Bastianelli found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> infect an {{individual}} with blood containing only gametocytes. The possibility {{of the existence of}} a chronic blood stage infection was proposed by Ronald Ross and David Thompson in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|The college {{enrolled}} {{its first}} African American students in 1963, following a federal lawsuit brought by Dana Smith, who {{became one of}} the first five African Americans at the institution when a district court judge ruled <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be denied admission based on race.|$|E

5|$|The {{first game}} of the {{campaign}} was against Lithuanian team FK Sūduva. Sūduva stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> send a scout to Glasgow to spy on Celtic to prepare for their match, and instead had to watch videotapes of their opponents.|$|E
5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be built to produce yields {{of more than a}} megaton; and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, the Allies {{spent the}} evening heatedly debating their course of action. The Peloponnesians were {{in favour of}} evacuating, {{and at this point}} Themistocles {{attempted}} his ruse with Xerxes. It was only when Aristides, the exiled Athenian general arrived that night, followed by some deserters from the Persians, with news of the deployment of the Persian fleet, that the Peloponnesians accepted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> escape, and so would fight.|$|E
25|$|The kidnappers demanded ransom, {{initially}} EUR 450,000, eventually decreasing to EUR 5,000. It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} family of Halimi was told <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> raise the money, they should get it from the Jewish community.|$|R
60|$|The crab began {{laughing}} again, {{which so}} provoked the zebra {{that he tried}} to shake the little creature off. This resulted in more ear-pinching, and finally Dorothy told them <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> behave <b>they</b> must go back to the forest.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to microbes, insects {{have come to}} flourish {{in areas of the}} ocean <b>that</b> <b>they</b> previously <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> The sea skater, for example, has been able to reproduce on the hard surface provided by the floating plastic.|$|R
5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some {{researchers have found that}} cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|In a {{revision}} of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed {{the definition of the}} clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of Triceratops and birds. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and Eoraptor. Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be considered inside Dinosauria.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year , God's {{punishment}} struck {{the people in the}} eastern lands, in the town Ornach , and in Khastorokan, and in Sarai, and in Bezdezh, and in other towns in those lands; the mortality was great among the Bessermens, and among the Tartars, and among the Armenians and the Abkhazians, and among the Jews, and among the European foreigners, and among the Circassians, and among all who lived there, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> bury them.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{development}} of Windows 1.0, Microsoft intentionally limited its borrowing of certain GUI elements from the Macintosh user interface, to comply with its license.

60|$|The art-students {{came down}} with Berry, who shook hands so cordially with him <b>that</b> perhaps <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help it. Miss Carver seemed to hesitate, but she gave him her hand too, and she asked, as the others had done, whether he had found his family well.|$|R
60|$|As he ceased speaking, {{he bowed}} again with ceremonious gravity, {{as if all}} were equally strangers to him; though the young men saw plainly that a smothered smile played about a mouth <b>that</b> even <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> refuse the praise of being of rare and {{extraordinary}} attraction.|$|R
5|$|Special {{weeks have}} also {{included}} shows featuring questions concerning specific topics, such as professional football, celebrity gossip, movies, and pop culture. During {{a week of}} episodes in November 2007, to celebrate the 1,000th episode of the syndicated Millionaire, all contestants that week started with $1,000 so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> leave empty-handed, and only had to answer ten questions to win $1,000,000. During that week, twenty home viewers per day also won $1,000 each.|$|E
5|$|The court {{eventually}} declared <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> issue a writ, {{because the}} Habeas Corpus Act 1862 {{prevented them from}} issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act. Hastings attempted {{to argue that the}} writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|The {{frame and}} {{qualification}} problems. AI researchers (like John McCarthy) who used logic discovered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> represent ordinary deductions that involved planning or default reasoning without making {{changes to the}} structure of logic itself. They developed new logics (like non-monotonic logics and modal logics) to try to solve the problems.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} international trade with imperfect competition to show that {{in the absence of}} price discrimination it matters which economic agent pays the tariff. The analysis indicates that the effects of trade protection (or liberalization) are not uniform across industries, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> even <b>not</b> exist. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{operation}} achieved some {{surprise and}} tactical success, but was ultimately a failure. A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed {{on the ground}} but replaced within a week. Allied aircrew casualties were quite small, since the majority of Allied losses were grounded aircraft. The Germans, however, lost many pilots <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> readily replace.|$|E
5|$|This time Thomas {{planned to}} launch {{simultaneous}} sorties from four gates. The main sector {{was to be}} again the Thomas gate, {{to take full advantage}} of the exhausted Muslim corps stationed there. The attacks from the other gates—Jabiya Gate, the Small Gate and the Eastern Gate—were intended to tie down the other Muslim corps so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> aid Shurhabil's corps at the Thomas gate.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamization was {{catching}} up with the conflict in Laos. During the 1970–1971 dry season, U.S. Air Force strike missions in support of Hmong operations had dropped by 70 percent {{from the previous year}} from 114 sorties per day to 38. The grinding nature of the conflict was also having a cumulative effect on the adult male population of the Hmong. Severe attrition had forced the Hmong into a numbers game <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> win.|$|E
60|$|They went on {{across the}} mountains, till in the {{afternoon}} once more they saw the road running beneath them like a ribbon, {{and at the end}} of it the lagoon.

50|$|From 1635 to 1639, Scudamore was {{ambassador}} to France, and caused controversy by adorning the embassy chapel in Laudian style. However, the Earl of Leicester who was staunchly Protestant was appointed as extraordinary ambassador over his head, {{with the result}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> two <b>could</b> <b>not</b> agree on policy.|$|R

5|$|When Homer's {{attempts}} to mend {{his relationship with}} Lisa fail, he buys her a pony with help from a loan through the Power Plant Credit Union. When Lisa wakes up one morning to find the pony (named Princess) lying next to her, she gallops into her parents' bedroom telling Homer she loves him. While Homer is happy, Marge is upset he ignored her warning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford the pony.|$|E
5|$|When {{vineyards}} in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted {{the seeds and}} started eating the grapes. The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. However, vineyards are not optimal habitat: some populations have had such a low reproductive success <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be maintained without immigration.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} at the centre of a {{controversy}} concerning a covenant {{on one of their}} early developments in 1956. This resulted in the Bell v Norman C. Ashton Ltd (1956) P&CR 359 case which came before the Leeds Courts. Ashton had purchased land with a covenant <b>that</b> meant <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> build on it.|$|R
