The niqabi is also required to refrain from forcing or propagating her niqab wearing practice upon others, especially against their will.

500|$|Clarke had to {{deal with}} four natural {{disasters}} during his tenure. An outbreak of smallpox in 1894 was the result of labour migration and men returning from working in Witwatersrand. When it proved too costly for the people, he waived the charge for the vaccination. Locust swarms in 1894 and 1895 caused damage to crops and resulted in famine in 1896. The government response was to offer the chief of each tribe a reward of 3d for every muid of locusts collected as well as cattle to slaughter when a swarm was eradicated. At the same time, Clarke bought 1,090 muids of quick-growing mealies to be given on payment to families requiring immediate relief, a measure of which Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, approved: [...] "It is better <b>to</b> <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of unnecessary expenditure than to run the risk of exposing the people to starvation." [...] Finally, in 1897, an outbreak of rinderpest killed many cattle and the government responded with a programme of inoculation.|$|E

The script for [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was completed before the first season ended, but NBC executives asked for several refinements [...] including less involved plots and fewer camera movements [...] before approving a second season. In an attempt to appease the network and improve ratings, executive producers Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana sought to make subtle changes to give the show a stronger mainstream appeal, while aiming not to compromise its integrity or originality. With [...] "Bop Gun", the producers slightly toned down the bleak visual style and hand-held photography motif. It is also the first episode {{to focus on a}} single story, rather than multiple subplots, which Fontana felt allowed the writers to tell the main story better.

The first scene, which depicts the moments immediately before the shooting, juxtaposes shots of the Ellison family admiring the tourist attractions of Baltimore with shots of their shooters playing basketball before following the family. The photography depicts the different sides of Baltimore by presenting the Ellison family shots like a cheerful tourist advertisement, with the other shots presenting a grittier image of the city.|$|E

30|$|Antibiotics {{often are}} {{prescribed}} in excess to patients having a clinical syndrome of community-acquired {{lower respiratory tract}} infection (LRTI). Despite the usually viral aetiology of their illness, an estimated 75 % of patients with acute bronchitis receive antibiotics [11]; indeed, clinical presentation does not allow the distinction between bacterial and viral infection, which encourages physicians <b>to</b> <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> “safe side” and prescribe antibiotics. Communication campaigns inciting primary physicians to limit unnecessary prescriptions for LRTI have a moderate impact, which is difficult to maintain over time [12, 13]. In this context, the addition of biomarker measurements to the clinical evaluation of such patients may have two main potential effects: improve the diagnostic accuracy, and reassure {{the patient and the}} physician that antibiotic therapy is unnecessary.|$|R

60|$|As 'The Prelude' is autobiographical, a {{large part}} of Wordsworth's life might be written in the notes {{appended}} to it; but, besides breaking up the text of the poem unduly, this plan has many disadvantages, and would render a subsequent and detailed life of the poet either unnecessary or repetitive. The notes which follow will therefore be limited to the explanation of local, historical, and chronological allusions, or to references to Wordsworth's own career that are not obvious without them. It has been occasionally difficult to decide whether some of the allusions, to minute points in ancient history, mediæval mythology, and contemporary politics, should be explained or left alone; but I have preferred <b>to</b> <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of giving a brief clue to details, with which every scholar is familiar.|$|E
60|$|The {{editor of}} {{writings}} by any author not long deceased is censured {{sooner or later}} for his errors of omission or commission. I have decided <b>to</b> <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of commission and {{to include in the}} uniform edition of Wilde's works everything that could be identified as genuine. Wilde's literary reputation has survived so much that I think it proof against any exhumation of articles which he or his admirers would have preferred to forget. As a matter of fact, I believe this volume will prove of unusual interest; some of the reviews are curiously prophetic; some are, of course, biassed by prejudice hostile or friendly; others are conceived in the author's wittiest and happiest vein; only a few are colourless. And if, according to Lord Beaconsfield, the verdict of a continental nation may be regarded as that of posterity, Wilde is a much greater force in our literature than even friendly contemporaries ever supposed he would become.|$|E
60|$|These few {{examples}} show, I think, {{that in every}} department of nature there occur instances of the instability of specific form, which the increase of materials aggravates rather than diminishes. And {{it must be remembered}} that the naturalist is rarely likely <b>to</b> <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of imputing greater indefiniteness to species than really exists. There is a completeness and satisfaction to the mind in defining and limiting and naming a species, which leads us all to do so whenever we conscientiously can, and which we know has led many collectors to reject vague intermediate forms as destroying the symmetry of their cabinets. We must therefore consider these cases of excessive variation and instability as being thoroughly well established; and to the objection that, after all, these cases are but few compared with those in which species can be limited and defined, and are therefore merely exceptions to a general rule, I reply that a true law embraces all apparent exceptions, and that to the great laws of nature there are no real exceptions--that what appear to be such are equally results of law, and are often (perhaps indeed always) those very results which are most important as revealing the true nature and action of the law. It is for such reasons that naturalists now look upon the study of varieties as more important than that of well-fixed species. It is in the former that we see nature still at work, in the very act of producing those wonderful modifications of form, that endless variety of colour, and that complicated harmony of relations, which gratify every sense and give occupation to every faculty of the true lover of nature.|$|E
