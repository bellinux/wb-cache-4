25|$|The {{breaches}} of {{the salary}} cap and salary floor regulations outlined by the AFL are: exceeding the TPP; falling below the salary floor; not informing the AFL of payments; late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents; or engaging in draft tampering. Penalties include fines of up to triple <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>involved</b> ($10,000 for each document late or incorrect lodged or lost), forfeiture of draft picks and/or deduction of premiership points. The most significant breach of {{the salary cap}} {{was that of the}} Carlton Football Club in the early 2000s.|$|E
25|$|The cap is {{actively}} policed and penalties for clubs {{found to have}} breached the NRL salary cap regulations include fines of lesser of half <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>involved</b> or $500,000 and/or deduction of premiership points. For example, six clubs were fined for minor infractions in 2003. These infractions are usually technical in nature, and can sometimes be affected by third-party factors such as loss of sponsorship revenue affecting an allowance. During the 2007 season the NRL implemented ways of creating a fair and more beneficial cap for players and clubs.|$|E

However, as mentioned in [36, 37], in purchase transactions where it is expected that <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>involved</b> will be small or very small (micropayments) as in our payment system, non-repudiation could be considered unnecessary in order to save some computations and perform the transactions more efficiently.|$|R

These penalties were increased after the Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal in 2010.|$|E

50|$|The {{level of}} evasion {{depends on a}} number of factors, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of money a person or a corporation possesses. Efforts to evade income tax decline when <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>involved</b> are lower. <b>The</b> level of evasion also depends on the efficiency of the tax administration. Corruption by tax officials make it difficult to control evasion. Tax administrations use various means to reduce evasion and increase the level of enforcement: for example, privatization of tax enforcement or tax farming.|$|R
