40|$|Field {{investigations}} {{of an ancient}} fortress wall in southern Myanmar reveal an offset of ~ 6 m across the Sagaing fault, the major right-lateral fault between the Sunda and Burma plates. The fault slip rate implied by offset of this 16 th-century fortress is between 11 and 18 cm yr^(– 1). A palaeoseismological excavation within the fortress reveals at least two major fault ruptures since its construction. The slip rate we obtained is comparable to geodetic and geological estimates farther north, but is only 50 per cent of the spreading rate (38 mm yr^(– 1)) at the Andaman Sea spreading centre. This disparity suggests that other structures may be accommodating deformation within the Burma Plate.

30|$|Nanoscale {{building}} blocks have attracted much interest {{due to their}} potential applications in replacement of traditional materials in <b>the</b> coming <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b> However, {{most of the work}} in the synthesis of nanocrystals using solution-phase chemical method is focused on VI-II semiconductor systems and noble metals [1]. Transition metal phosphides exhibit unique catalytic, optical, electronic, and magnetic properties depending on their phases [2]. For example, Fe 3 P is ferromagnet that has a high transition temperature (Tc = 716 K) [3], while FeP 2 is a small-bandgap semiconductor with a Tc of 15 K. Some preparation methods have been developed for the interest of studying the size-property relations of nanoscale iron phosphides. For example, Gu et al. [4] prepared 200 nm orthorhombic FeP via solvothermal synthesis employing FeCl 3 and Na 3 P at 180 °C. Luo et al. [5] synthesized nanocrystalline Fe 2 P in a similar way at 180 °C. Hu et al. [6] obtained a mixture of iron oxide nanoshells and hollow iron phosphide nanoparticles using sonichemistry method. Brock et al. [3] prepared FeP nanoparticles via a de-silylation route using a highly reactive phosphine source, P(SiMe 3) 3. Later, Brock [7] found that trioctylphosphine (TOP), which is a less-reactive reagent compared with P(SiMe 3) 3, can be used as phosphine source as well as surfactant and solvent in the preparation of MnP and FeP using metal carbonyls as metal source. Liu et al. [8] synthesized FeP nanorods by injecting Fe(CO) 5 /TOP into hot solution of TOP and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO). Hyeon et al. [9] studied the relation between the injection rate and length of Fe 2 P nanorods synthesized using a syringe pump. Fe 2 P nanorods can also be prepared without using a syringe pump as shown in the work of Whitmire et al. [10] who developed a single-source organometallic method to control morphology by varying the ratio of tri-n-octylamine (TOA) to oleic acid (OA) in a one-pot reaction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract To develop {{spatially}} continuous seismicity models (earthquake probability distributions) from a given earthquake catalog, {{the method}} of kernel estimation has been suggested. Kernel estimations with a global (spatially invariant) bandwidth deal poorly with earthquake hypocenter distributions that have different spatially local features. For example, a typical earthquake catalog has several areas of high activity (clusters) and areas of low-background seismicity. An alternative approach is adaptive kernel estimation, which uses a bandwidth parameter that is spatially variable. Its performance compared to kernel estimations with spatially invariant bandwidths suggests that (discrete) earthquake distributions require different degrees of local smoothing to provide useful spatial seismicity models. Using adaptive kernel estimation, the (local) indices of temporal dispersion of any earthquake probability distribution can be estimated and used to model the spatial probability distribution of mainshocks. The application of these methods to New Zealand and Australian earthquake catalogs shows that the spatial features (earthquake clusters) in which the mainshocks occurred have been reasonably stable throughout the observation period. The observed regions of higher activity persisted throughout the observation period, and none of these regions decreased to background activity during that time. This suggests that these regions will continue to represent higher risk for the occurrence of moderate to large earthquakes within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years or <b>decades.</b> Furthermore, {{it has been observed}} that shallow earthquakes are mostly part of temporal sequences (e. g., aftershocks or swarms), whereas the earthquakes within the subduction zones in New Zealand showed only small temporal variation during the observation period...|$|R

Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the purchasing power of rural labourers increased by around 40 percent. As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in fresh laws in 1363 to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite.

40|$|AbstractThe {{question}} of the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on small islands is currently much discussed. The many thousands of Pacific islands in their different contexts (geodynamic, climatic, etc.) and the insufficient data available explain why {{it is difficult to}} clearly discern the specific role of climate change in the recent evolution of these islands. To address this question, we investigated the recent changes affecting 21 islets in New Caledonia's lagoon. These islets are either located on small patch-reefs inside the New Caledonia Island lagoon or lie directly on the barrier reef. Based on the studies we conducted (field surveys, reconstruction of changes in the islets over the last decades, shoreline changes) we were able to define a typology of the islets that includes 6 stages and a life expectancy index. Using the life expectancy index, we found that of the 21 islets studied, 19 % are in a highly critical situation, meaning they are very likely to be endangered in the short term (within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years), 9. 5 % are in a critical situation, i. e., likely to disappear in the near future and very likely to disappear in <b>the</b> medium term (<b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades),</b> 19 % are evolving rapidly, which could lead to their disappearance in the medium term but not in the short term, 9. 5 % are not endangered in the short and medium term and 43 % are not endangered at all (stable or accreting, large area, relatively higher altitude). In this context, the rise in sea level induced by climate change is an adverse factor which is likely to lower the resilience of the islets to erosion processes. Other factors like the degradation of the reef ecosystem due to variations in ocean salinity, temperature and acidity, lower sediment stocks on the beaches and foreshores, human visitors, coastal development and so on are other adverse factors that could modify the capacity for resilience of these islets. Due to their variety and sensitivity, New Caledonia's islets could thus serve as integrative indicators of environmental and climatic change for New Caledonia...|$|R

We propose a general methodology for the automated adaptation of layout to multiple-patterning masking the complexity in dealing with its manufacturing constraints. We also study {{the impact of this}} technology on design and show the benefits of bringing the design perspective into making manufacturing-process decisions. Lastly, we propose a novel technique for DP that reduces cost and improve overlay/Critical-Dimension (CD) control in multiple-patterning.
