5|$|After {{his move}} to Oxford United in January 2008, {{he stated that}} the reason for the move was so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> closer to his family home in Southampton. On his arrival at Exeter City in July 2008, he moved into a house with fellow Exeter forward, Ben Watson.

5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip Kumar. After watching the film, Kumar was hesitant to play the lead role as he felt he would not match Ganesan's performance in the original version. K.

5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> in a scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film {{in order to avoid}} distracting the audience.|$|E

He {{and his wife}} {{abandoned}} their son by throwing him into Gotham City's park river after realizing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a danger to society after he killed their cat. Burgess Meredith, the actor who played The Penguin in the 1960s Batman TV series was originally asked to play Tucker, but he declined due his health problems which culminated with his death in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder of}} the Hindu sect Pushtimarg – Vallabhacharya (1479–1531) is {{believed}} to have visited Pandharpur at least twice and was ordered to marry by Vithoba (called Vitthalnath or Vitthalnathji in the sect) and have children so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> born as Vallabhacharya's son. Later, Vallabhacharya married. His second son and successor was recognized as a manifestation of Vithoba and named Vitthalnath, also known as Gusainji.|$|E

The club's technical director, Miguel Pardeza, categorically stated on 13 July that the player would remain at the club, however, and Jesé extended his contract for a further four years later in the same month, signing a deal worth more than €1 million a year and which contained a €200 million release clause.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{a network}} of former SS members, Mengele sailed to Argentina in July 1949. He {{initially}} lived in and around Buenos Aires, then fled to Paraguay in 1959 and Brazil in 1960 while being sought by West Germany, Israel, and Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> brought to trial. In spite of extradition requests by the West German government and clandestine operations by the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, Mengele eluded capture. He drowned while swimming off the Brazilian coast in 1979 and was buried under a false name. His remains were disinterred and positively identified by forensic examination in 1985.|$|E
5|$|De Ferran was {{confident}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> competitive and achieve a good result {{without having to}} worry about the championship. Da Matta felt his team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California where he wanted to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and hoped he would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E

5|$|During the off-season, Philadelphia {{planned to}} trade or sell Lavender, {{even though he}} had earlier {{announced}} his retirement from the game. Philadelphia's asking price for his rights was $1,000, but they received no offers. Christy Mathewson, manager of the Reds, was reported to have had interest in Lavender, the pitcher's success against the Giants still fresh in Mathewson's mind. Though Philadelphia had a meeting with Cincinnati, Mathewson was unable to attend, and no trade discussions materialized. The San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League expressed interest in Lavender, but he stressed that he was retired and that he would only consider a trade to Atlanta of the Southern Association so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> near his farm in Montezuma. In 1922, it was reported that he signed with Atlanta after playing well for an independent team in Dawson, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with his two surviving heirs was fraught, for, while the King had great affection for his youngest son John, he showed little warmth towards Richard and indeed seems to have borne him a grudge after their argument in 1184. The bickering and simmering tensions between Henry and Richard were cleverly exploited by the new French king, Philip Augustus. Philip had come to power in 1180 and he rapidly demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> an assertive, calculating and manipulative political leader. Initially Henry and Philip Augustus had enjoyed a good relationship. Despite attempts to divide the two, Henry and Philip Augustus agreed a joint alliance, even though this cost the French king the support of Flanders and Champagne. Philip Augustus regarded Geoffrey as a close friend, and would have welcomed him as a successor to Henry. With the death of Geoffrey, however, the relationship between Henry and Philip broke down.|$|E
5|$|In June, Edge won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship (the unified {{version of}} the World Tag Team Championship from the Raw brand and the WWE Tag Team Championship from the SmackDown brand) with Chris Jericho at The Bash after he and Jericho were {{inserted}} into what was originally a match between reigning champions The Colóns and Legacy. The win made Edge a record setting 12 time World Tag Team Champion. On July 3, Edge suffered a torn Achilles tendon while competing at a live event in San Diego in a match against Jeff Hardy, and later underwent surgery. It was reported <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> out of action {{for up to a}} year. During Edge's absence, Jericho replaced him with Big Show (forming Jeri-Show) and Jericho began to speak badly of Edge, mocking him for his injury.|$|E

5|$|In October 1995, Sirivudh {{talked about}} his desire to assassinate Hun Sen during an {{interview}} with So Naro, who was the secretary-general of the Khmer Journalists Association. A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun Sen, called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun Sen over the phone. The phone conversation was recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone conversation to CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun Sen learnt of the conversation and became enraged at Sirivudh's comments, and pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his parliamentary immunity so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E
5|$|The Montalto faction {{transferred}} {{their support}} to Medici on 1 April, securing his election. Joyeuse had been seeking Medici's election throughout the conclave, and {{had managed to}} secure the support of Montalto for his candidate. Montalto was allied with the Spanish and had previously backed Tolomeo Gallio. After Medici's election, Avila revealed that Philip III had excluded Medici as well, and protested so loudly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> heard on the street. The cardinals who had elected Medici answered that protesting {{the election of a}} candidate was useless once the person was elected pope. Upon his election, Medici took the name Leo XI in honour of his great-uncle Leo X. His election made Leo the fourth cardinal to be elected pope that had been created by Sixtus V in his consistory in 1583.|$|E
5|$|The usual grave for a thrall was {{probably}} {{not much more than}} a hole in the ground. He {{was probably}} buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century.|$|E
