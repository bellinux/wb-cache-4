5|$|Unemployment was {{particularly}} heavy in Britain's traditional staple export industries—coal mining, shipbuilding, {{iron and steel}} and textiles—all of which were in a slow decline from their Victorian heyday. Because of the concentration of <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> {{in the north of}} England, in Scotland and in Wales, the percentage of unemployed persons in these regions was significantly higher, sometimes more than double, than in the south throughout the interwar period. The decline of <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> helped to create pockets of long-term unemployment outside the normal cyclical variations; some workers had no work for years.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries {{the wool}} and cloth {{industries}} continued to thrive, {{powered by the}} waters of the River Sheppey. There were reputed to be 50 mills in the town and surrounding area in the early 18th century, and a number of fine clothiers' houses survive, particularly in Bowlish, a hamlet on the western edge of Shepton Mallet. Although <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> employed some 4,000 people {{towards the end of the}} century, they were already beginning to decline by this time. Discontent at the mechanisation of the mills resulted in the deaths of two men in a riot in the town in 1775, an event which apparently discouraged the mill-owners from modernising further. The decision resulted in Shepton's cloth trade losing out to the steam-powered mills in the north of England in the early 19th century. The manufacture of silk and crepe revived the town's fortunes somewhat, and Shepton's mills manufactured the silk used in Queen Victoria's wedding dress. However <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> also died out eventually.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s, Buford's economy was {{centered}} on both its location as a railway stop and its leather industry, until demand for leather declined and other transportation options became {{more readily available}} {{over the course of}} the 1900s, and <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> were no longer a viable part of Buford's economy by the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Since the deindustrialisation of {{the region}} in the mid-20th century, <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> have been {{replaced}} by newer sectors and industries, although many of the civic developments that accompanied industrialisation remain in the form of public buildings; a town hall, public baths and library.

5|$|Crawley {{was already}} a modest {{industrial}} centre {{by the end of}} the Second World War. Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large enough to have their own factories. In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair. Many of the jobs in <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> were highly skilled.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{at the mouth of}} Coal Mine Hollow, and the road it was on was used by the lumber and coal {{industries}} that were active in Plunketts Creek Township during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Creeks in the township supplied water power to 14 mills in 1861, and by 1876 there were 19 sawmills, a shingle mill, a woolen factory, and a tannery. By {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> supported the inhabitants of two villages in Plunketts Creek Township.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{economy of}} the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and sealing. The {{exploitation}} of the forests for timber started in the 1860s with {{the rapid growth of}} the city of Dunedin {{as a result of the}} goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into <b>these</b> <b>industries,</b> however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Application {{of social}} {{sustainability}} requires stakeholders {{to look at}} human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues {{should be considered in}} production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{textiles}} and related trades {{were the main}} source of employment in the town. Bleaching was a widely distributed finishing trade in Salford, carried over from the earlier woollen industry. In the 18th century, before the introduction of chemical bleaching, bleaching fields were commonplace, some very close to the town. In 1773 there were 25bleachers around Salford, most {{to the west of the}} township. Printing was another source of trade; the earliest recorded in the region was a calique printer in the Manchester Parish Register of 1763. <b>These</b> <b>industries</b> became more important as Salford faced increasing competition from the nearby towns of Bolton and Oldham. As its cotton spinning industries faltered its economy turned increasingly to other {{textiles and}} to the finishing trades, including rexine and silk dyeing, and fulling and bleaching, at a string of works in Salford.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{entrepreneurs}} {{transformed the}} economy from small, craft-organized factories located {{inside the city}} limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, {{the division of labor}} increased, and localized production systems formed around <b>these</b> <b>industries.</b> Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.|$|E
5|$|By 1539, the Spanish {{advances}} in El Salvador were sufficient that Cuscatlan was considered fully pacified. In {{the immediate aftermath}} of the Spanish conquest, the conquistadors sought wealth through slaving and mining, but both of <b>these</b> <b>industries</b> soon faltered, and the colonists instead turned to agriculture. In 1545, San Salvador was moved to its current location, and on 27 September 1546, it was elevated in status to a city. El Salvador originally formed three administrative divisions, those of Sonsonate (Izalcos), San Salvador (Cuscatlan), and San Miguel. Sonsonate was an alcaldía mayor, while San Salvador, San Miguel, and Choluteca (now in Honduras) formed the alcaldía mayor of San Salvador. From 1524, all of these fell within the jurisdiction of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. In 1542, this jurisdiction was reorganised as the Real Audiencia de Guatemala, and later the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Ecclesiastically, all of El Salvador fell within the Roman Catholic diocese of Guatemala. The native inhabitants of the Izalco region of El Salvador, famed for its prodigious production of cacao, were among the most heavily exploited in the whole Spanish Empire. By the end of the 16th century, this had led to the collapse of cacao production in the province.|$|E
