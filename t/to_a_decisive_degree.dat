40|$|The project {{intended}} {{to explain the}} causes of high structural unemployment in Poland. It is generally believed that {{the high level of}} unemployment in Poland is determined <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decisive</b> <b>degree</b> by factors such as a restrictive labor code, high degree of unionization and/or the unemployment benefits system. The research provides macroeconomic and microeconomic evidence that the employment consequences of a tax wedge can be more severe for the low-skilled. Consequently, it argues that a high tax wedge can be potentially more harmful in countries abundant in this kind of labour. These results should send a strong message to policymakers, especially those in Central and Eastern Europe. The project was financed by a research grant provided by the Ministry of Education and Science, Poland and conducted by a team of CASE researchers: Marek Gora (coordinator), Mateusz Walewski, Artur Radziwill and Agnieszka Sowa. It was completed {{in the first quarter of}} 2006. tax wedge, labour market, employment, skills, New Member States, Poland...|$|E
40|$|Sources of the {{conflict}} Mankind has always connected its hopes for a better future with the progress of civilization, the development of which in people's minds has been determined by scientific and technological successes. The creation of the spiritual and the moral in man himself, however, was shunted {{more and more to}} the periphery of social thought. Many came to regard ethical values as excessive sentimentality, if not as harmful vestiges. These values in the life of society were replaced by militant atheism, pragmatism, technocratism, and other "isms. " Such views have become especially widespread in the last two centuries. This was <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decisive</b> <b>degree</b> facilitated by capitalism, which strengthened the view that the material took precedence over the spiritual and the ethical, that everything was permitted in the struggle for economic and political power. Capitalism consecrated the admissibility of realizing maximum gain at any price, >i>inter alia>/i> {{at the expense of the}} destruction of natureâthe basis of human society's existence. ...|$|E
40|$|Regions {{are exposed}} to {{intensive}} competition to provide the most attractive location conditions for firms and their employees. Therefore, regional employment development depends <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decisive</b> <b>degree</b> on the attractiveness of locations both on the supply and the demand side. This paper gives an empirical analysis {{of the impact of}} regional conditions on regional manufacturing employment growth. Based upon a firm-level panel of manufacturing establishments in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, which can be aggregated to regional panel data for forty-four counties, both the role of supply-side and demand-side conditions and a possible impact of characteristics of the regional industry structure on regional employment growth are analysed for the period from 1980 to 1999. Moreover, the paper examines whether the impact of regional conditions on regional net employment growth is driven by their impact on regional firm-level job creation and/or job destruction. Our results indicate that supply-side conditions seem to be more important for regional employment growth than demand-side factors. While lower costs of production lead to higher regional employment growth due to lower job destruction, a better endowment with human capital and a higher regional R&D intensity stimulate employment growth by higher rates of job creation. Differences in regional firm size structure, export intensity, and other industry structure aspects are affecting job creation, but not job destruction. Moreover, the analysis reveals at least the tendency that regional location factors mainly influence either job creation or job destruction, but seldom both at the same time. Regional development, employment growth, job creation, job destruction, location conditions, manufacturing...|$|E
