5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe {{in the existence of}} any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E

40|$|A {{population}} of 72 bifocal wearers was studied {{to determine the}} relationship between VDT (video display terminal) placement for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> reported musculoskeletal pain and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> The mean hours worked was 50. 4 minutes (p= 0. 003) greater for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> reported head/neck pain versus <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> and 48. 6 minutes (p= 0. 004) greater for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> reported shoulder/arm pain that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the means of monitor height, distance, or angle for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> reported pain symptoms versus <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> This study indicates that, self reported pain symptoms are correlated with hours of VDT work and that {{there appears to be a}} threshold at approximately five hours for pain symptoms among bifocal wearers.

5|$|Exercise is an {{activity}} that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not,</b> but exercising {{too late in the}} day can be activating and delay falling asleep. Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E

In <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> are ostracized.

5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended. For <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E
