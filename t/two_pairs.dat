5|$|Millipedes breathe through <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> of spiracles located ventrally on each segment {{near the}} base of the legs. Each opens into an {{internal}} pouch, and connects to a system of tracheae. The heart runs {{the entire length of the}} body, with an aorta stretching into the head. The excretory organs are <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> of malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. The digestive tract is a simple tube with <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> of salivary glands to help digest the food.|$|E

5|$|Appendages: <b>Two</b> <b>pairs</b> {{of wings}} {{normally}} present. The forewings are modified into short smooth, veinless tegmina. Hindwings are membranous and semicircular with veins radiating outwards.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue with}} wild cards {{is that they}} distort the hand frequencies. In 5-card stud, the {{stronger}} hands are less frequent than the weaker hands; i.e., no pair is most common, followed by one <b>pair,</b> <b>two</b> <b>pair,</b> three of a kind, etc. When wild cards are added, the stronger hands gain frequency while the weaker hands lose frequency. For example, if a player holds a pair and a wild card, they will always choose three of a kind rather than <b>two</b> <b>pair.</b> This causes three of a kind to be more common than <b>two</b> <b>pair.</b> But if <b>two</b> <b>pair</b> ranks above three of a kind, the <b>two</b> <b>pair</b> will become more common.|$|R

5|$|At least <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> of {{interacting}} galaxies have been observed. Arp107 {{is a pair}} of galaxies in the process of merging, located 450million light-years away. NGC3395 and NGC3396 are a spiral and irregular barred spiral galaxy, respectively, that are interacting, located 1.33degrees southwest of 46 Leonis Minoris.|$|E
5|$|Horseshoe crabs, {{which are}} aquatic, use {{external}} fertilization, {{in other words}} the sperm and ova meet outside the parents' bodies. Their trilobite-like larvae look rather like miniature adults as they have full sets of appendages and eyes, but initially they have only <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> of book-gills and gain three more pairs as they molt.|$|E
50|$|Notice {{that certain}} hands (2 pair, 3 pair, full belly) will be natural-only hands, because wild cards can make better hands. (For example, <b>two</b> <b>pair</b> using {{a wild card}} is no longer <b>two</b> <b>pair,</b> but three of a kind.) This effect boosts the probabilities of some high-scoring hands, such as straights, {{at the expense of}} lower-scoring hands.|$|R

5|$|Adult Lepidoptera have <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing {{consists of}} an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E

5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Pavo on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Omega in 1756, but omitted Psi and Xi, and labelled <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> {{of stars}} close together Mu and Phi Pavonis. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Pavonis {{as he felt}} its brightness warranted a name, but dropped Chi Pavonis due to its faintness.|$|E
5|$|Beetles have {{mouthparts}} {{like those}} of grasshoppers. The mandibles appear as large pincers {{on the front of}} some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below). <b>Two</b> <b>pairs</b> of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with those of the males enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.|$|E
