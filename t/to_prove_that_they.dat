5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects are needed, {{which is also}} the case for stochastic processes, <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> exist mathematically. There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a measurable space of functions, defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{research}} {{has estimated that}} the quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, and the United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest earthquake {{in the history of}} Massachusetts. Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and other quakes in the northeastern United States. There are a number of old faults in the region, but none of them are known still to be active. It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is not enough evidence <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are linked.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{insanity}} {{as a concept}} dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used until the late 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not be tried for any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E

40|$|Well-known {{techniques}} from homological algebra and alge-braic topology {{allow one}} {{to construct a}} cohomology theory for groups on which the action of a fixed group is given. After a brief discussion on the modules to be considered as coefficients, {{the first section of}} this paper is devoted to providing some def-initions for this cohomology theory and then <b>to</b> <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are all equivalent. The second section is mainly dedicated to summarizing certain properties of this equivariant group cohomology and to showing several relationships with the or-dinary group cohomology theory. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{next most}} senior regular officers, all colonels, {{included}} men like Vernon Sturdee, Henry Wynter and John Northcott, {{all of whom}} had joined the Army before World War I. These officers held senior commands throughout the war, but seldom active ones. Below them were a distinct group of regular officers, graduates of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, which had opened in 1911. Their number included Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Cyril Clowes, Horace Robertson, Sydney Rowell and George Alan Vasey. These officers had fought in World War I and reached the rank of major, but their promotion prospects were restricted and they remained majors for twenty years. Many left the Army to join the British or Indian armies, or the RAAF, or to return to civilian life. As a group, they had become embittered and resentful, and determined <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could lead troops in battle. Many regular officers had attended training courses or been on exchange with the British Army, which was important {{in the early years of}} the war when there was close cooperation between the two armies.|$|E

25|$|In August 2013, former High Court justice Ian Callinan {{recommended}} 23 more {{changes to}} the Victorian parole system. In particular, he recommended that a full-time parole board be established to replace the current part-time one and that prisoners should have <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were low risk reoffenders before being granted parole. An electronic database, to replace the paper filing system currently in use, was also recommended.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, Ireland {{changed its}} {{immigration}} legislation to allow immigration officers to examine (i.e. request identity documents from) travellers {{arriving in the}} state from elsewhere in the CTA and to refuse them permission to land {{if they are not}} entitled to enter. Although this is stated to apply only to people other than Irish and British citizens, both of the latter groups are effectively covered as they may be required to produce identity documents <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are entitled to the CTA arrangements.|$|E
25|$|The {{amendments}} {{extended the}} Act's special provisions for seven years. Congress chose {{seven years to}} avoid having to reconsider the special provisions during the 1980s reapportionment process. Relatedly, Congress amended the bailout provision to require covered jurisdictions seeking bailout <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not used a test or device in a discriminatory manner in the 17-year period preceding their bailout request. Congress also expanded the coverage formula by adding new dates in 1972 as triggering dates, which brought more jurisdictions into coverage. Furthermore, Congress made permanent the nationwide prohibition on tests or devices.|$|E

25|$|Some BBSes, called elite, WaReZ or pirate boards, were {{exclusively}} {{used for}} distributing cracked software, phreaking, and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to {{upload and download}} files at once. Most elite BBSes used some form of new user verification, where new users would have to apply for membership and attempt <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not a law enforcement officer or a lamer. The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and {{gave rise to the}} slang known today as leetspeak.|$|E
25|$|Through this legislation, Congress {{extended}} the special provisions for five years. Congress also expanded the coverage formula by supplementing it with 1968 trigger dates, bringing into coverage several new jurisdictions {{outside of the}} South and appeasing several Southern legislators who felt the original coverage formula unfairly singled out Southern states. Simultaneously, Congress amended the bailout provision to require covered jurisdictions seeking bailout <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not used a test or device in a discriminatory manner in the ten-year period preceding their bailout request, an increase from the original five-year period requirement. Congress also expanded the ban on using tests or devices to the entire nation.|$|E
25|$|Visual arts by {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas comprise a major category in the world art collection. Contributions include pottery, paintings, jewellery, weavings, sculptures, basketry, , and beadwork. Because too many artists were posing as Native Americans and Alaska Natives in order {{to profit from the}} cachet of Indigenous art in the United States, the U.S. passed the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, requiring artists <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe. To support the ongoing practice of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian arts and cultures in the United States, the Ford Foundation, arts advocates and American Indian tribes created an endowment seed fund and established a national Native Arts and Cultures Foundation in 2007.|$|E

The West Indies were looking to avoid the series whitewash for the second consecutive time, and posted their highest total of the series in the first innings of the third Test, with Brian Lara making 226 to pass Allan Border as the all-time highest scorer in Test cricket.|$|E
25|$|Both contestants {{write down}} the words they form, in case they select the same one. After time runs out, the host asks the contestants to declare their word lengths, {{starting}} with the contestant who chose the letters. The host then asks the discovered words, starting with the shorter declared length. However, if a contestant fails to write a word in time, they must declare this fact and state their word first to prevent cheating. The contestant with the longer word scores one point per letter, or 18 points if they have used all nine. If the words are identical or of the same length, both contestants score. In the former case, the contestants must show their written word <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are the same. Each round ends with Dictionary Corner revealing the longest words that can be formed from the available letters, aided by the production team.|$|E
25|$|Ma Bufang's army battled {{extensively}} in bloody battles against the Japanese in Henan province. Ma Bufang sent his army, {{under the command}} of his relative General Ma Biao, to fight the Japanese in Henan. The Qinghai Chinese, Salar, Chinese Muslim, Dongxiang, and Tibetan troops Ma Bufang sent fought to the death against the Imperial Japanese Army, or committed suicide refusing to be taken prisoner, when cornered by the enemy. When they defeated the Japanese, the Muslim troops slaughtered all of them except for a few prisoners sent back to Qinghai <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been victorious. In September 1940, when the Japanese launched an offensive against the Muslim Qinghai troops, the Muslims ambushed them and killed so many of them that they were forced to retreat. The Japanese could not even pick up their dead; instead, they cut an arm from their corpses for cremation to send back to Japan. The Japanese did not attempt to make a similar offensive again. Ma Biao was the eldest son of Ma Haiqing, who was the sixth younger brother of Ma Haiyan, Ma Bufang's grandfather.|$|E
