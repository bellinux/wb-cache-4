30|$|For the Dudek {{sequence}} {{shown in}} Fig.  5 a, {{the scale and}} pose of the object both change gradually. The tracking results of the front half images indicate {{that all of these}} algorithms have a certain ability of dealing with pose variation (e.g., # 125). But we also observe that CT, CSK and Stuck cannot deal with scale variation well due to the error caused by their constant <b>tracking</b> <b>box.</b> On contrary, other methods concluding the proposed SACT can adjust their tracking boxes according to the scale of the object (e.g., # 565). Furthermore, it is obviously that the <b>tracking</b> <b>box</b> of SACT is tighter and more accurate than TLD, SCM, VTS and VTD, especially when the object gets smaller in size (e.g., # 1080). The proposed SACT can deal with scale and pose variation due to the Gaussian distributed <b>tracking</b> <b>box</b> and random features selection that has been proved to handle pose variation well.|$|E
30|$|Recently, the {{compressive}} tracking (CT) method (Zhang et al. in Proceedings of European {{conference on}} computer vision, pp 864 – 877, 2012) has {{attracted much attention}} due to its high efficiency, but it cannot well deal with the scale changing objects due to its constant <b>tracking</b> <b>box.</b> To address this issue, {{in this paper we}} propose a scale adaptive CT approach, which adaptively adjusts the scale of <b>tracking</b> <b>box</b> with the size variation of the objects. Our method significantly improves CT in three aspects: Firstly, the scale of <b>tracking</b> <b>box</b> is adaptively adjusted according {{to the size of the}} objects. Secondly, in the CT method, all the compressive features are supposed independent and equal contribution to the classifier. Actually, different compressive features have different confidence coefficients. In our proposed method, the confidence coefficients of features are computed and used to achieve different contribution to the classifier. Finally, in the CT method, the learning parameter λ is constant, which will result in large tracking drift on the occasion of object occlusion or large scale appearance variation. In our proposed method, a variable learning parameter λ is adopted, which can be adjusted according to the object appearance variation rate. Extensive experiments on the CVPR 2013 tracking benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.|$|E

30|$|Aiming at {{the problem}} of poor ability of anti-occlusion in {{compressive}} tracking (CT), an improved CT algorithm based on target segmentation and feature point matching is proposed. The problem of target tracking in occlusion is solved by target segmentation. The target is captured again by local feature matching after {{the disappearance of the}} target. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm has strong robustness. However, the method still has some shortcomings. For example, when the target reappears, the scale of the target may change and the scale of the target <b>tracking</b> <b>box</b> needs to be solved after relocation.|$|E

40|$|The 6 {{cylinder}} servo-hydraulic {{loading system}} of CEDEX's <b>track</b> <b>box</b> (250 kN, 50 Hz) has been recently implemented {{with a new}} piezoelectric loading system (± 20 kN, 300 Hz) allowing the incorporation of low amplitude high frequency dynamic load time histories to the high amplitude low frequency quasi-static load time histories used {{so far in the}} CEDEX's <b>track</b> <b>box</b> to assess the inelastic long term behavior of ballast under mixed traffic in conventional and high- speed lines. This presentation will discuss the results obtained in the first long-duration test performed at CEDEX's <b>track</b> <b>box</b> using simultaneously both loading systems, to simulate the pass-by of 6000 freight vehicles (1 M of 225 kN axle loads) travelling at a speed of 120 km/h over a line with vertical irregularities corresponding to a medium quality lin 3 e level. The superstructure of the track tested at full scale consisted of E 60 rails, stiff rail pads (mayor que 450 kN/mm), B 90. 2 sleepers with USP 0. 10 N/mm and a 0. 35 m thick ballast layer of ADIF first class. A shear wave velocity of 250 m/s can be assumed for the different layers of the track sub-base. The ballast long-term settlements will be compared with those obtained in a previous long-duration quasi- static test performed in the same track, for the RIVAS [EU co-funded] project, in which no dynamic loads where considered. Also, the results provided by a high diameter cyclic triaxial cell with ballast tested in full size will be commented. Finally, the progress made at CEDEX's Geotechnical Laboratory to reproduce numerically the long term behavior of ballast will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAimIn {{recent years}} the Spanish Geotechnical Laboratory of CEDEX (Centro de Estudios y Experimentación de Obras Públicas) has {{developed}} for ADIF (Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias) a series of monitoring techniques (with different types of sensors) {{to be used in}} combination with numerical models in order to define the vertical dynamic behavior of the track structure in high-speed railways. Currently we are extending our work with the purpose of monitoring and studying also the horizontal response of the track superstructure. In this contribution we present our methods for measuring vertical and horizontal displacements and loads on the rail in high-speed railways. MethodNumerical models have been used to evaluate results from different instrumentation configurations that have been designed to measure horizontal displacements and loads on the rail. Several tests in the CEDEX real scale <b>track</b> <b>box</b> facility have also been carried out. The obtained data have been interpreted {{in the light of the}} numerical models. In this way we have been able to pick out the best configurations, which have been later put in a real high-speed rail section. Besides, we have studied relationships between simultaneous measurements of horizontal force on the rail and horizontal rail-sleeper relative displacement. A good correlation between both parameters has been observed. New tests are being carried out in the CEDEX real scale <b>track</b> <b>box</b> facility with the purpose of optimizing the developed techniques and improving the numerical model calibration. ResultsWith all these techniques we are improving the knowledge of different railway sections (sections with significant thickness of ballast, transitions slab track - ballasted track, sections with bituminous sub-ballast, etc.), and optimizing their design. New techniques for analyzing the horizontal behavior of high-speed railways have been developed based on numerical models and different tests carried out in the CEDEX real scale <b>track</b> <b>box</b> facility...|$|R
