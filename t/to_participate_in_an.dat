5|$|Black Beauty was {{recorded}} on April 10, 1970, at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, when Davis performed as the opening act for the Grateful Dead. It was also {{soon after his}} studio album Bitches Brew had been released to stores, and he played some songs from the album while leading an ensemble that featured soprano saxophonist Steve Grossman, bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and percussionist Airto Moreira. After the departure of saxophonist Wayne Shorter from the group earlier that year, Grossman was enlisted by Davis <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> April 7 recording session for his next album Jack Johnson (1971) before joining the live band.|$|E
5|$|After their crews {{arrived to}} take them back to Austria-Hungary in early 1886, both vessels were taken into the navy's {{shipyard}} in Pola, where their armament was installed {{over the course of}} 1887, to include their torpedo tubes. Both ships took part in the Barcelona Universal Exposition, which saw a squadron of ironclads and cruisers sent to represent Austria-Hungary at the opening ceremonies. Coincidentally, both ships ran aground during training operations in late June 1888. The two cruisers spent much of the early 1890s laid up, with Panther being reactivated in 1896 for a major training cruise in the Pacific Ocean from May 1896 to February 1898, and Leopard returning to service in 1897 <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> international naval demonstration off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War. Leopard went on a training cruise in the Pacific in 19001901 for naval cadets, while Panther spent those years in reserve. The latter went on a cruise to Morocco in 1902, and to eastern Africa in 1905 to arrange a trade treaty with Ethiopia before embarking on another cruise in the Pacific. In the meantime, Leopard served with the main Austro-Hungarian fleet in home waters in the mid-1900s.|$|E

5|$|On 11 January 1953, Eisenhower, now president-elect, {{announced}} that Smith {{would become an}} Under Secretary of State. Smith's appointment was confirmed by the United States Senate on 6 February and he resigned as the DCI three days later. In May 1954, Smith traveled to Europe {{in an attempt to}} convince the British <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intervention to avert French defeat in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. When this failed, he reached an agreement with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, to partition Vietnam into two separate states. In 1953, the President of Guatemala, Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán, threatened to nationalize land belonging to the United Fruit Company. Smith ordered the American ambassador in Guatemala to put a CIA plan for a Guatemalan coup into effect, which was accomplished by the following year. Smith left the State Department on 1 October 1954 and took up a position with the United Fruit Company. He also served as President and Chairman of the Board of the Associated Missile Products Company and AMF Atomics Incorporated, Vice Chairman of American Machine and Foundry (AMF) and a director of RCA and Corning Incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} poor {{performance}} and slow speed, the Zara-class cruisers {{did not see}} significant service with the fleet. They were too slow {{to be used as}} fleet scouts or flotilla leaders, and their gun armament was too weak for {{them to be able to}} protect torpedo boats from torpedo-boat destroyers. As a result, they spent most of the 1880s and 1890s , being reactivated briefly for training exercises. Sebenico returned to active service in 1893, alternating between sea duty with the training squadron and harbor service as a training ship for engine-room personnel. In 1897, Spalato became assigned to the artillery school, while Zara was recommissioned for use in the torpedo school. That year, Sebenico took part in the only significant period of fleet service, when she was sent to the island of Crete <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> international naval demonstration during Greco-Turkish War. During the blockade, Sebenico stopped and sank a Greek vessel trying to break the blockade. Sebenico served in a variety of auxiliary roles over the following five years, before joining Spalato in the artillery school in 1903; the three ships served in their training roles until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, at which point they became guard ships.|$|E
5|$|Reinforcements for 2nd Parachute Battalion {{arrived from}} Britain {{to make good}} the battalion's losses, and on 11 December it moved to Souk el Khemis, linking up {{with the rest of}} the Brigade. As Frost and his men retreated from Oudna, the Brigade had been {{informed}} it would be used in an infantry role, and on 11 December it came under the operational control of British V Corps and moved to positions near Beda; when it arrived No. 1 Commando and a French unit, 2e Bataillon 9e Regiment de Tirailleurs Algeriennes, were assigned to its command. The brigade took up defensive positions around Beda and deployed patrols around the immediate vicinity, but remained in a static role; on 21 December it was placed under the command of 78th Infantry Division <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attack towards Tunis, but heavy rain caused this operation to be cancelled. When it was decided that continuing poor weather made any further assault towards Tunis impractical, Brigadier Flavell asked that the brigade be transferred to the rear so that it could be used in an airborne role. His request was denied, however, as V Corps stated that there were insufficient troops to replace the brigade; as such it remained in its positions, defending the entire Beda area.|$|E

On the March 15 episode of SmackDown, the twins attacked The Funkadactyls (Cameron and Naomi), {{and the following}} week interfered in matches between Team Rhodes Scholars and Brodus Clay and Tensai, but were attacked by The Funkadactyls. The twins made their in-ring return facing and defeating The Funkadactyls on the March 27 episode of Main Event after interference from Cody Rhodes, and also defeated them on Raw five days later. The Bella Twins were scheduled <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> eight-person tag team match with Team Rhodes Scholars against Tons of Funk (Clay and Tensai) and The Funkadactyls at WrestleMania 29, but the match was cancelled due to time restraints, and instead took place the following night on Raw, where The Bella Twins and Team Rhodes Scollars were defeated. The twins continued their feud with The Funkadactyls throughout April, defeating them in standard tag team, and six-Diva tag team matches. In June, Nikki suffered a fractured tibia.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{arrived in}} the European Theater of Operations in early February, coming {{under the command of}} the First Allied Airborne Army, and Major General Chapman was informed that there was a possibility that the division would be required to conduct airborne operations during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge. However, the campaign in the Ardennes ended before the division could be transported there. The next chance for the 13th <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> airborne operation, and to actually see combat, was in March 1945 when the Allies had penetrated into Germany itself and reached the River Rhine. A few weeks before the division was to participate in a combat jump over the Rhine it was reorganized, after a conference by the War Department had decided that a more efficient composition for an airborne division was two Parachute Infantry Regiments and only a single Glider Infantry Regiment. Subsequently, the 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a veteran unit that had served in Italy, Southern France and the Ardennes, joined the division in early March, and the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment was combined into the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment that remained as the division's sole glider-based element. The 517th had recently fought during the Ardennes campaign, and had received a Presidential Unit Citation for its actions.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Norway {{decided to}} allow any airline from the European Economic Area to operate {{helicopter}} services in Norway from 1995. This meant that companies like Bristow Group, KLM and Maersk Air could start operation in Norway. This would be coordinated through common technical rules for helicopters through the Joint Aviation Authorities. Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service announced on 1 October 1993 {{that the two}} companies would merge from 1 January 1994. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi would be paid NOK225 million in Helikopter Service shares. The Norwegian Competition Authority stated {{they would have to}} look at the merger, since the new company would have a near-monopoly on offshore flights. However, the Ministry of Transport and Communications stated that the authority could not hinder the merger, because by the time new contracts were awarded in 1995, helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid. The ownership of Braathens Helikopter was transferred to Helikopter Service on 14 December. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi received 14% of the shares in the merged company. They were immediately sold, giving Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi a NOK170 million profit on the five-year venture. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi needed the capital <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> initial public offering of Braathens. Most of the management of Braathens Helikopter was hired at the newly established competitor United Helicopter, a joint venture between Bristow Helicopters, Leif Höegh & Co and Andreas Ugland & Sønn.|$|E

5|$|On 5 May, the British {{government}} {{continued to}} state that it would provide only logistical and technical support to UNAMSIL, but was privately exploring its options for a military deployment. The United Kingdom had a greater level of political involvement in Sierra Leone {{than in any other}} African country and, with the country's stability deteriorating, it was reluctant to see that investment wasted. In addition, an estimated 1,000 entitled personnel were in Sierra Leone, and the government feared for their safety. Academics have since suggested that the credibility of UNAMSIL and future UN peacekeeping operations would have been at stake had the mission in Sierra Leone been allowed to fail. The British Armed Forces were not as widely deployed in 2000 as they were to be later in the decade. The British Army had two brigades serving with NATO in the Balkans, and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had ongoing commitments to Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, and elsewhere, but the armed forces—particularly units threatened by proposed cuts to the defence budget—were keen <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> operation. Senior officers thus advised the government that an operation in Sierra Leone was feasible. Over the following days, there was debate within the British government as to what the aims of a military deployment to Sierra Leone would be. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advocated a full-scale intervention to assist UNAMSIL, arguing that a non-combatant evacuation operation would not be sufficient and would undermine the UN, but the MoD believed that the armed forces would be unable to sustain a larger-scale operation.|$|E
5|$|This grudge came to {{the fore}} in 906, when Samonas tricked Andronikos into refusing <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{imperial}} expedition. Afraid that he would be punished for his disobedience, Andronikos with his family and retainers fled to the fortress of Kabala, near Iconium, and thence across the border into exile in the Abbasid Caliphate. Constantine and his father ended up in Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. Leo sent a secret message to the Doukai, offering a full pardon if they returned, but again through the machinations of Samonas, the letter fell into the hands of Caliph al-Muktafi (r. 902–908), who had Andronikos confined to house arrest and forced to convert to Islam along with those who had followed him. He died there in ca. 910. Constantine however managed to escape Baghdad, and was warmly welcomed back by Leo in a ceremony in the throne room of the Chrysotriklinos. The date of his return to Byzantium is unclear, but must be placed between ca. 908 and ca. 911. Despite his father's revolt, the Doukai remained very popular due to their military successes, and prophecies apparently circulated that predicted Constantine's rise to the throne. As a result, according to Theophanes Continuatus, Leo warned the young man from trying to become emperor, but this is probably a later interpolation in view of Constantine Doukas' eventual fate. In reality, Leo seems to have trusted him, for he showered him with gifts and appointed him to senior military positions: initially he was named—apparently in succession to Eustathios Argyros —strategos of the Charsianon theme, but by 913 he had risen to the post of Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief of the army). From both positions he fought victoriously against the Arabs.|$|E
