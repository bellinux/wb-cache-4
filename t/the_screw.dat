5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E

5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. <b>The</b> <b>screw</b> delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects at the front of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools {{so that it can be}} ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{were divided}} in their reviews of The Turn of <b>the</b> <b>Screw.</b> The acting and {{tone of the}} {{production}} were generally praised, but the plot's divergences from the original story were less well received. A particular disagreement concerned the film's horrific elements; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary, while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective. The original story has been much analysed owing to its ambiguity, and critics disagreed {{about the extent to}} which the film succeeded in portraying this trait. Academic analyses found the film considerably less ambiguous than the novella. The Turn of <b>the</b> <b>Screw</b> was released on DVD on 1 March 2010 in the UK and on 28 April 2015 in North America.|$|E
5|$|Productions {{during the}} 1980s {{included}} the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that {{remained in the}} repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of <b>the</b> <b>Screw,</b> Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company {{to be invited to}} appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of <b>the</b> <b>Screw,</b> Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.|$|E

5|$|Music {{critics have}} {{frequently}} {{commented on the}} recurring theme in Britten's operas from Peter Grimes onward of the isolated individual at odds with a hostile society.

5|$|The Turn of <b>the</b> <b>Screw</b> (also {{known as}} Ghost Story: The Turn of <b>the</b> <b>Screw)</b> is a British {{television}} film based on Henry James's 1898 ghost {{story of the}} same name. Commissioned and produced by the BBC, it was first broadcast on 30 December 2009, on BBC One. The novella was adapted for the screen by Sandy Welch, and the film was directed by Tim Fywell. Although generally true to the tone and story of James's work, the film {{is set in the}} 1920s—in contrast to the original 1840s setting—and accentuates sexual elements that some theorists have identified in the novella. The film's story is told in flashbacks during consultations between the institutionalised Ann (Michelle Dockery) and Dr Fisher (Dan Stevens). Ann tells how she was hired by an aristocrat (Mark Umbers) to care for the orphans Miles (Josef Lindsay) and Flora (Eva Sayer). She is met at the children's home, Bly, by Mrs Grose (Sue Johnston), the housekeeper. Ann soon begins to see unknown figures around the manor, and seeks an explanation.|$|E
5|$|The Turn of <b>the</b> <b>Screw</b> {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in the West Country of England, beginning in August 2009. The scenes at Bly were filmed at Brympton d'Evercy, a manor house near Yeovil, Somerset. Brympton was chosen because of its similarity to Bly House, as described by James, including its extensive grounds and large lake. The railway scenes were filmed at the East Somerset Railway.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Reid, {{writing in}} 1862, {{recorded}} some statistics {{of a typical}} voyage. The ship, with a crew of 143, put out from Liverpool on 21 October 1861, carrying 544 passengers (including the English cricket team {{that was the first}} to visit Australia), a cow, 36 sheep, 140 pigs, 96 goats and 1,114 chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys. The journey to Melbourne (her ninth) occupied 64 days, during which the best day's run was 354miles and the worst 108. With favourable winds the ship travelled under sail alone, <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> being withdrawn from the water. Three passengers died en route. The captain was John Gray, a Scot, who had held the post since before the Crimean War.|$|E
30|$|The ILN is a {{titanium}} nail, and therefore, titanium blocking screws {{should be}} used. <b>The</b> <b>screws</b> {{need to be}} strong enough to resist the reamer and control the bone fragment. We use 5 -mm, fully threaded, IMN interlocking screws from any manufacturer. The position of <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> is planned preoperatively and reproduced in the operating room. <b>The</b> <b>screws</b> are inserted under fluoroscopy using free-hand technique. Blocking screws placed too close to the nail can contact the nail. This is not a problem if <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> are in <b>the</b> non-moving fragment. If <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> are in <b>the</b> moving fragment (distal femur with an antegrade nail, proximal femur with a retrograde nail, and distal tibia with antegrade nail), they should not be placed too close to the nail. A blocking screw that impinges on the nail as the nail tries to slide in the bone could produce too much resistance to lengthening and may jeopardize the distraction process. Therefore, we suggest 1 – 2  mm space between <b>the</b> blocking <b>screw</b> and <b>the</b> nail.|$|R

5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{generally}} forages in {{the branches}} and foliage of trees, in small groups of up to seven birds. Occasionally larger flocks of up to 30 individuals have been reported, and the species has been encountered in a mixed-species foraging flock with the little friarbird (Philemon citreogularis). The bulk of their diet consists of insects, including cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, bugs such as lerps, scale (Coccidae) and shield bugs (Pentatomidae), beetles such as bark beetles, chafers (subfamily Melolonthinae), click beetles (genus Xanthophaea), darkling beetles (genera Chalcopteroides and Homotrysis), leaf beetles (genus Paropsis), ladybirds of the genus Scymnus, weevils such as the pinhole borer (Platypus australis), {{and members of the}} genera Mandalotus, Polyphrades and Prypnus, as well as flies, moths, bees, ants and spiders. Birds have been reported preying on small lizards. Prey are caught mostly by sallying, although birds also probe and glean. In Kakadu National Park, birds prefer to hunt prey between the leaf bases of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> palm Pandanus spiralis.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid propellant into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell {{out of the front}} of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. Warriors Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5in (118mm) armor of Gloire, while sometimes <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.|$|E
50|$|Screws: Introduced for season 3, {{these devices}} were a {{modification}} to the static spike strips. <b>The</b> <b>screws</b> were continually rotating augers placed horizontally {{along the edges}} of the arena floor. <b>The</b> <b>Screws</b> were intended to scrape up a bot, and possibly drag it closer to the Pulverizers due to the corkscrew design. Much like <b>the</b> Spinners, <b>the</b> <b>Screws</b> had a greater effect on the lighter weight classes—although their impact on all weight classes was small. For Season 5, <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> were upgraded with biting 'teeth' to better catch onto robots. Their rotation was also modified so that instead of 'pushing' in one direction, they converged in a corner from opposite directions and created a 'V' that could damage or turn over robots.|$|R

5|$|On 26 May, Prinz Eugen rendezvoused {{with the}} supply ship Spichern to refill her nearly empty fuel tanks. She had by then only some 160 tons fuel left, {{enough for a}} day.

The same day more engine problems showed up, including trouble with the port engine turbine, the cooling of the middle engine and problems with the starboard screw, reducing her speed to maximum 28 knots. <b>The</b> <b>screw</b> problems could only be checked and repaired in a dock and thus Brest, with its large docks and repair facilities, was chosen as destination. Despite the many British warships and several convoys in the area, at least 104 units were identified on the 29th by the ship's radio crew, Prinz Eugen reached the Bay of Biscay undiscovered, and on 1 June the ship was joined by German destroyers and aircraft off the coast of France south of Brest; and escorted to Brest, which she reached late on 1 June where she immediately entered dock.|$|E
