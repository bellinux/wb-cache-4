2500|$|Conditional {{mutation}} is a mutation {{that has}} wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain [...] "permissive" [...] environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under certain [...] "restrictive" [...] conditions. For example, a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutation</b> can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences {{at a lower}} temperature (permissive condition). These mutations are non-autonomous, as their manifestation depends upon presence of certain conditions, as opposed to other mutations which appear autonomously. The permissive conditions may be temperature, certain chemicals, light or mutations {{in other parts of}} the genome. In vivo mechanisms like transcriptional switches can create conditional mutations. For instance, association of Steroid Binding Domain can create a transcriptional switch that can change the expression of a gene based on the presence of a steroid ligand. Conditional mutations have applications in research as they allow control over gene expression. This is especially useful studying diseases in adults by allowing expression after a certain period of growth, thus eliminating the deleterious effect of gene expression seen during stages of development in model organisms. DNA Recombinase systems like Cre-Lox Recombination used in association with promoters that are activated under certain conditions can generate conditional mutations. Dual Recombinase technology can be used to induce multiple conditional mutations to study the diseases which manifest as a result of simultaneous mutations in multiple genes. Certain inteins have been identified which splice only at certain permissive temperatures, leading to improper protein synthesis and thus, loss of function mutations at other temperatures. Conditional mutations may also be used in genetic studies associated with ageing, as the expression can be changed after a certain time period in the organism's lifespan.|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a mutant of Baccillus subtilis with a temperature-sensitive lesion in {{the process}} of spore germination. The <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutation</b> affects only germination and outgrowth, and the earliest defect observed is an early block of ribonucleic acid synthesis during germination at 46 C. Upon return to 35 C there is a complete repair of the impaired function, {{even in the absence of}} protein synthesis. Protein synthesis inhibition during germination of the mutant spores at 46 C has the effect of increasing the amount of ribonucleic acid made. The <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutation</b> is located near aroI...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{polymerase}} II (RNAPII) is {{a complex}} multisubunit enzyme responsible for the synthesis of pre-mRNA in eucaryotes. The enzyme is made of two large subunits associated with at least eight smaller polypeptides, {{some of which are}} common to all three RNA polymerase species. We have initiated a genetic analysis of RNAPII by introducing mutations in RPO 21, the gene encoding the largest subunit of RNAPII in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have used a yeast genomic library to isolate plasmids that can suppress a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutation</b> in RPO 21 (rpo 21 - 4), with the goal of identifying gene products that interact with the largest subunit of RNAPII. We found that increased expression of wild-type RPO 26, a single-copy, essential gene encoding a 155 -amino-acid subunit common to RNAPI, RNAPII, and RNAPIII, suppressed the rpo 21 - 4 <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutation.</b> Mutations were constructed in vitro that resulted in single amino acid changes in the carboxy-terminal portion of the RPO 26 gene product. One <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutation,</b> as well as some mutations that did not by themselves generate a phenotype, were lethal in combination with rpo 21 - 4. These results support the idea that the RPO 26 and RPO 21 gene products interact...|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{to recover}} <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> {{affecting}} genes 13 and 14 (virion proteins) in bacteriophage T 7 by analysis of amber revertants were confounded by the frequent occurrence of spontaneous <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in other genes. These incidental <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> are physically distinct from {{but may be}} functionally related to genes 13 and 14, as shown by complementation and recombination studies. The possibility that these incidental <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> represent secondary-site suppressors of the pseudonormal suppressed amber products is discussed...|$|R

Modified procedures {{were used to}} facilitate mapping <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in general, and these modifications are discussed. The mutations were assigned to specific chromosomes by chromosome loss procedures, and linkage relationships were determined subsequently by standard tetrad analysis. Four of the mutations define new loci. The fifth mutation, cdc 63 - 1, is shown to be allelic to previously known mutations in the PRT 1 gene...|$|R
40|$|<b>Temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in {{the gene}} {{encoding}} the trimeric tail spike protein of phage P 22 interfere with protein maturation at 39 degrees C. We show here that <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> at many sites block the folding pathway prior to accumulation of the partially folded protrimer intermediate. Temperature-shift experiments indicate {{that at least}} some of the mutants accumulate an earlier intermediate in the folding pathway. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that the conformation of the isolated temperature-sensitive polypeptide chains is closer to that of the unfolded chain than to that of the mature spike formed at permissive temperature. The sites of these mutations probably represent amino acid sequences that play key roles during the folding of the tail spike polypeptide chain but are not important in the mature protein...|$|R

They {{are found in}} both replicated and unreplicated portions of DNA molecules, suggesting {{that they are not}} an early stage in the initiation of DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} map locations of 62 <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> of vaccinia virus WR have been determined by marker rescue experiments, using cloned HindIII fragments of wild-type DNA. Since vaccinia virus DNA is not infectious, marker rescue {{was performed by}} infecting monolayers of cells at the nonpermissive temperature with a low multiplicity of the mutant to be rescued and transfecting with calcium phosphate-precipitated recombinant DNA. Wild-type recombinants were measured by using either a direct plaque assay technique or a two-step procedure in which the final yield of virus from the transfected cells was assayed at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Mutants that had been previously assigned to the same complementation-recombination group were rescued by the same HindIII fragment, {{with the exception of}} three mutants in one group that were rescued by either one of two adjacent fragments. A comparison between the genetic linkage map of the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in 30 mutants with their physical locations demonstrated that not only was the order of the genetic map correct but also recombination frequencies generally reflected actual physical distances...|$|R
40|$|A newly isolated, {{temperature}}-sensitive mutant of a haploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described. Its shift to nonpermissive temperature (35 C) {{resulted in an}} irreversible change to rho−, causing, within four to six generations, more than 90 % of the cells to form petite colonies. Genetic analysis revealed extrakaryotic inheritance of this <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutation.</b> Data presented indicate mutation of a gene in the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid affecting {{the maintenance of the}} rho factor...|$|E

40|$|The <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>{{mutation}}</b> in our Escherichia coli strain C 1714 {{appears to}} be in a ribosomal protein. The mutation maps at the streptomycin locus. Protein synthesis in intact cells stops immediately when the temperature is shifted from 30 to 42 °C. Analysis of polyribosome distributions after shift-up suggests that initiation of protein synthesis is defective at the high temperature. In vitro protein synthesis in extracts from C 1714 is temperature sensitive when directed by natural mRNA, but not when directed by poly U...|$|E
40|$|The hisT gene, {{one of six}} {{genes in}} which {{mutation}} causes derepression of the histidine operon in Salmonella typhimurium, is shown to code for a protein that is not essential {{for the growth of}} the bacteria. This is indicated by the characterization of particular classes of mutations in the hisT gene: amber mutations, frame-shift <b>mutations,</b> and <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> that affect repression but not growth. In addition, the class of semilethal mutations was selected for but not found...|$|R
40|$|We report results {{indicating}} that the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> white-blood (wbl) <b>mutation</b> has a novel molecular basis, involving the formation of RNA transcripts of the affected gene rather than {{the behavior of the}} polypeptide product. First, we show that the temperature-sensitive mutant phenotype of wbl correlates with (and presumably results from) a temperature-dependent effect on levels of the 2. 6 -kb polyadenylated white transcript. Second, DNA sequence analysis and other studies show that wbl is associated with the insertion into the second white intron of a previously uncharacterized retrotransposon (designated the blood transposon). We discuss the potential origins of the novel temperature-sensitive molecular phenotype of wbl and the prospects for exploiting wbl to engineer <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in other genes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> {{fall into}} two general classes: those {{generating}} thermolabile proteins; and those generating defects in protein synthesis, folding or assembly. <b>Temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> at 17 sites in the gene for the coat protein of Phage P 22 are of the latter class, preventing the productive folding of the polypeptide chain at restrictive temperature. We show here that, though the coat subunits interact intimately to form the viral shell, these <b>temperature-sensitive</b> folding (TSF) <b>mutations</b> were all recessive to wild type. The mutant polypeptide chains were not rescued {{by the presence of}} wild-type polypeptide chains. Missense substitutions in multimeric proteins frequently exhibit intragenic complementation; however, all pairs of coat protein TSF mutants tested failed to complement. The recessive phenotypes, absence of rescue and absence of intragenic complementation are all accounted for by the TSF defect, in which destabilization of a folding intermediate at restrictive temperature prevents the mutant chain from reaching the conformation required for subunit/subunit recognition. We suggest that absence of intragenic complementation should be a general property of TSF mutations in genes encoding multimeric proteins. The spectra of new loci identified by isolating second-site suppressors and synthetic lethals of temperature sensitive mutants will also differ depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. In the case of TSF mutations, where folding intermediates are defective rather than the native molecule, the spectra of other genes identified should shift from those whose products interact with the native molecule to those whose products influence the folding process...|$|R

Measurements of the differential synthesis rate of ribosomal protein, αr (ribosomal protein synthesis rate/total protein synthesis rate), indicate that ribosomal protein synthesis is regulated directly or indirectly by availability of charged tRNA, and that the synthesis of ribosomal protein, like the synthesis of rRNA, {{is subject to the}} influence of the rel gene control system...|$|E

The dnaE gene product was implicated in all stages of ϕX- 174 DNA replication. Differences were observed between a double mutant (pol A-, dnaEts) and a single mutant (pol A+, dnaEts) {{in the ability to}} synthesize parental replicating form and its subsequent replication.

40|$|The {{two large}} {{subunits}} of RNA polymerase II, RPB 1 and RPB 2, contain regions of extensive homology {{to the two}} large subunits of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. These homologous regions may represent separate protein domains with unique functions. We investigated whether suppressor genetics could provide evidence for interactions between specific segments of RPB 1 and RPB 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A plasmid shuffle method was used to screen thoroughly for mutations in RPB 2 that suppress a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutation,</b> rpb 1 - 1, which is located in region H of RPB 1. All six RPB 2 mutations that suppress rpb 1 - 1 were clustered in region I of RPB 2. The location of these mutations and the observation that they were allele specific for suppression of rpb 1 - 1 suggests an interaction between region H of RPB 1 and region I of RPB 2. A similar experiment was done to isolate and map mutations in RPB 1 that suppress a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutation,</b> rpb 2 - 2, which occurs in region I of RPB 2. These suppressor mutations were not clustered in a particular region. Thus, fine structure suppressor genetics can provide evidence for interactions between specific segments of two proteins, but {{the results of this}} type of analysis can depend on the conditional mutation to be suppressed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in {{the gene}} for the {{thermostable}} tail spike of phage P 22 interyFere with the folding and subunit association pathway at the restrictive temperature {{but not with the}} activity or stability of the protein once matured. The local sites of these mutations and the mutant amino acid substitutions have been determined by DNA sequencing. Of 11 <b>temperature-sensitive</b> folding <b>mutations,</b> 3 were replacements of glycine residues by polar residues, and three were replacements of threonine residues by residues unable to form a side-chain H-bond. There were no proline replacements. Two of the temperature-sensitive sites in which threonine residues were replaced by isoleucine residues were homologous. These sequences probably maintain the correct local folding pathway at higher temperatures. The temperature-sensitive amino acid substitutions appear to destabilize a thermolabile intermediate in the wild-type folding pathway or to increase the rate of a competing off-pathway reaction...|$|R

Only small (fourfold or less) effects on mutation rates were observed, even when selection artifacts involving suppression of gene 30 mutations by rII mutations were taken into account. The deoxyribonucleic acid ligase gene of T 4 therefore appears {{to be only a}} minor determinant of frameshift mutation rates. This result is consistent with the particular nature of frameshift mutagenesis in bacteriophage T 4...|$|R
40|$|The SRP 1 - 1 {{mutation}} is an allele-specific dominant suppressor of <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in the zinc-binding {{domain of}} the A 190 subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase I (Pol I). We found that it also suppresses <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in the zinc-binding {{domain of the}} Pol I A 135 subunit. This domain had been suggested to be in physical proximity to the A 190 zinc-binding domain. We have cloned the SRP 1 gene and determined its nucleotide sequence. The gene encodes a protein of 542 amino acids consisting of three domains: the central domain, which is composed of eight (degenerate) 42 -amino-acid contiguous tandem repeats, and the surrounding N-terminal and C-terminal domains, both of which contain clusters of acidic and basic amino acids and are very hydrophilic. The mutational alteration (P 219 Q) responsible for the suppression {{was found to be}} in the central domain. Using antibody against the SRP 1 protein, we have found that SRP 1 is mainly localized at the periphery of the nucleus, apparently more concentrated in certain regions, as suggested by a punctate pattern in immunofluorescence microscopy.

40|$|The STE 4 gene encodes {{the beta}} subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein {{that is an}} {{essential}} component of the pheromone signal transduction pathway. To identify downstream component(s) of Ste 4, we sought pseudo-revertants that restored mating competence to ste 4 mutants. The suppressor mot 2 was isolated as a recessive mutation that restored conjugational competence to a temperature-sensitive ste 4 mutant and simultaneously conferred a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. The MOT 2 gene encodes a putative zinc finger protein, the deletion of which resulted in temperature-sensitive growth, increased expression of FUS 1 in the absence of pheromones, and suppression of a deletion of the alpha-factor receptor. On the other hand, sterility resulting from deletion of STE 4 was not suppressed by the mot 2 deletion. These phenotypes are similar to those associated with <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in CDC 36 and CDC 39, which are proposed to encode general negative regulators of transcription rather than factors involved in the pheromone response pathway. Deletion of MOT 2 also caused increased transcription of unrelated genes such as GAL 7 and PHO 84. Overexpression of MOT 2 suppresses the growth defect of <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in CDC 36 and CDC 39. These observations suggest that Mot 2 functions as a general negative regulator of transcription in the same processes as Cdc 36 and Cdc 39...|$|R
40|$|<b>Temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in {{proteins}} {{produced at}} or heated to a nonpermissive temperature render the proteins defective in {{some aspect of}} their maturation into functional entities. The characterization of <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in model proteins, such as virus membrane proteins, has allowed the elucidation of critical events in the maturation of virus membranes {{as well as in}} the intracellular folding, processing, and transport of membrane proteins in general. We have used a transport-defective, temperature-sensitive mutant of Sindbis virus, ts 23, which has two amino acid changes in the envelope protein E 1, to further examine requirements placed upon the glycoproteins for their export to the plasma membrane. Pulse-chase experiments in which we utilized the transport inhibitors monensin and brefeldin A allowed us to synthesize and assemble the glycoproteins of ts 23 into export-competent heterodimers at the permissive temperature while concurrently blocking their export to the cell surface. After removal of the inhibitors and a shift to the nonpermissive temperature, we assayed for protein transport, cell-cell fusion, and infectious-particle production. Taken together, the data show that the irreversible loss of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of ts 23 can be correlated with the folding of E 1 and the formation of export-competent PE 2 -E 1 heterodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, we have found that E 1 pairs with PE 2 to form the heterodimer prior to the completion of E 1 folding...|$|R

These regions are substrates for RNase P, and they are cleaved less efficiently than, for example, tRNA precursors.

Since dnaA is organized in an operon with dnaN, and dnaA is a regulatory gene of this operon, we propose that the dnaA effect on suppression can best be explained by modulation of suppressor dnaN levels...|$|R
