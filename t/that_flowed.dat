5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|The score's {{instrumental}} element {{began with}} using a harp as its base, with a choir being used later. More instrumentation was needed, {{with a full}} orchestra eventually being incorporated. As with his work on Journey and Assassin's Creed Syndicate, he used a soloist alongside an ensemble orchestra: in this case, the solo instrument was an oboe. The oboe solos were performed by Kristin Naigus, whom Wintory had heard performing an oboe cover of a track from Journey on YouTube. Wintory worked closely with Abzûs sound designer Steve Green created a music-based story <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> alongside and worked with the visual narrative of Abzû.|$|E
5|$|About 23 Ma, in the Pleistocene, {{continental}} ice sheets {{expanded from}} the polar {{regions of the}} globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold glacial periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. Snowmelt from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will fill up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).|$|E

5|$|The Restudy {{came with}} a plan to stop the declining {{environmental}} quality, and this proposal was to be the most expensive and comprehensive ecological repair project in history. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) proposed more than 60construction projects over 30years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more Stormwater Treatment Areas to filter water <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow by raising the Tamiami Trail and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas. The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8billion, and in a bipartisan show of cooperation, CERP was voted through Congress with an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the money}} for the first phase of Device works came from Henry's {{dissolution}} of the monasteries a few years before, and the revenues <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> in from the Court of Augmentations and First Fruits and Tenths as a result. In addition, the dissolution had released ample supplies of building materials as the monastic buildings were pulled down, and much of this was recycled. Netley Castle, for example, was based on an old abbey and reused many of its stones, East Tilbury Blockhouse reused parts of St Margaret's Chantry, Calshot Castle took the lead from nearby Beaulieu Abbey, East and West Cowes castles stone from Beaulieu and Quarr, and Sandwich had the stone from the local Carmelite friary. Milton Blockhouse was constructed on land that had recently been confiscated from Milton Chantry. By {{the second phase of the}} programme, however, most {{of the money}} from the dissolution had been spent, and Henry instead had to borrow funds; government officials noted that at least £100,000 was needed for the work.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the 35th Infantry {{took up a}} hill {{position}} {{northwest of}} Hamch'ang and south of Mun'gyong {{on the south side}} of a stream <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> past Sangju to the Naktong. On the north side of the stream an ROK battalion held the front line. Brigadier General Vennard Wilson, the 25th's Assistant Division Commander, ordered F Company of the battalion to be inserted in the center of the ROK line north of the stream, and this was done over the strong protests of the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins. Wilson thought the American troops would strengthen the ROK defense but Wilkins did not want the untried company to be dependent on ROK stability in its first engagement. Behind the ROK and F Company positions the ground rose to another hill within small arms range. Heavy rains had swollen the stream behind the ROK and F Company positions to a torrent that was rolling large boulders along its channel. In the meantime, the ROK 2nd Battalion, 17th Regiment, ambushed a battalion of North Korean troops near Tongkwanri, forcing it to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|The initial Australian dispositions around Isurava saw the {{depleted}} 39th {{spread out}} in five entrenched company areas astride the track in between {{the northern and southern}} creeks <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> into Eora Creek. Having left most of their entrenching equipment behind during the withdrawal from Deniki, the troops from the 39th had to dig-in with whatever they had at hand including steel helmets and bayonets. Their positions were constructed amidst an area of long grass, behind an abandoned garden, which offered good observation of the track heading towards Deniki. The 53rd Infantry Battalion was positioned further back at Alola, co-located with Potts' headquarters. A forward observation post had also been established on the Isurava ridgeline. The Australians maintained a patrol presence forward of their occupied areas. Throughout 24 and 25 August, as the Japanese force began pressing forward, patrols from the 53rd Infantry Battalion clashed with groups of Japanese in front of Isurava, {{and on the other side}} of Eora Creek around Missima. Potts, realising that Horii had launched a major attack, decided to deploy the 2/14th under Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Key to Isurava, using the 39th to screen their movement. The 2/16th, under Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro, was bought forward to Alola, where it would be held in reserve. By the time the 2/14th Battalion had deployed, the Japanese were able to field a force of between 3,000 and 5,000.|$|E

About 80% of Managua's commercial buildings were destroyed. President Anastasio Somoza Debayle's National Guard embezzled {{much of the}} international aid <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> into the country to assist in reconstruction, and several parts of downtown Managua were never rebuilt.

25|$|Hager Mountain {{is a large}} silicic lava dome {{structure}} that was formed approximately 5.9million years ago. The mountain's primary rock is from the Hayes Butte Basalt flows. The eruptions that produced these flows came from a fault zone running southeast–northwest between Hager Mountain and Hayes Butte. The eruptions that created Hager Mountain released lava <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> down {{the slopes of the}} volcanic dome onto plains around the mountain. The Hayes Butte Basalt overlays the Fort Rock Formation and earlier Picture Rock Basalt layers. All of these lava flows occurred during the Pliocene epoch.

Tanganyika Holdings had employed Maureen Muggeridge and formed a joint venture called Ashton Joint Venture, after minerals which indicated the presence of diamonds were found in 1976. In 1979, Muggeridge discovered diamond samples in the floodplain of a small creek <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> in Lake Argyle. She soon traced the source of the diamonds to the headwaters of Smoke Creek. On 2 October 1979, the Argyle pipe was discovered.|$|E

25|$|The {{territory}} {{was formed}} by mostly basaltic magma within the last 100,000 years. Fissural eruptions around the area of Pico da Bagacina produced fluid lava <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> to {{the coast of the}} island. The accumulation of successive flows produced a planar landscape with a surface covered in clinker geology. This layer was a combination of lightly dense lapilli and pyroclastic deposits that originated from the small cones in the immediate vicinity of the parish, namely Pico da Urze and Pico da Boa Hora. As a consequence of the genesis, the soils are exclusively arid or semi-arid regosols, with a predominance of sedimentary basalts resulting in the easy degradation of clinker topography, known more commonly as biscoitos (in the Azores) or breccia.|$|E
25|$|In 1856 Bishop Hale, an {{independently}} wealthy clergyman, purchased five allotments on St George's Terrace {{in order}} to build a residence for himself and his family. Bishop Hale favoured this location because of the large grounds and natural spring <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> all year round, and that there was a house and stables. The land was purchased from Edward Hamersley and Alfred Hillman Senior (Assistant Surveyor General). In 1858, Bishop Hale arranged for the construction of his residence by ticket-of-leave men. In December that year, Bishop Hale and his family travelled to England, not returning until April 1860. Bishop’s House was completed, at Bishop Hale's personal expense, for a cost £2,486, whilst the family was away overseas. The existing house on the site was utilised as a kitchen, and the stables as laundry and kitchen outhouses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} two decades of the century, Jews from Eastern Europe arrived in the South End. While their synagogues and other {{cultural}} institutions were located in other neighborhoods to the north, many were tradesmen who established shops on South Pearl and other streets. Development that may have been a response to that influx took place primarily to the south and west of the established blocks, in the blocks between Second and Third that had been laid out when they were still Groesbeckville, and the blocks west of Elizabeth Street. As had happened elsewhere in the city when similar areas along the bluff overlooking the river had been developed, the ravines were filled in and the streams <b>that</b> <b>flowed</b> through them diverted or buried in tunnels, a move which lessened the flooding closer to the river.|$|E
