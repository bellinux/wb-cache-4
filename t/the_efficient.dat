In this paper we show why free access to commons by <b>the</b> most <b>efficient</b> agents does not guarantee the maximization of social welfare. We also show under which conditions it is possible to maximize social welfare avoiding the exclusion of <b>the</b> least <b>efficient</b> agents. Finally, we analyze how asymmetric information distorts first-best allocation, redistributing the resource in favor of <b>the</b> most <b>efficient</b> agents, and why those with extreme types (the most and <b>the</b> least <b>efficient</b> agents) are <b>the</b> ones with less incentive to cooperate...|$|R
5|$|In {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed {{by the government and}} industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s.

Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.|$|E
5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis.

5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data.

One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on <b>the</b> <b>efficient</b> frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

5|$|The 1844 Railway act of England {{compelled}} {{at least}} one train to a station every day with the third class fares priced at a penny a mile.
