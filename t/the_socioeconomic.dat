5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing.

5|$|Social conditions, the {{standard}} of living and the self-confidence of the workers gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while {{the standard}} of living rose among the common people, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of <b>the</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' responses and the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E

5|$|The {{early history}} of the suburb and {{surrounding}} parts of southern Dunedin {{has been the subject}} of a major ongoing archaeological and historical research project into early Dunedin by the University of Otago, known simply as The Caversham Project. Over the course of the last 30years, a database has been compiled of life in early South Dunedin, focussing on the borough of Caversham.

5|$|During the 5th and 6th century many Sogdians took up {{residence}} in the Hexi Corridor where they retained autonomy in terms of governance and had a designated official administrator known as a sabao, which suggests their importance to <b>the</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> structure of China. The Sogdian influence on trade in China is also made apparent by a Chinese document which lists taxes paid on caravan trade in the Turpan region and shows that twenty-nine out of the thirty-five commercial transactions involved Sogdian merchants, and in thirteen of those cases both the buyer and the seller were Sogdian. Trade goods brought to China included grapes, alfalfa, and Sassanian silverware, as well as glass containers, Mediterranean coral, brass Buddhist images, Roman wool cloth, and Baltic amber. These were exchanged for Chinese paper, copper, and silk. In the 7th century the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang noted with approval that Sogdian boys were taught {{to read and write}} at the age of five, though their skill was turned to trade, disappointing the scholarly Xuanzang. He also recorded the Sogdians working in other capacities such as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created in}} November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. All {{of the people in}} the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in Arlington, Vermont, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The Post published Freedom from Want with a corresponding essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Despite many who endured sociopolitical hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring <b>the</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the newly}} formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English {{initiatives}} combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy {{paved the way for}} the establishment of the British Empire. Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in <b>the</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development. The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain. In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway—the Stockton and Darlington Railway—opened to the public.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} among the Mahishya population of Chakpota village in Southern West Bengal to determine the relationship between socio-economic conditions and certain haematological parameters, haemoglobin level and haemotocrit. Households were divided into high, middle and low <b>socioeconomic</b> groups on <b>the</b> basis of per capita income per year. The demographic {{data were collected from}} all the 255 households comprising 404 adult males and 383 adult females (above 20 years of age). Higher values in the parameters were observed among the males in all <b>the</b> three <b>socioeconomic</b> sub-groups. Significant differences in haemoglobin level and haemotocrit of males were observed between <b>the</b> three <b>socioeconomic</b> groups (p = <. 01). On the contrary, insignificant differences in haemoglobin level and haemocrit were observed between <b>the</b> three <b>socioeconomic</b> groups among <b>the</b> females.
