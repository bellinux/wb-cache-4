5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, <b>the</b> <b>priority</b> of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but <b>the</b> <b>priority</b> of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E

40|$|Former {{studies have}} focused on issue {{prioritization}} in parliaments and compared <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> of both political elites and citizens to measure their level of responsiveness to the general public.

This paper aims to contribute to the comparative agendas' politics literature by testing issue-congruency under competitive authoritarian regimes. Analyzing more than 10, 000 legislative texts, mainly parliamentary draft bills and questions, and matching them with public opinion data on citizen priorities in Morocco, we found a substantial level of issue congruence between <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> of <b>the</b> elites and citizens. The level of congruency is particularly higher for parliamentary questions compared to draft bills. The results also demonstrate that contrary to the earlier theories on clientelism and citizen-politician linkages in the Middle East, <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> of <b>the</b> major political parties largely reflect <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> of <b>the</b> general public rather than <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> of <b>the</b> party supporters...|$|R

5|$|Lutetium was {{independently}} {{discovered in}} 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James.
