5|$|Coastal {{scenes were}} filmed at Bass Rock and near Trancas, while other scenes were filmed near Signal Hill. The film's climax was filmed {{around the area}} of the Union Station train depot. The large gas tank, which stood over 300 feet tall, was made {{available}} to the cast and crew by the Southern California Gas Company. Filming at this location proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge,</b> as the cast and crew had trouble communicating with each other, with Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure.|$|E
5|$|Development of Virtue's Last Reward {{began on}} the Nintendo DS, but this changed early in {{production}} following {{the announcement of the}} Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. The development team at Chunsoft wanted to utilize the three-dimensional (3D) features of the newer systems, and changed production of the game to the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. As neither system had been released yet, the team was under the assumption that the 3D features would require 3D character models. Uchikoshi later remarked that designing 3D character models proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for Chunsoft due to company's inexperience with 3D effects.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate for rail traffic, it proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was dangerous for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{government}} {{efforts to}} promote Mandarin through the Speak Mandarin Campaign, the propagation of Mandarin and Chinese culture amongst Chinese Singaporeans continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> because Mandarin faces stiff competition from the strong presence of English. However, this situation is not only limited to Mandarin, but also Malay and Tamil, where rising statistics show that English is progressively taking over as home language of Singaporeans.|$|E

Taylor returned to the show in 1992, apologized to Winfrey {{and told her that}} she was in excruciating back and hip pain at the time.|$|E
25|$|The film took {{almost a}} decade to get into {{production}} as most studios rejected the script, which was eventually picked up by Relativity Media for $6 million. The film was shot {{over a period of}} several years, as casting also proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for the producers. Some actors, including George Clooney, declined to take part, while others, such as Richard Gere, attempted to get out of the project.|$|E
25|$|Casting the Mertzes, as {{they were}} now called (the surname taken from a doctor that Lucy {{scriptwriter}} Madelyn Pugh knew {{as a child in}} Indianapolis), proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge.</b> Ball had initially wanted character actor James Gleason, with whom she appeared in Columbia Pictures film Miss Grant Takes Richmond (1949), to play Fred Mertz. However, Gleason wanted nearly $3,500 per episode to play the role, a price that was far too high to sustain.|$|E

The financial performance for FY 2011 continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> with an after-tax loss of PKR 26.767 billion. This was preceded by six consecutive loss-making years dating back to 2005. The airline did report a reduction of post-tax losses of 83% in 2009 (compared to 2008) based on a reduction in fuel cost, comparatively stable exchange rate for the Pakistan Rupee and higher revenues. But in 2010 & 2011, losses again rose sharply compared to the previous years.|$|E
25|$|The Hoysala {{architecture}} {{style is}} {{an offshoot of}} the Western Chalukya style, which was popular in the 10th and 11th centuries. It is distinctively Dravidian, and owing to its unique features, Hoysala architecture qualifies as an independent style. The Hoysala sculpture in all its richness is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to photography. The artistry of the Hoysalas in stone has been compared to the finesse of an ivory worker or a goldsmith. The abundance of jewellery worn by the sculpted figures and the variety of hairstyles and headdresses depicted give a fair idea of the lifestyles of the Hoysala times.|$|E

25|$|Luxembourg’s {{small size}} {{no longer seemed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to the {{existence}} of the country, and the creation of the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg (1998) and of the University of Luxembourg (2003) was evidence of the continuing desire to become a “real” nation. The decision in 1985 to declare Lëtzebuergesch (Luxembourgish) the national language was also a step in the affirmation of the country’s independence. In fact, the linguistic situation in Luxembourg was characterised by trilingualism: Lëtzebuergesch was the spoken vernacular language, German the written language, in which Luxembourgers were most fluent, and French the language of official letters and law.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{technology}} {{continued to}} present difficulties: in particular, animating hair turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge.</b> Senior software engineer Kelly Ward {{spent six years}} writing programs to make it move the way they wanted. As late as January 2010, the directors were still not sure if the Rapunzel character's length of hair was going to work. These problems were finally solved in March: An improved version of a hair simulation program named Dynamic Wires, originally developed for Bolt, was eventually used. To make hair float believably in water, and to surmount other similar challenges, discrete differential geometry was used to produce the desired effects, freeing the animators from executing these specific tasks directly, which would have taken days instead of minutes.|$|E
25|$|The Bangladesh Cricket Board {{founded the}} six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament {{to be held}} in February that year. An auction was held for teams to buy players, and Mortaza was bought by the Dhaka Gladiators for $45,000. On his return to {{competitive}} cricket Mortaza was made captain of Dhaka Gladiators. Before the tournament had started, he reported to have been approached with a request to participate in spot-fixing. Led by Mortaza, who took ten wickets from eleven matches, Dhaka won the BPL's inaugural season. Shortly after the tournament concluded, Bangladesh hosted the 2012 Asia Cup; after losing to Pakistan the previous December, five new players called into Bangladesh's 15-man squad, including Mortaza who was making his come back to the national side after injury. When the BCB announced its central contracts for 2012 in March, Mortaza retained his top level contract. Against expectations Bangladesh progressed to the cup final against Pakistan; it was just the second time Bangladesh had reached the final of a tournament. Though he had played in the BPL, bowling ten overs in the ODIs as opposed to just four per match proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for Mortaza. Though in the penultimate game he struggled he regained full fitness to bowl in the final, and finished as Bangladesh's leading seamer with six wickets from four matches.|$|E

30|$|Continued {{progress}} in denitrification research will be enhanced if multiple approaches are applied at well-studied research sites (Davidson & Seitzinger 2006).
