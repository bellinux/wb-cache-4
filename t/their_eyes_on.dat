As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E

The broadcaster {{has no plans to}} join the EBU at the moment. This was confirmed again on 28 July 2014 {{in the run-up to the}} Eurovision Song Contest 2015 in Austria. 1FLTV did however state their interest in participating in the Eurovision Song Contest, but that they have to evaluate the costs of EBU membership, a necessary prelude to participation. 1FLTV confirmed that the nation will not be able to make its début in 2016, due to lack of funds to join the EBU. On 21 September 2016, 1FLTV announced that they would not be able to debut to the contest in 2017, but that they would set <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a future participation once they overcome their financial hurdles. Yet again, on the 1 September 2017 they also announced they wouldn't debut at the 2018 contest in Lisbon.|$|E

25|$|According to fMRI {{studies of}} the brain and {{behavioral}} observations, visual attention can be moved independently of moving eye position. Studies have had participants fixate <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a central point and measured brain activity as stimuli were presented outside the visual fixation point. fMRI findings show changes in brain activity correlated with the shift in spatial attention to the various stimuli. Behavioral studies have also shown that when a person knows where a stimulus is likely to appear, their attention can shift to it more rapidly and process it better.|$|E
25|$|Legitimate {{concerns}} about water supply were exploited to gain backing {{for a huge}} engineering and legal effort to bring more water {{to the city and}} allow more development. The city fathers had <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the Owens River, about 250 miles (400km) northeast of Los Angeles in Inyo County, near the Nevada state line. It was a permanent stream of fresh water fed by the melted snows of the eastern Sierra Nevada. It flowed through the Owens River Valley before emptying into the shallow, saline Owens Lake, where it evaporated.|$|E
25|$|The Suns {{entered the}} 2006–07 season with <b>their</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>on</b> the Prize objective, aiming {{to win the}} first {{championship}} in franchise history. From November 20-December 22, the Suns posted a 15-game win streak, followed almost immediately with a 17-game win streak from December 29-January 28. On March 14, the 49-14 Suns met the 52-10 Dallas Mavericks in a marquee matchup with big implications: both teams were fighting for the top seed in the Western conference and Nash was going for his third consecutive MVP award against Dirk Nowitzki. Though the Suns won the game in double overtime, the Mavericks would finish with the West's top seed at 67-15, and Dirk would narrowly win the MVP award ahead of Nash.|$|E

25|$|On 14 July, {{the insurgents}} set <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the large weapons and {{ammunition}} cache inside the Bastille fortress, {{which was also}} perceived to be a symbol of royal power. After several hours of combat, the prison fell that afternoon. Despite ordering a ceasefire, which prevented a mutual massacre, Governor Marquis Bernard-René de Launay was beaten, stabbed and decapitated; his head was placed on a pike and paraded about the city. Although the fortress had held only seven prisoners (four forgers, two noblemen kept for immoral behaviour, and a murder suspect) the Bastille served as a potent symbol of everything hated under the Ancien Régime. Returning to the Hôtel de Ville (city hall), the mob accused the prévôt des marchands (roughly, mayor) Jacques de Flesselles of treachery and butchered him.|$|E
25|$|Richards {{was born}} in Durban, Natal Province, Union of South Africa and {{attended}} Clifton Preparatory School and the Durban High School and for many years played club cricket for DHS Old Boys' Club. He played in the Natal Nuffield week side from 1961 to 1964, and for South African schools from 1962 to 1964, scoring a century against the Western Province first class team. The national selectors had <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> him early, and he played for a South African Colts XI against the touring MCC side in 1964–65, scoring 63, {{and later in the}} tour for an Invitation XI. When the Australians toured in 1966–67, he scored 107 in 160 minutes for a strong South African XI against them before the First Test, but despite several failures by the top-order batsmen in the Test series, he was unable to break into the national side.|$|E

[...] However, he said her eleventh album Aphrodite [...] "rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems" [...] and [...] "the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit." [...] Tim Sendra from Allmusic stated, [...] "The various producers keep <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the dancefloor throughout, crafting shiny and sleek tracks that sound custom-built to blast out of huge speaker columns" [...] and found Aphrodite [...] "One of her best, in fact." ...|$|E

500|$|Detailing and {{protesting the}} ugliness {{of life is}} a common theme {{throughout}} the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937). Reflecting on The Disasters of War, biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth [...] "be seen and... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it.... And the blind in spirit stay <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say." [...] The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life—probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the Eighty Years' War with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like Hans Baldung. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by Jacques Callot known as Les Grandes Misères de la guerre (1633), which record the devastating impact on Lorraine of LouisXIII's troops during the Thirty Years' War.|$|E
500|$|Along with Kaneko, series co-creator Kouji Okada {{produced}} the title. The game {{was directed by}} Katsura Hashino, his first time in such a position within the Megami Tensei series. While the option of making a direct sequel to Shin Megami Tensei II was considered, Kaneko wanted {{to return to the}} contemporary setting of the original Shin Megami Tensei as opposed to the science fiction aesthetic of its sequel. As it was felt that the game was more than just the third numeric installment, a subtitle was added. Before the final subtitle, [...] "Nocturne" [...] was added, other subtitles were considered. An early subtitle was Vortex. The game uses a third-person camera perspective rather than the first-person dungeon crawling of earlier installments. One of the reasons for this change was that the developers wanted to focus on the protagonist, who would stand out for being a half-demon. Another factor was many reports of people suffering from a condition similar to car sickness called [...] "3D sickness" [...] with first person shooters in Japan: the developers wanted players to have something to focus <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on.</b> Despite setting the game in contemporary Tokyo, the team chose a cel-shaded art style as they wanted their game to stand out and enable Kaneko to bring the game {{as close as possible to}} his original vision.|$|E
500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E

Cats will, however, [...] "squint" [...] their eyes, usually as a form of communication expressing affection and ease around another cat or human.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{instructions}} to the coastwatchers emphasised concealment, with emergency radios {{set up in the}} scrub near each station. [...] As well as their primary task of keeping <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the sea for ships, the men (no women were involved) carried out surveys, took weather measurements, and made observations on the wildlife of the islands. [...] Each station made radio contact daily with New Zealand, at staggered times to minimise the risk of their presence becoming known. [...] The men were relieved yearly, though a few repeated their tours of duty; two of them spent three years on the islands, with the naturalist J.H. Sorensen spending four years on Campbell Island.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 1 {{begins with}} a promise by the narrator to engage the reader with an {{analysis}} of contemporary thought, [...] "but the grand scheme degenerates immediately into nonsensical and ignorant chatter."

[...] According to Erdman, [...] "the contrast between appearance and reality in the realm of communication lies at the centre of Blake's satiric method."

[...] During the campaign, Carlson made repeated statements of the form [...] "When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs." [...] Further discussion ensued when the Drudge Report and a few other media outlets ran an unflattering Associated Press photograph of Clinton looking old and tired on the wintry Iowa campaign trail; Limbaugh sympathized with the plight of American women in an appearance-obsessed culture, then asked, [...] "Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a daily basis?" ...|$|E
2500|$|During their {{climb back}} to Blanket Hill, several guardsmen stopped and half-turned to keep <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the {{students}} in the Prentice Hall parking lot. At 12:24p.m., according to eyewitnesses, a sergeant named Myron Pryor turned and began firing at the crowd of students with his [...]45 pistol. A number of guardsmen nearest the students also turned and fired their rifles at the students. In all, at least 29 of the 77 guardsmen claimed to have fired their weapons, using an estimate of 67 rounds of ammunition. The shooting was determined to have lasted only 13 seconds, although John Kifner reported in The New York Times that [...] "it appeared to go on, as a solid volley, for perhaps a full minute or a little longer." [...] The question of why the shots were fired remains widely debated.|$|E
2500|$|The Allegory of the Cave (often said by {{scholars}} to represent Plato's own epistemology and metaphysics) is intimately connected to his political ideology (often said to also be Plato's own), that {{only people who}} have {{climbed out of the}} cave and cast <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a vision of goodness are fit to rule. Socrates claims that the enlightened men of society must be forced from their divine contemplations and be compelled to run the city according to their lofty insights. Thus is born the idea of the [...] "philosopher-king", the wise person who accepts the power thrust upon him by the people who are wise enough to choose a good master. This is the main thesis of Socrates in the Republic, that the most wisdom the masses can muster is the wise choice of a ruler.|$|E
