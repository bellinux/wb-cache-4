It is easier for a Lebanese Identity Card holder to also take loan from the bank whether you work in an identifiable institution or not. This is because their identity can be easily verified and <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> <b>are</b> confident {{that they can be}} traced in the event of loan default based on their PIN or biometric information stored on the Lebanese Identity Card.|$|E
25|$|Flooding {{along the}} Brisbane River has the {{potential}} to be devastating, as documented in 1974 and 2011. For much of the river's length its banks are relatively high, but topped by a broad plain. The river's meandering course means that flood waters from upstream cannot be quickly discharged into Moreton Bay. Thus higher than normal flows cause river levels to rise rapidly and once the top of <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> <b>are</b> breached the floodwaters can spread over wide areas of the city.|$|E
25|$|The Polish banking {{sector is}} the largest in East Central/Eastern European region, with 32.3 {{branches}} per 100,000 adults. <b>The</b> <b>banks</b> <b>are</b> {{the largest and most}} developed sector of the country's financial markets. They are regulated by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority. During the transformation to a market-oriented economy, the government privatized several banks, recapitalized the rest, and introduced legal reforms that made the sector more competitive. This has attracted a significant number of strategic foreign investors (ICFI). Poland's banking sector has approximately 5 national banks, a network of nearly 600 cooperative banks and 18 branches of foreign-owned banks. In addition, foreign investors have controlling stakes in nearly 40 commercial banks, which make up 68% of the banking capital.|$|E

There were three towers built along the walls during the medieval period, two of which have left their mark in the earth banks; the location of the third is uncertain.|$|E
500|$|Maiden Castle has no {{artificial}} defences on {{its northern}} and western sides {{because of the}} naturally steep slope of the hill, {{but there are two}} artificial banks, [...] apart. <b>The</b> <b>banks</b> <b>are</b> similar in dimension, both are [...] wide, and because the ground they are on slopes, the exterior side of each bank is higher than the side {{on the inside of the}} fort; they are [...] high on the inside of the fort and [...] on the exterior face. There is no evidence that Maiden Castle was protected by a ditch along with the banks. The main entrance is on the east side of the fort where the inner bank turns in towards the fort, and while there is a gap in the outer rampart it does not turn in. There may also be two other entrances to the site where the banks meet the cliffs to the north and south; the outer ditch runs inwards at both ends, possibly indicating an in-turned entrance abutting the edge of the cliff similar to the entrance at the Helsby hill fort also in Cheshire or perhaps an attempt to make the banks run flush to the cliff-edge to ensure there were no gaps in the site's defences.|$|E

The Federal Government talks about this and the banks also talk about it. But I want to state here that the banks have not been helpful. They always say money is available. Where is the money? There is no small scale industrialist who walks into a bank and gets a loan. It is difficult for SMEs to get loans from banks because they always demand for collaterals. The collateral they ask for is over and above the worth of the loan. So, <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> <b>are</b> not keen on lending to small scale businesses at all. They say this sub-sector is risk infested. They may claim that they have given some amount of money as loans to the SMEs; but you will find out that this is not true. For instance, what can a loan that is given to 2,000 people in a nation of about 167 million people do? The last statistics conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that there were about 17 million small scale industrialists in Nigeria and you are talking about empowering 2,000 people with loans. What is that? So, <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> <b>are</b> paying lip service to funding SMEs." ...|$|E

[...] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying [...] "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> <b>are</b> playing the equivalent of no-limit poker." [...] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that [...] "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars.
