The terminal and function sets contain primitive operations that are common in many previously proposed man-made designs.

The performance of the evolved operators has been confirmed experimentally using training and <b>testing</b> <b>sequences</b> of progressively transformed images.

40|$|Abstract. The {{testing of}} a {{state-based}} system may involve the applica-tion {{of a number}} of adaptive <b>test</b> <b>sequences.</b> Where the implementation under test (IUT) is deterministic, the response of the IUT to some adap-tive <b>test</b> <b>sequence</b> γ 1 may be capable of determining the response of the IUT to some other adaptive <b>test</b> <b>sequence</b> γ 2. Thus, the expected cost of applying a set of adaptive <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> depends upon the order in which they are applied. This paper explores properties of adaptive <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> and the problem of finding an order of application, of the el-ements from some set of adaptive <b>test</b> <b>sequences,</b> that minimises the expected cost of testing. ...|$|R

40|$|Testing complex systems, {{such as the}} ASML TWINSCAN lithographic machine, is {{expensive}} and time consuming. In a previous work, a <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> method to calculate time-optimal <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> has been developed. Because complex systems are composed of several subsystems, which are again composed of several modules, there exists a need to hierarchically model <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> problems. Such a hierarchical <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> problem consists of a high-level model that describes a <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> problem at the system level, and one or more low-level models that describe the <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> problems at the subsystem or module level. The tests at the system level correspond to the solutions of low-level problems. This paper describes a hierarchical <b>test</b> <b>sequencing</b> model and proposes two algorithms to compute an optimal <b>test</b> <b>sequence.</b> The benefits of hierarchically modeling a problem are less computational effort and less modeling effort, because not all relations are needed. This is illustrated by a small example. The industrial relevance of this method is illustrated on a case study related to a manufacturing testing phase of a lithographic machine...|$|R

As a consequence, new testing techniques must be developed. We present, in this paper, a state-based unit testing technique for aspect-oriented programs and associated tool (AJUnit). The technique focuses on the integration of one or several aspects to a class. The objective {{is to ensure that}} the integration is done without affecting the original behavior of the class. AJUnit, based on the model of JUnit, generates <b>testing</b> <b>sequences</b> covering an aspect(s) -class block of code. It also supports the execution and verification of the generated sequences.

40|$|Abstract-Protocol {{testing for}} the purpose of {{certifying}} the imple-mentation’s adherence to the protocol specification can be done with a test architecture consisting of remote tester and local responder proc-esses generating specific input stimuli, called <b>test</b> <b>sequences,</b> and observing the output produced by the implementation under test. It is possible to adapt <b>test</b> <b>sequence</b> generation techniques for finite state machines, such as transition tour, characterization, and checking sequence methods, to generate <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> for protocols specified as incomplete finite state machines. For certain <b>test</b> <b>sequences,</b> the tester or responder processes are forced to consider the timing of an interaction in which they have not taken part; these <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> are called nonsynchronizahle.

40|$|Abstract—Functional <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> {{are often}} used in {{manufacturing}} testing to target defects that are not detected by structural test. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the quality of functional <b>test</b> <b>sequences.</b> However, it is very time-consuming to evaluate the quality of functional <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> by gate-level fault simulation. Therefore, we propose output deviations as a metric to grade functional <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> at the register transfer (RT) level without explicit fault simulation. Experimental results for the open-source Parwan processor and the Scheduler module of the Illinois Verilog Model (IVM) show that the deviations metric is computationally efficient and it correlates well with gate-level coverage for stuck-at, transition-delay, and bridging faults. Results also show that functional <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> that are reordered based on output deviations provide steeper gate-level fault coverage ramp-up compared to other ordering methods.

40|$|Abstract Recently various {{real-time}} {{communication protocols}} have been proposed. In this paper, first, we propose a timed I/O automaton model {{so that we}} can simply specify such real-time protocols. The proposed model can handle not only time but also data values. Then, we propose a conformance testing method for the model. In order to trace a <b>test</b> <b>sequence</b> (I/O sequence) on the timed I/O automaton model, we need to execute each I/O action in the <b>test</b> <b>sequence</b> at an adequate execution timing which satisfies all timing constraints in the <b>test</b> <b>sequence.</b> However, since outputs are given from IUTs and uncontrollable, we cannot designate their output timing in advance. Also their output timing affects the executable timing for the succeeding I/O actions in the <b>test</b> <b>sequence.</b> Therefore, in general, the executable timing of each input action in a <b>test</b> <b>sequence</b> can be specified by a function of the execution time of the preceding I/O actions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to decide efficiently whether a given <b>test</b> <b>sequence</b> is executable.

40|$|SUMMARY This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} specification-based testing of concurrent programs with representative <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> generated from Statecharts. Representative <b>test</b> <b>sequences</b> are a subset of all possible interleavings of concurrent events that define the behaviors of a concurrent program. Because a program’s correctness may be determined by checking whether a program implemented all behaviors in its specification or not, the program {{can be regarded as}} being correct if it can supply an alternative execution that has the same effects as the program’s behavior with each representative <b>test</b> <b>sequence.</b> Based on this observation, we employ each representative <b>test</b> <b>sequence</b> as a seed to generate an automaton that accepts its equivalent sequences to reveal the same behavior. In order to effectively test a concurrent program, the automaton such generated accepts all sequences equivalent to the representative <b>test</b> <b>sequence</b> and it is used to control test execution. This paper describes an automated process of generating automata from a Statecharts specification and shows how the proposed approach works on Statecharts specifications through some examples. key words: statecharts, concurrent program, specification-based <b>testing,</b> <b>test</b> <b>sequence,</b> equivalent class 1...|$|R
