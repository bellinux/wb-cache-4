In the song's lyrics Rihanna yearns for her lover's attention, {{which makes}} her feel like the only girl in the world. The singer [...] "pours her heart out" [...] in the chorus: [...] "Want you <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like I'm the only girl in the world/ Like I'm {{the only one that}} you'll ever love/ Like I'm the only one who knows your heart/ Only girl in the world." [...] According to Digital Spy writer Nick Levine, the chorus [...] "thumps like a rabbit having an epileptic fit." [...] Rihanna sings suggestively, [...] "Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'/ You can come inside/ And when you enter, you ain't leavin'/ Be my {{prisoner}} for the night." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC compared the song's message to that of the German fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel"; Rihanna is not willing to throw her hair out of the castle for just any man to come and satisfy her, [...] "particularly not someone who isn't prepared to make the climb up to her scarily high window." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferrier {{spent two}} months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought {{to her at the}} {{hospital}} by a friend. Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she would {{no longer be able to}} negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate. Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this [...] "unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> so much better". This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. [...] As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival. Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service. She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was [...] "not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the final}} years of his life, Mantle {{purchased}} a condominium on Lake Oconee near Greensboro, Georgia, near Greer Johnson's home, and frequently stayed there for months at a time. He occasionally attended the local Methodist church, and sometimes ate Sunday dinner with members of the congregation. He was well-liked by the citizens of Greensboro, and seemed to like them in return. This was probably because the town respected Mantle's privacy, refusing either to talk about their famous neighbor to outsiders or to direct fans to his home. In one interview, Mantle stated that the people of Greensboro had [...] "gone out of their way <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> welcome, and I've found something there I haven't enjoyed since I was a kid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of The Chicagoist wrote, [...] "There is {{a moment}} in each {{installment}} of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel something in your chest.

And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning." ...|$|E

Ali successfully turned many black Americans against Frazier. Bryant Gumbel joined the pro-Ali, anti-Frazier bandwagon by writing a major magazine article that asked [...] "Is Joe Frazier a white champion with black skin?" [...] Frazier thought this was [...] "a cynical attempt by Clay <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> isolated from my own people.

She dropped out of college in her first year to pursue her singing career and was then signed by the Los Angeles-based record label and management team, Indie-Pop, who also discovered The Cataracs. Six months later, Dev and The Cataracs' song [...] "2Nite" [...] began to gain exposure on the radio, the television channel MtvU and the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart. In 2009, Dev moved to Los Angeles to produce music with the Cataracs and work directly with Indie-Pop.|$|E

50|$|Despite these findings, the {{mechanism}} was still challenged because {{the results were}} open to interpretation. Perhaps participants had more favorable expectancies for themselves than for others. Newman, Nibert, and Winer (2009) sought to test the expectancies possibility more directly. They hypothesized that participants who were more focused on testing information against their expectancies would have different recall biases than participants who {{were more likely to}} be focused on self-protection. Defensive pessimists were identified as people who are more likely to focus on expectancies. Defensive pessimists think extensively about possible future outcomes, both positive and negative. Their ultimate goal is to be prepared. They should still exhibit a preference for positive over negative information, but they are more likely to approach a situation with “Is this a reasonable thing to expect?” as opposed <b>to</b> “Will this <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> bad about myself?” Thus, it was hypothesized that defensive pessimists would recall more favorable than unfavorable behaviors in both themselves and others when subjected to the standard test for mnemic neglect. The findings supported the hypothesis. Defensive pessimists showed a bias for the recall of positive information over negative information for both themselves and others, thereby offering further support to the hypothesized mechanism of mnemic neglect (i.e. mnemic neglect is based on self-protection rather than self-verification).|$|R
