They find the owner, who confesses to killing the women because they rejected him, and kidnapped and tortured Mathis's partner when he discovered the culprit. Repeatedly at the hotel, Peter receives calls with static, strange noises, and clicks, which he suspects are coming from Newton. In the end, Peter decides and prepares to head back to Boston, but is approached by Newton, who has brought [...] "Mr. Secretary", <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Other Side, to see Peter.

500|$|Due to the {{practice}} of endogamy and the caste system, Póvoa's fishing community maintained local ethnic characteristics. Anthropological and cultural data indicate Nordic fishermen settling during the period of the coast's resettlement. In As Praias de Portugal (Beaches of Portugal, 1876), Ramalho ortigão wrote that the Povoan fishermen were a [...] "race" [...] in the Portuguese coast; entirely different from the Mediterranean type of Ovar and Olhão, Poveiro is of [...] "Saxon" [...] type. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> interior was a farmer with Galician character (Paleo and Nordid-Atlantid). In a 1908 research, anthropologist Fonseca Cardoso considered that Poveiros were the result of a mixture of Phoenicians, Teutons, Jews and, mostly, Normans. In the book The Races of Europe (1938), Poveiros were distinguished by having a greater than usual degree of blondism, broad faces of unknown origin, and broad jaws.|$|E

He achieved critical success with these books – Marvin Levin in the New York Times, for example, wrote: [...] "Nobody can write funnier lines than William Peter Blatty, a gifted virtuoso who writes like [...] Perelman"; but significant sales were lacking. It {{was at this}} point that Blatty began a collaboration with director Blake Edwards, writing scripts for comedy films such as: A Shot in the Dark (1964), What Did You Do in the War, Daddy? (1966), Gunn (1967), and Darling Lili (1970), a musical starring Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson. Blatty also worked on his own using the name [...] "Bill Blatty" [...] writing comedy screenplays such as those for the Danny Kaye film <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Diners' Club (1963), and the Warren Beatty/Leslie Caron film Promise Her Anything (1965). Other screenplays include the film adaptation of John Goldfarb, Please Come Home! (1965), and The Great Bank Robbery (1969).|$|E

Sally insists on keeping a folder of the events, including Larry's completed transcript, but Larry {{wants her to}} move on and indicates he has feelings for her. Sally gently rebuffs him and Larry steps out on an errand. Sally sees the Doctor and Martha hurriedly leave a taxi in front of the shop and goes outside to meet them. They don't recognise her and she realises that they have yet to experience the events that sent them to the past. She hands the Doctor the folder, warning him that he will need it in his future. The Doctor and Sally say goodbye as Larry returns, surprised to see <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Easter egg. Sally and Larry return to the shop hand in hand, hinting that she is now ready for a romantic relationship. The episode ends with a repeat of the Doctor's [...] "don't blink" [...] warning to Sally, this time directed at the viewer and overlaid with flashes of famous statues.|$|E
500|$|Following a tip, Dunham and Scott {{are sent}} to a storage {{facility}} where they uncover a biochemical laboratory, which explodes when detonated by a suspect they are chasing. Scott {{is affected by the}} chemicals released in the explosion, and is placed into an artificial coma to slow the progression of the chemical reaction. While investigating a possible cure to Scott's condition, Dunham blackmails Peter Bishop (Jackson) to gain access to his father Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble), whose top-secret work at Harvard in [...] "fringe science" [...] resulted in him being sent to a mental institution. Dunham manages to release Walter from the institution; however, he becomes enraged when he discovers his laboratory in Harvard has been shut down. Broyles reopens the laboratory, where Dunham transfers Scott's body. To identify <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storage facility, Walter synchronizes Dunham's brainwaves with the comatose Scott's so that she can read his mind. Walter claims that syncing brainwaves, and even reanimating the dead, can be accomplished up to six hours after death. With the help of Dunham's assistant, federal agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole), the experiment succeeds. Dunham identifies the man in Scott's memory, Morgan Steig, as a passenger on the plane. The team learns Steig's twin brother, Richard Steig, was an employee of Massive Dynamic, a company founded by William Bell, Walter's old lab partner.|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place, {{there is one}} thing which I can assure you. In all his career Napoleon never had so splendid an army as that with which he took the field for that campaign.

But it was very {{different}} in 1815.

Abruptly after the call, Fertility also calls Tender, again trying to reach the crisis hotline, and she tells him about dancing with the man at the mausoleum and asks him to get together with her.

2500|$|The obvious {{historical}} {{analogy is}} between Earth {{in the book}} and the historical situation of Judea under the Roman Empire, with the fanatics plotting rebellion against Trantor being modeled upon the Zealots who in 66 CE [...] launched the Great Jewish Revolt which ended with destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, a highly traumatic event of Jewish history. This fits well in the general scheme of Trantor being the equivalent of Rome, and Trantor's later decline in the Foundation Series being the equivalent of Rome's decline centuries after the destruction of Jerusalem. Asimov's position in this ancient historical controversy is clear, with the fanatic rebels being the undoubted villains of the book. It is noteworthy that Joseph Schwartz – <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> past who ultimately foils the fanatics' plot – is clearly Jewish, and his action in effect saves the people of the future Earth from re-enacting the great tragedy of Schwartz's own people.|$|E
