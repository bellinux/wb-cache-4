40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{framework}} for the modelling of charged fluid dynamics in general relativity. The model, which builds on a recently developed variational multi-fluid framework for dissipative fluids, accounts for relevant effects like the inertia of both charge currents and heat and, for mature systems, the decoupling of superfluid components. We discuss how the model compares to standard relativistic magnetohydronamics and consider {{the connection between the}} fluid dynamics, the microphysics and the underlying equation of state. As illustrations of the formalism, we consider three distinct two-fluid models describing (i) an Ohm's law for resistive charged flows, (ii) a relativistic heat equation, and (iii) an equation representing the momentum of a decoupled superfluid component. As a more complex example, we also formulate a three-fluid model which demonstrates the <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>effect.</b> The new framework allows us to model neutron stars (and related systems) at a hierarchy of increasingly complex levels, and should enable us to make progress on a range of exciting problems in astrophysics and cosmology...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{constant}} uniform magnetic field on a growing equiaxed crystal are investigated using a 3 -dimensional enthalpy based numerical model. Two cases are considered: The first case looks at unconstrained growth, where the current density is generated through the <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>effect</b> and the current circulates between the tips and roots of the dendrite, the second represents an imposed potential difference across the domain. A jump in the electrical conductivity between the liquid and solid causes the current density to be non uniform. In both cases the resulting Lorentz force drives fluid flow in the liquid phase, this in turn causes advection of the thermal and solute field altering the free energy close to the interface and changing the morphology of the dendrite. In the first case the flow field is complex comprising of many circulations, the morphological changes are modelled using a 2 D model with a quasi 3 D approximation. The second case is comparable to classic problems involving a constant velocity boundary...|$|E

The most important are thermal conduction through the supporting membrane and contact resistance. Analytical analysis shows that each parasitic decreases device performance, but only the contact resistance creates a significant shift in the optimum device current where the temperature reduction is maximised. To obtain an energetically correct lumped-element model, as presented in this paper, the electro-thermal Peltier effect must {{be linked to the}} <b>thermo-electric</b> Seebeck <b>effect,</b> which acts as a feedback parameter.

40|$|Current from {{thoriated}} tungsten filaments in vacuum, due {{to radial}} fields {{of up to}} two million volts per cm. — Three filaments were tested, each. 00123 cm in diam. and suspended under tension in the axis of a copper cylinder of 1. 6 cm diam. From the dimensions, the radial field at {{the surface of the}} filament was 228 times the applied potential difference. The electron currents pulled from the tungsten by the high fields (field currents) rise steadily from 10 ^- 12 to 10 ^- 3 amp. as the field is increased from about 400 to 1100 kv/cm. In the dark, luminous spots were seen on the anode, indicating that these currents come from a few active surface spots. The field current (for a given voltage) depends on the value of the maximum field current previously drawn from it (conditioning current), being reversibly reproducible below the conditioning current. The higher the conditioning current, the lower the field current. A previous heating to high temperatures (2400 °C) decreases the field current and also decreases the slope of the current-voltage curve. Both effects (current and heating) show fatigue. Variation with temperature of the filament, to 800 °C. The field currents are completely independent of temperature up to 700 °, but a temperature of 800 ° increases the currents due to a given field when this is sufficiently large, by a factor which is roughly independent of the current (10 - 8 to 10 - 4 amp.). Electron theory. In explanation of these results, it is suggested that the field currents are due to conduction electrons pulled from minute peaks on the surface, the fatigue effects of both current treatment and heat treatment being due to the rounding off of these peaks by positive ion bombardment or by temperature. Chemical changes may also alter the surface. The lack of dependence of field currents upon temperature furnishes strong evidence that most of the conduction electrons do not share in the energy of thermal agitation. The thermions, however, do share in this energy; they are presumably responsible for the Peltier and <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>effects.</b> In this theory it is assumed that conduction electrons follow the same sort of quantum laws in their escape from the solid as do atoms of a light element at temperatures far below the boiling point...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe thermo-electric {{coefficients}} of twenty-six magnetite samples, formed either by magmatism or metamorphism, were {{tested by the}} thermo-electric instrument BHET – 06. Results showed that the coefficient is of a constant value of about − 0. 05  mV/°C. It is emphasized that because every magnetite grain was tested randomly, the coefficient is independent of the crystallographic direction. This fact means the thermal voltage generated from a single magnetite crystal can be accumulated, {{and as a result}} a new thermo-electric field can arise when a gradient thermal field exists and is active within the earth’s crust. Because magnetite is widespread in the earth’s crust (generally appearing more in the middle-lower crust), there is more-than-random probability that the additional thermo-electric field can be generated when certain thermal conditions are fulfilled. We, therefore, used the <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>effect</b> of magnetite to study the mechanism responsible for the presence of abnormal geo-electric fields during earthquake formation and occurrence, because gradient thermal fields always exist before earthquakes. The possible presence of additional thermo-electric fields was calculated under theoretical seismological conditions, using the following calculation formula:E=− 0. 159 (σ×ΔT×Φ×ρ 2 ×[(h 2 − 2 x 2) cosα+ 3 hxsinα]/ρ 1 (h 2 +x 2) 5 / 2). In the above formula, σ is thermo-electric coefficient of magnetite, ΔT is the temperature difference acting on it, Φ is a sectional area on a block of magnetite vertically perpendicular to the direction of the thermal current, ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the respective resistivities of magnetite and the crust, and h, α, and x, respectively, h is the depth of embedded magnetite block. α means the angle created by the horizontal line and ligature of the two poles of magnetite block, and x is the distance from observation point to projective center point of the magnetite block on earth surface. According to simulations calculated with this formula, additional thermo-electric field intensity may reach as high as n to n ×  102  mV/km. This field is strong enough to cause obvious anomalies in the background geo-electric field, and can be easy probed by earthquake monitoring equipment. Therefore, we hypothesize that geo-electric abnormalities which occur during earthquakes may be caused by the <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>effect</b> of magnetite...|$|E
40|$|The {{reason for}} me to pick Wheatstone bridge as my subject {{is that it is a}} perfect example of {{electrical}} complexity that has many issues for many factors that have affected the flow of electricity (or have been affected from it). It is rich in topics, and I have thought that it would be a pleasure {{for me to}} do some research about it, and then present my extended essay. The part that bothered me about the measurements with the Wheatstone bridge was that, does it give precise results after it has just been balanced, or is it necessary to fulfill some conditions. For extremely precise results, the temperature must have been constant, to reduce the <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>effect</b> and keep the resistances constant. The temperature was not a problem, after it has been kept constant, but there is something more important about the resistance ratios. The current that is applied to the circuit must be suitable for the circuit, and to get the most precise results, electrical leakage that can result from the inductance or capacitance should be kept as minimum. The resistance to be measured and the one to be adjusted would be the only variable resistances, and the other ones should be kept in a constant ratio. In this experiment, they were kept to a constant ratio of 1 in order to have a wide range of measurement...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{analyzed}} and characterized a new flow thermo-electrochemical cell that generates power from waste-heat, while in parallel convecting this heat {{away from the}} source. I also reviewed previous research {{on the topic of}} thermo-electric energy generation, governing physics behind thermo-electrochemical energy generation, actual device fabrication, device testing, results, and applications of this technology. Thermo-electric devices (TE devices) exhibit the <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>effect,</b> where temperature gradients and material properties work in tandem to drive electron transfer at electrode surfaces, thereby generating electricity. For example, a typical sold-state TE device such as a bismuth telluride TE device, can generate up to 0. 300 mV/K [31]. New reseach has emerged [25, 26, 14] focusing on liquid-based thermo-electrochemical (TEC) cells that take advantage of the temperature dependence of oxidation/reduction chemical reactions to generate electricity. One of the major benefits of these TEC devices over traditional TE devices is a much higher S, = 1. 5 mV/K; another is the low cost of manufacturing, making them promising for commercial applications. The new TEC device that I fabricated and studied utilizes a flowing electrolyte instead of a stationary electrolyte. With this new configuration, and a heated boundary condition, I studied both the energy generation and convective heat transfer capabilities of the flowing electrolyte TEC cell. Numerically I obtained a maximum power output and heat transfer coefficient for the TEC cell of Pmax = 2. 6 [mu]W and h = 340 W/m²K which corroborates well with the experimentally found value of Pmax = 2. 0 [mu]W and h = 450 W/m². K. If employed in data centers, as a device for CPU cooling, with the given power output I found that a 100, 000 ft² data center can generate about 21. 96 MWh of energy, which at a cost of 0. 20 $/kWh can save a data center about 5, 000 $/year. More generally, the application of this technology in locations where waste-heat is prevalent, will allow for energy recycling and consequent cost savings. by Ali Sina Booeshaghi. Thesis: S.

40|$|Wire bonding is {{the process}} of {{creating}} interconnects between the circuitry on a microchip and PCB boards or substrates so that the microchip can interact with the outside world. The materials and techniques used in this bonding process can cause a wide variation in bond quality, so wire bond reliability testing is very important in determining the quality and longevity of wire bonds. Due to the fact that microchips are encased in protective resins after bonding and their substrates attached to the larger device as a whole, once any single wire bond fails then it could jeapordize the entire device as the wire bonds cannot be individually replaced or fixed. Current methods of reliability testing are lengthy and often destroy the entire sample in the process of evaluation, so the availability of novel non-destructive, real-time monitoring methods as well as accelerated aging could reduce costs and provide realistically timed tests of novel wire bond materials which do not form Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) as rapidly as Au wire on Al substrates. In this thesis, five new chip designs for use in wire bond reliability testing are reported, focusing on the first joint made in a wire bond, called the ball bond. These chips are scaled either to test up to 55 test bonds simultaneously or just one at a time, introducing different requirements for microchip infrastructure capabilities, such as on-chip sensing/data bus, multiplexer, and switches able to operate under High Temperature Storage (HTS) which ranges from temperatures of 150 - 220 ºC. There are different heating requirements for each of these microchips, needing to be heated externally or containing on-chip microheaters to heat only the ball bond under test, and not the rest of the microchip or surrounding I/O pads. Of the five chip designs, sample chips were produced by an external company. Experimental studies were then carried out with two of these chip designs. They were specifically made to test novel methods of determining ball bond reliability using in-situ, non-destructive sensing, in real-time, while the ball bond undergoes thermal aging. Pad resistance as an analysis tool for ball bond reliability is proposed in this thesis as a new way of evaluating ball bond quality and allows for the testing of electrical connection without the need for specialized measurement probes or difficult bonding processes that contact resistance measurements require. Results are reported for pad resistance measurements of a ball bond under very high temperature storage (VHTS) at 250 ºC, a temperature exceeding typical HTS ranges to accelerate aging. Pad resistance measurements are taken using the four-wire measurement method from each corner of the bond pad, while reversing current direction every measurement to remove <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>effects,</b> and then calculating the average square resistance of the pad from this value. The test ball bond is aged using a novel on-chip microheater which is a N+ doped Si resistive heater located directly underneath the bond pad, and can achieve temperatures up to 300 ºC while not aging any of the I/O pads surrounding it, which are located ~ 180 µm away. A 50 Ω resistor is placed 60 µm away from the heater to monitor the temperature. The use of a microheater allows the aging of novel wire types at temperatures much higher than those permitted for microchip operation while thermally isolating the test bond from the sensing and power bonds, which {{do not need to be}} aged. Higher temperatures allow the aging process to be sped up considerably. The microheater is programmatically cycled between 250 ºC (for 45 min) and 25 ºC (for 15 min) for up to 200 h or until the pad resistance measurements fail due breakdown of the bonding pad. Intermetallic compounds forming between the ball bond and the pad first become visible after a few hours, and then the pad becomes almost completely consumed after a day. The pad resistance is measured every few seconds while the sample is at room temperature, and the increase in pad resistance agrees with the fact that Au/Al IMC products are known to have much higher resistance than both pure Au or Al. Also discussed are some aging results of Au wires and Pd coated Cu (PCC) wires bonded to Al bonding pads and aged at a temperature of 200 ºC in an oven for 670 h. The oven aged Au ball bonds also saw IMC formation on the surface of the bonding pad, much like the microheater tests. The PCC ball bonds became heavily oxidized due to lack of Pd on the surface of the ball, the wire portions did not oxidize much. In conclusion, the new structures have been demonstrated to age ball bonds faster than with conventional methods while obtaining non-destructive data. Specifically, the new microheater ages a test bond at an accelerated rate without having an observable effect on the I/O connections used to monitor the test bond. Pad resistance measurements correlate to the aging of the test bond and ensure the electrical integrity of the joint is checked. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|Some {{results of}} non-equilibrium {{statistical}} mechanics are presented,both {{in the context}} of biological systems as well as in a classicalphysics context. In the biological context we seek the microscopicperspective as well as the macroscopic perspective. The physics contextis sought mainly as a test case and reference for development ofgeneralized perturbation or expansion techniques. Kinesin Concerningthe microscopic perspective we present a model for kinesin, a molecularmotor responsible for many important cellular processes that requirework. Kinesin is capable of transforming chemically stored energy intowork through a series of chemical and conformational changes, steppingalong microtubules (a biochemical polymer that structures cells) as its`rails'. Our approach to model this motor enzyme is to consider thespatial-chemical states as states of a Markov process, modelling therates as exchanges of mass and entropy with thermal and chemical (orparticle) reservoirs of the environment. Due to translationalinvariance of the process we need only describe a single steppingcycle. Under some additional assumptions (based on experiments) we mayfurther reduce the state space until we arrive at a model consisting ofsix states that are well defined. The model describes theexperimentally observed behavior of kinesin well. The thermoelectric effect Wepresent a interacting particle model for the thermoelectric effect. This leads to some insight in the working of temperature gradients asthermodynamic forces. On the other hand it provides us with apossibility to investigate perturbations beyond the linear regime. Perturbation and generalized fluctuation relations Nextwe argue that [...] in spite of its general validity [...] the fluctuationtheorem is not useful to obtain higher order response coefficients. Byintroducing the notion of field-reversal we provide the(time-) symmetrical equivalent of the fluctuation theorem as acomplementary relation. We then argue that a generalized form of thefluctuation theorem (derived by making use of field-reversal only),combines these fluctuation relations in order to derive responsecoefficients up to any given order (and consequently not necessarily byperturbing around equilibrium). These arguments are strengthenedthrough a more explicit derivation of these relations {{in the context of}}Markov processes and further elucidated with help of some examples. Models for DEB theory Atthe end we venture into the macroscopic perspective with help of DEBtheory, a biological theory describing mass and energy flows forindividual organisms. We present two different models that investigatethe possibility of a relatively simple underlying local dynamics. Firstwe propose a simple type of chemical reaction model [...] a caricature of arealistic chemical reaction system [...] without any kind of geometricalstructure. This model describes the dynamics for V 1 -morphs (organismswhose surface area grows as their volume) according to DEB theory withonly a single free parameter. Then, in order to describe the dynamicsfor isomorphs, we propose a "wire" model that takes the geometricalstructure of the organism into account, in order to obtain coincidencewith the dynamics dictated by DEB theory.
