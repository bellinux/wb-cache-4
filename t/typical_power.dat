5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with <b>typical</b> <b>power</b> levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E

25|$|For {{large-scale}} power generation, {{a typical}} set {{would be a}} 270MW primary gas turbine coupled to a 130MW secondary steam turbine, giving a total output of 400MW. A <b>typical</b> <b>power</b> station might consist of between 1 and 6 such sets.|$|E
25|$|Lamps {{are either}} amalgam or {{medium-pressure}} lamps. Low-pressure UV lamps offer high efficiencies (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1 W/cm power density (power {{per unit of}} arc length). Amalgam UV lamps are a higher-power version of low-pressure lamps. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly {{lower than that of}} traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2–3 W/cm. Medium-pressure UV lamps have a broad and pronounced peak-line spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. <b>Typical</b> <b>power</b> density is 30 W/cm³ or greater.|$|E
25|$|Most reactor designs rely on liquid {{hydrogen}} {{as both a}} coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into tritium, which is fed back into the reactor as fuel. Hydrogen is highly flammable, {{and in the case}} of a fire it is possible that the hydrogen stored on-site could be burned up and escape. In this case, the tritium contents of the hydrogen would be released into the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. Calculations suggest that at about , the total amount of tritium and other radioactive gases in a <b>typical</b> <b>power</b> station would be so small that they would have diluted to legally acceptable limits by the time they blew as far as the station's perimeter fence.|$|E

500|$|A <b>typical</b> <b>power</b> divider {{is shown}} in figure 13. [...] Ideally, input power would be divided equally between the output ports. [...] Dividers are made up of {{multiple}} couplers and, like couplers, may be reversed and used as multiplexers. [...] The drawback is that for a four channel multiplexer, the output consists of only 1/4 the power from each, and is relatively inefficient. [...] The {{reason for this is that}} at each combiner half the input power goes to port 4 and is dissipated in the termination load. [...] If the two inputs were coherent the phases could be so arranged that cancellation occurred at port 4 and then all the power would go to port 1. [...] However, multiplexer inputs are usually from entirely independent sources and therefore not coherent. [...] Lossless multiplexing can only be done with filter networks.Naval Air Warfare Center, pp.6.4.4, 6.4.5 ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Typical</b> <b>power</b> densities {{available}} from energy harvesting devices are highly {{dependent upon the}} specific application (affecting the generator's size) and the design itself of the harvesting generator.

Most energy scavenging devices for wearable electronics generate very little power.|$|E
