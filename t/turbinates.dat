5|$|<b>Turbinates</b> {{are thin}} bones or cartilages {{that come in}} two types, with two functions. Nasal {{olfactory}} <b>turbinates</b> are found in all living tetrapods and function in smell. Respiratory <b>turbinates</b> function to prevent water loss through evaporation and are found only in birds and mammals, modern endotherms (warm-blooded animals) who could lose {{a great deal of}} water while breathing because they breathe more often than comparably sized ectotherms (cold-blooded animals) to support their higher metabolism. Ruben and others in 1996 concluded that respiratory <b>turbinates</b> were probably not present in Nanotyrannus, Ornithomimus or Hypacrosaurus based on CT scanning, thus {{there was no evidence that}} those animals were warm-blooded.|$|E
5|$|The hollow {{crest of}} Hypacrosaurus most likely had social functions, {{such as a}} visual signal {{allowing}} individuals to identify sex or species, and providing a resonating chamber for making noises. The crest and its associated nasal passages have also figured in the debate about dinosaur endothermy, specifically in discussions about nasal <b>turbinates.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs {{had a good}} sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial endocasts that showed large {{olfactory}} bulbs in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed cartilaginous nasal <b>turbinates</b> {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that Stegoceras had a keen sense of smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the <b>turbinates</b> served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E
40|$|Background: Prolonged {{perceived}} {{nasal obstruction}} resulting from inferior <b>turbinate</b> hypertrophy (ITH) {{is a common}} complaint encountered in Otorhinolaryngology practice. A wide variety of surgical procedures like partial resections, submucous resection, electrocautery, submucous diathermy, cryosurgery, laser ablation and endoscopic resection have been performed but results have been universally unsatisfactory. There is very less literature available regarding Histopathological aspects of hypertrophied inferior <b>turbinate</b> which can throw more light on appropriate management of hypertrophied inferior <b>turbinate.</b> Hence this study was undertaken to provide quantitative and qualitative information on various soft tissue and bony constituents of hypertrophic inferior <b>turbinate.</b> Objective: Comparison of Histopathological features between inferior <b>turbinate</b> hypertrophy in allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis and deviated nasal septum. Materials and methods: A total of 100 patients who presented with nasal obstruction due to hypertrophied inferior <b>turbinate</b> were chosen for study. All patients underwent partial turbinectomy of hypertrophied inferior <b>turbinate</b> under general anesthesia with or without septoplasty. Turbinectomy included anterior 2 /...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{accessory}} middle <b>turbinate,</b> a rare anatomical {{variation of}} the nasal cavity, have been systematically studied in adults. Presence of accessory middle <b>turbinate</b> and its clinical significance in a child has not been reported. We describe clinical appearance and radiologic features of accessory middle <b>turbinate</b> in a child. Methods: Retrospective chart review. Results: A 3 -year-old boy presented to the otolaryngology clinic for evaluation of recurrent epistaxis. Anterior rhinoscopy revealed moist nasal mucosa without inflammation and bilateral prominent blood vessels on the anterior nasal septum. Nasal endoscopy showed <b>turbinate</b> like protuberances in bilateral middle meatus. CT images documented accessory middle <b>turbinate</b> in the bilateral nasal cavity. Conclusion: Otolaryngologists should be cognizant of anatomical variations of middle <b>turbinate</b> to achieve correct diagnosis and avoid potential complications during surgical management...|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} controversy {{surrounds the}} advisability {{and efficacy of}} middle <b>turbinate</b> resection in endoscopic sinus surgery. Some {{are in favor of}} middle <b>turbinate</b> preservation considering it to be important anatomic and physiological structure and others advocate middle <b>turbinate</b> resection as it improves nasal air flow and decreases synechiae formation. So a study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of middle <b>turbinate</b> resection in patients of chronic sinusitis undergoing Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS). 40 patients of chronic sinusitis were selected and divided into 2 groups, group I undergoing FESS with middle <b>turbinate</b> preservation and group II undergoing FESS along with middle <b>turbinate</b> resection. Final results were recorded 6  months after the operative procedure. 50 % patients had relief in nasal obstruction in group I as compared to 88 % in group II. Postoperative synechiae formation was seen in five patients in group I and in one patient in group II...|$|R
5|$|Examining the oxygen-isotope ratio {{from the}} bones from {{different}} parts of an extinct animal's body should indicate which thermoregulation mode an animal used during its lifetime. An endothermic (warm-blooded) animal should maintain a very similar body temperature throughout its entire body (which is called homeothermy) and therefore there should be little variation in the oxygen-isotope ratio when measured in different bones. Alternatively, the oxygen-isotope ratio differs considerably when measured throughout the body of an organism with an ectothermic (cold-blooded) physiology. Oxygen-isotope ratios calculated for Hypacrosaurus suggesting that the ratios varied little, indicating that Hypacrosaurus was a homeotherm, and likely was endothermic. This is in contrast to the Ruben et al. (1996) finding that Hypacrosaurus was not warm-blooded, which was based on the absence of nasal <b>turbinates</b> (see Crest functions subsection, above).|$|E
25|$|Endothermy demands {{frequent}} respiration, {{which can}} result in water loss. In living birds and mammals, water loss is limited by pulling moisture out of exhaled air with mucous-covered respiratory <b>turbinates,</b> tissue-covered bony sheets in the nasal cavity. Several dinosaurs have olfactory <b>turbinates,</b> used for smell, but none have yet been identified with respiratory <b>turbinates.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{nasal septum}} is {{composed}} of the quadrangular cartilage, the vomer bone (the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), aspects of the premaxilla, and the palatine bones. Each lateral nasal wall contains three pairs of <b>turbinates</b> (nasal conchae), which are small, thin, shell-form bones: (i) the superior concha, (ii) the middle concha, and (iii) the inferior concha, which are the bony framework of the <b>turbinates.</b> Lateral to the <b>turbinates</b> is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. Inferior to the nasal conchae (<b>turbinates)</b> is the meatus space, with names that correspond to the <b>turbinates,</b> e.g. superior turbinate, superior meatus, et alii. The internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal, perforated cribriform plate (of the ethmoid bone) through which pass sensory filaments of the olfactory nerve (Cranial nerve I); finally, below and behind (posteroinferior) the cribriform plate, sloping down at an angle, is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of the {{underlying}} allergy or irritant may reduce <b>turbinate</b> swelling. In cases that do not resolve, or for treatment of deviated septum, <b>turbinate</b> surgery may be required.|$|R
40|$|Background: In the {{presence}} of <b>turbinate</b> dysfunction, an inferior turbinectomy for persistent hypertrophy of bone and/or mucosa may be performed. We sought to explore anatomic feasibility of a transoral turbinectomy. Methods: After transoral inferior turbinectomy in 12 cadavers, average distances from the external nasal valve to inferior <b>turbinate</b> and from pyriform aperture to inferior <b>turbinate</b> were compared. Average "area of access" was calculated. Preoperative and postoperative nasal length, tip projection, and alar-base width were also compared. Results: Average distance from external nasal valve to inferior <b>turbinate</b> was 32. 4 mm. Average distance from aperture to inferior <b>turbinate</b> was 2. 4 mm (P < 0. 0001). Average "areas of access" to nasal vault through the external nasal valve and mouth were 183. 9 mm(2) and 243. 6 mm(2) (P = 0. 07), respectively. Conclusions: The transoral approach provides a larger "area of access" to the <b>turbinate,</b> a statistically significant reduction of distance to target, no postoperative changes in nasal soft tissue, and easier instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Techniques for {{inferior}} <b>turbinate</b> reduction {{vary from}} complete turbinectomy to limited cauterization. Surgical methods differ {{on the degree}} of tissue reduction and reliance on surgical tissue removal versus tissue ablation. Method: The technique and surgical steps of our preferred method of <b>turbinate</b> reduction are presented. Results: Critical steps include proper design of the medial flap and removal of <b>turbinate</b> bone and lateral mucosa to allow lateral positioning of the medial flap. Bipolar cautery of the inferior <b>turbinate</b> artery branches allows complete haemostasis and undermining of the head allows proper debulking of the anterior aspect of the <b>turbinate</b> and widening of the nasal valve area. Conclusion: The medial flap inferior turbinoplasty provides consistent, robust results. Long-term relief of obstructive symptoms without additional risk of complication is expected with this procedure. 2 page(s...|$|R
25|$|John Ruben {{and others}} have argued that no {{evidence}} of nasal <b>turbinates</b> {{has been found in}} dinosaurs. All the dinosaurs they examined had nasal passages that were too narrow and short to accommodate nasal <b>turbinates,</b> so dinosaurs could not have sustained the breathing rate required for a mammal-like or bird-like metabolic rate while at rest, because their lungs would have dried out. However, objections have been raised against this argument. Nasal <b>turbinates</b> are absent or very small in some birds (e.g. ratites, Procellariiformes and Falconiformes) and mammals (e.g. whales, anteaters, bats, elephants, and most primates), although these animals are fully endothermic and in some cases very active. Other studies conclude that nasal <b>turbinates</b> are fragile and seldom found in fossils. In particular none have been found in fossil birds.|$|E
25|$|In some people, {{surgery to}} restore missing or reduced <b>turbinates</b> may be beneficial.|$|E
25|$|Modern mammals have {{respiratory}} <b>turbinates,</b> convoluted {{structures of}} thin bone in the nasal cavity. These {{are lined with}} mucous membranes that warm and moisten inhaled air and extract heat and moisture from exhaled air. An animal with respiratory <b>turbinates</b> can maintain {{a high rate of}} breathing without the danger of drying its lungs out, and therefore may have a fast metabolism. Unfortunately these bones are very delicate and therefore have not yet been found in fossils. But rudimentary ridges like those that support respiratory <b>turbinates</b> have been found in advanced Triassic cynodonts, such as Thrinaxodon and Diademodon, which suggests that they may have had fairly high metabolic rates.|$|E
5000|$|A concha bullosa is a pneumatized (air-filled) cavity {{within a}} <b>turbinate</b> in the nose. (Concha is another term for <b>turbinate.)</b> Bullosa {{refers to the}} air-filled cavity within the <b>turbinate.</b> It is a normal {{anatomic}} variant seen in up to half the population. Occasionally, a large concha bullosa within a <b>turbinate</b> may cause it to bulge sufficiently to obstruct the opening of an adjacent sinus, possibly leading to recurrent sinusitis. [...] In such a case the <b>turbinate</b> can be reduced in size by endoscopic nasal surgery (turbinectomy). The presence of a concha bullosa {{is often associated with}} deviation of the nasal septum toward {{the opposite side of the}} nasal cavity. Although it is thought that sinusitis or sinus pathology has relation to concha bullosa, no strong statistical correlation has been demonstrated.|$|R

25|$|According {{to court}} documents, McMath was {{admitted}} to Children's Hospital Oakland on December 9, 2013, for an adenotonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and submucous resection of bilateral inferior <b>turbinates.</b> It was hoped these procedures would provide improved airflow during her sleep at night. The hospital described these procedures as complicated. The family described the surgery as a routine tonsillectomy in media reports.|$|E
25|$|Nasal <b>turbinates</b> are {{convoluted}} {{structures of}} thin bone in the nasal cavity. In most mammals and birds these are present and lined with mucous membranes that perform two functions. They improve {{the sense of}} smell by increasing the area available to absorb airborne chemicals, and they warm and moisten inhaled air, and extract heat and moisture from exhaled air to prevent desiccation of the lungs.|$|E
40|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} inferior <b>turbinate</b> enlargement is controversial. Submucosal electrosurgical techniques for <b>turbinate</b> reduction include conventional diathermy, radiofrequency tissue reduction and coblation. All electrosurgical techniques use radiofrequency electricity to damage <b>turbinate</b> tissue but {{differ in the}} control and delivery of energy. This review will examine the history of submucosal electrosurgery and clarify the various techniques. This review will also examine the evidence for the efficacy and safety of electrosurgery {{for the treatment of}} nasal <b>turbinate</b> enlargement, and will make a case that no progress will be made in clinical trials on the safety and efficacy unless there is standardisation of equipment and techniques in nasal electrosurgery...|$|R

25|$|The {{complete}} {{physical examination}} of the rhinoplasty patient determines {{if he or she}} is physically fit to undergo and tolerate the physiologic stresses of nose surgery. The examination comprehends every existing physical problem, and a consultation with an anaesthesiologist, if warranted by the patient's medical data. Specific facial and nasal evaluations record the patient's skin-type, existing surgical scars, and the symmetry and asymmetry of the aesthetic nasal subunits. The external and internal nasal examination concentrates upon the anatomic thirds of the nose—upper section, middle section, lower section—specifically noting their structures; the measures of the nasal angles (at which the external nose projects from the face); and the physical characteristics of the naso-facial bony and soft tissues. The internal examination evaluates the condition of the nasal septum, the internal and external nasal valves, the <b>turbinates,</b> and the nasal lining, paying special attention to the structure and the form of the nasal dorsum and the tip of the nose.|$|E
500|$|On {{very hot}} days, emus pant to {{maintain}} their body temperature, their lungs work as evaporative coolers and, unlike some other species, the resulting low levels of {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood do not appear to cause alkalosis.

40|$|Background: Nasal {{obstruction}} is a {{very common}} Ear, Nose, and Throat outpatient problem. We report a case series illustrating the safety and clinical effectiveness of submucous diathermy (SMD) {{in the treatment of}} medically refractory nasal obstruction caused by hypertrophy of the inferior <b>turbinate.</b> Methods: Consecutive patients presenting over a 5 -year period with medically refractory nasal obstruction secondary to hypertrophy of the inferior <b>turbinate</b> were offered SMD as a technique for <b>turbinate</b> reduction. Subjective symptom score of the degree of obstruction was assessed preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Results: A total of 12 adults aged between 18 and 42 years {{with a mean age of}} 27. 8 years, consented to SMD for <b>turbinate</b> reduction. The patients all had subjective improvement in their nasal airways postoperatively. Subjective symptom score declined to 66. 7 % by the 1 st postoperative year.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe topical therapies are {{the best}} {{postoperative}} treatment option for chronic rhinosinusitis, especially those with high volume and pressure, such as the squeeze bottles. However, they are not an available option in Brazil, where irrigation syringes are used. ObjectiveTo investigate the efficacy of topical sinonasal therapy with syringe {{and the influence of}} this process on the middle <b>turbinate.</b> MethodsIntervention study in training models (S. I. M. O. N. T.). After standard dissection, three interventions were performed (Nasal Spray 4 puffs, 60 -mL syringe and 240 -mL Squeeze Bottle) with normal and Sutured Middle <b>Turbinate.</b> Images of each sinus were captured after the interventions, totaling 144 images. The images were classified by 10 evaluators according to the amount of residual volume from zero to 3, with zero and 1 being considered poor penetration and 2 and 3, good penetration. The 1440 evaluations were used in this study. ResultsConsidering all middle <b>turbinate</b> situations, the amount of good penetrations were 8. 1 % for Spray; 68. 3 % for Syringe, and 78. 3 % for Squeeze (p< 0. 0001). Considering all types of interventions, the Normal Middle <b>Turbinate</b> had 48. 2 % of good penetrations and the Sutured Middle <b>Turbinate,</b> 55 % (p= 0. 01). Considering only Sutured Middle <b>Turbinate,</b> {{there was no difference between}} the interventions with Syringe and Squeeze (76. 3 % vs. 80. 4 %; p= 0. 27). ConclusionTopical therapy of irrigation with a 60 -mL syringe was more effective than that with nasal spray. The status of the middle <b>turbinate</b> proved to be fundamental and influenced topical therapy. Irrigation with syringe was as effective as the squeeze bottle when the middle <b>turbinate</b> was sutured to the nasal septum...|$|R

2500|$|Empty nose {{syndrome}} (ENS), {{one form}} of secondary atrophic rhinitis, is a rare clinical syndrome in which people who have clear nasal passages experience a range of symptoms, most commonly feelings of nasal obstruction, nasal dryness and crusting, and a sensation of being unable to breathe. People who experience ENS have usually undergone a turbinectomy (removal or reduction of <b>turbinates,</b> structures inside the nose) or other surgical procedures that interfere with turbinates; the overall incidence is unknown but it appears to occur in {{a small percentage of}} those who undergo nasosinal procedures. [...] It appears to be a health care caused condition but its existence as a medical condition, cause, diagnosis and management are controversial.|$|E
2500|$|The cause may be {{changes to}} the mucous {{membrane}} of nose and to the nerve endings in the mucosa caused by chronic {{changes to the}} temperature and humidity of the air flowing inside the nose, caused in turn by removal or reduction of the <b>turbinates.</b> [...] The cause may be direct damage to the nerves caused by surgery, but because as of 2015 there was no technology that allowed mapping of the sensory nerves in the nose it {{has been difficult to}} determine if this is a cause. Because the occurrence of ENS is rare and investigators have been unable to identify consistent diagnostic features or precipitating features, psychological causes leading to a psychosomatic condition have been proposed.|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} nasal polyps in chronic rhinosinusitis is unknown, but {{the role of}} viral infections in polyp growth is {{clinically}} well established. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently emerged as key players in our local airway defense against microbes. Among these, TLR 9 has gained special interest in viral diseases. Many studies on chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) compare polyp tissue with nasal mucosa from polyp-free individuals. Knowledge about changes in the <b>turbinate</b> tissue bordering the polyp tissue is limited. To analyse the role of TLR 9 mediated microbial defense in tissue bordering the polyp. Nasal polyps and <b>turbinate</b> tissue from 11 patients with CRSwNP and <b>turbinate</b> tissue from 11 healthy controls in total were used. Five biopsies from either group were analysed immediately with flow cytometry regarding receptor expression and 6 biopsies were used for in vitro stimulation with a TLR 9 agonist, CpG. Cytokine release was analysed using Luminex. Eight patients with CRSwNP in total were intranasally challenged with CpG/placebo 24 hours before surgery and the biopsies were collected and analysed as above. TLR 9 expression was detected on <b>turbinate</b> epithelial cells from healthy controls and polyp epithelial cells from patients, whereas TLR 9 was absent in <b>turbinate</b> epithelial cells from patients. CpG stimulation increased the percentage cells expressing TLR 9 and decreased percentage cells expressing VEGFR 2 in <b>turbinate</b> tissue from patients. After CpG stimulation the elevated levels of IL- 6, G-CSF and MIP- 1 β in the <b>turbinate</b> tissue from patients were reduced towards the levels demonstrated in healthy controls. Defects in the TLR 9 mediated microbial defense in the mucosa adjacent to the anatomic origin of the polyp might explain virus induced polyp growth. CpG stimulation decreased VEGFR 2, suggesting a role for CpG in polyp formation. The focus on <b>turbinate</b> tissue in patients with CRSwNP opens new perspectives in CRSwNP-research...|$|R
