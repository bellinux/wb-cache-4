5|$|George Schwab was a German {{shoemaker}} {{who died}} in 1924. German anarchist Carl Nold claimed he learned Schwab was <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> through correspondence with other activists but no proof ever emerged. Historian Paul Avrich also suspected him but noted that while Schwab was in Chicago, he had only arrived days before. This contradicted statements by others that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> was a well-known figure in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|One day, while {{travelling}} {{around the}} city with his police officer-friend Balaji, Jagadish witnesses the explosion of a bus {{in which they had}} travelled. He manages to capture the man who laid the bomb, but he escapes from the hospital where he was kept under custody. Jagadish captures <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> again, and also forces the police officer who helped the bomber's escape, to commit suicide. Jagadish soon learns that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> is a mere executor, a sleeper agent, whose only role was to plant the bomb. He also discovers that the Islamic terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, which <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> belongs to, has planned various such attacks in the city in a couple of days. Enlisting the help of his fellow army men and Balaji, Jagadish manages to thwart these attacks and kill the sleeper cell leader's brother and eleven other terrorists, including the previously captured sleeper agent.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Eugene <b>Bombers</b> were a {{professional}} American football team based in Eugene, Oregon. The team {{was founded in}} 1966 {{as a member of}} the Pacific Football League. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> qualified for <b>the</b> postseason in 1966 but opted to forfeit as they didn't expect to draw enough spectators to meet the cost of playing. After one season in the Pacific League <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> moved to <b>the</b> Continental Football League's newly formed Pacific Division. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> played their home games at Bethel Park in Eugene. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> became inactive in 1968 due to the lack of a suitable stadium, and never reactivated.|$|R
5|$|Acting as a NATO {{observer}} of Royal Air Force procedure, Petacchi is in SPECTRE's pay to hijack <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> in mid-flight by killing its crew and flying {{it to the}} Bahamas.

5|$|Black and the FBI {{investigate}} the crime scene; Black not only realises the bomber's proficiency with explosives, but {{is able to}} work out that he viewed the bombing from the parking garage. In a bin in the garage, they find a tissue covered in Dees' semen. Black informs the FBI that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> is smart {{enough to be able}} to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{investigation}} into the 2012 Burgas bus bombing terrorist attack against Israeli citizens in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian government officially accused the Lebanese-militant movement Hezbollah of committing the attack. Five Israeli citizens, the Bulgarian bus driver, and <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> were killed. The bomb exploded as the Israeli tourists boarded a bus from the airport to their hotel.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> {{compete for}} <b>the</b> I-94 Rivalry Cup with the Kalamazoo Growlers. The rivalry began in 2014 when the Growlers entered the Northwoods League, ending <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> reign as <b>the</b> only {{team in the}} league from Michigan. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> lead <b>the</b> yearly series 2-1 as well as the all-time series 19 games to 7.|$|R
50|$|During the 1981-82 season, <b>the</b> Flin Flon <b>Bombers</b> {{pulled off}} a perfect regular season record of 42 wins, no losses, and no ties. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> were such a {{powerhouse}} in the NJHL that The Pas Huskies refused to play them in the league semi-finals. In <b>the</b> finals, <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> swept <b>the</b> Thompson King Miners in four games to claim the league title. Next was to challenge the Manitoba Junior Hockey League champion Fort Garry Blues. Much {{to the dismay of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bombers,</b> <b>the</b> Blues were from a much stronger league and crushed <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> in a 3-game-sweep by scores of 11-2, 9-1, and 10-4.|$|R
50|$|With a 9-3 record, <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> {{finished}} {{fourth in the}} final CPIFL standings, which qualified the team for <b>the</b> playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, where they defeated the first seeded Sioux City Bandits {{to advance to the}} Champions Bowl. In the first ever Champions Bowl, <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> were defeated 47-34 by the Wichita Wild.|$|R
5|$|In all Zveno configurations, all {{aircraft}} were piloted and all {{had their}} engines running — {{it was expected}} that the combined thrust would more than offset the weight and actually improve the performance of the mothership compared to conventional bombers. The fighters were rigidly attached via pyramid-shaped metal frames, with both latches controlled by the fighter pilots. (On Zveno-1, the front latches were controlled by <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> crew, while the back latch was controlled by the pilot; this was changed to all-pilot control in the next version). The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted the fighters to use fuel from <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> while attached, although this was not fully implemented in practice.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} that fighter escort was inherently desirable, {{but no one}} could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> yet retain its combat maneuverability. Failure to see this issue through proved one of the Air Corps Tactical School's major shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming {{part of the}} Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony Gaze. On 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Coates. The controller vectored the pair onto an enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> and lost sight of it and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress signals from <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> Johnson did not see it crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged. It {{was the only time}} Johnson was to engage a German bomber. By the end of January, Johnson had added another 16.35 flying hours on Spitfires.|$|E

50|$|In the Western Canadian playdowns, <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> next played Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Junior Hockey League. After {{allowing}} the series to be split after four games, <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> beat <b>the</b> Oil Kings {{the next two}} games to take the series in six. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> then beat <b>the</b> Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League's Fort William Canadiens four games straight to win the Abbott Cup.|$|R
500|$|One of <b>the</b> reasons <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> had {{sustained}} {{so little}} damage was the cloud base. Its density {{had made it}} difficult for RAF fighter controllers to direct their squadrons with accuracy. The same cloud that helped shield <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> was to obscure the target area. Its base started at [...] and its top reached [...] <b>The</b> <b>bombers</b> reached <b>the</b> Victoria Docks, but it and the other targets were covered.

5|$|The North American AJ Savage (later A-2 Savage) was a carrier-based medium bomber {{built for}} the United States Navy by North American Aviation. The {{aircraft}} was designed shortly after World War II to carry atomic bombs and this meant that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> was the heaviest aircraft thus far designed to operate from an aircraft carrier. It was powered by two piston engines and a turbojet buried in the rear fuselage. The AJ-1 first became operational in 1950 and several were based in South Korea during 1953 as a deterrent against the Communists. Of the 140 built, plus three prototypes, 30 were reconnaissance aircraft. Inflight-refueling equipment was deployed on the Savage in the mid-1950s. <b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> {{was replaced by the}} Douglas A3D Skywarrior beginning in 1957.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from <b>the</b> <b>bomber.</b> As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> mothership.|$|E
5|$|While admitting {{none of the}} {{defendants}} {{were involved in the}} bombing, the prosecution made the argument that Lingg had built the bomb and two prosecution witnesses (Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson) tried to imply the bomb thrower was helped by Spies, Fischer and Schwab. The defendants claimed they had no knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> at all.|$|E
5000|$|Houli {{was drafted}} at pick 42 in the 2006 National Draft by Essendon. He played four games for <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> in 2007 and kicked three goals. After his {{impressive}} performances in <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> 2008 NAB Cup {{he was selected}} for <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> Round 1 team to play the Kangaroos. He played {{an important part in}} helping <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> secure a 55-point victory and received the first round nomination for the AFL Rising Star award.

50|$|Following the 2004 season, <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> changed affiliations {{and became}} the {{affiliate}} of the Boston Red Sox, who had previously been affiliated with the Augusta GreenJackets, also of the South Atlantic League. On February 11, 2005, Minor League Baseball announced that <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> had been granted permission to move to Greenville, where a new park opened in 2006. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> would play in Greenville Municipal Stadium in 2005.|$|R
50|$|With a 9-3 record, <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> {{finished}} 4th in {{the final}} CPIFL standings, which qualified the team for <b>the</b> playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, where they defeated the first-seeded Sioux City Bandits {{to advance to the}} Champions Bowl.

5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|At these speeds, it was {{expected}} that the B-70 would be almost immune to interceptor aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. <b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> would spend only a few minutes over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E
5|$|Attacks {{against the}} Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul {{do not seem}} to have been {{successful}} until FEAF ordered <b>the</b> <b>Bomber</b> Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27, set to detonate at night. This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force trying to keep the pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E
50|$|Murphy {{played for}} <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> from 1982-1990. He {{was named the}} league's Most Outstanding Player in 1986 and was a two-time All-Star.

50|$|On September 2, 2015, Nichols {{was traded}} to <b>the</b> Winnipeg Blue <b>Bombers.</b> Nichols played in {{numerous}} games for <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> in 2015, {{due in large part}} to various injuries to starting QB Drew Willy. Nichols started the 2016 season as the backup to Drew Willy, however following a 1-4 start to the season head-coach Mike O'Shea announced that Nichols would be the starting QB for their week 6 match-up against Edmonton. In 2016, Nichols began his tenure as <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> starting quarterback with 7 wins in a row propelling <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> to a record of 8-4. <b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> would finish <b>the</b> season with a record of 11-7, finishing 3rd place in the Western Division. In <b>the</b> playoffs <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> were unable to hold onto a 19-point lead over the BC Lions, falling 32-31 thus ending their 2016 campaign. Drew Willy was traded in the middle of the season, and veteran quarterback Kevin Glenn was released in January 2017, confirming <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> belief that he could be their starting quarterback for the foreseeable future. This sentiment was reinforced when they signed him to a 3-year contract extension on January 18, 2017.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bombers</b> {{attracted}} many talented {{athletes and}} rugby players during the 1970s and 1980s, but finished as runner-up {{to the powerful}} and now defunct St. Louis Falcon's RFC {{for most of the}} two decades. Though <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> won several tournament titles during this period, the biggest matches were always against the Falcons. There was never a dull moment when <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> and Falcons stepped on the pitch to do battle. <b>The</b> tremendous <b>Bomber</b> tradition of playing hard rugby, supporting your club mates, and {{having a lot of fun}} doing it was built during this time.|$|R
5|$|Before the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI held many {{press conferences}} asking {{the public to}} help identify the Unabomber. They were convinced that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> was from the Chicago area (where he began his bombings), had worked or had some connection in Salt Lake City, and by the 1990s {{was associated with the}} San Francisco Bay Area. This geographical information, as well as the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released before the entire manifesto was published, persuaded David Kaczynski's wife, Linda, to urge her husband to read the manifesto.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|By this point, {{supplies}} of the Beaufighter {{and the new}} Mosquito had improved dramatically, and {{the decision was made}} to remove all single-engine designs from the night fighter force during 1942. Two Defiant units did switch to the Mk. VI, but they operated for only about four months before converting to the Mosquito. Production for the AI role ended, and the electronics were converted to Monica tail warning radars for <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> force, until the mid-1944 knowledge of the Germans' Flensburg radar detector, which spotted Monica transmissions, was revealed to the British.|$|E
50|$|On August 21, 1999, the IPFL {{announced}} two new expansion {{teams in}} Omaha and Shreveport. November 9, 1999, Shreveport introduces <b>the</b> team name (<b>Bombers)</b> and <b>the</b> logo.
