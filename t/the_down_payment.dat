The City {{is to keep}} $125million in <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment.</b> The consortium operating {{under the name of}} Midway Investment and Development Company LLC consisted of Vancouver Airport Services, Citi Infrastructure Investors, and Boston's John Hancock Life Insurance. It was awarded the contract in October 2008 by the City Council, which voted 49–0 to approve it. The consortium would have operated the airport and collected airport parking, concession, and passenger facility charges. However, Chicago would have continued to provide fire and police services. Chicago privatized the Chicago Skyway in 2007. In 2010 a new slogan emerged calling the airport The busiest square mile in the world.|$|E

25|$|On April 15, 1864, {{two weeks}} before the lease was due to expire, Willard {{tendered}} <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> to Tayloe in paper money. Tayloe refused to issue the mortgage and turn over the deed, claiming that the hotel was now worth much more than $22,500 and that Willard had not paid in gold (the only form of cash available in 1854) as specified in the lease. Worse, due to inflation, the Notes were worth only about half what gold specie was worth. Willard sued for relief.|$|E
25|$|In {{the instant}} case, the Court held that {{plaintiff}} Henry Willard had not acted in bad faith by tendering United States Notes as down {{payment for the}} sale of property, even though the contract in question specified payment in gold or silver coin. Nonetheless, the contract specified payment in coin, and payment in coin must be made. The Court also held that fluctuations in the price of the property between the date on which the contract was agreed and the date <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> was made do not create issues of equity.|$|E

Ball and Arnaz offered to take a pay cut to finance filming, on the condition that their company, Desilu, would retain the rights to that film once it was aired. CBS relinquished the show rights to Desilu after initial broadcast, not realizing they were giving away a valuable and durable asset. In 1957, CBS bought the rights back for $1,000,000 ($ in today's terms), which provided Ball and Arnaz <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> for the purchase of the former RKO Pictures studios, which became Desilu Studios.|$|E

It finally saw {{the opportunity to get}} an owned-and-operated station in what was then the United States' fifth-largest television market and quickly jumped into the bidding war for KRON. NBC was seen as the frontrunner to buy the station, until it was outbid at the last second by New York City-based Young Broadcasting, then-owner of Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV and several other stations in medium to small markets, on November 16, 1999. Young's purchase price for the station ($750 million at the outset, rising to $820 million by closing) was a record price for a single station that stands to this day.

500|$|When {{mortgage}} lenders {{consider whether}} to underwrite a particular loan, {{they look to}} {{factors such as the}} creditworthiness of the borrower and the amount of down payment the borrower will be making. [...] The amount of <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> required by the mortgage lender can be as high as 20% of the home's purchase price. [...] In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> requirement can be substantially reduced if repayment of the mortgage is guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), an agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). [...] The required down payment under such FHA insured loans has varied over time; in the 1990s it was 3% of the home's purchase price.|$|E

500|$|Legislative {{responses}} {{began in}} early 2004, when a {{subcommittee of the}} House Committee on Financial Services held hearings on {{a bill that would}} create a so-called Zero Downpayment Program administered by the FHA. [...] The president of the Nehemiah Corporation gave testimony at those hearings, expressing concern about a provision in the bill that would allow FHA to assess mortgage-insurance premiums that were higher than those required from borrowers who did provide a down payment. [...] With those higher premiums, Nehemiah's president wrote, [...] "we might as well simply continue to offer the zero down payment option primarily through <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> assistance industry".

500|$|In its {{original}} form, the qualification requirements for an FHA insured loan {{called for the}} borrower to be his/her own source of funds for <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment.</b> [...] In 1996, the U.S. Congress amended the statute to permit the down-payment funds {{to come from a}} family member of the borrower. [...] However, HUD subsequently issued guidelines that considerably expanded the list of exceptions beyond that which appeared in the statute. [...] The expanded list included, for example, the borrower's employer or labor union. [...] The expanded list also included [...] "charitable organizations". [...] That guideline also noted that [...] "As a rule, our concern is not with how the donor obtains the gift funds provided they are not derived in any manner from a party to the sales transaction". [...] In 1996, HUD issued Mortgagee Letter 96–18, stating [...] "a nonprofit or other organization that provides bona fide gifts to eligible participants should not compel the beneficiary to purchase only properties owned by the donor of the funds.

50|$|A <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> {{refers to}} <b>the</b> cash {{paid to the}} lender for the home and {{represents}} the initial homeowners' equity or financial interest in the home. A low <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> means that a home represents a highly leveraged investment for the homeowner, with little equity relative to debt. In such circumstances, only small declines {{in the value of}} the home result in negative equity, a situation in which the value of the home is less than the mortgage amount owed. In 2005, <b>the</b> median <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> for first-time home buyers was 2%, with 43% of those buyers making no <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> whatsoever.

5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} [...] "silent seconds" [...] HUD condoned and promoted <b>the</b> use of <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> gifting programs. These programs generally worked as follows: [...] "Let's say someone wanted to buy a $100,000 house but didn't have <b>the</b> required <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> and closing costs, which we will say totaled $6,000. A nonprofit 'affordable housing' organization would provide the required $6000 to the homebuyer as a 'gift' and, simultaneously, collect the same amount — plus a tidy fee (usually 1% or a flat fee) — from the seller. The amount collected from the seller was called a 'donation' but, in reality, it was simply money laundering, conducted by pious organizations that talked about the poor and needy while raking in millions in revenues. Although HUD's Inspector General urged, in 2000, that seller-funded gift programs be banned, HUD resisted until 2008, well after the beginning of the subprime mortgage crisis. Seller-funded <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> were finally banned by an act of Congress in 2008.|$|R

500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother.

In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop.

[...] If not, then no relief was likely: The contract had expired, and Willard had not acted in a timely fashion to secure his rights under it by submitting a cash down-payment. But if he had acted in good faith, then Willard would be able to seek relief from courts of equity. The constitutionality of the National Banking Act was not at issue, the Court said, because the issue before the Court was not whether paper currency constituted [...] "cash" [...] but whether Willard acted in good faith (e.g., had assumed in good faith that U.S. Notes constitute cash, as Congress had said they did). Field laid out extensive reasons for why Willard had acted in good faith: ...|$|E
2500|$|Tayloe's lease to Willard later {{generated}} {{an important}} {{case before the}} Supreme Court of the United States. In 1854, Tayloe leased the property again to Willard, this time for 10 years {{at a rate of}} $1,200 per year. The lease contained a provision that Willard could purchase the entire property {{at any time during the}} life of the lease for $22,500—$2,000 in [...] "cash" [...] down payment and another $2,000 a year plus interest thereafter until the mortgage was paid. During the lease, the Civil War broke out and property values in Washington, D.C., skyrocketed. In 1863, Congress passed the National Banking Act, which authorized the federal government to issue United States Notes (paper money) rather than certificates redeemable in gold. On April 15, 1864, two weeks before the lease was due to expire, Willard tendered <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> to Tayloe in paper money. Tayloe refused to issue the mortgage and turn over the deed, claiming that the hotel was now worth much more than $22,500 and that Willard had not paid in gold (the only form of cash available in 1854) as specified in the lease. Willard sued. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia held against Willard. [...] Willard appealed. In 1869, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the terms of the lease should not be interpreted as of the date it was agreed to (1854). Congress had made the use of gold and silver as currency illegal during the war, and this change in the law enabled Willard to pay <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> in paper currency. The Court also held that the terms of the lease did not provide for a re-evaluation of the worth of the hotel, and that Willard was entitled to the original $22,500 purchase price. For many years, the decision was the leading case in contract law regarding intent and enforcement.|$|E

50|$|However, {{precaution}} is not {{the most}} common reason for deleveraging. Deleveraging usually happens after a market downturn and hence is driven by the need to cover loss, which can deplete capital, build a less risky profile, or is required by nervous lenders to prevent default.
