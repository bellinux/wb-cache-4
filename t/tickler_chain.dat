40|$|The {{communication}} {{deals with}} the results of comparative tests conducted from Cochin base to study the effect of a <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> on the catches landed by a 55 ' shrimp otter trawl. The net was operated with and without chain and 82 hauls of 61 hours and 28 minutes total duration were made. The following are the conclusions: (a) the catch of shrimp per hour of trawling is increased by about 71 % due to attachment of the chain to the ground rope; (b) the attachment of the <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> also increased the catch of fish by 25 %. The increase in the catch of shrimps and fish is probably due to the disturbance caused by moving chain attached to the foot-rope...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} efficiencies of a No. 36 Yankee {{shrimp trawl}} and a No. 41. 5 Yankee otter trawl in catching three species of flatfishes (witch flounder, American plaice and Greenland halibut) were compared from data collected during research-vessel {{surveys of the}} northeastern Gulf of St. Lawrence. The shrimp trawl outfished the otter trawl in catching juveniles « 30 ern) of the three species, the greatest differences being for witch flounder and American plaice. The performance of the shrimp trawl, without and with a <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> attached to the footrope, in catching juvenile and commercial-sized (~ 30 ern) flatfishes was evaluated {{from a series of}} replicate tows.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} some background {{information about the}} developments in the prawn fishing technique. The important indigenous gear for prawns are the filtering type nets like the stake nets, boat seines and beach seines with bag. The only indigenous net, which can be compared in design with the modern bottom trawling gear, is the "Thuri Valai" of the Madras Coast. Prawns have also been reported from the catches of gill nets and cast nets. Dredges and beam trawls are simplest among the dragged gear. Even though several earlier attempts were made with the beam trawl, in 1959 season a detailed experiment was made to study the fishing features of this gear. The subsequent experiments conducted were for comparison with otter trawl, towing of 2 beam trawls one behind the other {{and the use of}} <b>tickler</b> <b>chain.</b> The initial experiments with otter trawls were mainly directed towards operational aspects. The experiments were {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} fully mechanised and partially mechanised operation, the effect of extra buoyancy of floats and the use of <b>tickler</b> <b>chain.</b> Subsequent developments had been on the structure and design of prawn trawling gear. Effect of long wings and sweeps were tested. Catches of nylon and cotton nets were compared. The sizes of meshes of the cod-end have also been increased...|$|E
40|$|In trawl fisheries, {{beam trawls}} with <b>tickler</b> <b>chains,</b> chain mats or bobbin ropes {{are used to}} target {{flatfish}} or shrimp. High fuel consumption, seabed disturbance and high discard rates are well-known disadvantages of this fishing technique. These shortcomings are increasingly gaining international public and political attention, especially with the upcoming discard ban in Europe. The most promising alternative fishing technique meeting both the fisherman's aspirations, {{and the need for}} ecological progress is pulse fishing with electrotrawls. Here, the mechanical stimulation by <b>tickler</b> <b>chains</b> or bobbins is replaced by electrical stimulation resulting in reduced bottom contact, fuel costs and discards. Although a significant amount of research has been done on electrotrawls and their impact on marine organisms, most data were published in very diverse sources ranging from local non-peer-reviewed reports with a limited distribution to highly consulted international peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, there is a clear need for a comprehensive yet concise and critical overview, covering and summarizing all these data and making these available for the scientific community. This article aims to meet the above goals by discussing the working principle of electric fields, the history of electrotrawls and their current application in the North Sea and impact on marine organisms. It is concluded by elaborating on the opportunities and challenges for the further implementation of this alternative fishing techniqu...|$|R
40|$|An EU funded {{research}} project {{was started in}} 1998 by institutes from Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany to reduce the adverse environmental impact of demersal trawls. In the frame of this project the Institute for Fishery Technique of the Federal Research Centre for Fisheries, Hamburg, is developing a jet beamtrawl replacing the heavy <b>tickler</b> <b>chains</b> of a traditional flatfish beam trawl by water jet nozzles placed at the lower side of the beam with the jets directed towards the sea bottom. First trials on the dutch research vessel “Tridens” were performed in March 1998. Catch and bycatch of a jet beamtrawl and a traditional beamtrawl were compared. The efficiency of the jet beamtrawl was not satisfactory {{and will have to}} be improved...|$|R
50|$|Electric {{pulse fishing}} is a fishing {{technique}} sometimes used in trawl fisheries which produces a limited electric field above the seabed to catch fish. The pulse trawl gear {{consists of a}} number of electrodes, attached to the gear in the tow direction, that emit short electric pulses. The electrodes replace the <b>tickler</b> <b>chains</b> that are used in traditional beam trawl fishery. The pulse trawl fishery is mainly aimed at flatfish like sole, with by-catch plaice. In addition, the pulse trawl gear is applied in shrimp fisheries on a limited scale. Technically, the use of electricity to catch fish is prohibited in European waters. However, the European Union is able to provides exemptions to this rule since 2007. These exemptions are now mainly used by Dutch and British trawlers in the North Sea.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experiments with}} modified beam trawls {{aimed at reducing}} discard rates and direct mortality of benthic in-fauna and epi-fauna without affecting the level of landings. Drop-out panels made of large meshes {{in the belly of}} the net were effective in reducing by-catch, but the penalty was a loss in landings (particularly sole, plaice, dab). Effective release of heavy invertebrates (quahog, prickly cockle) seems possible. An alternative parabolic <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> arrangement did not reduce landings nor by-catch. Parallel chains seemed to offer more potential in reducing by-catch, particularly shellfish, but significant losses in landings also occurred. The configuration used here, with ticklers fitted on the ground rope, caused an increase in direct mortality of benthic invertebrates and is therefore not recommende...|$|E
40|$|Comparative fishing {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in May 2011 (week 19) on commercial beam trawlers fishing with conventional <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> beam trawls (on MFV GO 4), pulse wings made by HFK-Engineering of Baarn, the Netherlands (MFV TX 36), and pulse trawls produced by the DELMECO-Group of Goes, the Netherlands (version used on MFV TX 68). The three vessels fished side-by-side as much as possible. Landings and discards of these vessels were monitored. Special emphasis was given on cod and whiting, that were dissected to study possible spinal damage. Result for TX 36 and TX 68 are {{expressed in terms of}} percentages of GO 4. The pulse characteristics were as follows: TX 36 : voltage 45 V 0 to peak, pulse frequency: 45 Hz, pulse duration 380 μs; electric power on single gear: 7. 0 kW; TX 68 : voltage 50 V 0 to peak, pulse frequency: 50 Hz, pulse duration 220 μs; electric power on single gear: 8. 5 kW. The fuel consumption recorded over the whole week was considerably lower for the pulse trawls, i. e. on TX 36 (40 %) and on TX 68 (54 %), than for the <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> beam trawls used on the GO 4. The net earnings (taken as gross earnings minus fuel costs) for the TX 36 were almost twice as large at 186 %, and for the TX 68 also considerably higher at 155 %. The vessels with pulse trawls caught fewer (65 - 69 %) target species, but also less (30 - 50 %) immature and non-target fish ('discards'), and benthic species (48 - 73 %) than the vessel with tickler chains on these fishing grounds and in this period. The pulse gears caught fewer (19 - 42 %) kg per hour cod than the <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> beam trawls, but the catches of cod on all three vessels were very small. For plaice and dab these differences were statistically proven, for brill, turbot and cod this was not the case. There was no marked difference between both pulse trawl vessels in total landings. The TX 68 caught less marketable sole, but not significantly less undersized sole than the GO 4. The TX 36 caught less undersized sole, but here the difference in marketable fish was not significant. Catches of brill and turbot were so small that no statistically substantiated conclusion could be drawn. Only for undersized turbot the TX 36 caught less. For whiting we found a demonstrable reduction in both marketable and undersized fish in both pulse fishing vessels. The TX 36 caught less whiting in number per hour. The CPUEs found from the auction data and the sampled hauls correlated reasonably well for the most abundant species, such as plaice and sole. However, for less abundant species the results did not match very well, and care should be taken to increase the sampling rate in future comparative fishing studies. Spinal fracture in cod occurred under pulse stimulation but to a limited extent in both marketable and undersized fish. There is an indication that this happens slightly more on TX 68 (11 %) than on TX 36 (7 %). Whiting hardly seems to suffer any damage...|$|E
40|$|Link {{chains are}} widely used in many {{different}} sectors of industry, for example in hoist applications, marine applications, manure chains in agricultural applications, snow chains for cars or even as a bicycle lock. A more specific application is the <b>tickler</b> <b>chain,</b> where the link chain is used to drag over the seabed {{in order to increase}} the catch rate. In this case the link chain is subjected to extreme abrasive wear due to the sand and seawater environment. Fracture of these chains causes serious economical damage due to downtime and especially production loss. The main objective of this research is to quantify the most important wear mechanisms that act on a link chain, and with that knowledge to try to design and build a reliable test rig that simulates abrasive wear of tickler chains. With these simulation results the chain parameters, such as geometry and material, can be improved in order to decrease the wear rate...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the changes in}} the Dutch demersal fishing fleet since the 1950 s revealed that competitive interactions among vessels and gear types within the constraints imposed by biological, economic and fisheries management factors are the dominant processes governing the dynamics of fishing fleets. Double beam trawling, introduced in the early 1960 s, proved a successful fishing method to catch deep burying flatfish, in particular sole. In less than 10 years, the otter trawl fleet was replaced by a highly specialised beam trawling fleet, despite an initial doubling of the loss rate of vessels due to stability problems. Engine power, size of the beam trawl, number of <b>tickler</b> <b>chains</b> and fishing speed rapidly increased and fishing activities expanded into previously lightly fished grounds and seasons. Following the ban on flatfish trawling within the 12 nautical mile zone for vessels of more than 300 hp in 1975 and with the restriction of engine power to 2000 hp in 1987, the beam trawl fleet bifurcated. Changes in the fleet capacity were related to the economic results and showed a cyclic pattern with a period of 6 ¿ 7 years. The arms race between fishers was fuelled by competitive interactions among fishers: while the catchability of the fleet more than doubled in the ten years following the introduction of the beam trawl, a decline in catchability was observed in reference beam trawlers that remained the same. Vessel performance was not only affected by the technological characteristics but also by the number and characteristics of competing vessels...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{estimates}} of discard survival {{are difficult to}} obtain due to the complex logistics of survival studies, either by accommodating organisms in holding tanks or by tagging. There are few studies on the survival of discards in beam trawl fisheries (Table A 1 in APPENDIX for an overview until 2013), and up till today (March 2014) {{most of them have}} focused on the short-term survival using holding facilities in on-board tanks (Depestele et al., 2014; Revill et al., 2013) or underwater cages (Uhlmann et al., 2014; van Marlen et al., 2013). To our knowledge only very limited information is available on successful tagging studies in beam trawl fishery. As a consequence of the complex methodology, there are only a very limited number of species and/or individuals investigated, thus leading to the investigation of yet another modest number of influential factors. The complex logistic nature of onboard survival tank studies, especially when conducted on-board commercial vessels, resulted in a narrow focus of potential key aspects, such as haul duration, number of <b>tickler</b> <b>chains</b> (van Beek et al., 1990), catch weight (Depestele et al., 2014), or maturity (Revill et al., 2013), etc. Major influential factors could nevertheless be numerous. Beam trawl fisheries, as many other fisheries, disturb fish throughout the catching process, starting by the encounter of the chains (or pulses), followed by a stressing period (e. g. fish trying to escape the net) and culminating in a physical and internal damaging process during retention in the codend, release on deck, and subsequent sorting...|$|R
40|$|A clear {{change of}} species {{distribution}} in the North Sea can be deduced when comparing the maps from Olsen’s Piscatorial Atlas published in 1883 with present fish surveys. Many species have disappeared from large areas. For example, 20, 000 km² of oyster beds disappeared, most likely due {{to a combination of}} overfishing, possibly climate change and diseases. This had large consequences for the local biodiversity. Even in Olsen’s time, there was concern about the fishing pressure. And human pressure upon this vulnerable ecosystem keeps increasing. Apart from traditional uses such as fisheries, gas, oil and sand extraction and shipping, new functions such as wind energy, offshore protection and the possible construction of new islands are using more and more space. The first offshore wind park is now operational in The Netherlands and a large research program is being conducted concerning the possible effects of this type of park upon benthic fauna, fish, birds and sea mammals. Initial results indicate that some birds profit from the park while others avoid it. At the same time new parks are being planned, and if this continues the Dutch section of the North Sea may be strewn with small-sized wind parks in tens years time. But is this wise? Both for ecological and safety reasons it seems much better to build a few large parks instead of many small ones. And this is just on of the problems with spatial planning in the sea. For centuries, the Dutch part of the North Sea has been heavily fished. Since the 1960 s a large beam trawl fleet has been harvesting sole and plaice using 4 and 12 m beam trawls with <b>tickler</b> <b>chains</b> that frequently plough or rake most of the sea floor in this area. The direct effects of this type of fisheries are well known. Large amounts of unwanted by-catch are discarded and die. The long-term effects include destruction of habitats and shifts in biodiversity, species composition or age structure of benthic invertebrate and fish communities. Recent studies show clear differences between the fished and non-fished areas. The EU has asked the member states to create Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to stop further deterioration of the marine realm. Plans for their designation are under development. In the near future, sustainability targets will have to be defined for these areas. However, the development of the marine ecosystem {{is the result of a}} very complex interplay between natural and human induced causes, the final result being an integrated summation of the effects of manageable and non-manageable factors. When managing the development of MPAs we have to take into account effects of climate change, pollution, introduced species and other drivers. In the presentation, the possible establishment of MPAs in the southern part of the North Sea and its values for spatial planning and conservation of marine biodiversity will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Pulse {{trawling}} {{is used to}} {{a growing}} extent in the Dutch flatfish beam trawl fleet, and deemed as a promising alternative to <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> beam trawling. A comparative fishing experiment was carried out with one vessel using conventional beam trawls, {{and the other two}} using flatfish pulse trawls supplied by two different companies. Pulse trawl landings were lower both expressed in kg h- 1 (67 % based on auction data) or baskets per hectare (81 %). The pulse trawls had fewer fish discards (57 %, p < 0. 0001), including 62 % undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.) (p < 0. 0001), and 80 % discarded weight of benthic invertebrates (p = 0. 0198) per hectare. The pulse fishing technique resulted in a lower fuel consumption (37 – 49 %), and consequently in spite of lower landings net revenues were higher. A downside of using pulse trawls is the possible spinal damage of marketable cod (Gadus morhua L.), but because total cod landings by beam trawls are low (4 – 5 %), the implication will likely be limited...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experiments aimed to improve the selectivity of beam trawls in the North Sea for roundfish whilst minimizing losses on target flatfish. Large-meshed top panels were designed for the <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> type of beam trawls used in this fishery. The design process involved model studies in a flume tank, feasibility trials at sea on a research vessel, and comparative fishing trials on chartered commercial fishing vessels. A total of 11 weeks with 450 hauls in total were fished on two categories of vessels, namely 300 and 1500 ¿ 2000 hp, representing the major groups in the Dutch fleet. An economic evaluation was also carried out with the landings data from the fish auction. A reduction of 30 ¿ 40 or cod and whiting could be obtained with the new gear design, with virtually no losses in flatfish (particularly sole and plaice). The results were communicated extensively with representatives of the fishing industry throughout the project. The new gears were found to be effective and acceptable for the fishing industry. Their implementation would help reducing fishing mortality of these species...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} nine fishing trips with on board {{observers}} {{were carried out}} on MFV UK 153 (PT 1) and two beam trawlers (BT 1, BT 2) of comparative engine power and size to appraise the performance of pulse beam v. s. conventional <b>tickler</b> <b>chain</b> beam trawls. The main conclusions from this study are: 1. Landings of plaice and sole are significantly lower in the pulse trawl {{when compared to the}} conventional beam trawl. 2. There {{was no significant difference in}} the catch rates of undersized (discard) plaice between the pulse trawl and the conventional trawl. 3. In the pulse trawl, the catch rates of undersized (discard) sole were significantly lower than in the conventional beam trawl. 4. The catch rates of benthic fauna (nrs/hr of Astropecten irregularis, Asterias rubens, and Liocarcinus holsatus) were significantly lower in the pulse trawl compared to the conventional beam trawl. 5. There are indications that undersized plaice are damaged to a lesser degree in the pulse trawl and will survive better in the pulse trawl. Based on previous research, these results would indicate a survival rate of plaice in the pulse trawl that is twice as high as in a conventional beam trawl. But since the method of determining damage to fish by visual observation is subjective, this conclusion should be treated with caution...|$|E
