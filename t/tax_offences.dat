5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income <b>tax</b> <b>offences</b> and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E

40|$|The {{principles}} {{of the system of}} criminal penalties inspire the legal construct of complicity in the administrative <b>tax</b> <b>offence.</b> However, the latter has relevant specifities that are particularly evident in two cases. First, when the violation ascribable to the taxpayer is also a consequence of the contribution of a tax advisor through his expertise. Second, when the <b>tax</b> <b>offence</b> is physically committed by an individual but in the interest of another natural or legal person. Furthermore, this paper underlines that the tax penalty system should be even more focused on the beneficiary of the <b>tax</b> <b>offence</b> rather on than its perpetrator, and in order to gain this aim, it is suggested to modify some rules today in force...|$|R

40|$|Although in many people’s opinion the European Convention on Human Rights {{has nothing}} to do with taxation, the {{evidence}} of its involvment comes out as a matter of fact. Actually, in the last years the European Court on Human Rights have heard an increasing number of tax cases, so that we could say it has become almost a “regular” tax court. The ECtHR has achieved more and more importance in tax matters, especially since its rulings are taken into account by national courts and arguably also influence tax policies of member States of the Council of Europe. Anyway, since from a tax perspective we have not any specific provision in the ECHR, we must look for which of its provisions can be more involved in taxation issues. The ECtHR’s jurisprudence is very helpful in this research. For example, Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention of Human Rights is the most important one, as it defines the right to property as well as the right of States to tax their citizens. Over the last few years, on various occasions the Court has heavily criticized States which refuse to grant VAT refunds. In the Court’s opinion, the right to a VAT refund is a possession protected by a citizen’s right to property. Nevertheless, rulings by the ECtHR have also had an impact on tax policy, including direct taxes. The ECtHR’s decisions are also important with regard to the right to a fair hearing in tax disputes (Article 6 — Right to a fair trial). According to its case law, the right to a fair hearing applies exclusively to criminal charges and to the determination of civil rights and civil charges. At the same time, for its purpose of interpreting the European Convention of Human Rights, the ECtHR has classified many tax disputes as “criminal charges”. Case law by the ECtHR has also upheld citizens’ rights in various other relevant tax issues; the ECtHR has expressed views on important tax related issues such as discriminatory taxation, the right to privacy and freedom of conscience and religion. Last, but not least, the Court has decided that in tax disputes the principle of ne bis in idem, dealt with in Article 4 of Protocol 7 to the European Convention of Human Rights, applies, i. e. a citizen should not be punished twice for the same <b>tax</b> <b>offence...</b>|$|R

40|$|PhD (Tax), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Fraud, corruption, {{and related}} {{taxation}} consequences from a financial and a moral perspective were investigated in this study. A literature review of tax ethics, tax morality, tax conduct, tax planning, tax avoidance, tax evasion, tax fraud, white-collar crime, fraud, money laundering, corruption and corporate governance are presented. The research methodology and empirical investigation followed, the research results achieved, and the conclusions and recommendations made, are also presented. The most import conclusions {{from this study}} are that economic crime (such as fraud and corruption) {{has an impact on}} taxation in South Africa, that economic crime offences ignore any possible taxation consequences and that the type of the economic crime being perpetrated {{is a function of the}} opportunities available to a potential offender. The majority of the respondents (both economic crime offenders and role-players in the field of the prevention, detection and prosecution of fraud, corruption and <b>tax</b> related <b>offences)</b> indicated that law enforcement, prosecution and sentencing practices are not adequate in South Africa. However, the majority of both groups of respondents also indicated that current laws and regulations are adequate to address economic crime in South Africa. This could be interpreted as a vote of confidence in current laws and regulations but an indication that it should be applied more effectively in the fight against economic crime. Within the legal framework of the criminal justice system and the various taxation laws and regulations in South Africa, there are always opportunities for people to come into conflict with the law. This study was also undertaken to investigate an economic crime offender’s perceptions of fraud, corruption and tax-related offences. In total 82 economic crime offenders, serving a prison term for their offences, completed a questionnaire and were personally interviewed in a semi-structured interview comprising pre-set questions. The study demonstrated that there is a correlation between an economic crime offender’s level of education and the monetary extent of the perpetrated offence. In perpetrating an economic crime, the offender is only concerned about the immediate financial reward, disregarding any possible consequences such as taxation or prosecution. To prevent fraud, corruption and tax-related offences, the motivation to commit such crimes should be eliminated or reduced. Fraudsters weigh up the individual risks and rewards of their criminal behaviour, and for that reason, their future conduct can be modified with appropriate rehabilitation and anti-economic crime education programs. Consequently, this study has vital implications for reformulating appropriate rehabilitation programmes for economic crime offenders. Economic crime offenders should be subject to an anti-economic crime education program in which the consequences of perpetrating economic crime in general on the economy and tax revenue could be conveyed to such offenders. Rehabilitation programs designed and developed specifically for economic crime offenders should be implemented at correctional institutions. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|The Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) revised in February 2012 include “tax crimes (related {{to direct}} taxes and {{indirect}} taxes) ” {{in the list}} of “designated categories of offences”. Thus, states are encouraged to include a range of <b>tax</b> <b>offences</b> in their definition of predicate offences. However, the standards defined by FATF are not compulsory, and they are framed in a fairly supple manner, allowing the national lawmakers to limit money laundering to the proceeds of serious offences and to decide how they will define the predicate offences and any elements that make them serious. The pressure on Switzerland to define predicate crimes in tax matters must nevertheless be considered as strong, since many countries already consider that money laundering can be committed in relation to such crimes and strive to create a level playing field for the financial industry. This contribution reflects on how serious <b>tax</b> <b>offences</b> could be defined with the aim not only of satisfying the international standards, but also and foremost, of giving adequate assistance and protection to Swiss criminal enquiries in tax matters. It then analyses how the requirement that the laundered assets are “proceeds” of the predicate offence could be dealt with in this context. Finally, it evaluates the possible impact of the creation of predicate tax crimes on the due diligence duties of financial intermediaries...|$|E

One of the variants of restructuring is the duty assignment of separate organizations to carry out the external tax audit at legislative level, which is executed by the auditors (independent accountants), which got the applicable accreditation in the authorized state body, and then to give the proper conclusions to the taxes authorities and to execute all the recommendations according to the amendments of violations of the tax legislation found in the process of the tax audit conducting.
