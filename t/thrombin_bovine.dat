40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the most}} anticipated, but {{potentially}} serious complications during or after surgery are bleeding events. Among the many potential factors associated with bleeding complications in surgery, the use of <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> has been anecdotally identified as a possible cause of increased bleeding risk. Most of these reports of bleeding events {{in association with the}} use of topical <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> have been limited to case reports lacking clear cause and effect relationship determination. Recent studies have failed to establish significant differences in the rates of bleeding events between those treated with <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> and those treated with either human or recombinant thrombin. Methods We conducted a search of MEDLINE for the most recent past 10 years (1997 – 2007) and identified all published studies that reported a study of surgical patients with a clear objective to examine the risk of bleeding events in surgical patients. We also specifically noted the reporting of any topical <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> used during surgical procedures. We aimed to examine whether there were any differences in the risk of bleeds in general surgical populations as compared to those studies that reported exposure to topical <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin.</b> Results We identified 21 clinical studies that addressed the risk of bleeding in surgery. Of these, 5 studies analyzed the use of <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> sealants in surgical patients. There were no standardized definitions for bleeding events employed across these studies. The rates of bleeds in the general surgery studies ranged from 0. 1 %– 20. 2 %, with most studies reporting rates between 2. 6 %– 4 %. The rates of bleeding events ranged from 0. 0 %– 13 % in the <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> studies with most studies reporting between a 2 %– 3 % rate. Conclusion The risk of bleeds was not clearly different in those studies reporting use of <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> in all patients compared to the other surgical populations studied. A well-designed and well-controlled study is needed to accurately examine the bleeding risks in surgical patients treated and unexposed to topical <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin,</b> and to evaluate the independent risk associated with topical <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> as well as other risk factors. </p...|$|R

In particular, bile acids such as lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) {{have been considered}} quite useful as starting points for a rich and different set of medicinal chemistry activities. Besides, the discovery of bioactive ingredients from plants and fungi is always the main target in medicinal chemistry. The lanostane-type triterpenoid 3 b-hydroxylanosta- 8, 24 -diene- 21 -oic acid (Trametenolic acid, TMA) was the main bioactive component of Gloeophyllum odoratum, which was reported to possess widely bioactivities, including tumor cell anti-proliferation effects (for example, human HL- 60 leukemia, human KB epidermoid carcinoma, murine L 1210 leukemia cells, Caski, HT- 3, T- 24, etc.), inhibition of enzyme activity (human <b>thrombin,</b> <b>bovine</b> trypsin and so on). Nevertheless, trametenolic acid was scarcely investigated as antimicrobial agent.

On {{the basis of these}} considerations, six new compounds bearing a guanidine moiety in their side chain were synthesized using LCA, UDCA and TMA as starting materials.

Because of its excellent biocompatibility fibrin {{has become a}} frequently used matrix in tissue engineering. To date, autologous fibrinogen has usually been polymerised with bovine <b>thrombin.</b> <b>Bovine</b> thrombin, however can cause severe immunological side effects {{and in some cases}} patients even died after recurrent use. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore the practicability of obtaining autologous thrombin from a single patient in an adequate concentration and amount. After fibrinogen was cryoprecipitated from about 200 ml of freshly-frozen plasma, thrombin was isolated from the supernatant through ion-exchange chromatography. The thrombin was first bound to Sephadex A- 50, then eluated using a salt buffer and finally purified from the salt through Sephadex G- 50. To provide a system for clinical application a prototype of a single use unit which allowed preparation in a closed system was developed. With this prototype we reached a high variety of thrombin concentration from 0, 4  600 NIH with a mean of 129, 39 NIH and a standard deviation of +/- 244, 47 NIH. Because of the poor reproducibility of the thrombin activity, the production unit was modified into an open system to get a better control of every single preparation step. The thrombin concentration with this open system reached a higher homogeneity of thrombin with activities between 51, 9  414 NIH a mean of 186, 2 and a standard deviation of +/- 81, 1 NIH. The study has shown that it is possible to obtain a sufficient amount of autologous thrombin from a single donor to create a fibrin matrix of high efficiency without the risk of immunological and infectious side effects. In a first clinical application the fibrin matrix has been used to reconstruct a defect of an auricle. Chondrocytes were amplified after taking a small sample of costal cartilage and autogenous blood plasma was processed to fibrinogen, thrombin and serum. A form for building an exactly suiting transplant was made using epithetic techniques. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to engineer a precisely formed cartilage graft made of pure autogenous components. Though the transplant fitted exactly into the existent defect at time of transplantation the long term result was rather moderate. After resorption processes the cartilage lost plastic stability and had to be supported with ear cartilage from the left side. The maintenance of a precise anatomic architecture remains the most significant hurdle to overcome. In particular the in vivo integration and the protection of the engineered transplants after implantation needs more attention, before this technology is clinically more feasible in plastic and reconstructive surgery...|$|E

A recent study correlated the presence of plasma antibovine thrombin antibodies with graft thrombosis in hemodialysis patients. We therefore hypothesized that perioperative topical <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> exposure would lead to the development of antibovine thrombin antibodies and graft thrombosis. We screened 314 hemodialysis patients and identified 73 patients who had 74 grafts placed for whom complete data on perioperative topical <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> exposure and subsequent graft outcomes was available. Sixty-one of these patients were available for retrospective measurement of antibovine thrombin antibodies, antihuman thrombin antibodies, and the thrombin activation markers thrombin activatible fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and thrombin precursor protein (TpP™). In these grafts, there was no significant association between topical <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> exposure and primary assisted patency (P = 0. 37). The presence of antibovine thrombin antibodies (P = 0. 13), antihuman thrombin antibodies (P = 0. 10), and increased TAFI (P = 0. 18) were associated with trends toward reduced primary assisted patency which did not reach significance.

Topical <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> {{has been used to}} promote hemostasis after surgical procedures for over 60 years and is used frequently as a topical hemostatic agent in cardiac surgery. Recently, use of <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> has been reported to be associated with increased risk for anaphylaxis, thrombosis, and immune-mediated coagulopathy thought secondary to the production of antifactor V and antithrombin antibodies. In patients who develop bovine thrombin-induced immune-mediated coagulopathy, clinical manifestations may range from asymptomatic alterations in coagulation tests to severe hemorrhage and death. Patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures may be at increased risk for development of antibodies to <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> products and associated complications. This adverse immunologic profile has {{led to the development of}} alternative preparations including a human and a recombinant thrombin which have been shown to be equally efficacious to <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> and have reduced antigenicity.

Commercially available <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> was used as control. The content of the growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor beta polypeptide, and transforming growth factor beta, were assessed in both the clot and supernatant.

40|$|Activated {{autologous}} {{platelet-rich plasma}} (PRP) used in therapeutic wound healing applications is poorly characterized and standardized. Using pulsed electric fields (PEF) to activate platelets may reduce variability and eliminate complications {{associated with the}} use of <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin.</b> We previously reported that exposing PRP to sub-microsecond duration, high electric field (SMHEF) pulses generates a greater number of platelet-derived microparticles, increased expression of prothrombotic platelet surfaces, and differential release of growth factors compared to thrombin. Moreover, the platelet releasate produced by SMHEF pulses induced greater cell proliferation than plasma. To determine whether sub-microsecond duration, low electric field (SMLEF) bipolar pulses results in differential activation of PRP compared to SMHEF, with respect to profiles of activation markers, growth factor release, and cell proliferation capacity. PRP activation by SMLEF bipolar pulses was compared to SMHEF pulses and <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin.</b> PRP was prepared using the Harvest SmartPreP 2 System from acid citrate dextrose anticoagulated healthy donor blood. PEF activation by either SMHEF or SMLEF pulses was performed using a standard electroporation cuvette preloaded with CaCl 2 and a prototype instrument designed to take into account the electrical properties of PRP. Flow cytometry was used to assess platelet surface P-selectin expression, and annexin V binding. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial growth factor (EGF) and platelet factor 4 (PF 4), and were measured by ELISA. The ability of supernatants to stimulate proliferation of human epithelial cells in culture was also evaluated. Controls included vehicle-treated, unactivated PRP and PRP with 10 mM CaCl 2 activated with 1 U/mL <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin.</b> PRP activated with SMLEF bipolar pulses or thrombin had similar light scatter profiles, consistent with the presence of platelet-derived microparticles, platelets, and platelet aggregates whereas SMHEF pulses primarily resulted in platelet-derived microparticles. Microparticles and platelets in PRP activated with SMLEF bipolar pulses had significantly lower annexin V-positivity than those following SMHEF activation. In contrast, the % P-selectin positivity and surface P-selectin expression (MFI) for platelets and microparticles in SMLEF bipolar pulse activated PRP was significantly higher than that in SMHEF-activated PRP, but not significantly different from that produced by thrombin activation. Higher levels of EGF were observed following either SMLEF bipolar pulses or SMHEF pulses of PRP than after <b>bovine</b> <b>thrombin</b> activation while VEGF, PDGF, and PF 4 levels were similar with all three activating conditions. Cell proliferation was significantly increased by releasates of both SMLEF bipolar pulse and SMHEF pulse activated PRP compared to plasma alone. PEF activation of PRP at bipolar low vs. monopolar high field strength results in differential platelet-derived microparticle production and activation of platelet surface procoagulant markers while inducing similar release of growth factors and similar capacity to induce cell proliferation. Stimulation of PRP with SMLEF bipolar pulses is gentler than SMHEF pulses, resulting in less platelet microparticle generation but with overall activation levels similar to that obtained with thrombin. These results suggest that PEF provides the means to alter, in a controlled fashion, PRP properties thereby enabling evaluation of their effects on wound healing and clinical outcomes...|$|R
40|$|When {{surgical}} ligation {{of bleeding}} fails, {{or is not}} possible, surgeons rely {{on a number of}} hemostatic aids, including thrombin. This review discusses the history, pharmacology and clinical application of thrombin as a surgical hemostat. The initial <b>thrombin</b> was <b>bovine</b> in origin, but its use has been complicated by the formation of antibodies that cross react with human coagulation factors. This has been associated with life threatening bleeding and in some circumstances anaphylaxis and death. Human thrombin, isolated from pooled plasma of donors, has been developed in an effort to minimize these risks, but its downside is the potential of transmitting blood-borne pathogens and limited availability. Recently a recombinant thrombin has been developed and approved for use by the FDA. It has the advantage of being minimally antigenic and devoid of the risk if viral transmission. Thrombin is often used in conjunction with other hemostatic aids, including absorbable agents (like gelfoam, collagen, and cellulose), and with fibrinogen in fibrin glues. The last part of this review will discuss these agents in detail, and review their clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|Binding {{products}} or food ‘glues’ are {{used throughout the}} food industry to increase the meat use rate or to augment economic efficiency. Some of these binders contain <b>thrombin</b> from <b>bovine</b> and porcine blood. The European parliament has recently banned thrombin-based additives and labelling legislation governs their use in the US. A mass spectrometry screening method is available to detect the addition of thrombin agents to foods {{as there is a}} need to protect consumers and to avoid misleading trade practices. We report the details of an inter-laboratory trial to determine the transferability of this method to operators in various food testing laboratories, each using a different triple quadrupole mass spectrometer design. The trial was successful with the species origin of the binding agent contained in each of the forty three test materials being correctly reported by the participants. This is consistent with a false positive and false negative rate of zero percent. This is the first collaborative study, as far as we are aware, which involves a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) application to approach a food authenticity issue...|$|R
