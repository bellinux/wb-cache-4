50|$|The North Jackson Street Bridge is a {{historic}} bridge in De Witt, Arkansas. Built c. 1910, it carries North Jackson Street over Holt Branch, just south of North Circle Drive. It consists of two spans of steel girders, resting on concrete abutments and a concrete central pier, with concrete decking. It is 32 ft long and has a roadbed 22 ft wide. Its guard rails consist of poured concrete panels, with incised rectangles on the side.

50|$|In {{the rubber}} pad forming process only a milled lower die is {{required}} {{on which a}} metal plate is placed. Afterwards, {{the shape of the}} lower die is pressed in the plate with the rubber mold. In most cases, the contour, hole patterns and the like will be cut with a 3D laser cutter.The simplicity of the rubber press tool causes tooling costs to be around 85 to 90% lower than those of regular deep drawing while the variable costs are higher. This combination makes rubber pad pressing very suitable for smaller and medium-sized series (up to 5,000-10,000 pieces per year), even though traditional cutting, lace, welding, finishing etc. is used more due to <b>the</b> <b>unfamiliarity</b> <b>with</b> rubber pad forming.|$|E

That loss, coupled with Nelsen's physical condition and <b>the</b> <b>unfamiliarity</b> <b>with</b> the personnel on the former AFL clubs they were playing for the first time, took the starch out of what had been a good offense going all the way back to 1963.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>unfamiliarity</b> <b>with</b> {{the exotic}} beast {{has also made}} {{elephants}} a subject of widely different interpretations thus giving rise to mythological creatures. The story of the blind men and an elephant was written to show how reality may be viewed from differing perspectives. The source of this parable is unknown, but {{it appears to have}} originated in India. It has been attributed to Buddhists, Hindus, Jainists, and Sufis, and was also used by Discordians. The scattered skulls of prehistoric dwarf elephants, on the islands of Crete and Sicily may have formed the basis of belief in existence of cyclopes, the one-eyed giants featured in Homer's Odyssey (c. 800~600 BC). As early as the 1370s, scholars had noted that the skulls feature a large nasal cavity at the front that could be mistaken for a singular eye socket; and the skulls, twice the size of a human's, looked as if they could belong to giant humanoids. It is also suggested that the Behemoth described in the Book of Job may be the elephant due to its grazing habits and preference to rivers.|$|E
50|$|Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951) is a {{singular}} figure in Modern Indian Art. Having {{arrived on the}} Indian art scene with {{the first wave of}} nationalism, he was seen as father figure of nationalist art and modernism. Along with E B Havell, Coomaraswamy, Sister Nivedita and other nationalists he brought an attitudinal change in the Indian response to traditional art. But his true contribution went beyond these. Trained under European artists initially, realism remained the underpinning of his work. But as a modernist at heart who was guided more by his sensibility than his training, he transformed the post Renaissance academic realism into which he was trained with his series of contacts with oriental art into something more supple and responsive to the imaginative flights of his mind. A post-Romantic in his sensibilities, he let his individualism triumph over his nationalism. Although he aligned with the nationalists {{in the early years of}} his career he transcended it very soon to develop something more akin to a Baudelairian aesthetics of modernism with a subjective response to the world rather than an unmediated representation of things. His most impressive work, the Arabian Nights series painted in 1930, can be described as a look at his immediate world through the eyes of a Baudelarian Flaneur, with the stories of the Arabian Nights serving as a pre-text. Equally original as a writer, Abanindranath is a phenomenon whose import has not been fully grasped. Much of this has been due to <b>the</b> <b>unfamiliarity</b> <b>with</b> his work in the absence of easily accessible public collections and publications. The present book brings together a large body of his work for the first time in an attempt to fulfill a glaring lacuna in our picture of this early master of modern Indian art.|$|E
5000|$|A {{restaurant}} on third line and Queen St. West in Brampton, Ontario became {{a meeting place}} for many of those immigrants. Over time an idea emerged to establish a German Cultural Centre in the region. Because of <b>the</b> <b>unfamiliarity</b> <b>with</b> Canadian laws among most of these largely new immigrants, a more seasoned member of these social gatherings, Mr. Gerhard Neudörffer, {{was asked if he}} was willing to approach authorities. The law at the time stated that only a Canadian citizen could be President of such an organization. Since {{he was the only one}} who could give satisfaction to all the requirements of the law, he was asked to spear-head this endeavour. During the winter of 1957/58 the efforts to establish a cultural centre were intensified and in March 1958, the German Canadian Club Hansa was officially registered. Until the purchase of the clubhouse in 1962, the meetings of the newly founded organization were held at the home of the Neudörffer's family. It was also used as storage for everything concerning the club. In addition, a sizable parcel of land was bought adjacent to the newly acquired club house on Highway 10. Once all was settled the activities of the club moved to its new home. From 1966 to 1973, due to limited space at the club's facility, dances were held in various nearby Halls in Brampton. One of the club's first - and therefore oldest - under groups was the Ladies Auxiliary who made sure that the stomach came to its right during social events. Much of the credit that the Hansa Club became an institution in and around Brampton is due to this group. The Ladies Auxiliary organized traditional German Christmas parties and Easter egg hunts which remain a cultural highlights for the members and their children. During the early years the Hansa Haus Club became very active not only in social but also in community affairs. For instance, Peel Memorial Hospital was one of the beneficiaries, because the proceeds of one social dance per year were donated to the hospital. The club also sponsored a Pee Wee Baseball and Minor Hockey team and support was given to the Senators Drum and Bugle Corps. The Hansa Club took active part in the annual Flower Festival and the highlight was when the Hansa Club received first prize with a replica of the Hansa Haus at the parade. Furthermore, the Hansa Club was the first to organize a [...] "Biergarten" [...] during the Flower Festival, which became a favourite place to soak parched tongues and rest tired feet after the parade. With the acquisition of the property on Highway 10, the club developed tremendously spawning a wealth of under groups who all offered social, sporting and cultural events not only to its members, but also the community within its region. There were soccer teams, a choir, and folk dance groups, to name only a few. To highlight the Hansa Haus's integration into its multicultural Canadian society the club's members organized Mardi Gras dances from the early 1960s. In spring 1966 the Hansa Mardi Gras Society was formed and took over the responsibility to contributing to the naturally colourful Mardi Gras Season.|$|E

5000|$|In early 1985, Urban WDAO {{moved to}} AM, and 107.7 {{switched}} to an Adult Contemporary format as Star 107.7/WWSN under owner Stoner Broadcasting.

In 1993, Bob Sweeney became the new Morning Show host, replacing [...] "The Tall Guys". He would serve as morning host along with co-host Kristi Leigh until 2005, {{when he moved to}} Smooth Jazz 106.5 WDSJ as Morning Show host, and would be replaced by PD Jeff Stevens. The station would be sold by Stoner Broadcasting to American Radio Systems in 1995, and in turn Jacor would purchase the station in 1998, and later be merged with Clear Channel Communications eventually taking over the station. In the late 1990s, the station would take a 1980s-lean, as the 1980s Oldies format became popular during this period, and the station would air a 1980s Oldies format during the weekends called [...] "The Time Warp Weekend". Upon his move from sister Alternative WXEG 103.9 The X in the Summer of 1998, new PD Jeff Stevens would not only replace midday host Kate Burdett, who moved on to other stations in the Dayton cluster, but also add a specialty show to the line-up entitled The Time Warp Cafe from Noon-1 PM, spotlighting music from the 1980s and adding in a [...] "Vault" [...] song, which is a song that reached cult status in the 1980s or received a lot of play via music video on MTV but never hit big on the charts. The first song played during this segment was [...] "Don't Pay The Ferryman" [...] by Chris DeBurgh. A few years later, a [...] "Sounds like the 80s" [...] song was added, which was a song from the early 1990s that featured an 1980s artist. The very first title played was [...] "So Close" [...] by Daryl Hall and John Oates from 1990. It was later retitled [...] "A Taste of the 90s" [...] to broaden the selection of titles that could be played. In 2006, the [...] "Time Warp Weekend" [...] was replaced by [...] "The Whatever Weekend", in response to the growing popularity of Adult Hits stations across the country. In early 2010, weekends were renamed [...] "The Weekend Mix" [...] and remain named that to this day. The 1980s lean also continues, including the rebroadcast of Casey Kasem's American Top 40 countdowns Saturday mornings from 6 AM to 10 AM, which feature originally aired broadcasts from 1980 to 1988. WMMX has been airing the rebroadcasts of AT40 since 2001 when they were packed as [...] "AT40 Flashback", at which time the shows were condensed three-hour rebroadcasts of AT40, usually beginning the countdowns around #30.

When Premiere Radio Networks canceled the program, WMMX continued to rerun the package until they were replaced by an all-new rebroadcast package from Premiere Radio Networks branded as [...] "Casey Kasem's American Top 40: The '80s" [...] in April 2007, which would broadcast the shows in their original, four-hour format.|$|E
