50|$|The zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture, {{also known}} as a {{quadripod}} fracture, quadramalar fracture, and formerly referred to as a <b>tripod</b> <b>fracture</b> or trimalar fracture, has four components: the lateral orbital wall (at either the zygomaticofrontal suture superiorly along the wall or zygomaticosphenoid suture) inferiorly, separation of the maxilla and zygoma along the anterior maxilla (near the zygomaticomaxillary suture), the zygomatic arch, and the orbital floor near the infraorbital canal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The present {{prospective}} study seeks {{to evaluate the}} incidence of <b>tripod</b> <b>fracture,</b> etiology and treatment options. All patients with faciomaxillary fractures following road traffic accidents admitted in the Deptt. Of otorhinolayngology, silchar medical college & hospital, Assam {{during the period of}} one year from Aug 2011 to Aug 2012, were scrutinized for <b>tripod</b> <b>fracture,</b> both clinically and radiologically & were managed according to the severity of fracture. Patients presenting with simple zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures were managed conservatively. While comminuted/malaligned fractures had monofragments fixed using open & closed reduction methods. Out of which most had early intubation, before edema occurred, to make airway control and provide anaesthesia. in few patients in whom intubation by oral route was impossible, tracheostomy was performed to secure airway. The adequacy of fracture reduction & its stability was confirmed by subsequent CT scan measurements, statistical analysis, and clinical follow-up during the postoperative period, in which patients showed no significant associated complications, facial asymmetry, enophthalmos, or diplopia. Road traffic accidents came out to be most common cause of facio-maxillary fracture, incidence of zygomaticomaxillary fractures is second to nasal bone fracture, which in itself most common facial fracture...|$|E
40|$|Background: While {{there have}} been a few reports {{involving}} identification of trauma patients with combined facial and cervical spine fractures, no study has specifically addressed the effects of a coexistent facial injury on evaluation and treatment of a significant cervical spine injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether coexisting facial fractures affect the timing, method, or rate of complications for treatment of acute cervical spine fractures. Methods: A prospectively collected institutional trauma registry containing 50 patient records from the years 1998 to 2002 was reviewed for patients with combination facial and cervical spine fractures. Thirty seven patients were initially identified. Facial fractures were managed by Plastic Surgery while cervical spine injuries were followed by Orthopedics or Neurosurgery. Review of the patient records revealed that 5 patients died prior to any intervention, 2 patients had no acute facial fracture, and in 1 the cervical spine fracture was chronic. The remaining 29 patient records were thoroughly reviewed with specific attention to the timing, method and complications of cervical spine treatment while management of the facial fractures was ongoing. Results: Of the 29 patients, there were 2 mandibular fractures, 4 orbital fractures, 7 nasal fractures, 7 maxillary fractures and 9 combination fractures not involving the mandible. The associated cervical fractures included 3 compression fractures, 1 burst fracture, and 7 facet fractures with the remainder being spinous or transverse process injuries. There was no appreciable correlation between a particular facial fracture and coexisting cervical spinal injury. A majority of the facial fractures were treated non-operatively, with 9 patients requiring plastic surgery intervention. 6 patients had soft tissue repairs to the face/ ears; 1 had an open repair of the zygomatic arch; and 2 had reconstructions of the nose. A distinct trend was identified in terms of lethality of injury, severity of cervical spine injury as well as delay and alteration in treatment of cervical spine injury in association with presence of a mandibular fracture. Among patients with non-mandibular facial fractures but requiring facial reconstruction, cervical spine interventions included: 1 patient who underwent anterior/posterior fusion for a C 6 -C 7 flexion distraction injury/C 7 superior facet fracture 4 days after their zygomatic arch procedure; 7 patients who were managed with hard collars; and 1 with a soft collar. In 1 patient, halo vest immobilization was originally recommended for a displaced C 6 facet fracture; however the patient was treated with a hard collar because of a coexisting <b>tripod</b> <b>fracture</b> with a depressed orbit. Among patients with non-mandibular facial fractures not requiring facial reconstruction 5 patients were initially managed with halo vest immobilization for their cervical spine injuries with 1 of 5 eventually undergoing an anterior fusion of C 1 -C 3 for a C 2 Fx with C 2 -C 3 subluxation. The remainders were managed with hard collars. In contrast, the mandible fracture group consisted of 2 patients who both had additional facial injuries including maxillary and orbital fractures. 1 patient had a coexisting Type II odontoid fracture with mild diastasis/subluxation. Surgical treatment was delayed by inability to obtain an MRI due to acute placement of facial fixation implants, and the patient was treated initially in a halo vest. In the second patient definitive treatment of a displaced Hangman’s fracture with surgery was deferred in lieu of halo vest traction due to the associated facial fractures. Conclusion:This retrospective review of a busy level 1 trauma center revealed a significant rate of concomitant facial and cervical spine fractures. Non-mandibular facial fractures do not appear to interfere significantly with management of associated cervical spine injury. Mandibular fracture, however, appears to be a marker of more potentially lethal injury and is much more likely to alter the timing and choice of treatment with respect to associated cervical spine fracture. Further study is required to determine whether this alteration in care has an adverse effect on ultimate clinical outcome in these patients.

50|$|Fractures with {{displacement}} require surgery {{consisting of}} fracture reduction with miniplates, microplates and screws. Gillie's approach {{is used for}} depressed zygomatic fractures. The prognosis of <b>tripod</b> <b>fractures</b> is generally good. In some cases there may be persistent post-surgical facial asymmetry, which can require further treatment.|$|R
40|$|For decades, facial {{beauty and}} {{esthetics}} {{have been one}} of the most important quests of the human race. The lateral prominence and convexity of the zygomatic bone makes it the most important bone for providing the aesthetic facial look and sets up the facial width but at the same time this prominence and convexity makes this bone more vulnerable to injury. Zygomatic complex <b>fractures</b> or <b>tripod</b> <b>fractures</b> are the second most common fractures after nasal fractures among facial injuries. Several studies have been undertaken regarding the reduction and fixation of zygomatic fractures with mini plates and screws. In 2002 Fujioka et al in vivo studies successfully proved that one point fixation at the zygomaticomaxillary complex gives three point alignment and sufficient rigidity when the fractures are not comminuted. In this article, 30 cases have been reviewed with one point fixation of zygomatic complex <b>tripod</b> <b>fractures</b> at the zygomatic buttress through Keen′s intraoral approach along with advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
40|$|The {{findings}} of three-dimensional computed tomography (3 DCT) and two-dimensional computed tomography (2 DCT) with helical CT scanning were compared for 21 patients with maxillofacial bone fractures. The {{results of this}} study suggest that the 3 DCT evaluation can be divided into 3 groups. The first group, in which 3 DCT is superior to 2 DCT, includes severe complicated midface <b>fractures,</b> for example, <b>tripod</b> <b>fractures</b> and complicated maxillary bone fractures. The second group, in which 3 DCT is equal to 2 DCT, includes simple fractures, for example, nasal bone fractures and isolated zygomatic fractures. In this group, patients and their families could easily understand the nature of the fracture and clinical course shown by 3 DCT as compared with conventional X-ray and 2 DCT. The third group, in which 3 DCT is inferior to 2 DCT, includes blowout fractures. Although 3 DCT does not provide additional information in blowout fractures, helical scanning permits clear observation of multiplanar images without artifacts arising from metal prostheses by excluding lower slices during image reconstruction. We conclude that 3 DCT provides useful information, especially in regard to the extent of complex fracture lines, as in <b>tripod</b> <b>fractures.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Management of {{comminuted}} zygomaticomaxillary fractures are is {{an entity}} {{that has always}} tested the skill of surgeons. A variety of methods have been coined over the years for management of these fractures. Packing the antrum with a gauze or balloon {{can be used in}} much comminuted fractures especially with anterior antral wall communication. Internal immobilization with a Foley’s balloon catheter is being used widely in Blow out fractures of orbit and rarely in <b>tripod</b> <b>fractures.</b> Despite a thorough search, not much literature could be found of its use in anterior maxillary wall fractures. The {{purpose of this article is}} to appraise this technique in anterior maxillary wall fractures...|$|R
30|$|With ZMC fractures, {{displacement}} in {{the posterior}} direction {{was found to}} be the most frequent, while displacement in the superior-inferior direction was rare. These results coincide with those of Toriumi et al. [3] that indicated that displacement around the superior-inferior axis is the most frequent in ZMC fractures. In the natural condition, the zygoma arch breaks first when <b>tripod</b> <b>fractures</b> occur because it is the thinnest and the most fragile support of the zygoma. When this occurs, the zygoma remains supported at three sites: the frontal process, the inferior orbital rim, and the zygomaticomaxillary buttress. They hypothesized that fracture patterns are largely determined by which of these three remaining sites breaks first under trauma [3].|$|R
40|$|<b>Tripod</b> {{displaced}} zygomatic <b>fractures</b> {{are generally}} treated with rigid internal fixation at the intraorbital rim (IOR), frontozygomatic (FZ) suture, and zygomaticomaxillary buttress. Intraorbital rim fixation {{is associated with}} complaints of poor esthetic results and miniplate intolerance. Although different solutions were previously reported as 2 -point fixation or resorbable fixation at the IOR, a 3 -point fixation is considered {{the best choice for}} maintaining an optimal zygomatic stability after reduction. Consequently, the best goal is to perform a surgical technique that provides a 3 -point fixation and avoids the consequence of subjective and objective alterations at the IOR and FZ areas. We propose an innovative technique that proved to be a simple, effective method to eliminate postsurgical sequelae due to rigid internal fixation positioning in the IOR and FZ areas...|$|R
