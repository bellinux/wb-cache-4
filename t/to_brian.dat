5|$|After he {{posted a}} 3–2 {{record and a}} 5.45 ERA in seven starts, Hughes {{was moved to the}} bullpen when Wang {{returned}} to the rotation in early June. Hughes pitched well, becoming the primary setup man to Mariano Rivera in July due to injuries <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> Bruney and Dámaso Marte. Despite his success as a reliever, Cashman maintained that Hughes would be a starter over the long-term.|$|E

5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his {{anchoring}} duties at NBC, ceding the reins <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported {{from the scene of}} any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Brian Reynolds {{discussed}} {{the use of}} the demo in the development process. Originally a marketing tool released prior to the game, they started getting feedback. They were able to incorporate many suggestions into the retail version. According <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> Reynolds, they made improvement in the game's interface, added a couple of new features and fixed a few glitches. They also improved some rules, fine-tuned the game balance and improved the AI. Finally, he adds that they continued to add patches to enhance the game after the game was released.|$|E
5|$|In Keegan's first season, 1971–72, Liverpool {{missed out}} on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> Clough's Derby County. Shankly {{maintained}} that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed {{towards the end of}} their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team's overall form, especially as they made a strong finish to the season, and he was confident of success in 1972–73.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Hamish & Andy battled {{against each}} other {{to make contact with}} celebrities, so that two {{listeners}} could interview their 'old school' celebrity crush as a teenager. Andy tried <b>to</b> track down <b>Brian</b> Austin Green while Hamish was after Steven Seagal. The boys employed several different strategies in order to get them onto the show. Andy pretended to be the owner of a jewellery chain in Australia named 'Cactus Fire', in an attempt <b>to</b> convince <b>Brian</b> Austin-Green's niece <b>to</b> get <b>Brian</b> onto the show. Whilst Hamish bought five cases of Stephen Seagal's energy drink Lightning Bolt, which cost him $250 and has never arrived to him. Eventually, Andy won the race <b>to</b> get <b>Brian</b> on the show, and his young fan Becky was able to speak to him.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{has been}} having drug-like {{withdrawals}} since Lois decided to wean him. He becomes so desperate {{that when he}} and Lois are at the park, he jumps on a woman breastfeeding her baby and greedily suckles on her, but is pulled off by Lois. One night, he then tries to milk Lois in her sleep. He pumps her breasts and succeeds, but spills and desperately tries licking it up. Stewie realizes how pathetic he is and accepts his weaning. He comes <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> and informs {{that he is now}} off breast milk, but Lois has other plans. Lois allows Stewie to be breastfed again, thus delighting him.|$|E
5|$|The two kings made a truce, {{by which}} Brian was granted rule over the {{southern}} half of Ireland, while Máel Sechnaill retained the northern half and high kingship. In honour of this arrangement, Máel Sechnaill handed over <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> the hostages {{he had taken}} from Dublin and Leinster; and in 998, Brian handed over to Máel Sechnaill the hostages of Connacht. In the same year, Brian and Máel Sechnaill began co-operating against the Norse of Dublin for the first time.|$|E
5|$|A four-sport athlete at Kathleen High School, Mitchell {{committed}} to UCLA {{to play football}} for the Bruins. In his collegiate debut in 1998, he had four receptions for 108yards, including a 79-yard touchdown from Cade McNown, {{as well as a}} 34-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> Poli-Dixon. Mitchell broke his femur the following week against Houston and missed most of the season. Limited by a knee cartilage injury throughout the 1999 season, he finished with 38 receptions for 533yards. As a junior in 2000, Mitchell was a Fred Biletnikoff Award finalist and earned first-team All-Pac-10 honors {{at the conclusion of the}} season. In the 2000 Sun Bowl, he had nine catches for a Sun Bowl record of 180yards. He declared for the 2001 NFL Draft following the 2000 season and finished his college career with 77 catches for 1,494yards and nine touchdowns.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} get ideas on how <b>to</b> get <b>Brian</b> fired, Stewie hires a trio of Latinos to consult him on how <b>to</b> fire <b>Brian.</b> After some ridiculous ideas {{including}} getting Brian deported and killing him, he takes the idea of framing Brian for rigging a soda drink on his boss. This results in Brian being fired.|$|R
5|$|A year passes. Peter {{has begun}} dating again, some dates being a Stickman and Bonnie, but has talked Joe into posing as Lois {{from time to}} time so that her death doesn't emotionally scar Chris. Stewie {{indirectly}} reveals <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> that he killed Lois. Disturbed and angered, Brian vows to bring him to justice. Stewie realizes that keeping the evidence of his crime as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and Peter had an argument stating they wanted to kill each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' trash and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting.|$|E
5|$|As the Griffin family {{attend the}} county fair, Stewie announces {{that he has}} bred a winning {{pedigree}} pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> that he got the pig from a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog {{in the same time}} and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe), leading an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the Griffin family. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home.|$|E
5|$|By this stage, Yorkshire {{regarded}} Yardley as {{the heir}} <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> Sellers as captain, and the England Test selectors {{also began to}} prepare him to assume the England captaincy. At {{the end of the}} 1938 season, Yardley was chosen to tour South Africa with MCC as vice-captain to Wally Hammond. He made a good start to the tour, scoring centuries in his first two innings, both surpassing his previous highest score. Wisden noted that he made a good impression on spectators in these early matches. In his fourth match, he captained the MCC in Hammond's absence for the first time. When Len Hutton was injured in a tour match and missed the first Test, Yardey made his debut but scored just seven runs in a total of 422 and did not bat in the second innings. Hutton returned for the second match, and the successes of other batsmen meant that Yardley was not required in the other Tests on the tour. However, he scored a third century when he captained the MCC against Border.|$|E

5|$|Darlington {{reached the}} quarter-finals of the 1968 League Cup; drawn away <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> Clough's Derby County, {{they took the}} lead, only to lose 5–4. During the 1970s the club had to apply for {{re-election}} to the League five times, and by 1982 they were facing a financial crisis which they survived thanks to fundraising efforts in the town. Three years later they won promotion by finishing third in the league under manager Cyril Knowles. Darlington spent two seasons in the Third Division; the 13th-place finish in 1986 was the highest position they achieved in the Football League since {{the introduction of the}} four-division structure in 1958, but they were relegated the following season.|$|E
5|$|In {{their annual}} rivalry game, Alabama {{defeated}} the Mississippi State Bulldogs 20–7 at Starkville despite having four turnovers. Alabama won the coin toss and elected {{to receive the}} ball to start the game. They then scored on a 33-yard Cade Foster field goal for an early 3–0 lead. Both teams then traded punts for their next six combined possessions before the Bulldogs missed a 23-yard field goal midway through the second quarter. On the Alabama drive that ensued, the Crimson Tide had their first of four turnovers on a Taveze Calhoun interception of an AJ McCarron pass. Alabama rebounded on their next possession with an 18-yard touchdown pass from McCarron <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> Vogler that made the halftime score 10–0.|$|E
5|$|The American League's closers then {{entered the}} game, with Jonathan Papelbon {{pitching}} a scoreless {{bottom of the}} eighth. In the ninth, J.J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole <b>to</b> <b>Brian</b> Roberts, {{but he could not}} come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.|$|E
