5|$|On the August 20, 2009 {{episode of}} Impact!, {{backstage}} interviewer Lauren, {{who was standing}} with and about to interview Christy Hemme, Tara, Taylor Wilde, and Sarita, announced that TNA were planning to host an eight-team single elimination tag team tournament to crown the first-ever TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions. After a four-way match consisting of Hemme, Traci Brooks, Sarita, and Awesome Kong, TNA commentators Mike Tenay and Taz announced that the first round match of the tournament would {{take place on the}} August 27 episode of Impact! with Kong and Raisha Saeed facing Brooks and Sharmell. Kong and Saeed wound up winning the match, and moving to the next round of the tournament. On the September 3 episode of Impact!, the team of Hemme and Tara defeated the team of Hamada and Sojournor Bolt to move onto round two of the tournament. The next week on Impact!, the team of Sarita and Taylor Wilde defeated Alissa Flash and Daffney to also advance to round two. Later in that same episode, Angelina Love and Velvet Sky (collectively known as <b>The</b> <b>Beautiful</b> People) defeated the team of Madison Rayne and Roxxi. Round two began on the September 17 episode of Impact!, with the encounters of Kong and Saeed versus Sarita and Wilde and <b>The</b> <b>Beautiful</b> People versus Hemme and Tara. The first bout pitted Hemme and Tara against <b>The</b> <b>Beautiful</b> People, with the latter being victorious. Sarita and Wilde won the second encounter over Kong and Saeed. The finals for the tournament were then set for TNA's No Surrender PPV event, with <b>The</b> <b>Beautiful</b> People versus Sarita and Wilde. Sarita and Wilde defeated Madison Rayne, a substitute for Angelina Love who had been released from her contract prior to the event, and Velvet Sky (also collectively known as <b>The</b> <b>Beautiful</b> People) on September 20 at No Surrender to become the first official TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions.|$|E
50|$|This {{introductory}} stanza {{is followed}} by a mythological exemplum to demonstrate this idea - that of Helen of Troy, who abandoned her husband, daughter, and parents to be with the man she loved. This use of Helen as a mythological exemplum might be seen as problematic: after all, Helen is <b>the</b> most <b>beautiful</b> mortal, and yet Sappho has her judging Paris to be <b>the</b> most <b>beautiful.</b> Harold Zellner explains this apparent paradox {{as an integral part of}} the argument that Sappho makes that <b>the</b> most <b>beautiful</b> is <b>the</b> one that one loves: the apparent contradiction between Helen being <b>the</b> most <b>beautiful,</b> and Helen finding Paris <b>the</b> most <b>beautiful,</b> can be resolved if we agree with Sappho's definition of beauty.|$|R

5|$|A 2006 {{review of}} Asian nuthatches {{suggested}} {{that there are still}} unresolved problems in nuthatch taxonomy and proposed splitting the genus Sitta.
