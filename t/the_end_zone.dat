5|$|After {{upsetting}} second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland {{climbed to}} an AP Poll ranking of {{eighth in the}} nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. State at Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, a Maryland fumble rolled out of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with a pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid.

5|$|At 10:10 of {{the third}} quarter Roethlisberger {{completed}} a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14–9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison—who was called in to replace injured long snapper Greg Warren—snapped the ball out of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> to give the Giants a safety and tie the game. The Giants drove after receiving the safety's kickoff to score a touchdown—taking a 21–14 lead with 3:07 remaining. Pittsburgh was unable to convert on their final two drives, as Roethlisberger threw his fourth interception of the day.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati's offense {{took over}} at the spot of the {{interception}} and immediately began moving down the field. Pike completed three consecutive passes: a five-yard pass to Gilyard, a 10-yard throw to Goodman, then a 31-yard toss to Gilyard. After the long throw, Cincinnati had a first down at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. The Bearcats continued their drive after an incomplete pass by Pike with an 18-yard completion to Goebel that gave the Bearcats a first down at the Virginia Tech eight-yard line. Two plays later, however, Cincinnati's drive {{came to an end}} when Virginia Tech defender Stephan Virgil intercepted a pass from Pike to a player in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> denying the Bearcats a chance to score. Virgil was downed in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line after the turnover.|$|E
5|$|Georgia's punt {{rolled into}} <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback, and with 1:28 {{remaining}} in the game, Virginia Tech began the final drive on its own 20-yard line.

Glennon's attempt at a Hail Mary pass fell short, giving Georgia the win with a final score of 31–24.|$|E

5|$|Once again {{facing the}} New England Patriots, the New York Giants headed to Lucas Oil Stadium, home of Eli's brother Peyton's team, the Indianapolis Colts. The Giants {{got off to}} an early lead by an {{intentional}} grounding call on Tom Brady in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a safety and retaining the ball {{for most of the}} 1st quarter. However, New England came back and battled to a 10–9 lead. Nearing the end of the 4th quarter with the Giants behind 17–15, Patriots coach Bill Belichick allowed them to score a touchdown with the idea that they would have nearly a minute to drive downfield and score. However, the New York defense held and broke up several Brady pass attempts. A last-second throw into <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> by the Patriots QB was thwarted and the Giants had won their second Super Bowl 21–17 in four years at New England's expense.|$|E

On third down, Zow completed a first-down pass to wide receiver Michael Vaughn at the Alabama 32-yard line. Zow then completed another first-down pass, this time to Freddy Milons at Alabama 45-yard line. Alexander rushed ahead for a one-yard gain, then Zow threw an interception to Tech defender Ryan Smith, who returned {{the ball to the}} Alabama 36-yard line. After the interception, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which pushed the Hokies back to their 49-yard line.|$|E

They then ran a Statue of Liberty play, with Zabransky faking a pass to the right side and handing the ball behind his back to Ian Johnson, who ran left and entered <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> untouched, giving the Broncos a stunning 4342 win.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing kickoff saw {{yet another}} Connecticut special-teams blunder. UConn running back Robbie Frey misplayed the ball {{off of the}} kickoff, letting it roll back into <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> Frey {{recovered}} the loose ball; if he had simply taken a knee, by rule {{it would have been}} a touchback and the Huskies would have gotten the ball at their own 20-yard line. Instead, Frey carried the ball out of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back James Starks, giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.|$|E

On its second play, Stith regained the lost yard. The third-down play was an incomplete pass by Clark, and the Hokies punted after going three and out. The kick rolled into <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback, and Alabama's offense began at its 20-yard line. Alexander was tackled for a two-yard loss, then Zow threw an interception to Anthony Midget, who returned the ball all the way into <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown.

Oakland reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber picked up the fumbled ball and ran into <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> which with another Blanda extra point gave the Raiders a 43–32 lead, deflating any hopes of the Jets coming back to win the contest. Ridlehuber could not {{remember}} whether AFL rules permitted advancing a fumbled kickoff return (they did), so tried to make it appear he was entering <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> with the same motion he gathered in the ball. Oakland kicked off to New York again, but it could do little with the ball in the final seconds, and the game ended.|$|E
