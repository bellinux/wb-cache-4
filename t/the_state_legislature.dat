5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>legislature.</b> It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>legislature</b> {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E

Lack of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray's administration in 1826.|$|E

5|$|Mary Leonard {{became the}} first woman {{admitted}} to the state bar on April 13, 1886, when the court admitted her after a year-long battle that included <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>legislature</b> passing a new law to allow women to be admitted. In 1906, the Oregon court upheld a maximum hour law for women in State v. Muller, 48 Or. 252, 85 P. 855 (1906). Due partly to a brief by future U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Oregon law in Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908) despite ruling in 1905 in Lochner v. New York that a maximum hour law for bakers was unconstitutional. Then in 1910, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>legislature</b> expanded the court back to five justices, and lastly, in 1913 the court expanded to the current seven justices.|$|E

For a time, both courts operated simultaneously, and both claimed to be the court of last resort in the state. Supporters of the old court won control of the legislature and abolished the new court in 1826. Owsley resigned from the Court of Appeals two years later.|$|E
