5|$|The {{style is}} found in several centres on the Continent in the tenth century. In Italy, the leading proponents were Liutprand of Cremona, Eugenius Vulgarius and Atto of Vercelli.

5|$|Most {{information}} about Magnus is gleaned from Norse sagas and chronicles, which began appearing during the 12th century. The most important sources still available are the Norwegian chronicles Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium by Theodoric the Monk and <b>the</b> <b>anonymous</b> Ágrip af Noregskonungasögum (or simply Ágrip) from the 1180s and the Icelandic sagas Heimskringla (by Snorri Sturluson), Morkinskinna and Fagrskinna, which date {{to about the}} 1220s. While the later sagas are the most detailed accounts, they are also generally considered the least reliable. Additional {{information about}} Magnus, in particular his campaigns, is found in sources from the British Isles, which included contemporary accounts.|$|E

5|$|Several reviewers have {{likened the}} album to a bootleg. Neither Wheeler nor Parallel World {{provided}} {{any information about}} the artists or names of the tracks. When re-issued in 2003, reviewer Mack Hagood criticized Parallel World for reifying its bootleg status by retaining <b>the</b> <b>anonymous</b> track list rather than working to look for surviving artists or their families, who would likely benefit greatly from royalties.
