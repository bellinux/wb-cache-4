5|$|The {{northern}} voalavo probably largely {{lives on}} the ground, but is able to climb in vegetation. It likes areas with dense networks of roots, among which it moves using runways and natural tunnels.

5|$|Following {{the release}} of her debut studio album, Breaking Night (1989), La India went on to produce When <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> <b>is</b> Over (1991), a {{collaboration}} between her then-husband Little Louie Vega and Marc Anthony. Both albums were recorded {{at the time when}} freestyle music's popularity was beginning to wane, and neither was a commercial success. India and Vega left Atlantic Records, as India wanted to pursue her singing career performing in Spanish. Three years later, American musician Eddie Palmieri, who had heard her singing on the radio, wrote and produced India's first Spanish-language record titled Llegó la India, via Eddie Palmieri (1992). Although it was a commercial success, her high-pitched vocals were criticized.|$|E

5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play <b>The</b> <b>Night</b> <b>is</b> Young. After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.|$|E
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... <b>The</b> <b>night</b> <b>is</b> passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of Rewrites story {{takes place in the}} fictional city of Kazamatsuri in Japan, where treeplanting and {{afforestation}} have caused the city to become overgrown with trees and vegetation. The protagonist Kotarou and his friends in the occult research society attend a high school in Kazamatsuri, and the characters also spend time in the society's clubroom. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the forest around Kazamatsuri and Kotarou's house. Throughout the story, Kotarou encounters an alternate dimension of Kazamatsuri where everything is silent and the sky is gray. There are many entrances to this dimension throughout the city. In this secret world developed by Gaia, a sustainable environment exists to support life. When on the Moon, a hill where daisies grow is prominently shown amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>is</b> eternal. This hill appears again later on Earth in the forest of Kazamatsuri.|$|E

25|$|The lovers, at last {{alone and}} {{freed from the}} {{constraints}} of courtly life, declare their passion for each other. Tristan decries the realm of daylight which is false, unreal, and keeps them apart. It is only in night, he claims, that they can truly be together and only in the long night of death can they be eternally united ("O sink' hernieder, Nacht der Liebe"). During their long tryst, Brangäne calls a warning several times that <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>is</b> ending ("Einsam wachend in der Nacht"), but her cries fall upon deaf ears. The day breaks in on the lovers as Melot leads King Marke and his men to find Tristan and Isolde in each other's arms. Marke is heartbroken, {{not only because of}} his nephew's betrayal but also because Melot chose to betray his friend Tristan to Marke and because of Isolde's betrayal as well ("Mir – dies?

500|$|The {{dromedary}} is diurnal (active mainly during daylight); free-ranging herds {{feed and}} roam throughout the day, though they rest during the hottest hours around noon. <b>The</b> <b>night</b> <b>is</b> mainly spent resting.

Some males either form bachelor groups or roam alone. Herds may congregate to form associations of hundreds of camels during migrations {{at the time of}} natural disasters. The males of the herd prevent female members from interacting with bachelor males by standing or walking between them and sometimes driving the bachelor males away. In Australia, short-term home ranges of feral dromedaries cover annual home ranges can spread over several thousand square kilometres.|$|E
