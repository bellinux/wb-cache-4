When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon's rotation and make other planetary manipulations, it becomes {{too dangerous to}} remain. The departing Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them, but he chooses to stay to witness Earth's end, and transmit a report of what he sees.|$|E
5|$|George Meyer {{obtained}} {{inspiration for}} the scene toward {{the beginning of the}} episode where Rainier Wolfcastle is taunting <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> an experience he had with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was following Schwarzenegger during a hike, and overheard him taunting his children. Schwarzenegger's influence was seen in the same scene, as he was appointed to be the chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993.|$|E

The next day he played in an England versus Germany charity football match to help raise funds for the Sir Bobby Robson cancer fund. He took part in the first edition of Soccer Aid in 2006, playing for an England team captained by Robbie Williams.|$|E

5|$|In the 1450s, King Thomas vigorously {{searched for}} {{suitable}} spouses for <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> his first marriage. Stephen's two sisters were married off in 1451, and in 1453 Stephen too entered his father's considerations. Wishing {{to gain control}} over the allodial land of Petar Talovac, who had governed Croatia proper as ban {{on behalf of the}} Hungarian king, Thomas attempted to have Stephen marry Talovac's widow, Hedwig Garai. Kosača too hastened to marry the wealthy widow, leading to an armed conflict, but neither prevailed due to an intervention by the Republic of Venice on behalf of Talovac's heirs.|$|E
5|$|In the Book of Nehemiah, the Ashdodites seem to {{represent}} the whole nation of the Philistines in the sixth century BCE, the speech of Ashdod (which half of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> mixed families are described as adopting) would simply be the general Philistine dialect. Hugo Winckler explains {{the use of that}} name by the fact that Ashdod was the nearest of the Philistine cities to Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|When {{the other}} Jewish {{children}} {{were sent to}} Chelmno, Syvia's family smuggled <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> cellar to cellar. The book also relates tragic events: one of Syvia's friends disappears, and another is killed and burned in an extermination camp. The ghetto is liberated one day shy of Syvia's tenth birthday, on January 19, 1945. Syvia, her older sister Dora, and a younger cousin, Isaac, were three of only twelve children who survived.|$|E
5|$|In {{the true}} ending, Junpei learns that the {{previous}} Nonary Game consisted of nine pairs of kidnapped siblings separated onto the ocean-bound Gigantic and in a mock-up in Building Q in the Nevada desert. The game was designed to explore morphic fields; the research anticipated that {{the stress of the}} game would activate the fields between siblings, allowing solutions solved by one to be sent via these fields to their counterpart at the other location. This research was to help Ace cure his prosopagnosia. This Nonary Game went awry: Akane and her brother Santa were placed at the same location instead of being separated, and Seven discovered the kidnappings and rescued <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> the ship. Ace grabbed Akane before they could escape, and forced her into the incinerator room where she faced a sudoku puzzle that she could not solve, and apparently died.|$|E
5|$|The reality series {{revolves}} around the children of Kris Jenner, and originally focused mainly on <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> her first marriage to deceased attorney Robert Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob. Kris' children Kendall and Kylie from her subsequent marriage to American athlete Bruce (later Caitlyn) Jenner have also been featured on the show since its beginning, along with Jenner's son Brody from another marriage, although he appeared very few times during the early seasons, mostly being called by his step-brother Rob to babysit their half-sisters Kylie and Kendall. Kourtney's boyfriend Scott Disick has also been appearing frequently on the show since the first season, {{as well as on}} the show's spin-offs. Cast members also include numerous friends and other acquaintances of the family members, most notably Malika Haqq and Jonathan Cheban who joined Keeping Up with the Kardashians in the second and third seasons, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Wesley, aware the Enterprise is in orbit, {{arranges}} for {{the children}} to passively resist. When the Aldeans request Picard's help to resolve the issue with the children, the crew finds a way to beam through the shield, allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to sneak onto the planet. Data manages to disable the Custodian, disrupting the Aldean's transporter and planetary shield. Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened the ozone layer of their planet, exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children. The radiation would likely have the same effects on <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> the Enterprise. Without the planetary shield, the ozone layer will naturally return, allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again. The Aldeans recognize the error of their ways and return the children to the Enterprise. They accept Starfleet's help to correct their ancient systems and recognize that they will have to forgo their invisibility to continue their society.|$|E
5|$|Winton {{organised}} {{the transfer}} of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £50 guarantee. Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered {{by the fact that}} the domestic evacuation of children was already occurring, and places were hard to find.|$|E

His business skills and Victoria's booming economy soon made him a wealthy man. After his first wife's death he married Rebekah Evans in 1871; the couple had seven children of their own. At his death, Berry was survived by eight of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> his first marriage and all seven of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> his second marriage.|$|E

In addition, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> other than the first husband are considered illegitimate, unless he has already divorced her or died (i.e., a mamzer), being a product of an adulterous relationship.|$|E
