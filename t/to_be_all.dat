5|$|He took match {{figures of}} 5/48 in the Second Test in a drawn match. He batted {{for the first}} time, and {{remained}} unbeaten without scoring as Australia collapsed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 107 on sticky wicket. It {{was the only time}} that they conceded a first innings lead in the series, and persistent rain forced a draw.|$|E
5|$|After the First Test, Ring {{returned}} to action as Australia completed an innings victory over Northamptonshire. He took 1/31 in the hosts' first innings of 119, before making an unbeaten 16 in partnering McCool in an unbroken stand of 39 as Australia declared at 8/352. In the second innings, he took {{four of the}} last five wickets and ended with 4/31 as Northamptonshire collapsed from 5/142 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 169. This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Ring scored three runs and was not asked to bowl in the first innings. Yorkshire were bowled out for 206 from 90.1overs; Bradman called on Ernie Toshack and Johnston to bowl 81.1overs and did not entrust the other bowlers with substantial work. Ring then took 1/22 in the second innings as the match petered out into a draw.|$|E
5|$|By 1947–48, Brown had recovered, so Harvey had {{to compete}} with him as well as Morris and Barnes for selection. In the first match of the season against the touring Indians, Harvey made 4 and 35. The {{following}} week, he made 89 in the first innings against South Australia but managed only three in the second innings as the Victorians collapsed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 182 and lost by nine wickets. Harvey was overlooked for the Australian XI for the Test trial against India the following week. Instead, {{he played in the}} match against Queensland, scoring only 13 and 3. He was subsequently overlooked for the Test selection. During this time, he played alongside Neil in all but the Queensland match, when his younger brother was playing in the Australian XI. However, neither batted together.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1950 {{after the}} {{successful}} landing at Inchon by the US X Corps {{and the subsequent}} destruction of the Korean People's Army, the Korean War appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> but over. United Nations (UN) forces advanced rapidly into North Korea {{with the intention of}} reuniting North and South Korea before the end of 1950. North Korea is divided through the center by the impassable Taebaek Mountains, which separated the UN forces into two groups. The US Eighth Army advanced north through the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, while the Republic of Korea (ROK) I Corps and the US X Corps advanced north on the eastern coast.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>All</b> further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Poulton {{came in at}} 1/9 {{after the fall of}} Villani {{at the end of the}} first over. She counter-attacked with Nitschke, scoring 39 runs herself from only 25 balls, {{including}} two sixes. The pair put on 58 from only 37 balls before Poulton was caught from the first ball of the eighth over. Australia collapsed and lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 155 with three balls unused, before completing a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Poulton came in at 1/33 and hit 15 from 13 balls, including three fours. Australia finished on 7/133 and won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the top of their quartet.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} morning, English tailender Alec Bedser had reached 37. His partner Denis Compton hit a {{ball into the}} covers and Bradman and Loxton {{collided}} {{in an attempt to}} field the ball and prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end. Bedser was a long way short of the crease and was run out. The wicket ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 in a 121-run partnership. England then lost their last three wickets for 26 runs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 363.|$|E
5|$|The {{match against}} Middlesex {{was the only}} fixture between the Tests. McCool toiled for 18 overs before snaring the last two wickets to end with 2/54 after the hosts had batted first. He made a duck as Australia scored 317 to take a 114-run lead. In the second innings, McCool took 3/54 {{including}} the wickets of John Dewes and Leslie Compton as the hosts lost 4/22 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 135. With only 22 runs needed for victory, Bradman let McCool and fellow leg spinner Doug Ring open the batting. The pair duly saw Australia home without losing a wicket, with McCool on seven.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Lord’s Test. Australia elected to field and {{dismissed}} the hosts for 221. Brown injured a finger while fielding and was unable to bat in Australia's first innings. Hamence filled in as an opener alongside Hassett but was out for a duck, so Bradman joined his deputy with the score at 1/6. The Australian skipper put on 231 with Hassett, who top-scored with 139. Accelerating after reaching his century, Hassett was out for 4/289 and the tourists collapsed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 389, after losing 7/100. In the second innings, Australia's makeshift openers Harvey and Sam Loxton chased down the 122 runs required for a 10-wicket win in less than hour, so Hassett was not required to bat.|$|E

5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first, Australia scored 236 before Johnston took 6/15 from 12.5 overs. He took {{the last four}} wickets as the home team fell from 6/81 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 85. Johnston bowled four wicketless overs in the second innings as Australia {{completed}} victory without needing to bat for a second time. In the second match, he signed off on his tour in a low key manner, taking a wicket in each innings to end with a match total of 2/48 as Australia completed another innings triumph.|$|E
5|$|After {{leading his}} state to another Sheffield Shield title and {{a win over}} England, Miller {{replaced}} Morris as the vice-captain for the tour of the West Indies that started in early 1955. Australia was looking for its first series win against any team in three years, having lost two consecutive series to England. Australia batted first in the opening Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica. Miller came to the wicket at 2/137 {{and put on a}} 224-run partnership with Harvey. Both ended with centuries and Miller scored his highest Test score of 147, striking 15fours. When Valentine and Ramadhin had conceded 100runs, he respectively shook their hands. Australia finished at 9/515. Johnson had been injured when hit in the foot by a yorker so Miller was left in charge of the team on the field with Australia one bowler short. Miller attempted to unsettle the batsmen by placing many men close to the bat in an attempt to insult their batting capabilities. He took the new ball at 5/239 and the hosts collapsed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 259. Miller had taken 2/36, and enforced the follow-on, which was questioned as paceman Ron Archer had broken down. With Australia two bowlers short, the West Indies moved to 1/114. When Weekes arrived at the crease, Miller unsettled him with delaying tactics, and he was out for one. He then placed two silly points and two silly mid-ons in an attempt to unsettle Walcott, who fell to Lindwall soon after. Miller then took two wickets and the hosts had lost three wickets in as many overs. The West Indies were bowled out and Australia won by nine wickets. Miller had taken 3/62 in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|After the Test, Loxton bowled first {{change in}} the first innings against Middlesex. He took 3/33 from 21 overs as the hosts were bowled out for 203. Loxton removed Leslie Compton, his younger brother and England Test batsman Denis, and Jim Sims {{in the space of}} five runs to reduce Middlesex from 5/182 to 8/188. He had a heavier {{workload}} than normal in the first innings, as leading paceman Lindwall had turned up inebriated on the first morning and therefore lacked energy and penetration. Loxton then joined Morris at the crease, with Australia in difficulty at 3/53. They put on 172 in 115 minutes before Morris was out for 109, and Loxton followed him at 5/271 for the top-score of 123, having punished the bowlers in a hard-hitting display. Australia then collapsed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 317. Loxton took 1/15 in the second innings to help seal victory by ten wickets in Australia's only county match before the Fourth Test.|$|E

5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia {{proceeded}} to reach 460/7Keith Miller making 74before Bradman declared, setting England {{a target of}} 596 midway through the afternoon. The hosts reached 106/3 at stumps on the fourth day, but then collapsed on the final morning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 186, handing Australia a 409-run victory. Cyril Washbrook and Tom Dollery top-scored for England with 37 apiece. Ernie Toshack had the pick of the figures with 5/40 while Lindwall took 3/61. Although Toshack had the better figures, commentators credited Lindwall with orchestrating the England collapse; {{at the start of}} the innings he bowled at leading English batsmen Len Hutton at great pace before dismissing him. Hutton had appeared very unsettled by Lindwall and played meekly. He was severely criticised for his timid manner and was controversially dropped for the following match as the selectors thought he was providing a poor example to the junior members of the team. The Australians were very pleased with this decision, which they believed to be wrong, as they regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent. The match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.|$|E
5|$|After this match, Neil {{was called}} into the Australian Test team, so only Ray and Merv played in Victoria's next match against New South Wales. Mervagain captaining the sidemade a duck and was out before Ray came in, in Victoria's only innings of the match and was not {{selected}} {{for the remainder of}} the season. After this, Ray and Neil played together for Victoria on two occasions in the second half of the season when the latter did not have a match for Australia. In the first match, against New South Wales, the two batted in partnership for the first time for their state. Ray came in at 5/53 to join Neil and he fell for 9 to leave the score at 6/64 as Victoria collapsed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 130. In the second innings, Ray joined Neil with the score at 5/266 and the latter fell at 6/292, ending a 26-run partnership. The pair did not bat together in the second match against South Australia as Neil was out before Ray came in on both occasions. The 1947-48 was the most productive for the Harveys as a combination for Victoria until Ray played a full season in 1953-54 together with Neil.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions {{for the sole purpose of}} pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

5|$|Australia won the toss {{and sent}} Surrey in to bat. They made 221, and Jack Parker top-scored with 76 in an uneven effort {{in which there}} were six single-figure scores. As the match started {{the day after the}} Second Test, Bradman let most of his second-string bowlers do the work to rest his first-choice bowlers, and Ring took three wickets, while the Test players only took two in total. Hamence opened the batting for Australia—Brown injured a finger while fielding—but he was out for a duck. Hassett (139) and Bradman (128) then put on 231, Bradman making his sixth century of the tour. However, the Australians lost wickets {{steadily}} thereafter <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 389. Surrey made 289 in their second innings, with McCool taking 6/113 after bowling more than 40% of the overs. The hosts batted steadily with three fifties, but wickets fell regularly and only one partnership greater than 40 materialised. The tourists wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch fellow Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final. Harvey and Loxton volunteered and chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs. Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time.|$|E
5|$|Bradman then {{returned}} {{in the next}} match against Surrey at The Oval in London, winning the toss and electing to bat. The last time Australia had played at the ground was the Fifth Test in 1938, when England declared at a world record score of 7/903; Bradman had hurt his ankle, {{and was unable to}} bat as Australia fell to the largest defeat in Test history. This match was a far different experience for the Australians. Barnes and Morris put on 136 before Bradman came in to join Barnes; together they added another 207 before Barnes fell for 176. Bradman started slowly and was heckled by the crowd for taking 80 minutes to reach 50, but accelerated and went on to score 146 before being dismissed at 3/403, with Australia proceeding <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> out for 632. He had attacked the medium pacers with his pull shot, but had some difficulties reading the left arm wrist spin of Australian expatriate John McMahon, nearly being caught behind the wicket on multiple occasions. Australia then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Wales {{play all}} their home matches at the 74,500 {{capacity}} Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, {{which is also}} Wales' national stadium. The Millennium Stadium was first conceived in 1994, when a group redevelopment committee was set up. It was decided to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park after a review found {{it was out of}} date; new legislation also required stadia <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> seated. Construction began in September 1997, and was completed by June 1999, in time for the Rugby World Cup. The construction cost the WRU £126million, which was funded by private investment, £46million of public funds from the National Lottery, the sale of debentures to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and loans. While the new ground was being built, Wales used the old Wembley Stadium for their home matchesa deal reciprocated during construction of the new Wembley, when FA Cup finals were held at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E
