40|$|This {{book is a}} {{collection}} of papers presented at a workshop in 1999 on the evolution and effects of economic regulation in several industries. Countries around the world have been undergoing seemingly constant regulatory changes for the past decade. In the 1990 s industrialized countries began a process of deregulation, which many believe has gone too far, leading to renewed pressure for increased regulation. Developing countries, meanwhile, are liberalizing sectors once dominated by the state and struggling to develop effective regulations and regulatory agencies amidst competing interests. This collection of papers provides important and refreshing context to <b>today</b> <b>s</b> issues, reminding us that the debate over effective regulation is not new and that <b>today</b> <b>s</b> regulations have historical roots. The path-dependent nature of regulatory changes mean that <b>today</b> <b>s</b> regulations and industry structures are shaped in part by conditions put in place many years ago, and rationales for these rules are often ad-hoc and bear little relation to the reasons given {{at the beginning of the}} path. ...|$|R

We compare immediate subsidies paid for health-conscious consumption and future subsidies rewarding a good health outcome. We show that, while both policies can implement the first best choice, doing so by future subsidies results in higher costs for the government. This arises since the individual anticipates that, from <b>today</b> <b>s</b> perspective, she will make biased use of future subsidies. Hence, {{in order to create}} the same incentive effect, a future subsidy must be higher in present value terms...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} I tested the {{standard}} assumptions about differences in language usage in adult and children 2 ̆ 7 s literature by analyzing parallel {{passages from the}} works of four authors, Nathaniel Hawthorne, George MacDonald, Oscar Wilde, and John Gardner, who each wrote prose fantasy for both audiences. ^ A computer program and syntactic code based on those used by York University in Toronto provided a statistical analysis of the 20, 000 words of selected text. I found that the passages from the children 2 ̆ 7 s books had much shorter paragraphs, and slightly shorter sentences, T-units, clauses, and words. T-units were the most consistently and notably reduced elements. The children 2 ̆ 7 s books also had more lexical repetition and fewer abstract and Latinate words and tended towards a verbal style. These characteristics support some of the common assumptions about children 2 ̆ 7 s literature, but the differences were slighter than anticipated. In the area of syntax, the assumption that coordination would increase and subordination decrease markedly in the children 2 ̆ 7 s stories did not prove true. Coordination was only marginally more frequent in the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>passages,</b> and subordination nearly equal in both sets. The reduction of prepositions in the juvenile samples seems of more significance syntactically. In the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>passages</b> there are large increases {{in the amount of}} dialogue and in the use of Germanic based words. ^ My general conclusion is that the differences in the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>passages</b> reflect a stronger tendency towards everyday speech, that children 2 ̆ 7 s authors borrow more conventions from conversation and from oral traditions when writing for a child audience. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} conclusions from the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) Higher Volume Operations (HVO) Flight Experiment which NASA conducted to determine pilot acceptability of the HVO concept for normal conditions. The SATS HVO concept improves efficiency at non-towered, non-radar airports in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) while achieving a level of safety equal to <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system. Reported are results from flight experiment data that indicate that the SATS HVO concept is viable. The success of the SATS HVO concept is based on acceptable pilot workload, performance, and subjective criteria {{when compared to the}} procedural control operations in use today at non-towered, non-radar controlled airfields in IMC. The HVO Flight Experiment, flown on NASA's Cirrus SR 22, used a subset of the HVO Simulation Experiment scenarios and evaluation pilots in order to validate the simulation experiment results. HVO and Baseline (<b>today</b> <b>s</b> system) scenarios flown included: single aircraft arriving for a GPS non-precision approach; aircraft arriving for the approach with multiple traffic aircraft; and aircraft arriving for the approach with multiple traffic aircraft and then conducting a missed approach. Results reveal that all twelve low-time instrument-rated pilots preferred SATS HVO when compared to current procedural separation operations. These pilots also flew the HVO procedures safely and proficiently without additional workload in comparison to <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system (Baseline). Detailed results of pilot flight technical error, and their subjective assessments of workload and situation awareness are presented in this paper...|$|R

Many warehouses use robots for their logistical tasks, while warehouse employees only need to ensure that ev- erything is performing properly and finish some tasks like collecting items and shipping them out to customers. This thesis investigates how to reorganize a high density storage of stacks. Mul- tiple algorithms such as exhaustive, random and greedy searches were implemented on top of my own problem specific designs, and tested in simulations separated from the actual system. The results from implementations made during the work with this thesis were compared to each other and to the performance of <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system. The majority of the work in this thesis have been to design and implement my own ideas on how to solve the reorganization problem. During my work, much time have been spent to rethink, adjust and redesign the algorithms in order to get even better performance. Results from simulations of the various algorithms are promising, and improvements can be seen over the different implementations during my work. In comparison with how <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system performs on the reorganization task, the results are also very promising. However, the comparison of <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system and the implementations in this thesis have some uncertainties, and further work is required to confirm the improvement completely.

40|$|Agile retrospectives {{could help}} teams {{learn from the}} past and {{identify}} improvement opportunities. In this thesis we investigate the characteristics of the present retrospective practice and the organizational learning it provides for teams practicing them, through a multiple case-study. The research is based on a depth-study of five years of retrospective practice from one team, and a breadth-study of seven interviews from other retrospective practicing teams. Our results show that teams today are mostly satisfied with their retrospective practice and are able to identify improvement opportunities and implement them, which contradicts previous research. However we identify one barrier related to team commitment dependent on enthusiasm, and previous implementation of improvement opportunities that results in a feedback-loop that could both help implement future improvements and hinder them. We investigate the learning happening through <b>today</b> <b>s</b> retrospectives and find that the practice is approximating a learning system where teams are able to test their current work practices, learn from them and improve from them. Where most of the governing values and behavioral consequences for such a system are already present in <b>today</b> <b>s</b> practice. However we find that the primary learning type remains single-loop, even though double-loop should be expected. We identify a barrier that hinders double-loop learning, consisting of several factors and propose a method based on our findings. The method aims to facilitate triple-loop learning and adaption of the retrospective practice, which can lower the learning barrier. Finally we conclude that <b>today</b> <b>s</b> retrospective practices provide agile development teams the ability to adapt their current work-practices and enable them to learn from past development iterations and thus provide the means for identifying improvement opportunities and improve from them...|$|R
