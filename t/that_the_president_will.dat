The theory incorporates both the turnout and vote decisions in one framework and predicts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> party <b>will</b> be disadvantaged in midterm elections (i. e., the theory predicts the “midterm effect”). Furthermore, this effect is driven by the asymmetric effect of ideology on voters’ turnout decisions rather than as a result of vote choices made in the voting booth. The loss averse theory is contrasted with five existing explanations for the midterm effect. All six explanations are then tested empirically with both aggregate and individual-level data. Both levels of empirical analysis support the loss averse behavioral explanation...|$|R
