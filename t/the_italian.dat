5|$|All four ships {{served in}} the 1st Division of <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> fleet during the Italo-Turkish War, and were the workhorses of the {{operations}} off North Africa and in the eastern Mediterranean. During World War I, the ships were primarily based in Brindisi, Taranto, and Valona; they saw no action during the war due to the cautious fleet policies adopted by both <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> and Austro-Hungarian navies. The ships remained in <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> fleet {{for a few years}} after the war, but all were discarded and broken up for scrap by 1927.|$|E

5|$|Ancona {{was quickly}} readied for combat when Italy {{declared}} {{war against the}} Austrian Empire in the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. The following month, she joined <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> fleet at the Battle of Lissa. She was stationed in the van of <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> fleet, which became separated {{from the rest of}} the fleet. Ancona was damaged by Austrian shellfire, including one shell that started a fire. Her career was uneventful after the war, resulting from a combination of the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was eventually sold for scrapping in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a work-up {{patrol in}} the Norwegian Sea, {{she spent the}} bulk of the war in the Mediterranean. While working up, Unrivalled fired a torpedo at what was thought to be a {{submerged}} enemy submarine. Only the periscope was sighted, and the torpedo was fired in the direction detected by the hydrophones, but no German submarine was in the area. Whilst in service in the Mediterranean, she sank a number of small merchantmen and small naval auxiliary vessels with both torpedoes and gunfire. These included <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> auxiliary submarine chaser O 97 / Margherita, <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> merchants Maddalena, Mostaganem and Pasubio, <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> tugs Genova and Iseo, <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> sailing vessels Triglav, Albina, Margherita, Sparviero and Ardito, the German auxiliary submarine chasers UJ 2201/Bois Rose and UJ 2204/Boréal, <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> tanker Bivona, the small Italian merchant Santa Mariana Salina, <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> auxiliary minesweeper R 172 / Impero and the small Italian vessel San Francisco di Paola A.|$|E

50|$|The Austrians were victorious, both {{strategically}} and tactically. <b>The</b> <b>Italians</b> {{were driven}} {{back across the}} Mincio out of Venetia.

5|$|Given the {{superficial}} {{similarities between the}} two flags, <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> flag and the Mexican flag have been compared over time. However, <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> tricolour actually uses lighter shades of green and red and the two have different aspect ratios; <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> flag's aspect ratio is 2:3, while the Mexican flag's aspect ratio of 4:7 results in a more elongated rectangular shape. When Italy became a republic in 1946, the Mexican naval ensign was a plain tricolour; for this reason, on demand of the international naval authorities, Italy could not adopt a sole national flag similar to France as it wished.|$|E

5000|$|The Pacification {{began with}} Italian forces rapidly occupying the Sirte desert {{separating}} Tripolitania from Cyrenaica, utilizing aircraft, motor transport, and good logistical organization that allowed <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> to occupy 150,000 square kilometres of territory in five months.

2500|$|Starting {{in early}} October 1935, <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> invaded Ethiopia.

During this offensive, <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> were forced back in places and put on the defensive. [...] In early 1936, the First Battle of Tembien stopped the progress of the Ethiopian offensive and <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> were ready to continue their offensive. Following the defeat and destruction of the northern Ethiopian armies at the Battle of Amba Aradam, the Second Battle of Tembien, and the Battle of Shire, Haile Selassie took the field with the last Ethiopian army on the northern front. On 31 March 1936, he launched a counterattack against <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> himself at <b>the</b> Battle of Maychew in southern Tigray. The emperor's army was defeated and retreated in disarray.
