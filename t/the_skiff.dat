25|$|On 7 September Brandenburg {{launched}} a Sea Lynx helicopter {{to perform a}} reconnaissance mission on a suspected skiff just south of Mukalla, Yemen. The Sea Lynx closed on and filmed five suspects on board the vessel throwing ladders and weapons overboard. <b>The</b> <b>skiff</b> was ordered to stop, but apparently refused to do so. An interpreter tried to convince the crew to stop, but to no avail. Then Brandenburg fired warning shots across her bow. As the boat continue undeterred, it was later known that the headquarters of Operation Atalanta authorized the German frigate to disable <b>the</b> <b>skiff</b> by gunfire. After the vessel was neutralized, a German Navy team from a Rigid-hulled inflatable boat {{took control of the}} crew and seized a number of weapons. One of the suspects was injured by gunfire during the incident, and later died of his wounds onboard Brandenburg while receiving medical treatment. This was the first fatality caused by the Bundeswehr in the course of Operation Atalanta. The weaponry found on board <b>the</b> <b>skiff</b> was later destroyed.|$|E

The rules of racing are based on those of British Rowing closely enough that British Rowing qualified umpires may also umpire skiff races.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2009, Toowoomba {{responded to}} a call for {{assistance}} from the merchant vessel BBC Portugal, and successfully prevented an act of high-seas piracy. A Japanese P-3 Orion aircraft and a naval helicopter from the German frigate Bremen provided surveillance support while Toowoomba closed in. A boarding party from Toowoomba confiscated several weapons from the attackers, including a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, six AK-47 assault rifles, and a G3 assault rifle, before <b>the</b> <b>skiff</b> was directed to leave the IRTC.|$|E
50|$|On {{receiving}} {{distress call}} from MT Chios, a Greece-flagged crude oil tanker, was {{being chased by}} heavily armed pirates about 82 nautical miles west of Suheli Par in the Lakshadweep archipelago. The tanker, on its way from Singapore to Yemen, adopted best management practices and evasive manoeuvres to dodge <b>the</b> <b>skiffs</b> on <b>the</b> prowl. Meanwhile, an armed Dornier maritime reconnaissance aircraft launched from naval air station INS Garuda in the Southern Naval Command spotted <b>the</b> <b>skiffs</b> around 8 p.m. on Saturday and relayed the location coordinates to INS Tir (A86), which was operating in close proximity.|$|R

During the pursuit the attackers threw overboard three ladders, two bags and seven rifles. The Spanish personnel captured six men of whom five were wounded, three of them seriously.

25|$|Jacob Johnson {{saved the}} lives of Colonel Thomas Henderson, the young editor of the Raleigh Star, and his friend Mr. Callum, when the {{enthusiastic}} group of fishermen capsized their fishing skiff on Walnut Creek near Hunter's Mill in December 1811. The third occupant of <b>the</b> <b>skiff,</b> Mr. William Peace, had no trouble getting to shore. Johnson jumped {{in the water and}} saved Henderson and Callum, to the detriment of his own health. He died several weeks later, ironically, while ringing the funeral bell at the State Capitol Building. He was buried at the Old City Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|The German Navy {{eventually}} {{released the}} four surviving suspects. The {{body of the}} suspect killed in the action was handed back to his relatives in Somalia by the International Red Cross. The Bundeswehr decided not to extradite the men to Kenya after being advised by Operation Atalanta’s headquarters that the men’s conviction after the trial was not granted. At the {{time there was a}} deal with Kenya to judge in that country any act of piracy committed in the Indian Ocean, but on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, as the attack did not affect German interests, <b>the</b> <b>skiff</b> crewmembers were left in a craft within sight of the Somali coast.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} years of the oil rush, high {{overland}} shipping costs drove many well owners to float their product down Oil Creek to the Allegheny River as lumber producers did. For decades, logs had been transported using man-made floods, known as pond freshets, created by successively breaking milldams along the length of the river. These freshets could carry up to 800 skiffs filled with crude oil downstream at once. Most skiffs held between [...] of oil, but one third of that leaked out of <b>the</b> <b>skiffs</b> before they were even launched and another third was lost by <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>skiffs</b> reached Pittsburgh.

25|$|On October 11, pirates {{attacked}} Hong Kong registered tanker Island Splendor {{and attacked}} a Spanish fishing vessel 3 days later.

The pirates apparently mistook the warship for a freighter. Patiño was hit on her hull and funnel by 50 rounds in the ensuing gunbattle, which lasted up to two minutes. The Spanish vessel returned fire with her light armament, but when the pirates continued the aggression, the Spanish sailors proceeded to [...] "neutralize" [...] the threat with what the Spanish Ministry of Defence described as [...] "self-defense fire", which forced <b>the</b> <b>skiff</b> to flee.|$|E

2500|$|While {{operating}} with Combined Task Force 151, on 13 December 2011, the destroyer [...] disrupted {{a group of}} suspected pirates south of Yemen near the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor. [...] At approximately 8:40am local time, the merchant vessel M/V Nordic Apollo reported to United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, Dubai, of being fired upon by pirates in a skiff. At approximately 11:00am, the M/V Heather, operating 30 nautical miles from Nordic Apollo, reported suspicious activity by a skiff. [...] CTF-151 commander Rear Admiral Kaleem Shaukat, Pakistan Navy, ordered Pinckney to investigate. Pinckney got underway and launched its MH-60R helicopter which located a suspicious skiff.

[...] While operating in the Arabian Sea in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, at 10:00 A.M. local time, the carrier Enterprise and cruiser Leyte Gulf responded to a distress call from the Falcon Trader II reporting that suspected pirates in a small skiff were attempting to board the ship. A follow-up message reported that the pirates had boarded the Falcon Trader II, but confirmed that her crew was safely in the ship's citadel. [...] A SH-60F helicopter from squadron HS-11 embarked on the Enterprise and a SH-60B helicopter from squadron HSL-48 on board the Leyte Gulf were dispatched to investigate the situation.

[...] The helicopter pursued <b>the</b> <b>skiff</b> which was observed trying to rendezvous with a suspected pirate mother ship. [...] The helicopter came under small arms fire, but the flight crew were not harmed while the helicopter maintained surveillance of the situation.

After chasing down <b>the</b> <b>skiff</b> and its mothership, US {{military}} captured five Somalis. Judge Raymond A. Jackson, a Federal District Court judge in Norfolk, Virginia threw out the piracy charge, which dates from enactment in 1819 when piracy was defined only as robbery at sea. The penalty for piracy is mandatory life in prison. The U.S. government appealed the ruling. In March 2011 the five Somalis were sentenced to life for piracy to run consecutively with the 80-year term.

2500|$|The boat models {{discovered}} at Meketre′s tomb feature several {{different kinds of}} boats, including traveling boats, sporting boats, and several papyriform crafts. [...] Two of the papyriform skiffs have a trawling net slung between them. It is uncertain {{whether or not the}} net is meant to be depicted as being under the water or being pulled out of the water by the fishermen. In the event that the artist meant for the net to be in the water, {{it is interesting to note}} that the net is upside down. Needless to say, the upside down net would not work for catching fish. [...] This ambiguity points up the question of artistic veracity of the craftsmen who make ship models. As is attested by the ambiguity of the holes in the sides of the Phoenician model, and <b>the</b> <b>skiff</b> from Meketre, archaeologists need to be aware of the possibility of artistic error while interpreting ancient ship models. While a mistake involving an inverted trawling net may seem trivial, the lesson is important. It is important for archaeologists to be aware of the possibility that ancient artists may not have been familiar with the finer details of ships and boats.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 January 2011, an Indian Coast Guard {{aircraft}} while {{responding to}} a distress call from CMA CGM Verdi, located two skiffs attempting a piracy attack near Lakshadweep.
