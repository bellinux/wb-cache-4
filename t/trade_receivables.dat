5000|$|The {{balance of}} the balance sheet {{reflects}} the conventions of double-entry bookkeeping, by which business transactions are recorded. In double-entry bookkeeping, every transaction is recorded by paired entries, and typically a transaction will result in two or more pairs of entries. The sale of product, for example, would record both a receipt of cash (or {{the creation of a}} <b>trade</b> <b>receivable</b> {{in the case of an}} extension of credit to the buyer) and a reduction in the inventory of goods for sale; the receipt of cash or a <b>trade</b> <b>receivable</b> is an addition to revenue, and the reduction in goods inventory is an addition to expense (an [...] "expense" [...] is the [...] "expending" [...] of an asset, in this case, the inventory). Thus, there are two pairs of entries: an addition to revenue balanced by an addition to cash; a subtraction from inventory balanced by an addition to expense. The cash and inventory accounts are asset accounts; the revenue and expense accounts will close at the end of the accounting period to affect equity.|$|R

40|$|Magistrska naloga temelji na obratnem kapitalu, kateremu bi vsa podjetja morala posvečati posebno pozornost. Dobro upravljanje z obratnim kapitalom pomeni premišljeno odločanje o obsegu zalog, terjatvah do kupcev in dolgovih. V nalogi se prepletata teoretični in empirični del. V empiričnem delu smo prikazali podatke za Skupino Gorenje, ki je eden izmed vodilnih evropskih izdelovalcev aparatov za dom. Na začetku naloge smo opredelili osnovne pojme, ki so povezani z obratnim kapitalom, v naslednjem poglavju smo opisali komponente obratnega kapitala, na koncu pa opredelili še politiko obratnega kapitala. Komponente obratnega kapitala so zaloge, terjatve do kupcev, denar in obveznosti do dobaviteljev, katerim smo v nalogi namenili največ pozornosti. Prikazali smo gibanje zalog, terjatev do kupcev in obveznosti do dobaviteljev za Skupino Gorenje, in sicer smo izračunali povprečne vrednosti le-teh, dneve vezav ter koeficiente obračanja. Ker mora podjetje obratna sredstva tudi financirati, smo poskušali preko krogotoka obratnega kapitala ugotoviti, kako hitrost obračanja obratnih sredstev vpliva na financiranje obratnega kapitala. Prišli smo do ugotovitve, da se s hitrejšim obračanjem obratnih sredstev znižujejo potrebe po virih financiranja. Za podjetje je dobro, da ima čim krajši cikel vezav zalog in terjatev do kupcev ter čim krajše dneve vezav obveznosti. Idealno bi bilo, če bi lahko podjetje zaloge in terjatve do kupcev financiralo z obveznostmi do dobaviteljev, vendar morajo podjetja v praksi običajno uporabljati še druge vire financiranja. V zadnjem poglavju smo se osredotočili na politiko obratnega kapitala, ki govori o višini obratnega kapitala v podjetju ter virih njihovega financiranja. Z ustrezno oblikovano politiko obratnega kapitala podjetje zniža potrebni obseg financiranja in poveča donosnost kapitala. The {{following}} master 2 ̆ 7 s dissertation {{is based}} on the working capital which companies should pay more attention to. Good working capital management means a well-informed decision-making when it comes to inventories, <b>trade</b> accounts <b>receivables</b> and debts. In the dissertation theoretical and empirical parts are intertwined with each other. The empirical part includes the data for Gorenje Group, one of the leading European manufacturers of household appliances. At the beginning of the dissertation there are definitions of basic concepts connected with the working capital, whereas the next chapter deals with the components of the working capital, finally followed by the working capital policy. Components of the working capital are inventories, <b>trade</b> accounts <b>receivables,</b> cash and <b>trade</b> accounts payables on which we have concentrated the most. The movements of inventories, <b>trade</b> accounts <b>receivables</b> and <b>trade</b> accounts payables have been shown for Gorenje Group and furthermore, the average values of these, the turnover ratio in days and the turnover ratio have been calculated. Since the company needs to finance the working capital, we have tried to determine how the rate of turning affects the working capital financing by means of the working capital conversion cycle. We {{have come to the conclusion}} that the high turnover of the working capital reduces the need for financing the resources. It is better for the company to have shorter days of inventories turnover, <b>trade</b> accounts <b>receivables</b> and <b>trade</b> accounts payables turnover. The perfect situation would be if the company could finance its inventories and <b>trade</b> accounts <b>receivables</b> with the <b>trade</b> accounts payables. However, in reality companies need to search for other resources of financing. In the last chapter we are focused on the working capital policy, which talks about the amount of the working capital in the company and resources for their financing. With appropriately formed working capital policy the company reduces the necessary range of financing and increases the return of capital...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores a {{financial}} role of Japanese general trading companies (GTCs), which {{act as a}} central point in a distribution network among group firms. I examine Meltzer’s conjecture, which holds that financially strong companies like GTCs increase <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> and reduce trade payables to shield their trading partners from a monetary squeeze. First, I investigate the trade credit granted to each other by GTCs and all its trade partners. The panel estimation demonstrates that both <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> and trade payables decrease during periods of monetary tightness and increase during those of monetary ease. In response {{to a change in}} a bank-lending indicator, there is little difference between <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> and payables. Thus GTCs become neither net-credit providers nor net-credit takers from this behavior. In other words, interfirm financing passing through a GTC’s balance sheet positively correlates with banking financing. Therefore, the Meltzer hypothesis does not hold for transactions between GTCs and all their trade partners. Instead, gross trade credit functions as a complement to macroeconomic bank lending. Second, I examine trade credit by dividing GTCs’ trading partners into related companies (i. e., subsidiaries and associate firms) and non-related companies. In terms of the reactions of trade credit to market financial indicators, I did not find statistically significant evidence that the Meltzer hypothesis works in either case. No matter with whom a GTC trades, interfirm financing passing through the GTC’s balance sheet moves positively in concert with banking financing. A major difference between related and non-related companies lies {{in the way in which}} <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> react to a GTC’s individual financial situation (that is, a firm’s individual interest expense rate minus a market’s interest rate). An increase in the interest gap induces a GTC to incur extra expenses over the market rate. In this situation, a GTC reduces <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> to non-related firms, but not those to related firms. This behavior eventually works as a shield, protecting their related companies from sharing the parent company’s interest costs. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, using {{microdata}} in Japan, {{we investigate}} whether credit contagion decreases trade credit supply for small businesses. In 1997 - 98 the Japanese economy experienced a large recession, {{and the number}} of dishonored bills {{and the number of}} bankruptcy filings caused by the domino effect increased. During a period of credit contagion, if firms possess higher financial claims than other firms, the possibility of default becomes higher. Therefore, if the problem of credit contagion is serious during such a period, suppliers withdraw trade credit from customers with higher <b>trade</b> <b>receivables.</b> They might also withdraw more trade credit from customers even though the credit risk of the customers is low. We find that during a recession, suppliers reduce trade credit more for small businesses with higher <b>trade</b> <b>receivables.</b> Additionally, in the manufacturing trade, credit is reduced for both risky and non-risky small firms.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} trade finance in the trade collapse of 2008 - 09 {{from the perspective of}} the Korean economy. We use two approaches. Firstly, as background to a more formal analysis, we make a casual observation on the behavior of aggregate data on trade finance, on which Korea has relatively abundant data. Aggregate data do not convincingly support the view that trade finance played an active role in causing the trade collapse. The measures of trade finance and the value of trade both dropped sharply, but the ratio of trade finance over trade was stable and in some cases increased during the crisis period. Secondly, using quarterly data on listed firms in Korea, we conduct panel estimations to test whether firms that are more dependent on external finance experienced greater export contraction during the crisis. Our regression analysis suggests that the financial vulnerability of firms, measured by various financial ratios, did not contribute to export contraction during the financial crisis. This observation largely applies even to smaller firms, who are usually thought of as being more vulnerable financially. However, we find that small exporters that relied heavily on cross-border <b>trade</b> payables or <b>receivables</b> suffered larger drops in export growth during the crisis...|$|R
