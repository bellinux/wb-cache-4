25|$|In Week 2, {{the team}} {{traveled}} to St. Louis where they lost 24-22. A major defensive loss was suffered when Brian Orakpo went {{down from a}} tear to his left pectoral muscle. Despite widespread complaints from Redskins fans and players about the Rams playing dirty, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but {{move on to the}} home opener against Cincinnati. The game started on a bad omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to pile up as CB Josh Wilson and WR Pierre Garçon went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24-22, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead. The Redskins only won one of their next five games, going into the bye week at 3-6.|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{was described as}} [...] "a bit of a floozy", “fiery”, “a bitch" [...] and [...] "feisty". Kat is described by the EastEnders website saying {{that as soon as}} she arrived in Walford with her [...] "fake tan, heavy make-up and hoop earrings", viewers would know that Kat would bring a dose of [...] "Viagra to the men of Albert Square". It continues to read: [...] "Her mum had died, dad was grieving and nan (Mo) was touting stolen meat off the back of lorries (some things never change). Kat wasted very little time in establishing herself as a drama queen by shocking everyone with the revelation that her youngest sister, Zoe was in fact her daughter. Then she stole her dishy doctor boyfriend for good measure." [...] It continues: [...] "With her enemies closing in, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but return home to Walford for help, complete with a huge baby bump" ...|$|E

2500|$|One interned {{serviceman}} {{described the}} Laghouat camp as a [...] "Beau Geste style fort based about a Saharan oasis". Those held were treated well, except that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{and they were}} not allowed to leave the camp. In any event, [...] "any escape was virtually impossible, given the expanse of desert that surrounded them". Another internee wrote to the Red Cross in Scotland from the Camp des internés britanniques Laghouat : [...] "Technically we are not prisoners of war but up to the present {{have not been able to}} find a difference. Unfortunately 30 to 40 per cent of the articles sent in the batch of parcels were missing." [...] In his book There and Back Again: a navigator's story (2004), former Royal Air Force navigator Douglas Hudson of 101 Squadron reports that over five hundred Allied prisoners were held in the camp. He tells of inhumane living conditions and the construction of an escape tunnel.|$|E
