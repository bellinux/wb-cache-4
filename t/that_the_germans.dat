5|$|High {{figures for}} tanks lost {{during the battle}} have been widely {{attributed}} to the Germans, but these are incorrect. For example, Rotmistrov in his postwar accounts of the battle stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> lost 350–400 tanks, including 70 Tigers, and 3,500–10,000 soldiers on 12 July, and a Soviet General Staff study of the Battle of Kursk reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> lost 300 tanks, 20 assault guns and over 4,500 soldiers in the battle from 12 to 16 July inclusive. However, archival data of the German units involved show that much lower losses were incurred during the battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 French agents {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> {{were planning}} to mount an offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk {{in the ground and}} served by rail links. The first signs of abnormal activity at Mimoyecques were spotted by analysts at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit in September 1943, when aerial reconnaissance revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites. Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large-scale activity around the tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Empire has {{any place in}} dictating the terms of peace. The authors also insist <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> populace must accept some blame for having not resisted the march to war {{on the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>German</b> government. <b>The</b> authors maintain <b>that</b> immediate calls for negotiation would not be favorable, as <b>the</b> <b>German</b> state would potentially dictate the process from a position of diplomatic and military power. Instead, <b>the</b> manifesto proclaims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war must be continued so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> state loses its military strength, and by extension, its ability to negotiate.|$|R

5|$|Some historians state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> troops did {{not expect}} the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, <b>the</b> Soviet armour <b>that</b> was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops {{could not have been}} genuinely surprised. <b>The</b> <b>German</b> historian Dieter Brand argues <b>that</b> even though <b>the</b> <b>German</b> commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, <b>the</b> frontline <b>German</b> troops were indeed largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|R

5|$|Stalin {{consulted}} with his frontline commanders and senior {{officers of the}} General Staff from 12 to 15 April 1943. In the end he and the Stavka agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> would probably target Kursk. Stalin believed the decision to defend would give the Germans the initiative, but Zhukov countered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> would be drawn into a trap where their armoured power would be destroyed, thus creating the conditions for a major Soviet counteroffensive. They decided to meet the enemy attack by preparing defensive positions to wear out the German groupings before launching their own offensive. Preparation of defences and fortifications began {{by the end of}} April, and continued until the German attack in early July. The two-month delay between the German decision to attack the Kursk salient and its implementation allowed the Red Army ample time to thoroughly prepare.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had by {{now been}} fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Godfrey put Fleming {{in charge}} of Operation Goldeneye between 1941 and 1942; Goldeneye was a plan to {{maintain}} an intelligence framework in Spain {{in the event of}} a German takeover of the territory. Fleming's plan involved maintaining communication with Gibraltar and launching sabotage operations against the Nazis. In 1941 he liaised with Donovan over American involvement in a measure intended to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> did not dominate the seaways.|$|E

5|$|Despite the War Ministry's {{position}} {{immediately after}} the First World War, in 1932 it was reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> army was training pigeons for photography, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> pigeon cameras were capable of 200 exposures per flight. In the same year, <b>the</b> French claimed <b>that</b> they had developed film cameras for pigeons {{as well as a}} method for having the birds released behind enemy lines by trained dogs.|$|R

5|$|After 24 hours, only 2,500 {{men of the}} 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd Airborne {{were under}} the control of their divisions, {{approximately}} a third of the force dropped. This wide dispersal had the effect of confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response. The 7th Army received notification of the parachute drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion was underway. The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in the week before the invasion meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> did not detect the approaching fleet until 02:00.|$|E
5|$|Both battalions {{were still}} {{in contact with the}} Germans during the {{withdrawal}} with 10 Para to the north having the furthest to travel to reach the relative safety of the rail crossing. By 15:00 it became obvious <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were already in front of the battalion. Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, they had to capture positions between themselves and the railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's rear guard.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{discovered}} in Weizsäcker's office, Fleischmann's laboratory and the Strasbourg Hospital pointed to nuclear activities {{taking place at}} Stadtilm, Haigerloch, Hechingen, and Tailfingen. After establishing its headquarters in von Haagen's office Alsos staff uncovered documents concerning secret medical experiments at Natzweiler concentration camp. These indicated the Germans {{had been unable to}} develop a practical process for uranium enrichment. For the first time the Alsos Mission was able to categorically report <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> did not have nuclear weapons, and would not have them for some time.|$|E

5|$|Dummy {{horses were}} {{sometimes}} used to deceive the enemy into misreading {{the location of}} troops. They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. Evidence exists <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US are suspected of infecting cattle and horses bound for France with glanders, a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns {{in their ability to}} move artillery on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann {{sent for}} Brand again {{a few days}} later.

Clages' presence meant that three of Himmler's senior officers– Eichmann, Becher and Clages– had involved themselves with the Brand proposal. Clages handed Brand $50,000 and 270,000 Swiss francs <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> had intercepted, sent to the Aid and Rescue Committee by rescue workers in Switzerland via the Swedish Embassy in Budapest.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd wrote {{a letter}} to President Franklin D.

Roosevelt agreed, and the result was the Manhattan Project—a top-secret research program administered by Major General Leslie R.
