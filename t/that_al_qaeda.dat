Alia Brahimi argues <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda’s</b> activity in targeting Britain and Europe is unlikely to let up, because it sees attacks on ‘legitimate’ targets in the West as bolstering its flagging perceived legitimacy and authority, and as congruent with its more ‘moderate’ tactics in the Arabian peninsula of minimizing harm to Muslims...|$|R

Bergen wrote that even if al-Qaeda is not as organised as the Bush administration stressed, {{it is still a}} very dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the resources available to bin Laden. On Curtis's claim that al-Qaeda was a creation of neoconservative politicians, Bergen said, [...] "This is nonsense. There is substantial evidence <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> was founded in 1988 by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation that implemented the 9/11 attacks." [...] Bergen further claimed that Curtis's arguments serve as a defence of Bush's failure to capture bin Laden in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and his ignoring warnings of a terrorist attack prior to 11 September.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the head}} of the UN's counter-piracy division, Colonel John Steed, the Al-Shabaab group in 2011 {{increasingly}} sought to cooperate with the pirate gangs in the face of dwindling funds and resources for their own activities. Steed, however, acknowledged that he had no definite proof of operational ties between the pirates and the Islamist militants. Detained pirates also indicated to UNODC officials that some measure of cooperation with Al-Shabaab militants was necessary, as they have increasingly launched maritime raids from areas in southern Somalia controlled by the insurgent outfit. Al-Shabaab members have also extorted the pirates, demanding protection money from them and forcing seized pirate gang leaders in Harardhere to hand over 20% of future ransom proceeds. It has been suggested that al-Qaeda have received funding from pirate operations. A maritime intelligence source told CBS News that it was [...] "'inconceivable' to Western intelligence agencies <b>that</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> would not be getting some financial reward from the successful hijackings". They go on to express concern about this funding link being able to keep the group satisfied as piracy gains more publicity and higher ransoms.|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Byman, {{security}} studies {{professor at}} Georgetown University, argues that Washington must clarify its policies behind extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings, lest a nefarious precedent {{in international law}} is set. Additionally, Byman argues that Washington must [...] "remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid." [...] Though Byman recognizes the problems inherent in using armed UAVs, he believes {{that they are very}} effective. [...] "U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,000 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban--top figures who are not easily replaced." [...] Drones have also undercut terrorists' ability to effectively communicate with its target audiences, ultimately straining their recruitment pools. To avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda operates have avoided gathering in large numbers and mitigated use of electronic devices. Byman argues <b>that</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> leaders [...] "cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire coupe of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda's command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} anthrax attacks, White House {{officials}} repeatedly pressured FBI Director Robert Mueller {{to prove that}} they were a second-wave assault by al-Qaeda following the September 11 attacks. During the president's morning intelligence briefings, Mueller was [...] "beaten up" [...] for not producing proof that the killer spores were the handiwork of terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden, according to a former aide. [...] "They really wanted to blame somebody in the Middle East," [...] the retired senior FBI official stated. The FBI knew early on that the anthrax used was of a consistency requiring sophisticated equipment and was unlikely to have been produced in some [...] "cave". At the same time, both President Bush and Vice President Cheney in public statements speculated {{about the possibility of a}} link between the anthrax attacks and Al Qaeda. The Guardian reported in early October that American scientists had implicated Iraq as the source of the anthrax, and the next day the Wall St. Journal editorialized <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> perpetrated the mailings, with Iraq the source of the anthrax. A few days later, John McCain suggested on the Late Show with David Letterman that the anthrax may have come from Iraq, and the next week ABC News did a series of reports stating that three or four (depending on the report) sources had identified bentonite as an ingredient in the anthrax preparations, implicating Iraq.|$|E

Hitherto little heard of, and also known as Abu Humam or Abu Rana, Suaidi was captured hiding in a building {{with a group of}} followers. [...] "Al-Qaeda in Iraq is severely wounded", Rubaie said. He said Suaidi had been involved in ordering the bombing of the Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in February 2006 that unleashed the wave of tit-for-tat killings now threatening civil war. Iraqi officials blame Al-Qaeda for the attack. The group denies it. Rubaie did not give Suaidi's nationality. He said he had been tracked to the same area north of Baghdad where US forces killed Al-Qaeda's leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in June 2006. [...] "He was hiding in a building used by families. He wanted to use children and women as human shields", Rubaie said. Little is publicly known about Suaidi. Rubaie called him the deputy of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, a shadowy figure, probably Egyptian, who took over the Sunni Islamist group from Zarqawi.|$|E

40|$|This Thesis {{develops}} and applies {{a theoretical}} framework to understand <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda’s</b> ideology. A concept of ideology comprising a number of political myths, shaped through rhetoric is the central feature of this research. The Thesis tests the theory that extremist ideologies emerge out {{of social and political}} crises and postulates that the primary components of ideology are a number of political myths created in the context of historical,theological and political factors. These myths and other components of ideology are given form through rhetoric and the rhetorical styles and techniques employed, in turn, shape ideology. Rhetorical analysis is carried out to identify aspects of <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda’s</b> ideology, particularly in the construction of political myth. Analysis of the relationship between textuality and political style reveals <b>that</b> while <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> adopts republican attitudes to political debate, its textual style most closely matches the texts of modern revolutionary terrorists and reveals a great deal about its dual reliance on horrific violence and reasoned discourse. The rhetorical influences on <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda’s</b> main ideologue are examined to reveal how they shape its ideology. The research fills a gap in academic analysis of terrorism in general and ideology in particular by providing a novel framework to identify the roots, causes, beliefs and trajectories of a particular seam of political thought. Specifically, it identifies <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> as an extreme and inevitable manifestation of Islamist political ideology, which in turn was a reaction to a number of modern political and social crises and ideas. The political myths <b>that</b> comprise <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda’s</b> ideology are inherited from mainstream Islamism and are open to critical challenge. However, its motivations and strategies are driven by its primary ideologues’ perception of their political and conflict experiences. The belief that Muslim countries are ruled by unrepresentative and ineffective regimes subservient to the West and the belief that through asymmetric tactics such as terrorism it is possible to destroy a superpower are the two driving forces <b>that</b> sustain <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda’s</b> ideology. These perceptions are less susceptible to critical debate and may only change after a transformation of political reality; when convincing changes have occurred in the nature of regimes in the Muslim world and when <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda’s</b> political aims of defeating the West are demonstrably unachievable...|$|R
