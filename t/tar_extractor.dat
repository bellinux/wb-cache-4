50|$|There {{were two}} {{purposes}} to the liquid seal: first, {{to draw off}} some of the tar and liquor, as the gas from the retort was laden with tar, and the hydraulic main could rid the gas of it, to a certain degree; further tar removal would take place in the condenser, washer/scrubber, and the <b>tar</b> <b>extractor.</b> Still, there would be less tar to deal with later. Second, the liquid seal also provided defense against air being drawn into the hydraulic main: if the main had no liquid within, and a retort was left open with the pipe not shut off, and air were to combine with the gas, the main could explode, along with nearby benches.|$|E

30|$|However, {{there are}} little {{systematic}} research on extracting phenol from coal <b>tar</b> with centrifugal <b>extractor.</b> In order {{to get rid of}} the drawbacks of annulus centrifugal extractor, such as high energy consumption, complex structure and hard dismantling (Chen et al. 2009; Yuan et al. 2010; Wang 2014; Li et al. 2016), the extraction phenol from coal tar by new-type high flux centrifugal extractor were systematically studied in this paper.|$|R
