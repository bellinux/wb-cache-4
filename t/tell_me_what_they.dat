Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." ...|$|E

40|$|Orthodoxy in {{epistemology}} {{maintains that}} some sources of belief, e. g. perception and introspection, generate knowledge, while others, e. g. testimony and m emory, preserve knowledge. An exam ple from Jennifer Lackey – the Schoolteacher case – purports {{to show that}} testimony can generate knowledge. It is argued that Lackey’s case fails to subvert the orthodox view, for the case does not involve the generation of knowledge by testimony. A {{modified version of the}} case does. Lackey’s example illustrates the orthodox view; the revised case refutes it. The theoretical explanation of knowledge from testimony as information transmission explains how testimony transfers knowledge and why it can generate knowledge. It also revea ls the real difference between so-called “generative ” and so-called “preservative ” sources. The former extract information; the latter transmit information. Perception provides knowledge of the world, introspection knowledge of our selves, and mindreading knowledge of other minds. Reasoning extends knowledge beyond things we already know. Perception, introspection, mindreading, and reasoning are all ways of generating new knowledge, generating knowledge of events, facts, and states of affairs not known before. Memory differs. Memory preserves knowledge of things we already know. If I knew something at an earlier time, say on the basis of perception, and then I remember it now, then I know it now, but only because I knew it before. Testimony (the process of forming beliefs on the basis of understanding what other people say) looks like memory. If someone else knows something and <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> know, and I accept <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say, then I come to know it too. But I only acquire knowledge from accepting <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say if they know it already. Testimony, like memory, doesn’t generate knowledge where there was no knowledge before; testimony preserves knowledge...|$|R

However, after some discourse and mutual promises that no advantage should be taken on either side, by what was transacted then or at any other of those meetings, they came to a kind of a treaty; but so remote, and so wide from one another, that nothing could be expected from it; for my attorney demanded #500 and charges, and they offered #50 without charges; so they broke off, and the mercer proposed to have a meeting with me myself; and my attorney agreed to that very readily.|$|R
40|$|Background: Contemporary {{birthing}} practises in Australia pose a medicalised technological environment whereby women&rsquo;s {{needs are}} often {{secondary to the}} hospital-medical environment. As {{a result of the}} increased removal of human connection and touch, there have been reports of increased desensitisation, even disembodiment of midwives and obstetricians from the labouring woman, and an associated increase in birth trauma experiences in maternity care settings. Despite current studies of women&rsquo;s trauma when involved in a caesarean section, instrumental delivery or other emergency scenario, however little research has been done into women&rsquo;s lived experiences of psychological and emotional trauma related to vaginal births. Contemporary birthing practices inside Victorian metropolitan public maternity hospitals within Australia pose significant risk of psychological and emotional trauma to mothers experiencing vaginal births. Method: This study employed a qualitative exploratory descriptive approach. Selection criteria included: First time mothers who gave birth within the last year in a maternity hospital in Australia, had a vaginal birth with no instruments, experienced some perceived form of self-reported birth trauma, live in the northern corridor of Melbourne, a permanent resident of Australia, able to converse in fluently in English, over 20 years of age. Exclusion criteria: obstetric co-morbidity (for example. Pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes), recent immigrant to Australia - less than five years, psychiatric co-morbidity, complex birth event, caesarean and twins. Women were recruited who birthed within a Melbourne metropolitan public maternity hospital. This was a convenience sample of women who had a traumatic birthing experience. Data were collected using an in-depth semi structured interview and data saturation was achieved after seven interviews. Results: The data analysis revealed nine themes, I was determined to birth naturally; Not <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing; I just had to force her to be born; I felt traumatised; it was really horrific; I know that is just what the system is like&hellip; they&rsquo;re hospital midwives&hellip; they&rsquo;re medical; I didn&rsquo;t feel connected to them; She stood up for me/ I felt powerful; After the birth, just horrible/ Your stuck with the consequences; I deserve a better birth. These themes each identified areas of deep distress for the women leading to perceived traumas exacerbated by midwifery and obstetrical procedures and attitudes. Women experienced varying degrees of trauma, ranging from wishing they would die to feeling as though they were violently assaulted. One of the most commonly reported experiences for women in the study was that they felt powerless, out of control, ignored and abandoned by the midwives and obstetricians. The actions or inactions of midwives and obstetricians had a direct involvement to how women perceived their trauma. A series of recommendations for better midwifery practice were made including introducing a maternity care model based on caseload midwifery practices, improved antenatal education and continued postnatal support through debriefing of a woman&rsquo;s birth event. Conclusion: Key findings included the new discovery that birth trauma perceptions are not exclusive to actual obstetrical acts during labour and birth. Rather that a vaginal birth can hold equally as much of a traumatic impact than, for example, a caesarean or emergency forceps birth. The results highlighted the depth of trauma for women experiencing vaginal births within metropolitan Melbourne public maternity hospitals. These findings emphasise the need for changes to hospital processes including antenatal education, midwifery and obstetrician education, staff attitudes and women&rsquo;s capacity to act assertively during labour...|$|R
