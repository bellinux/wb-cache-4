5|$|In {{the top of}} the box was a hole {{perhaps an}} inch in diameter. As they looked <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> they saw the picture of a man. It was a most {{marvelous}} picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect....|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> of the donut. An example is the red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a union of such circles.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was first}} opened around 1760 {{by a local}} farmer to obtain stone for road building. The site was {{excavated}} by John Skinner and Richard Hoare in 1816-17, who gained the entry <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> which was made previously. The excavation revealed the bones (some burned) of several individuals. The mound was restored in 1858 by Thomas Joliffe. Some of the artefacts from the excavations are in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E
50|$|External wire {{connections}} to the board are made either by soldering <b>the</b> wires <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> or, for wires too thick to pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> by soldering them to specially made pins called Veropins which fit tightly into <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> Alternatively, some types of connectors have a suitable pin spacing to be inserted directly into the board.|$|R
50|$|Each hitch has {{attachment}} holes for attaching implements, and the implement has posts that fit <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> <b>The</b> implement is secured {{by placing a}} pin {{on the ends of}} the posts.|$|R
50|$|A typical gauge {{used when}} making tennis balls would have two holes, one {{slightly}} larger than the other. A manufactured object passes the go/no go test if it goes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> large <b>hole</b> but does not go <b>through</b> <b>the</b> smaller hole; the object fails if it passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> smaller <b>hole,</b> or does not pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> large <b>hole.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{televised}} {{contest of}} Bound for Glory was the Steel Asylum {{to determine the}} number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. There were ten participants in this contest; those involved were Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Sonjay Dutt, and Super Eric. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave to the ring, while SoCal Val accompanied Dutt. In this encounter, the ring was surrounded by a large red steel cage that domed with a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling. The objective was for a competitor to fight up the walls of the cage and escape via the hole in the center. The first person to complete the task won the match and became number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. The duration of the bout was 12 minutes and 7 seconds. After several minutes of fighting among one another, several wrestlers attempted to climb the cage but were stopped. At one point, Devine performed his signature Devine Intervention maneuver on Rave, with Rave landing awkwardly on his neck. The winner of the contest was Lethal, who climbed the cage and escaped <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> while everyone was preoccupied.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

25|$|Another {{method by}} which {{sustained}} release is achieved is through an osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system, where the active compound is encased in a water-permeable membrane with a laser drilled hole at one end. As water passes through the membrane the drug is pushed out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> and into the digestive tract {{where it can be}} absorbed.|$|E

30|$|An air-injection {{press was}} {{developed}} to prevent particleboard from blowing out during the manufacturing process. The air-injection press, which has <b>holes</b> punched in <b>the</b> heating plates, injects high-pressure air into <b>the</b> board <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> of one plate and releases <b>the</b> air <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> of <b>the</b> other plate. The high-pressure air forces out vapor trapped within the board, thus preventing blowout. The newly developed press reduced the pressing time required for manufacturing board from high-moisture-content particles. However, the manufactured boards exhibited mechanical properties and dimensional stability inferior to conventionally manufactured boards.|$|R

25|$|It was {{fashionable to}} pluck or shave the {{forehead}} {{to raise the}} hairlines. The hair was tied tightly on the scalp and usually hidden inside the cone (possibly {{one end of the}} veil was tied to the hair and wrapped round, with the free end being pulled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> {{at the tip of the}} cone). However some images show long hair worn loose behind the hennin.|$|E
25|$|The epoxy/core test, detects voids by {{visual and}} {{mechanical}} methods. It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter {{hole through the}} pavement into the sub-base with a dry-bit roto-hammer. Next, a two-part epoxy is poured into the hole – dyed for visual clarity. Once the epoxy hardens, technicians drill <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> If a void is present, the epoxy will stick to the core and provide physical evidence.|$|E
25|$|A camera obscura device {{consists}} of a box, tent or room with a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and perspective preserved. The image can be projected onto paper, and can then be traced to produce a highly accurate representation.|$|E
40|$|A flow {{network is}} a system of {{mutually}} intersecting holes in a plate or an assembly of plates. The flow at each intersection {{is characterized by a}} collision of two flow streams, resulting in complex flow patterns <b>through</b> <b>the</b> downstream <b>holes.</b> In <b>the</b> case of multiple intersections, the flow is periodically disrupted at each succeeding intersection, thus preventing the formation of a fully-developed flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Williams {{made the}} hole {{big enough to}} get into the next room, which was {{occupied}} only by patient Private Waters, and dragged the patients through. The last man out was Hook, who killed some Zulus who had knocked down the door before he dived <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> John Williams once again went to work, spurred on {{by the fact that the}} roof was now ablaze, as Hook defended the hole and Waters continued to fire through a loophole.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, three utility {{workers in}} Key Largo, Florida, died {{one by one}} within seconds of {{descending}} into a narrow space beneath a manhole cover to check a section of paved street, the hole was filled with hydrogen sulfide and methane gas created from years of rotted vegetation. In an attempt to save the men, a firefighter who entered the hole without his air tank (because he could not fit <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> with it) collapsed within seconds {{and had to be}} rescued by a colleague. The firefighter was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital and later recovered.|$|E

25|$|Public sex of {{any kind}} is illegal {{in many parts of}} the world, and police {{undercover}} operations continue to be used in order to enforce such laws. Adverse personal consequences to participants in glory hole activity have included police surveillance, public humiliation in the press, often with marital and employment consequences, and imprisonment following a criminal conviction. Gay bashing, mugging, and bodily injury are further potential risks. For reasons of personal safety, as well as etiquette, men typically wait for a signal from the receptive partner to come <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> before inserting any part of their genitals through a glory hole.|$|E
25|$|As {{reported}} in David Kushner's Masters of Doom, when Carmack was 14, {{he broke into}} a school to help {{a group of children}} steal Apple II computers. To gain entry to the building, Carmack concocted a sticky substance of thermite mixed with Vaseline that melted through the windows. However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> and opened the window, setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. Carmack was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions 'no empathy for other human beings' and describes Carmack as 'a brain on legs'). Carmack was then sentenced to a year in a juvenile home.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{the front}} {{head of a}} kit bass drum has {{a hole in it}} to allow air to escape when the drum is struck for shorter sustain. Muffling can be {{installed}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> without taking off the front head. The hole also allows microphones to be placed into the bass drum for recording and amplification. In addition to microphones, sometimes trigger pads are used to amplify the sound and provide a uniform tone, especially when fast playing without decrease of volume is desired. Professional drummers often choose to have a customized bass drum front head, with the logo or name of their band on the front.|$|E
