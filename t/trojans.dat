5|$|The <b>Trojans</b> next {{faced the}} Stanford Cardinal. Though the Cardinal {{were the last}} team to beat the <b>Trojans</b> at home back in 2001, they were {{slightly}} struggling under first–year head coach Walt Harris and quarterback Trent Edwards with a 4–3 record. The <b>Trojans</b> jumped to an early lead with a LenDale White rushing touchdown, a Reggie Bush rushing touchdown, a Leinart touchdown pass to White, and a Mario Danelo field goal. With a 24-point lead, Leinart threw two more touchdown passes before Edwards passed for the first Cardinal touchdown of the game. Leinart's fourth touchdown pass came with threeminutes left in the half to give the <b>Trojans</b> a 44–7 half-time lead. The Cardinal scored on a rush in the third quarter, and with many starters out the <b>Trojans</b> answered {{in the fourth quarter}} with their own rushing touchdown. The Cardinal ended the scoring with 23seconds remaining with their second rushing touchdown of the game to bring the score to 51–21. With the win, the <b>Trojans</b> extended their winning streak to 31games.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Trojans</b> next {{faced the}} Washington State Cougars, led by third–year head coach Bill Doba and quarterback Alex Brink. The <b>Trojans</b> took an early lead on a Leinart {{touchdown}} pass to Dwayne Jarrett, but the Cougars answered twominutes later on a Jerome Harrison rush for a touchdown. After the Cougars missed the extra point, the <b>Trojans</b> scored three more touchdowns in the first quarter, with a fumble recovery {{in the end zone}} and two more Leinart touchdown passes, to take a 28–6 lead. Late in the second quarter the <b>Trojans</b> scored again on a LenDale White touchdown rush, and a Mario Danelo field goal as time was expiring gave them a 38–6 half-time lead. The <b>Trojans</b> would get another Danelo field goal and a second White touchdown rush before the Cougars would rush for their second touchdown. With a final rushing touchdown after the starters had been taken out of the game, the <b>Trojans</b> won 55–13 and increased their winning streak to 30games.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Trojan</b> {{insertion}} {{has been}} made difficult in modern communications in the recent years, due to extensive research work in the direction to protect Integrated Circuits (ICs). Several <b>Trojan</b> detection techniques {{have been developed to}} prevent the destruction caused by malicious insertion of <b>Trojan</b> in physical layer, making the process of <b>Trojan</b> insertion much more difficult. In this paper, we highlight our major findings in terms of innovative <b>Trojan</b> design that can easily evade existing <b>Trojan</b> detection approaches based on side-channel analysis. We propose a design that makes <b>Trojan</b> undetectable for known defense benchmarks and during functional testing. We demonstrate our <b>Trojan</b> model and validate the results on a known defense mechanism. We also present a novel detection mechanism for the same proposed <b>Trojan</b> model. The experimental results are presented using Xilinx Place and Route characteristics, in particular, the Floorplanner tool to identify the <b>Trojan</b> and address such problems.

5|$|The <b>Trojans</b> next {{faced the}} sixteenth–ranked Fresno State Bulldogs, led by ninth–year head coach Pat Hill and quarterback Paul Pinegar. The Bulldogs took an early lead on a Pinegar {{touchdown}} pass that was answered by LenDale White's rushing touchdown for the <b>Trojans</b> {{to leave the}} game tied {{at the end of}} the first quarter. After a rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs, the <b>Trojans</b> could only answer with a Mario Danelo field goal. A second passing touchdown by Pinegar and another Danelo field goal closed out the half with the Bulldogs leading 21–13. The <b>Trojans</b> seemed to take control of the game in the third quarter with a Leinart touchdown run, a Reggie Bush touchdown run, and a Leinart touchdown pass that gave the <b>Trojans</b> a 13-point lead. Pinegar answered for the Bulldogs with his third touchdown pass of the game, but a 50-yard touchdown rush by Bush allowed the <b>Trojans</b> to keep the same lead, Two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, Pinegar's fourth touchdown pass and a second rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs, gave them a 1-point lead with nineminutes left in the game. After a 65-yard run by Bush, White scored for the <b>Trojans,</b> who missed on a two–point conversion attempt. A Danelo field goal gave the <b>Trojans</b> a 50–42 lead, and the <b>Trojans</b> won after intercepting Pinegar with a minute left in the game. Bush set a Pac-10 record with 513total yards in the game, including almost 300yards rushing, and the <b>Trojans</b> increased their winning streak to 33games.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Trojans</b> next {{traveled}} to face rivals, the California Golden Bears, led by fourth–year head coach Jeff Tedford and quarterback Joe Ayoob. Although the Bears handed the <b>Trojans</b> their last loss in 2003, they were struggling in the season, having lost {{three out of}} the last four games and dropping out of the rankings {{for the first time since}} 2003. The <b>Trojans</b> scored first after Ayoob's first of four interceptions in the game, on a LenDale White rush. Ayoob recovered after the interception, and led the Bears to a field goal to cut their deficit to four at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Leinart rushed for a pair of touchdowns to give the <b>Trojans</b> a 21–3 lead at half-time. After a pair of White rushing touchdowns, the Bears scored again on a Chris Manerino rush that ended scoring in the game, with the <b>Trojans</b> winning 35–10. With the win, the <b>Trojans</b> clinched at least a share of the Pac-10 title and increased their winning streak to 32games, tied for the sixthlongest in history.|$|E
5|$|The largest Jupiter trojan is 624 Hektor, {{which has}} an average {{diameter}} of 203±3.6km. There are few large Jupiter <b>trojans</b> {{in comparison to the}} overall population. With decreasing size, the number of Jupiter <b>trojans</b> grows very quickly down to 84km, much more so than in the asteroid belt. A diameter of 84km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9.5, assuming an albedo of 0.04. Within the 4.4–40km range the Jupiter trojans' size distribution resembles that of the main-belt asteroids. Nothing is known about the masses of the smaller Jupiter <b>trojans.</b> The size distribution suggests that the smaller <b>Trojans</b> are the products of collisions by larger Jupiter <b>trojans.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{future of}} the Jupiter <b>trojans</b> is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the Jupiter trojan population as fragments are ejected. Ejected Jupiter <b>trojans</b> could become temporary satellites of Jupiter or Jupiter-family comets. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter <b>trojans</b> are unstable {{over the age of}} the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 ejected Jupiter <b>trojans</b> greater than 1km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped Jupiter <b>trojans</b> may become Jupiter-family comets as they approach the Sun and their surface ice begins evaporating.|$|E

5|$|In the Trojans' {{first home}} {{game of the}} season they faced the Arkansas Razorbacks, led by eighth–year head coach Houston Nutt and quarterback Robert Johnson. Bush opened the scoring for the <b>Trojans</b> with a 76-yard rush. The Razorbacks {{answered}} with a touchdown pass by Johnson, however, Leinart scored three touchdowns, two passing and one rushing, {{before the end of the}} quarter. In the second quarter the Razorbacks were able to kick a field goal before the <b>Trojans</b> scored two more touchdowns on a rush by LenDale White and a third pass by Leinart. Going into the half the <b>Trojans</b> led 42–10. In the third quarter, White rushed for his second touchdown and Leinart threw a fourth before the Trojan starters were taken out of the game. Booty threw his second touchdown of the season in the fourth quarter before backup quarterback Alex Mortensen threw a touchdown for the Razorbacks. Third-string Trojan quarterback Mike McDonald threw a 4-yard touchdown to end the game, giving the <b>Trojans</b> a 70–17 win and a 24-game winning streak.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter <b>trojans</b> do not {{maintain}} a fixed separation from Jupiter. They slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points, periodically {{moving closer to}} Jupiter or farther from it. Jupiter <b>trojans</b> generally follow paths called tadpole orbits around the Lagrangian points; the average period of their libration is about 150 years. The amplitude of the libration (along the Jovian orbit) varies from 0.6° to 88°, with the average being about 33°. Simulations show that Jupiter <b>trojans</b> can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one Lagrangian point to another—these are called horseshoe orbits (currently no Jupiter Trojan with such an orbit is known).|$|E

5|$|The <b>Trojans</b> next {{stayed on}} the road and faced the fifteenth–ranked Arizona State Sun Devils, led by fifth–year head coach Dirk Koetter and quarterback Sam Keller. With both offenses {{struggling}} in the first quarter, Sun Devil, Terry Richardson, opened scoring on an 84-yard punt return for a touchdown. The <b>Trojans</b> answered early in the second quarter with a field goal, however, two touchdowns, a Keller pass and a Keegan Herring rush, gave the Sun Devils an 18-point half-time lead. Starting in the third quarter the <b>Trojans</b> got on track with a pair of rushing touchdowns to bring their deficit to four, and midway through the fourth quarter they took the lead on a quarterback sneak by Leinart. Keller drove the Sun Devils to another touchdown to take back the lead, but two more rushing touchdowns by the <b>Trojans,</b> within a minute and a half, gave them the win, 38–28. Reggie Bush and LenDale White both ran for over 150yards to help the <b>Trojans</b> win their Pac-10 record 26th consecutive game. Helping to seal the win for the <b>Trojans</b> were their defense who sacked Keller five times and caused him to throw five interceptions.

Later in the quarter, Clemens threw a touchdown and {{early in the second}} quarter another field goal gave the Ducks a 13–0 lead. Before the end of the half, Leinart threw a touchdown to Bush and a Mario Danelo field goal gave the <b>Trojans</b> a 13–10 deficit at the half.

The Huskies took an early lead {{on a field}} goal, but the <b>Trojans</b> {{answered}} with a Leinart touchdown pass to Steve Smith. Stanback threw his only touchdown of the game late in the quarter to give the Huskies a 10–7 lead, but the <b>Trojans</b> took the lead for good {{less than a minute}} later with Leinart's second touchdown pass of the day. A minute into the second quarter Reggie Bush ran for a touchdown, and, after a failed extra point attempt and the Huskies offense unable to move the ball, two minutes later returned a punt 84yards for a touchdown. After another failed drive for the Huskies and another twominutes, Leinart threw his third touchdown of the game to give the <b>Trojans</b> a 34–10 lead. Stanback rushed for a touchdown with twominutes remaining before half-time to cut their deficit in half, but Mario Danelo kicked a field goal as time expired to give the <b>Trojans</b> a 37–17 lead at half-time. In the third quarter, Leinart threw his fourth touchdown of the game before he was replaced by backup Booty. A Booty interception, that was returned 76yards by Dashon Goldson, gave the Huskies their last score of the game, and Booty's touchdown pass to Patrick Turner proved to be the final score in the game, giving the <b>Trojans</b> a 51–24 win. With the win the <b>Trojans</b> extended their winning streak to 29games.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{theories}} have emerged {{to explain the}} formation and evolution of the Jupiter <b>trojans.</b> The first suggests that the Jupiter <b>trojans</b> formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming. The last stage of Jupiter's formation involved runaway growth of its mass through the accretion of large amounts of hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk; during this growth, which lasted for only about 10,000 years, the mass of Jupiter increased {{by a factor of}} ten. The planetesimals that had approximately the same orbits as Jupiter were caught by the increased gravity of the planet. The capture mechanism was very efficient—about 50% of all remaining planetesimals were trapped. This hypothesis has two major problems: the number of trapped bodies exceeds the observed population of Jupiter <b>trojans</b> by four orders of magnitude, and the present Jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by the capture model. Simulations of this scenario show that such a mode of formation also would inhibit the creation of similar <b>trojans</b> for Saturn, and this has been borne out by observation: to date no <b>trojans</b> have been found near Saturn.|$|E
