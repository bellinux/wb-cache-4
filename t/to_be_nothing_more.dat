5|$|Production {{began on}} 18 September 1967 {{with a budget}} of £83,000. Thirty-two {{thousand}} pounds was provided by AIP, with £12,000 for Price's expenditures and fees, and £20,000 for production costs. Philip Waddilove, a former BBC radio and record producer, contributed £5,000 in return for associate producer billing. Although the film would be the biggest budgeted title in Tigon's history, for AIP their part of the budget represented a relatively small expenditure of money. Not much in terms of real quality was expected by AIP heads Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson, and the movie was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a tax write-off.|$|E
5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants {{who might be}} slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a {{necessary}} or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment. By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena {{with little or no}} training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald's {{goal was}} to produce a {{literary}} work which would truly prove himself as a writer, and Gatsby {{did not have the}} commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character. According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although 1926 brought Owen Davis's stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye. For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a nostalgic period piece.|$|E

25|$|More {{surprising}} was {{the analysis}} of the rat-poison paste; it turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a mixture of flour, water and soda. This led to the possibility that Marie used the real arsenic to murder her husband. Any remaining doubts that may have lingered vanished when Emma Pontier turned over the small malachite box, and Dr. Lespinasse found it to contain arsenic. Marie was arrested and held in jail in Brive. A young French lawyer, Charles Lachaud, was appointed to her defence and was assisted by three others, Maîtres Théodore Bac (who later became mayor of Limoges during the 1848 Revolution), Paillet, and Desmont. Before they began their work, there was another surprise in store. The newspaper stories regarding Marie Lafarge turned up something from her past.|$|E

The New York Times writer Ashley Dunn characterized the game's E3 demonstration as [...] "brain-dead" [...] in its gameplay and suggested that even young children would rather fly a dragon on the Sony PlayStation. Game Revolution issued Pilotwings 64 a particularly harsh review score, declaring the game <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a graphical showcase for those with nothing better to do. The sound effects present in the game were impressive to several reviewers, but the soundtrack has been negatively compared to lounge music and porn groove, although the 'Birdman' track was highly rated.|$|E

500|$|In 1918, Long began urging Terhune {{to publish}} a book of his dog stories, though Terhune himself was not {{convinced}} at first. He considered them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than [...] "hack writing" [...] and inferior to his other works. Even after Long convinced him of the public's love of the works, Terhune initially did nothing towards the goal. Later that year, Doubleday-Page, which had published Terhune's last novel Fortune, wrote asking to see his next book while reminding him that their contract gave them first refusal rights to it. Wanting to escape from that publisher due to the dismal performance of Fortune, Terhune decided to follow Long's suggestion so he could use the book of dog stories to fulfill his contractual obligation. After he collected together the twenty Lad stories he'd written so far, he reorganized them into chapters and submitted the book. He was unsurprised that it was rejected, but in the rejection letter the company referred to Alfred Ollivant's 1898 novel Owd Bob and Jack London's 1903 novel Call of the Wild as [...] "superior pieces of work". As Terhune himself considered both authors to be unimpressive writers, he became determined that Lad: A Dog would be published. E. P. Dutton's John Macrae, who was a known dog lover, found the stories [...] "simple but charming" [...] and felt the public would like them greatly.|$|E
500|$|... "What You Waiting For?" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork gave the song a strong review, rating it {{four and a}} half stars, and labeled it [...] "fucking great". The website went on to rank the song 16th on its list of the Top 50 Singles of 2004. RJ Smith of Blender noted the song's new wave influence by stating that it could start a revival of Missing Persons, and Amy Linden of The Village Voice compared the [...] "giddy, yodeling vocals" [...] to those of Lene Lovich's 1981 song [...] "New Toy". Jason Damas from PopMatters was mixed on the song, calling the opening [...] "awkward" [...] and the refrain [...] "ridiculously dumb", but arguing that the song [...] "is so frivolous and stupid that it winds up being brilliant; it pretends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than party bubblegum and achieves its artistic criteria beautifully." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani agreed, stating that [...] "it's this impishness that helps make 'What You Waiting For' one of the hottest 'arrival' songs of all time". Richard Smirke of Playlouder found the track's production [...] "crisp" [...] and [...] "edgy", and Jennifer Nine of Yahoo! Music called the song [...] "itchily irresistible". Jemma Volp-Fletcher, writing for Contactmusic.com, rated the song nine out of 10, commenting that it has [...] "irresistible commercial pull and a melody to die for" [...] and that the track [...] "makes the most of her unmistakable vocal and reflects that off-the-wall Stefani personality perfectly." [...] Natasha Tripney from musicOMH gave the song a negative review, stating that [...] "it'll become one of those tracks that's irritatingly catchy—but on this initial listening, Ms Stefani's debut solo effort is just plain irritating." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{nuisance}} claims; in Nichols v Marsland, for example, [...] "Act of God" [...] {{was accepted as}} a defence. One defence is that of [...] "20 years prescription", which is valid for private nuisance but not public. If a private nuisance continues for 20 years, it becomes legal by prescription, assuming the defendant can show {{that it has been}} continuous and the claimant has been aware of it. A limitation is that the 20 years is from when the activity became a nuisance, not from when the activity started. In Sturges v Bridgman, the claimant, a doctor, lived next to a [...] "confectionery business". Vibrations and noises coming from this business continued for over 20 years without causing the doctor nuisance, and the doctor only complained after building a consulting room in his garden. It was held that the actual nuisance only started when the consulting room was built and the activity began to affect the doctor, not when the activity started. A second defence is statutory authority, when an activity is authorised by a piece of legislation; this applies to both public and private nuisance. This applies even when the activity is carried out not directly in line with the statute, but intra vires. In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd, the defendant was authorised to build an oil refinery by an Act of Parliament. The Act gave no express authority to operate it, and after it came into operation the claimant argued that it caused a nuisance through the smell and noise. The House of Lords held that it had statutory authority to operate the refinery, saying [...] "Parliament can hardly be supposed to have intended the refinery <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a visual adornment to the landscape in an area of natural beauty". The statutory authority defence has recently been subject to legislative consideration in the Planning Act 2008, which expands the defence to over 14 types of infrastructure development.|$|E
