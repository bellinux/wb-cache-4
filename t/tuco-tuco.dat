5|$|The fossils from Punta Alta {{included}} a nearly perfect head and three fragments of {{heads of the}} Megatherium Cuvierii, the jaw of a related species which Owen named Mylodon Darwinii, and jaws of Megalonyx Jeffersonii. The near complete skeleton was named Scelidotherium by Owen, who found it had most of its bones nearly in their proper relative positions. At the nearby Monte Hermoso beds the numerous rodents included species allied to the Brazilian <b>tuco-tuco</b> and the capybara.|$|E
25|$|The guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the cougar, the Patagonian fox (Lycalopex griseus), the Patagonian hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus humboldtii), and the Magellanic <b>tuco-tuco</b> (Ctenomys magellanicus; a {{subterranean}} rodent) are {{the most}} characteristic mammals of the Patagonian plains. The Patagonian steppe {{is one of the}} last strongholds of the guanaco and Darwin's rheas (Rhea pennata), which had been hunted for their skins by the Tehuelches, on foot using boleadoras, before the diffusion of firearms and horses; they were formerly the chief means of subsistence for the natives, who hunted them on horseback with dogs and bolas. Vizcachas (Lagidum spp.) and the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum) are also characteristic of the steppe and the Pampas to the north.|$|E
60|$|The eyes of moles and of some {{burrowing}} rodents are rudimentary in size, and in {{some cases}} are quite covered by skin and fur. This state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the <b>tuco-tuco,</b> or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind. One which I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not necessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their size, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would aid the effects of disuse.|$|E
50|$|Talas <b>tuco-tucos</b> are herbivorous, {{feeding on}} roots and grasses. Unlike most {{subterranean}} rodents, Talas <b>tuco-tucos</b> leave their burrows to forage for vegetation above ground.|$|R

60|$|A more {{interesting}} animal is the Ctenomys magellanica, {{a little less}} than the rat in size, with a shorter tail, pale grey fur, and red incisors. It is called <b>tuco-tuco</b> from its voice, and oculto from its habits; for it is a dweller underground, and requires a loose, sandy soil in which, like the mole, it may swim beneath the surface. Consequently the pampa, with its heavy, moist mould, is not the tuco's proper place; nevertheless, wherever there is a stretch of sandy soil, or a range of dunes, there it is found living; not seen, but heard; for all day long and all night sounds its voice, resonant and loud, like a succession of blows from a hammer; as if a company of gnomes were toiling far down underfoot, beating on their anvils, first with strong measured strokes, then with lighter and faster, and with a swing and rhythm as if the little men were beating in time to some rude chant unheard above the surface. How came these isolated colonies of a species so subterranean in habits, and requiring a sandy soil to move in, so far from their proper district--that sterile country from which they are separated by wide, unsuitable areas? They cannot perform long overland journeys like the rat. Perhaps the dunes have travelled, carrying their little cattle with them.|$|E
6000|$|To {{finish with}} the mammalia, {{there are two}} {{interesting}} opossums, both of the genus Didelphys, but in habits as wide apart as cat from otter. One of these marsupials appears so much {{at home on the}} plains that I almost regret having said that the vizcacha alone gives us the idea of being in its habits the product of the pampas. This animal--Didelphys crassicaudata--has a long slender, wedge-, shaped head and body, admirably adapted for pushing through the thick grass and rushes; for it is both terrestrial and aquatic, therefore well suited to inhabit low, level plains liable to be flooded. On dry land its habits {{are similar to those of}} a weasel; in lagoons, where it dives and swims with great ease, it constructs a globular nest suspended from the rushes. The fur is soft, of a rich yellow, reddish above, and on the sides and under surfaces varying in some parts to orange, in others exhibiting beautiful copper and terra-cotta tints. These lovely tints and the metallic lustre soon fade from the fur, otherwise this animal would be much sought after in the interests of those who love to decorate themselves with the spoils of beautiful dead animals--beast and bird. The other opossum is the black and white Didelphys azarae; and it is indeed strange to find this animal on the pampas, although its presence there is not so mysterious as that of the <b>tuco-tuco.</b> It shuffles along slowly and awkwardly on the ground, but is a great traveller nevertheless. Tschudi met it mountaineering on the Andes at an enormous altitude, and, true to its lawless nature, it confronted me in Patagonia, where the books say no marsupial dwells. In every way it is adapted to an arboreal life, yet it is everywhere found on the level country, far removed from the conditions which one would imagine to be necessary to its existence. For how many thousands of years has this marsupial been a dweller on the plain, all its best faculties unexercised, its beautiful grasping hands pressed to the ground, and its prehensile tail dragged like an idle rope behind it! Yet, if one is brought to a tree, it will take to it as readily as a duck to water, or an armadillo to earth, climbing up the trunk and about the branches with a monkey-like agility. How reluctant Nature seems in some cases to undo her own work! How long she will allow a specialized organ, with the correlated instinct, to rest without use, yet ready to flash forth on the instant, bright and keen-edged, as in the ancient days of strife, ages past, before peace came to dwell on earth! ...|$|E

50|$|The Puntilla <b>tuco-tuco</b> is {{a fairly}} large species of <b>tuco-tuco.</b> The type {{specimen}} has a head-and-body length of 205 mm and a tail length of 97 mm. It is an even pale colour and is distinguished from other tuco-tucos {{living in the same}} area by the long tail, the narrow skull and the broad auditory bullae (hollow bony structures on the skull that enclose parts of the middle and inner ear). The Catamarca <b>tuco-tuco</b> (Ctenomys knighti) is a darker colour and Foch's <b>tuco-tuco</b> (Ctenomys fochi) is smaller.|$|E
50|$|The Southern <b>tuco-tuco</b> can be preyed on by owls, {{though this}} {{is more likely to}} occur in their {{sympatric}} relative, the Talas <b>tuco-tuco</b> due to its difference in size.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>tuco-tuco</b> lives sympatrically {{with the}} Talas <b>tuco-tuco</b> (C. talarum) {{in the coastal}} grassland and sand dune areas of the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina along the Atlantic coast. Its region ranges from Necochea to Bahia Blanca. Though these two species {{live in the same}} region, they are microspacially segregated based on their different preferences in soil type. The southern <b>tuco-tuco</b> prefers softer soil with poor and low primary productivity.|$|E
50|$|Biomixing {{refers to}} the kind of soil bioturbations {{typically}} caused by surface-, shallow-, and intermediate-burrowing vertebrates, such as rodents (pocket gophers, <b>tuco-tucos,</b> mole-rats), insectivores (moles), mustelids (badgers), canids (wolves, coyotes, foxes), marsupials (marsupial moles, wombats), aardvarks, armadillos, pigs, and other similar organisms. Though animal bioturbations are dominant, tree uprooting is still an important process.|$|R
50|$|They can be {{described}} as medium-sized. Stiff hairs project over the three middle digits of the rear feet. Their massive skulls narrow in the facial areas. Some molecular work, suggests that, despite their appearance, they may be more closely related to octodontoids such as degus, nutria, and <b>tuco-tucos</b> than they are to chinchillas and viscachas.|$|R
40|$|Subterranean rodents {{spend most}} of the day inside {{underground}} tunnels, where there is little daily change in environmental variables. Our observations of <b>tuco-tucos</b> (Ctenomys aff. knighti) in a field enclosure indicated that these animals perceive the aboveground light-dark cycle by several bouts of light-exposure at irregular times during the light hours of the day. To assess whether such light-dark pattern acts as an entraining agent of the circadian clock, we first constructed in laboratory the Phase Response Curve for 1 h light-pulses (1000 lux). Its shape is qualitatively similar to other curves reported in the literature and to our knowledge it is the first Phase Response Curve of a subterranean rodent. Computer simulations were performed with a non-linear limit-cycle oscillator subjected to a simple model of the light regimen experienced by <b>tuco-tucos.</b> Results showed that synchronization is achieved even by a simple regimen of a single daily light pulse scattered uniformly along the light hours of the day. Natural entrainment studies benefit from integrated laboratory, field and computational approaches...|$|R

50|$|At present 21 {{species of}} blesmols from 5 genera are accepted, but this number {{is likely to}} increase.

50|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the octodontids should be reclassified in the order Lagomorpha, but this has not been supported by further analyses (e.g. Opazo, 2005). Older literature includes the <b>tuco-tucos</b> in the family, as the subfamily Ctenomyinae, but these animals are normally now treated as a separate family, Ctenomyidae. There is some evidence that evolution within the family may have resulted from polyploidy.
