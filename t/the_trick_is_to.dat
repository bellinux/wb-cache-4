In genre fiction Iain Banks, writing as Iain M. Banks, produced ground-breaking science fiction.

500|$|In a 1990 paper, [...] "Elephants Don't Play Chess," [...] {{robotics}} researcher Rodney Brooks took direct aim at {{the physical}} symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since [...] "the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail {{there is to be}} known. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> sense it appropriately and often enough." [...] In the 80s and 90s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the embodied mind thesis.|$|E

We also had newcomers like Darryl Hickman, Barbara Eden. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> only use them once a year. People like Fay Wray came back several times, but as other characters." ...|$|R

50|$|A special {{protocol}} {{is needed}} for real-time fax over IP (Internet Protocol) since existing fax terminals only supported PSTN connections, where the information flow was generally smooth and uninterrupted, {{as opposed to the}} jittery arrival of IP packets. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> come up with a protocol that makes the IP network “invisible” to the endpoint fax terminals, which would mean the user of a legacy fax terminal need not know that the fax call was traversing an IP network.|$|R
500|$|Kahn {{also said}} that instead of taking the song's lyrics and being [...] "pretentious" [...] about it, {{he wanted to show}} the {{audience}} exactly what Brown was singing about, commenting, [...] "What if we just got ambitious and demonstrated the lyrics? <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> do it in a creative way. Let's try to display the lyrics and the feeling of the dance at the same time." [...] On October 2009, Brown released screencaps for the video, coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for [...] "Russian Roulette". The photos showed several scenes, including Brown {{in the middle of a}} squadron of black storm troopers, Brown in a gray suit, and him giving a karate kick in mid-air. Another was also of Brown, Wayne and Swizz Beatz standing confidently against a white backdrop.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{in terms}} of {{hardware}} the 6600 {{was not on the}} leading edge, Cray invested considerable effort into the design of the machine in an attempt to enable it to run as fast as possible. Unlike most high-end projects, Cray realized that there was considerably more to performance than simple processor speed, that I/O bandwidth had to be maximized as well in order to avoid [...] "starving" [...] the processor of data to crunch.

2500|$|... {{where the}} second {{summation}} {{is taken over}} all -shuffles.

[...] The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements [...] is preserved in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
50|$|It {{is likely}} that these islands were so named after the {{practise}} of sailing refitted British naval ships from the Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard to these islands and back as a trial run before heading into open seas. It has also been suggested that they were named because they constituted a trial of one's skill in navigation and seamanship. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> round them in a small sailing ship and enter the Strait of Juan de Fuca, despite the frequent rip tides and the prevailing westerlies.|$|R
25|$|While each playwright {{will take}} {{his or her}} own approach, Kenneth Cavander, the playwright who {{undertook}} and completed this task for Timon of Athens felt that <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave what <b>is</b> immediate and alive to our ears in the original untouched and only elsewhere to unpack whatever might hinder the free flow of the story {{in a way that is}} clear, not over-reverent, and above all, actable, so that the result is clear and compelling to a contemporary audience while preserving the spirit of the original.|$|R

2500|$|Now {{a note on}} the grotesque: Among {{all these}} [...] "fauves"—the name given to the Impressionists in {{conventional}} workshops—the most [...] "fauve" [...] of all is certainly Jean Metzinger, the defender of Cubism. Cubism is a style of painting inspired by puzzles or these popular guessing-game designs for children found in certain newspapers, which consist of finding, for example, a hare pursued by a hunter in the landscape accessories. That's how [...] "Cubism" [...] proceeds. Under the title of Nu , Jean Metzinger shows us [...] "cubes" [...] of various tones, but of the same color. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find the head, the arms at different points on the canvas. It's a distraction like any other, but it is not art. This is the latest cry of pictorial craziness [...]|$|E
2500|$|Increased {{spending}} on disease prevention is often suggested {{as a way}} of reducing health care spending. Whether prevention saves or costs money depends on the intervention. Childhood vaccinations, or contraceptives save much more than they cost. Research suggests that in many cases prevention does not produce significant long-term cost savings. Some interventions may be cost-effective by providing health benefits, while others are not cost-effective. [...] Preventive care is typically provided to many people who would never become ill, and for those who would have become ill is partially offset by the health care costs during additional years of life. On the other hand, research conducted by Novartis argues that the countries that have excelled in getting the highest value for healthcare spending are the ones who have invested more in prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> avoid getting patients to hospital, which is where highest healthcare dollars are being consumed. Not all preventive measures have good ROI (EG. Global vaccination campaign for a rare infectious diseases). However, preventive measures such as diet, exercises and reduction of tobacco intake would have broad impact on many diseases and will offer good return of investment.|$|E
2500|$|With work on Reservoir Dogs completed, Tarantino {{returned}} {{to the notion of}} a trilogy film: [...] "I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don't: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story." [...] Tarantino explains that the idea [...] "was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you've ever seen when it comes to crime stories— the oldest stories in the book... You know, 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife'— the oldest story about... the guy's gotta go out with the big man's wife and don't touch her. You know, you've seen the story a zillion times." [...] "I'm using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry", he says. [...] "Part of <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life's rules and see how they unravel." [...] In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: [...] "I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly [...] I wanted him to be a bully and a jerk".|$|E
2500|$|A contact while moving {{was always}} possible. However, {{offensive}} action usually took two forms: either {{an attack on}} a camp, or an ambush.

They targeted tracks and, particularly in parts of Borneo, waterways.

50|$|Burkhard {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{original}} and diverse composers of his generation; he wrote operas, oratorios, sonatas, suites, serenades, cantatas, concertos, organ music, orchestral charts, and chamber music as well. Burkhard believed that it was the composers mission to go out on a limb to create and discover new modes of expression by combining the old ones, but never following already set musical fashions. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a new unique sound that resounded as one solid stylistic sound as that reflected some of what the composer's personality entailed. He would teach his students exactly this and never steer them away from their original findings.|$|R
2500|$|Norwegian singer Sondre Lerche covered [...] "Countdown" [...] in December 2011 as a [...] "Christmas gift" [...] and his {{favorite}} {{song of the}} year. He further stated, [...] "I took the liberty of making some gender-oriented changes to the lyrics to better accommodate my macho-persona... That being said, <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get passed the novelty-factor and just sing a beautiful song {{at the best of}} your abilities. Obviously, a significant part of this song's appeal and ecstatic energy comes from the dizzying vocal performance and the mind-blowingly cool production work — elements and talents useless to even attempt replicating (especially not in my father in-law's basement). But as long as there's a song underneath, there's a way." [...] His cover of the song contains his vocals and mild acoustic guitar strumming, which according to Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine gives [...] "an approach that puts the focus on the track's stellar songwriting". According to Mallika Rao of The Huffington Post, [...] "Sondre Lerche made us a gift... and probably because he's a talented, popular, professional musician, it's really good". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the cover, saying: [...] "The end result is a simple track, without pomp or circumstance or the crazy marching band, where Lerche is able to replicate not the high-energy feel, but the song's simple message of love and dedication. Thanks to its minimalist nature, the track isn't a corny display of pop mockery, but a demonstration of how universal great music can be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{did in this}} case, as I'll show you," [...] went on Usher positively. [...] "I sat {{the man in the}} ill-fitting {{clothes in}} a {{comfortable}} chair, and simply wrote words on a blackboard; and the machine simply recorded the variations of his pulse; and I simply observed his manner. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> introduce some word connected with the supposed crime in a list of words connected with something quite different, yet a list in which it occurs quite naturally. Thus I wrote 'heron' and 'eagle' and 'owl', and when I wrote 'falcon' he was tremendously agitated; and when I began to make an 'r' {{at the end of the}} word, that machine just bounded. Who else in this republic has any reason to jump at the name of a newly-arrived Englishman like Falconroy except the man who's shot him? Isn't that better evidence than a lot of gabble from witnesses--if the evidence of a reliable machine?" ...|$|E
60|$|At these sports {{there are}} usually from four to six bulls sacrificed. The {{audience}} occupies seats around the ring in which the exhibition is given, each seat but the foremost rising higher {{than the one in}} front, so that every one can get a full view of the sport. When all is ready a bull is turned into the ring. Three or four men come in, mounted on the merest skeletons of horses blind or blind-folded and so weak that they could not make a sudden turn with their riders without danger of falling down. The men are armed with spears having a point as sharp as a needle. Other men enter the arena on foot, armed with red flags and explosives {{about the size of a}} musket cartridge. To each of these explosives is fastened a barbed needle which serves the purpose of attaching them to the bull by running the needle into the skin. Before the animal is turned loose a lot of these explosives are attached to him. The pain from the pricking of the skin by the needles is exasperating; but when the explosions of the cartridges commence the animal becomes frantic. As he makes a lunge towards one horseman, another runs a spear into him. He turns towards his last tormentor when a man on foot holds out a red flag; the bull rushes for this and is allowed to take it on his horns. The flag drops and covers the eyes of the animal so that he is at a loss what to do; it is jerked from him and the torment is renewed. When the animal is worked into an uncontrollable frenzy, the horsemen withdraw, and the matadores --literally murderers--enter, armed with knives having blades twelve or eighteen inches long, and sharp. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> dodge an attack from the animal and stab him to the heart as he passes. If these efforts fail the bull is finally lassoed, held fast and killed by driving a knife blade into the spinal column just back of the horns. He is then dragged out by horses or mules, another is let into the ring, and the same performance is renewed.|$|E
