40|$|The bachelor's thesis "The {{benefits}} and limits <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> mysticism of Dorothee Sölle" seeks to present <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> mysticism of protestant theologian Dorothee Sölle {{and to suggest}} the {{benefits and}} limits of that theological concept.

This study concentrates on political changes regarding casual political changes, for example, changes in political talks, and changes in the political procedures of the decision administration. Formal political changes, for example, <b>the</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> organized political framework, are yet to have critical effect on social developments, {{in spite of the fact}} that measures are presently being taken, for example, the abolishment of the Internal Security Act (ISA), beginning on 16 September 2011, and the foundation of an extraordinary board of trustees on appointive change.|$|E
25|$|After 1949, the ROC Army {{has participated}} in combat {{operations}} on Kinmen and the Dachen Archipelago against the PLA in the Battle of Kuningtou, and in the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. In addition to these major conflicts, ROCA commandos were regularly sent to raid the Fujian and Guangdong coasts. Until the 1970s, the stated mission of the Army was to retake the mainland from the People's Republic of China. Following the lifting of martial law in 1988 and <b>the</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> the 1990s, {{the mission of the}} ROC Army has been shifted to the defense of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu from a PLA invasion.|$|E

This changed during {{the early twentieth century}} through <b>the</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> travel. In 1895, popular publications printed articles showing the car was cheaper to operate than the horse. The development of automobiles in the early 1900s included the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908. In 1900, 8,000 cars were registered in the US, which increased to 619,000 by 1911. By the time of the Model T's introduction in 1908, there were 44 US households per car. Early cars were a luxury for the wealthy, but after Ford began to dramatically drop prices after 1913, more were able to afford one.|$|E

He resumed his nationalist activities in support of Crișana and Transylvania's union with Romania, joining the Romanian National Guard and becoming its local commander. In December, he was called upon by his university colleagues to represent them at the Alba Iulia grand national assembly, where he voted for union with Romania. The motion for union was read out by his uncle, Goldiș; Fabriciu and Sabin's brother, Camil Manuilă, were also present. In 1919, he obtained his doctorate in medicine. In 1920, he married Veturia Leucuția, a Banat native who would later become a doctor and set up an infrastructure for nursing education in Romania. She had also been a student representative at Alba Iulia.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} practical {{obstacle to}} a completely democratically elected and representative UNPA is that, {{in contrast to}} the situation in which the European Parliament functions, a significant number of UN members, including populous countries such as China are not electoral democracies. In the past, bodies such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights were criticized for being dominated by abusive regimes. If UNPA representatives were to be drawn from member nations' parliaments, it could create legitimacy concerns since some national legislatures are regarded as a rubber stamp for the rulers' decrees. Some global parliament proponents, such as Prof. Lucio Levi, propose starting a federation limited to democracies: [...] "Though <b>the</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> states all over the world hasn’t been completed, this does not preclude starting <b>the</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> the UN. Six Western European countries founded the European Community, starting its democratization without waiting for <b>the</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> the institutions of all the European states." [...] UNA-USA's Jeff Laurenti notes the problems associated with excluding undemocratic countries from membership: [...] "It is one thing to deny membership to a few small [...] "rogue" [...] dictatorships. It is quite another to exclude China, the vast majority of Arab countries, and two-thirds of Africa, and imagine that the resulting body can have a formal consultative or oversight role with United Nations agencies, be part of UN-sponsored negotiations on multilateral conventions (the real work of international legislating), or pass on the resolutions of UN political bodies." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between oil wealth and <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> {{has been widely}} investigated through the last decades. The negative effect that oil seems to have on <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> is named <b>the</b> oil curse. Even though the subject has been investigated by many researchers for several years, the effect of oil on <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> in different authoritarian regime types {{has not yet been}} studied statistically. This thesis investigates how oil rents affect <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> in three different authoritarian regime types: limited multiparty regimes, military regimes and oneparty regimes. I use a cross-sectional time-series dataset covering observations between 1960 and 2010, investigating if the oil curse is valid for all three regime types and if there are differences in the effect of oil between the regime types. The results of the analysis find support for the oil curse being present in limited multiparty regimes and one-party regimes. In military regimes, oil rents do not seem to have any negative effect on <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization...</b>|$|R

In Yan'an, the Japanese lived normal lives without guards, owned a {{cooperative}} store, and printed their own news bulletins and propaganda. [...] Visiting American officers used Nosaka's Japanese soldiers to critique {{and improve their}} own methods of anti-Japanese psychological warfare. Shortly after Japan's surrender in 1945, Nosaka began to march with approximately 200 other Japanese Communists across northern China. [...] They arrived at the coast after picking up hundreds of other Japanese along the way. Demanding immediate repatriation from the first Americans they found, they declared their intention to return and work [...] "for <b>the</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Japan {{and the establishment of}} peace in the Far East". [...] Although there are no records of the exact number of Japanese [...] "re-educated" [...] by Nosaka who elected to remain in Communist-occupied China after 1945, it is estimated that [...] "the number must have been considerable".|$|E
500|$|The New England {{response}} to the assembly was Cotton's book The Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven published in 1644. It was Cotton's attempt to persuade the assembly to adopt the Congregational way of church polity in England, endorsed by English ministers Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye. [...] In it, Cotton reveals some of his thoughts on state governance. [...] "Democracy I do not conceive that ever God did ordain as a fit government either for church or commonwealth." [...] Despite these views against democracy, congregationalism later became important in <b>the</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> the English colonies in North America. This work on church polity {{had no effect on}} the view of most Presbyterians, but it did change the stance of Presbyterian John Owen who later became a leader of the independent party at the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660.
