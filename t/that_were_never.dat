5|$|Green Wing {{had some}} plot lines <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> used. Unused storylines {{included}} Alan having an 80-year-old wife and step-grandchildren {{as old as}} him, and Guy suffering from impotence. Pile originally wanted the show to cover the entire hospital, not just doctors, but also porters, car park attendants and kitchen staff. However, she eventually decided that they had enough material with the eight main doctors and human resources workers.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, after Jackson's sudden death, La Toya Jackson {{said that}} she had {{discovered}} two hard disks at her brother's home which contain more than 1,000 songs <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> released and that are even not registered by any bodies (excluding some). It has been said that Jackson, in his lifetime, recorded more than 50,000 songs but many of the songs were not released.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} groups <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> {{thought to}} be piscivores are the anurognathids; these were instead thought to be nocturnal, aerial insectivores, a view still {{maintained}} today. With highly flexible joints on the wing finger, a broad, triangular wing shape, large eyes and short tail, these pterosaurs were analogous to some of today's insectivorous bats, being capable of high manoeuvrability at relatively low speeds.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{also suffered}} from engine problems, however, {{that were not}} so easily cured; the Ranger engine was well known for unreliability, and was particularly prone to overheating problems <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> satisfactoriarly solved.

5|$|Alien Soldier was {{released}} in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia, Europe and Japan. In North America, the game was delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service. Released late in the Mega Drive's lifecycle and {{after the release of}} the Sega Saturn, Alien Soldier pushed the system to its technical limits. Suganami wished he continued working on it after release, believing he could have improved on the story and graphics. Years later, Yosuke Okunari of Treasure addressed concerns that Alien Soldier {{was released}} as an incomplete game, stating that the notion is only derived from Suganami having originally had large ambitions <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> realized.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, Narayan, ever fond of conversation, would spend almost every evening with N. Ram, the {{publisher}} of The Hindu, drinking coffee and talking about various topics until well past midnight. Despite his fondness of meeting and talking to people, he stopped giving interviews. The apathy towards interviews {{was the result of}} an interview with Time, after which Narayan had to spend a few days in the hospital, as he was dragged around the city to take photographs <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> used in the article.|$|E

5|$|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a {{favourite}} {{architect of}} Catherine's. Like Bullant, {{he became a}} more fantastical designer with time. Nothing he built himself, however, has survived. He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day, including Saint-Maur, the Tuileries, and Chenonceau. In 1576 and 1579, he produced the two-volume Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France, a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine. His work is an invaluable record of buildings <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> finished or were later substantially altered.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> shown for domestic consumption. One of these scenes, which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, disturbing the sleeping residents.|$|E
5|$|Jason {{made his}} comic book {{debut in the}} 1993 {{adaptation}} of Jason Goes to Hell, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> shot. Jason made his first appearance outside of the direct adaptations in Satan's Six No. 4, published in 1993, which {{is a continuation of}} the events of Jason Goes to Hell. In 1995, Nancy A. Collins wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy toxic waste dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn on each other. In 1994 four young adult novels were released under the title of Friday the 13th. They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his mask.|$|E

5|$|Introducing {{more taxes}} {{proved to be}} hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, {{and the people of}} the state simply did not have that much money to give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion of a Republican official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} Liao and the Song were {{initially}} peaceful, {{with the two}} dynasties exchanging embassies in 974. Following {{the collapse of the}} Tang dynasty, several territories formed small, independent states <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> reunified during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Additionally, several additional territories that were controlled by military governors during the Tang dynasty had fallen under the control of local warlords following the Tang collapse. Rather than focus on reclaiming land from the Liao dynasty, Zhao Kuangyin, who would take the title Emperor Taizu of Song, focused on reclaiming these smaller break-off territories. He would die in 976 having reestablished control over all but one of these territories, the Northern Han kingdom. Despite the Northern Han's status as a protectorate of the Liao dynasty, Emperor Taizu of Song launched an invasion of the kingdom in 976, only months before his death. The Northern Han received assistance from the Liao, and the invasion was repelled. Emperor Taizong of Song, brother of the founding emperor and the second emperor of the Song dynasty, launched a second invasion in 979. The Northern Han again received Liao assistance, but this invasion was successful; the Northern Han crumbled, and the Song were able to assume control of the territory. Emperor Taizong of Song immediately followed this victory with an attempted invasion of the sixteen prefectures, but the unrested and undersupplied Song troops were thoroughly routed by the Liao in the Battle of Gaoliang River.|$|E
