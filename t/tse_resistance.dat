40|$|Background: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are fatal {{neurodegenerative}} {{diseases of}} several mammalian species, including humans. In Italy, the active surveillance through rapid tests on brain stem from small ruminants started in 2002 on randomly selected samples of healthy slaughtered animals. Sampling number was proportionally {{related to the}} regional small ruminant population. Of the twenty Italian regions, Sicily has the second largest population of small ruminants which is mainly constituted by crossbreed animals (> 70 %). Sicily contains also three native sheep breeds Pinzirita, Comisana and Valle del Belice. Native goat breeds are Girgentana, Messinese, Argentata dell'Etna, Maltese and Rossa Mediterranea. The polymorphisms of prion protein gene (PRNP) may influence disease susceptibility and breeding programs for genetic <b>TSE</b> <b>resistance</b> are being applied in sheep. Protective alleles have been recently reported for goats also. These differ from those in sheep and may allow breeding programs in the near future. In this paper the data of active surveillance for scrapie control in general population of small ruminants in Sicily are reported together with the analysis on the polymorphism of PRNP {{in a number of}} Sicilian autochthonous breeds. The evaluation of the frequency of protective alleles is fundamental for the implementation of a <b>TSE</b> <b>resistance</b> breeding program. Results: TSE surveillance in small ruminants in Sicily showed a of total fifty seven scrapie outbreaks from 1997 to 2014 involving mainly crossbreed animals. The PRNP polymorphism analysis in autochthonous breeds showed protective allele frequencies of 30 - 40 % ARR in sheep and 12 - 18 % K 222 in three of the four goat breeds; these breeds are distributed over limited areas of the island. Conclusion: The study on PRNP polymorphisms in Sicilian small ruminant population showed higher frequency of the protective alleles compared to most other European breeds. Our results suggest that PRNP genetic variety in Sicilian sheep and goats can be a resource for <b>TSE</b> <b>resistance</b> breeding programmes while maintaining the conservation of endangered breeds and valorisation of their typical food products. </p...|$|E
40|$|Prion Proteins (PrP) {{are among}} {{a small number}} of {{proteins}} for which large numbers of NMR ensembles have been resolved for sequence mutants and diverse species. Here, we perform a comprehensive principle components analysis (PCA) on the tertiary structures of PrP globular proteins to discern PrP subdomains that exhibit conformational change in response to point mutations and clade-specific evolutionary sequence mutation trends. This is to our knowledge the first such large-scale analysis of multiple NMR ensembles of protein structures, and the first study of its kind for PrPs. We conducted PCA on human (n =  11), mouse (n =  14), and wildtype (n =  21) sets of PrP globular structures, from which we identified five conformationally variable subdomains within PrP. PCA shows that different non-local patterns and rankings of variable subdomains arise for different pathogenic mutants. These subdomains may thus be key areas for initiating PrP conversion during disease. Furthermore, we have observed the conformational clustering of divergent TSE-non-susceptible species pairs; these non-phylogenetic clusterings indicate structural solutions towards <b>TSE</b> <b>resistance</b> that do not necessarily coincide with evolutionary divergence. We discuss the novelty of our approach and the importance of PrP subdomains in structural conversion during disease...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on genetic <b>TSE</b> <b>resistance</b> in goats in consideration of a pilot project study carried out in Cyprus. In particular, the BIOHAZ Panel was requested to assess the scientific validity {{of the study and}} to indicate to what extent and based on this study genetic breeding {{can be used as a}} control program for Classical scrapie in goats in Cyprus. The review of the limited studies carried out so far indicate that PRNP polymorphisms can modulate scrapie susceptibility in goats. Some polymorphisms could be associated with a lower susceptibility to TSE and are possible candidates for future breeding programmes. It has to be clarified whether the association of PRNP polymorphisms with apparent resistance to scrapie in goat is limited to those scrapie agents involved in the outbreaks studied and if this apparent resistance can be extended to other combinations of TSE agents/goat breeds. The report of the Cypriot pilot study presents a case control study in Cypriot goat herds aiming at the identification of the effect of PRNP polymorphisms on TSE susceptibility. According to the author, the results obtained would indicate a higher resistance agains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Scrapie and BSE {{belong to}} a group of fatal, transmissible, {{neurodegenerative}} diseases called TSE. In order to minimize the risk of natural scrapie and presumed natural BSE in sheep, breeding programmes towards <b>TSE</b> <b>resistance</b> are conducted in many countries based on resistance rendering PRNP polymorphisms at codons 136 (A/V), 154 (R/H) and 171 (R/H/Q). Therefore, a reliable, fast and cost-effective method for routine PRNP genotyping in sheep, applicable in standard equipped molecular genetic laboratories, will be a vital instrument to fulfill the need of genotyping hundreds or thousands of sheep. Methods A dual fluorescent multiprobe assay consisting of 2 closed tube PCR reactions containing respectively 4 and 3 dual-labelled fluorescent ASO probes for the detection in real-time of the 7 allelic variants of sheep PRNP mentioned above. Results The assay is succesfully performed using unpurified DNA as a template for PCR, without any post-PCR manipulations and with semi-automatic determination of the PRNP genotypes. The performance of the assay was confirmed via PCR-RFLP and sequencing in a cross-validation study with 50 sheep. Conclusions We report the development and validation of a robust, reliable and reproducible method for PRNP genotyping of a few to many sheep samples in a fast, simple and cost-effective way, applicable in standard equipped molecular genetic laboratories. The described primer/probe design strategy can also be applied for the detection of other polymorphisms or disease causing mutations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{progression}} of scrapie {{is known to}} be influenced by the amino acid polymorphisms of the host prion protein (PrP) gene. There is no breeding programme for <b>TSE</b> <b>resistance</b> in sheep in Finland, but a scrapie control programme has been in place since 1995. In this study we have analysed PrP genotypes of total of 928 purebred and crossbred sheep together with the data of scrapie survey carried out in Finland during 2002 – 2008 in order to gain knowledge of the genotype distribution and scrapie prevalence in Finnish sheep. Results The ARQ/ARQ genotype was the most common genotype in all breeds studied. ARR allele frequency was less than 12 % in purebred Finnish sheep and in most genotypes heterozygous for ARR, the second allele was ARQ. The VRQ allele was not detected in the Grey race sheep of Kainuu or in the Aland sheep, and it was present in less than 6 % of the Finnish Landrace sheep. Leucine was the most prominent amino acid found in codon 141. In addition, one novel prion dimorphisms of Q 220 L was detected. During the scrapie survey of over 15 000 sheep in 2002 – 2008, no classical scrapie cases and only five atypical scrapie cases were detected. Conclusions The results indicate that the Finnish sheep populations have genetically little resistance to classical scrapie, but no classical scrapie was detected during an extensive survey in 2002 – 2008. However, five atypical scrapie cases emerged; thus, the disease is present in the Finnish sheep population at a low level. </p...|$|E

Assessing {{the impact}} on prion protein (PrP) genotype frequencies. Preventie Veterinary Medicine, 73, (1), 1 - 16. Sponsorship: DEFRAFrom April 2005, member states of the European Union were required to implement a compulsory breeding programme for resistance to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in sheep as part of measures to eradicate TSEs from national flocks. In this paper, we assessed the impact of four different breeding strategies on prion protein (PrP) genotype frequencies using a mathematical model which describes in detail gene flow in the British sheep flock. These strategies ranged from the minimum requirements laid down in by EU legislation to compulsory implementation of the current National Scrapie Plan for Great Britain (NSP) ram genotyping scheme. All four strategies were predicted to substantially reduce {{the frequency of the}} VRQ allele, which is associated with the highest risk of scrapie, although schemes with more stringent requirements produced a larger reduction. However, there were marked differences in the impact of the strategies on the frequency of other PrP alleles. In particular, restrictions beyond those required by EU legislation were necessary to change the frequency of other PrP alleles substantially. Consequently, a breeding programme which aims to reduce the risk to human health by reducing the frequency of the ARQ allele (associated with the highest risk of BSE in sheep) must place restrictions on ARQ-bearing animals. Similarly, a programme which seeks to increase the frequency of the ARR allele (associated with the lowest risk of TSE) must favour ARR-bearing animals. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Glycosylation is {{the most}} {{abundant}} post-translational modification of proteins and {{has the ability to}} change the physical properties of the protein and its cell biology. The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a membrane bound host glycoprotein present in a number of isoforms in vivo due to variable occupancy of the two N-linked glycosylation sites. The function of PrPC is still unclear but it is essential for disease in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The significance of the PrP glycoforms in the physiological function is unknown. Gene targeted mice have been created with point mutations that selectively abolish the glycosylation sites of PrPC. These GlycoD mutants have been used to study the effect of glycosylation at the different sites on the cell biology of PrPC. This study showed that both glycosylation sites {{played a role in the}} cell biology of PrPC. Removal of a single or both glycosylation sites significantly reduced total PrPC protein. The relative amount of the truncated protein produced through proteolytic cleaving was slightly reduced in the GlycoD mutants; however the proportion of truncated to full length PrP was increased, further reducing full length protein. The maintenance of truncated protein levels indicates a potential importance of the fragment in PrPC function. Wild type PrP is predominantly diglycosylated and localised to the cell surface. In this study it was shown that all GlycoD mutants had reduced amounts of cell surface PrPC and an increased proportion of PrPC associated with the secretory pathway. Removal of either the first or the second glycosylation site produced changes in cell biology that were almost indistinguishable from each other whilst disruption of both glycosylation sites produces a more extreme phenotype than removal of a single site. Previous studies have shown an altered susceptibility for TSE disease GlycoD mice. An in vitro conversion assay was used to investigate the ability of the glycoforms to initiate conversion from PrPC to the disease associated PrPSc. Mice which had only the second site abolished were much more efficient at seeding conversion than all other glycoforms. This may reflect the difference in susceptibility between the two monoglycosylated PrPs but does not explain the increased resistance compared to wild type mice. All other GlycoD mutants had similar seeding times to wild type mice despite having increased <b>TSE</b> <b>resistance.</b> The differences observed in the cell biology of PrPC of the GlycoD mutants may go some way to explaining the differences in TSE susceptibilities seen with these mice...|$|E
