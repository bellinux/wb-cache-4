5|$|<b>The</b> <b>evacuation</b> {{proceeded}} without {{interference from}} the PAVN. Aircraft flying air cover for <b>the</b> <b>evacuation</b> reported being tracked with {{surface to air}} radar {{in the vicinity of}} Bien Hoa Air Base (which had fallen to the PAVN on 25 April), but there were no missile launches. The Hanoi leadership, reckoning that completion of <b>the</b> <b>evacuation</b> would lessen the risk of American intervention, had apparently instructed General Dũng not to target the airlift itself. Members of the police in Saigon had been promised evacuation in exchange for protecting the American evacuation buses and control of the crowds in the city during <b>the</b> <b>evacuation.</b> Disgruntled ARVN troops repeatedly hit American helicopters with small arms fire throughout <b>the</b> <b>evacuation,</b> without causing serious damage. Despite receiving sporadic NVA AAA fire, USAF and USN aircraft made no attacks on AAA or SAM sites during <b>the</b> <b>evacuation.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>evacuation,</b> {{which had}} been delayed for months, was {{initiated}} due to fear of the Red Army advances during the East Prussian Offensive. Some parts of <b>the</b> <b>evacuation</b> were planned as a military necessity, Operation Hannibal being the most important military operation involved in <b>the</b> <b>evacuation.</b> However, many refugees took to the roads on their own initiative because of reported Soviet atrocities against Germans in the areas under Soviet control. Both spurious and factual accounts of Soviet atrocities were disseminated through the official news and propaganda outlets of Nazi Germany and by rumors that swept through the military and civilian populations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} {{an elevator}} evacuation model for ultra-tall building which is implemented by AnyLogic package. Pedestrian {{movement and the}} elevator running can be well combined into <b>the</b> elevator <b>evacuation</b> model. Theoretical analysis is conducted to explore the influencing factors of <b>the</b> elevator <b>evacuation</b> and how <b>the</b> elevator <b>evacuation</b> time is determined by these influencing factors, including the number of occupants evacuating by one elevator, the height of refuge floor, the elevator speed and acceleration speed, the elevator capacity and elevator door width etc. Simulation experiments are conducted to analyze <b>the</b> elevator <b>evacuation</b> time of ultra-tall building. By theoretical and simulation analysis and <b>the</b> elevator <b>evacuation</b> time 说 can be expressed as functions with several variables...|$|R
5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but <b>the</b> <b>evacuation</b> was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the {{analysis}} about <b>the</b> traditional <b>evacuation</b> and lifesaving facilities, this paper adopts high-tech technological means (e. g. advanced intelligent information-monitoring technique, artificial intelligent technique, computer technology, etc.), integrates the function of building evacuation, and establishes an intelligent evacuation system. This system overcomes the disadvantages and defects of <b>the</b> current intelligent <b>evacuation</b> system, and realizes the intelligent dynamic guidance of <b>the</b> personnel <b>evacuation</b> under <b>the</b> real fire scene through the main control module of <b>the</b> intelligent <b>evacuation</b> system. It aims to actually realize the intellectualization according to the dynamic change of the fire scene, and make <b>the</b> personnel <b>evacuation</b> more scientific, rapid and safer...|$|R

5|$|South of {{the river}} Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, {{commander}} of XXX Corps and Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning of I Airborne Corps, decided not to reinforce the position north of the Rhine. Instead they ordered the Corps staff to prepare a plan to withdraw the division (Operation Berlin). <b>The</b> <b>evacuation</b> of the surviving 2,500men {{able to make the}} crossing was to begin at 20:45. <b>The</b> <b>evacuation</b> would be from north to south, and was modelled on <b>the</b> <b>evacuation</b> from Gallipoli in the First World War. During the day's fighting, some units had become isolated and never received the order to evacuate. Those capable of taking part were formed into groups of fourteen (the maximum capacity of the boats) and guided to the river by men from the Glider Pilot Regiment who during the day had reconnoitred and marked out two routes to the river. Under cover of an artillery barrage <b>the</b> <b>evacuation</b> started at 22:00. German infiltration of the perimeter caused problems during the withdrawal and some groups got into fire fights or were captured. When they reached the river, priority was given to the wounded and regardless of rank the soldiers waited in line for their turn to get into the boats.|$|E
