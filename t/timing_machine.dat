50|$|Positional {{adjustments}} {{are attained}} by careful poising (ensuring even weight distribution) of the balance-hairspring {{system as well}} as careful control of the shape and polish on the balance pivots. All of this achieves an equalization {{of the effect of}} gravity on the watch in various positions. Positional adjustments are achieved through careful adjustment of each of these factors, provided by repeated trials on a <b>timing</b> <b>machine.</b> Thus, adjusting a watch to position requires many hours of labor, increasing the cost of the watch. Medium grade watches were commonly adjusted to 3 positions (dial up, dial down, pendant up) while high grade watches were commonly adjusted to 5 positions (dial up, dial down, stem up, stem left, stem right) or even all 6 positions. Railroad watches were required, after 1908, to be adjusted to 5 positions. 3 positions were the general requirement before that time.|$|E
5000|$|To keep time accurately, {{pendulum}} clocks must {{be absolutely}} level. If they are not, the pendulum swings more {{to one side}} than the other, upsetting the symmetrical operation of the escapement. This condition can often be heard audibly in the ticking sound of the clock. The ticks or [...] "beats" [...] should be at precisely equally spaced intervals to give a sound of, [...] "tick...tock...tick...tock"; if they are not, and have the sound [...] "tick-tock...tick-tock..." [...] the clock is out of beat {{and needs to be}} leveled. This problem can easily cause the clock to stop working, {{and is one of the}} most common reasons for service calls. A spirit level or watch <b>timing</b> <b>machine</b> can achieve a higher accuracy than relying on the sound of the beat; precision regulators often have a built in spirit level for the task. Older freestanding clocks often have feet with adjustable screws to level them, more recent ones have a leveling adjustment in the movement. Some modern pendulum clocks have 'auto-beat' or 'self-regulating beat adjustment' devices, and don't need this adjustment.|$|E

50|$|The biggest {{obstacle}} for a watchmaker regulating a watch, even today, {{is getting a}} similar result from the escapement no matter the position it is kept in. This has been made infinitely easier with accurate <b>timing</b> <b>machines</b> which give instantaneous timing results, whereas in Breguet's time all that watchmakers had was another watch to regulate from. So, results were not very exact and it could take weeks to get them. Effects of gravity on an escapement can have quite significant effects with slight variations of position. Even if a pocket watch was kept {{most of the time}} in a breast pocket, the exact position could still vary over 45°. Watchmakers can regulate a watch in up to 8 positions: dial up, crown down, dial down, crown left, crown up, crown right, half-way position crown up, and half-way position crown down. A tourbillon quite neatly reduces this problem; it only needs to be regulated for 3 positions; the two horizontal positions, dial up & down, and one vertical position.|$|R

The appeal jury, headed by Jan de Vries, also the President of FINA in 1960, rejected the appeal, keeping Devitt the winner. This controversy would pave the way for electronic touchpads to be included in swimming events to determine finish and accurate timing.|$|E

Pulsar timing has turned millisecond pulsars into powerful tools {{for the study}} of neutron star physics, time-keeping, astrometry, the interstellar medium and binary systems. It uses millisecond pulsars as probes of the gravitational fields of their companions, of globular clusters and of the Galaxy, and provides information on the dynamics of the solar system. It has also confirmed predictions of general relativity, for which Joe Taylor and Russell Hulse received the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. Vasts amounts of information are expected as the current searches continue to discover new millisecond pulsars. This thesis describes the design and construction of the Caltech Fast Pulsar <b>Timing</b> <b>Machine</b> and some preliminary results at the Parkes Observatory. The FPTM is a wide band <b>timing</b> <b>machine</b> built around a digital correlator for long-term timing stability and has a large observing bandwidth to time millisecond pulsars at high radio frequencies, where propagation effects are minimized. It is the combination of the 128 MHz bandwidth. the 512 lag digital correlator and the 1024 period phase bins with a minimum size of 2. 7 [ [...] . ] that gives the FPTM its power. The large bandwidth makes new observations of faint pulsars possible above 1 GHz, where current receivers easily provide radio signals with more than 100 MHz of bandwidth. The large number of channels reduces the dispersion smearing of distant millisecond pulsars, which often defines the timing floor in timing systems, and the 1024 phase bins of 2. 7 [ [...] . ] or more ensure that the pulsar profile is adequately sampled. The FPTM is currently at Parkes Observatory, in Australia, where we are undertaking a long-term precision timing program for millisecond pulsars. We frequently observe the bright binary millisecond pulsar J 0437 - 4715 with sub-microsecond times-of-arrival, and have already found interesting features in the pulse profile that could not be resolved with previous timing systems. Nevertheless, we still find drifts in the timing residuals of as much as a few [ [...] . ] over several hours which we do not yet understand (even though they are also seen by the other timing system at Parkes!). We are confident that we will solve these residuals and consistently time PSR J 0437 - 4715 at the level of 100 ns or better.

40|$|AbstractCircadian rhythms with {{a period}} of ∼ 24 h, are natural <b>timing</b> <b>machines.</b> They are broadly {{distributed}} in living organisms, such as Neurospora, Drosophila, and mammals. The underlying natures of the rhythmic behavior have been explored by experimental and theoretical approaches. However, the global and physical natures of the oscillation under fluctuations are still not very clear. We developed a landscape and flux framework to explore the global stability and robustness of a circadian oscillation system. The potential landscape of the network is uncovered and has a global Mexican-hat shape. The height of the Mexican-hat provides a quantitative measure to evaluate the robustness and coherence of the oscillation. We found that in nonequilibrium dynamic systems, not only the potential landscape but also the probability flux {{are important to the}} dynamics of the system under intrinsic noise. Landscape attracts the systems down to the oscillation ring while flux drives the coherent oscillation on the ring. We also investigated the phase coherence and the entropy production rate of the system at different fluctuations and found that dissipations are less and the coherence is higher for larger number of molecules. We also found that the power spectrum of autocorrelation functions show resonance peak at the frequency of coherent oscillations. The peak is less prominent for smaller number of molecules and less barrier height and therefore can be used as another measure of stability of oscillations. As a consequence of nonzero probability flux, we show that the three-point correlations from the time traces show irreversibility, providing a possible way to explore the flux from the observations. Furthermore, we explored the escape time from the oscillation ring to outside at different molecular number. We found that when barrier height is higher, escape time is longer and phase coherence of oscillation is higher. Finally, we performed the global sensitivity analysis of the underlying parameters to find the key network wirings responsible for the stability of the oscillation system...|$|R

The science of precision millisecond pulsar timing can yield the most precise astrometric measurements ever made. This potential {{can only be}} realized through {{an extraordinary amount of}} investment in the experimental apparatus, the effort of many observers, and the close attention to details required to avoid the many pitfalls along the way. This thesis describes the work and results from a precision timing project aimed at monitoring the brightest millisecond pulsar, PSR J 0437 - 4715. This pulsar is a very suitable target for such a study because of its small period (5. 75 ms), low DM (2. 69 pc cm[ [...] . ]), and high flux density (~ 90 mJy at 1. 4 GHz). The initial work for this thesis involved completion and installation of the Fast Pulsar <b>Timing</b> <b>Machine</b> (FPTM) at Parkes observatory, Australia. With a bandwidth of 128 MHz and time resolution of 4 [ [...] . ], this machine made a quantum jump in the time of arrival precision for PSR J 0437 - 4715. The precision improved from ~ 2 [ [...] . ] to ~ 0. 2 [ [...] . ]. In order to further enhance the signal-to-noise ratio achievable with this pulsar and probe the limits of precision pulsar timing, we have subsequently improved the FPTM significantly by doubling its bandwidth, so that it can record the pulsar radio emission over a 256 MHz bandwidth. This required us to double the IF processing hardware in the FPTM and implement numerous software modifications to control the observing apparatus, interface the FPTM with the observatory control computers, as well as process the data to produce final times of arrival. Integration of just a few minutes with the 64 m Parkes radio telescope yield times of arrival for PSR J 0437 - 4715 with a precision of 100 nanoseconds. The longer term residuals (3 years) show root-mean-square deviations of 500 nanoseconds. This excessively large scatter in the residuals has been traced to inaccurate polarization calibration, and a systematic quadratic trend of ~ 5 [ [...] . ] in the times of arrival as a function of baseband frequency. The latter phenomenon has been simulated in software and shown to arise from the large dynamic range in the baseband spectrum. Despite the systematic errors, our measurement of the pulsar's astrometric and binary parameters match the best obtained so far with other millisecond pulsars. This has allowed us to measure the pulsar's parallax, and the secular change in the binary's projected semi-major axis due to the system's proper motion. The latter effect restricts the inclination angle of the binary, [ [...] . ] < 43 [ [...] . ]. The parallax, along with the period derivative and orbital period derivative, enable us to constrain the distance of the pulsar, 162 < d < 205 pc. A stability analysis of the pulsar's time of arrival residuals demonstrates that it matches the long term stability of the best studied millisecond pulsars, PSRs B 1937 + 21 and B 1855 + 09, at least on the time scale of the data available so far, 3 years. The precision in the pulsar position now matches the amplitude of the modulation of position expected from the pulsar's binary motion. Detection of this effect will require reduction of the calibration and spectral shape errors, as well as further refinements in the timing software used. Along with radio interferornetric observations of the pulsar and optical detection of the white-dwarf companion, the pulsar timing position will provide the best contraints for frame tie between the ecliptic and extragalactic reference frames...|$|E

A bare PC SIP server provides immunity against OS vulnerabilities and yields performance gains due to the elimination of OS overhead. We discuss server design focusing on its novel architectural features and illustrate key implementation aspects by examining relevant task and method invocations for SIP request processing. We also study bare PC SIP server performance by comparing its latency and throughput against two conventional OS-based SIP servers running on equivalent hardware: OpenSER on Linux and Brekeke on Windows. Furthermore, we measure internal bare PC SIP server performance by providing internal timings for the most significant operations associated with registration and proxy services. Additionally, we study performance under increasing server load by obtaining the execution time spent in the bare PC SIP handler method and the total processing time including network protocol processing overhead when processing SIP requests and responses. The results show that the bare PC server performs better than the OS-based servers in most cases and that its internal processing times are small as would be expected due to the elimination of OS overhead. The design and implementation details of the bare PC SIP server presented here give insight into understanding SIP server performance on a bare machine.

Second, according to the randomness of application environment that set up shared cache adaptive configuration and management mechanism in the finite state <b>machine</b> <b>timing</b> sequence model of each kind of software, to ensure the system reliability. In order to support multi-tasking and multi-user operator system - Linux, the multi-processor must use shared memory technology, so this paper also introduced the memory management unit, and base on these, it focuses on how multi-processor and the AHB bus cooperate to ensure cache coherence of the whole system. We can use software execution model and hardware design to achieve instruction or data coherence between each cache and main memory. ? 2014 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mechanism called time-deterministic replay (TDR) that can reproduce {{the execution of}} a program, including its precise timing. Without TDR, reproducing the timing of an execution is difficult {{because there are many}} sources of timing variability – such as preemptions, hardware interrupts, cache effects, scheduling decisions, etc. TDR uses a combination of techniques to either mitigate or eliminate most of these sources of variability. Using a prototype implementation of TDR in a Java Virtual Machine, we show {{that it is possible to}} reproduce the timing to within 1. 85 % of the original execution, even on commodity hardware. The paper discusses several potential applications of TDR, and studies one of them in detail: the detection of a covert timing channel. Timing channels can be used to exfiltrate information from a compromised machine; they work by subtly varying the <b>timing</b> of the <b>machine’s</b> outputs, and it is this variation that can be detected with TDR. Unlike prior solutions, which generally look for a specific type of timing channel, our approach can detect a wide variety of channels with high accuracy. ...|$|R
