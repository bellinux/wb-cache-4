5|$|Deodato said he {{conceived}} {{of the film}} while <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son about {{news coverage of the}} terrorism of the Red Brigades. Deodato thought that the media focused on portraying violence with little regard for journalistic integrity and believed that the media staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensational footage. He reflected this behavior in the film team in Cannibal Holocaust, whom he said symbolized the Italian media.|$|E

5|$|Show {{producers}} {{removed a}} sketch {{which would include}} a rape joke upon Carter's discovery of his daughter, Lois, with her secret family on the southern plantation. Unlike past requests to cut and/or alter jokes, this was not one imposed by the broadcast standards and practices; this was done on the writers' own accord. The sequence showing Peter's silent film star ancestor being stabbed in a card fight was omitted from television broadcasting to save time. Near {{the end of the}} episode, the Griffins are shown arguing over the quality of The Godfather; this scene is drawn from an actual argument that has taken place in the Family Guy writing room over its quality. MacFarlane prefers The 'Burbs and The Money Pit, both of which were received very poorly. Adolf Hitler <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife about his annoyance at Peter Hitler was also removed from television broadcasting for timing purposes.|$|E

25|$|According to Geoff Hurst's autobiography, England full back George Cohen overheard Ramsey <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{coaching}} staff {{about the possibility}} of dropping Moore for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened Norman Hunter in his place. However, eventually they settled on keeping the captain in the team. Moore had not been playing badly, nor had he given the impression that he had been distracted by his contract dispute prior to the competition. The only possible explanations were that the Germans had some rather fast attacking players, which could expose Moore's own lack of pace, and that Hunter– who was of a similar age to Moore but only had four caps– was the club partner of Moore's co-defender with England, Jack Charlton.|$|E
