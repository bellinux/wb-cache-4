Successful reports have been published, but then dismissed as the conductivity was rendered p-type instead of n-type and associated not with sulfur, but with residual boron, which is a highly efficient p-type dopant in diamond.|$|E

40|$|This article compares East Germany's Cold War-era {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>doping</b> <b>to</b> {{that of the}} USA's {{in terms}} of their respective impacts on medical risk. Although deserving of criticism on many levels, the GDR doping programme featured a number of safeguards designed to minimise medical dangers. Unlike their East German counterparts, American governmental units were not directly involved in the administration of performance-enhancing substances. The US approach <b>to</b> <b>doping</b> was not ideal in terms of medical risk, however. As a result of the country's regulatory approach <b>to</b> <b>doping,</b> the country's athletes frequently turned to black market sources for doping agents. It was also relatively common for American athletes to use performance-enhancing drugs without the benefit of medical supervision. The US approach <b>to</b> <b>doping</b> was in these ways inferior to that of East Germany's on the subject of medical risk...|$|R

He described he had started <b>to</b> <b>dope</b> only with corticosteroids in the 80s, and then as he previously had confessed upgraded his doping with EPO in 1993–98. Riis states the last time he doped as a rider was in July 1998. [...] He states he quit during the 1998 Tour de France when he was nearly caught by the police. As part of the probe into the Festina doping scandal, police were on their way to search the rooms of his Telekom teammates. Riis offered the following comment on the episode: “In my room I didn’t have a choice. My vials of doping products had to disappear quickly. In just a few minutes I gathered all my doses of EPO and threw them down the toilet”.|$|E
