40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 76) The {{purpose of}} this study is to introduce the design concept of <b>tapered</b> <b>structural</b> members. At present, there exists a variety of books and papers about this subject which go into depth however there are not many books available regarding applications of the concept into design of these members as a whole. This paper will serve as a summary discussion of the subject and application of the concept into design of a real structure. The project consists of two parts. The first part of the project deals with theoretical aspects of the subject and its relations to the AISC Specifications. The second part is a complete design example of the applications of the subject in real life structure. For this purpose; it was decided to design a 747 Jumbojet airplane hanger. Due to the large dimensions of the airplane, a common steel frame building is not a good and economical choice. Large wing spans of the airplane will dictate long beam spans and not allow interior bracing members. In other words there will not be any resistance against wind or seismic effects, therefore rigid frame tapered girders are the most appropriate solutions...|$|R

5000|$|The form, {{volume and}} {{structure}} of the towers is generated by two ellipses, one at foundation level and the other at a horizontal plane at 450 m. These two ellipses are rotated relative to another. The tightening caused by the rotation between the two ellipses forms a [...] "waist" [...] and a densification of material halfway up the tower. This means that the lattice structure, which {{at the bottom of the}} tower is porous and spacious, becomes denser at waist level. The waist itself becomes tight, like a twisted rope; transparency is reduced and views to the outside are limited. Further up the tower the lattice opens again, accentuated here by the <b>tapering</b> of the <b>structural</b> column-tubes.|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{effect of}} pre-deformational, along-strike sedimentary <b>tapers</b> on the <b>structural</b> architecture of thrust wedges accreted above viscous materials has been commonly underestimated or neglected. We illustrate {{results of an}} experimental programme specifically designed to study {{the impact of this}} parameter on thrust wedge evolution using sandbox analogue modelling. Two series of experiments were performed: the first series was designed to investigate the sensitivity of wedge growth to the along-strike sedimentary taper variability; the second was designed to investigate the sensitivity of a growing along-strike tapered wedge to the convergence rate. Our experimental results indicate that even gentle pre-deformational along-strike thickness variations in foredeep clastic sequences overlying viscous materials, such as evaporites or overpressured shales, can produce dramatic changes in the first-order structural architecture and kinematic evolution of accreting thrust wedges...|$|R

Growth stratigraphy of piggy-back basins and thrusting of progressively younger horizons trace the eastward advance of the leading thrust front over ∼ 60 km in the last 2 Myr. Moderate internal shortening of fault-bounded blocks typically 4 – 8 km wide reflects rapid creation of thrust faults, with some early formed faults undergoing out-of-sequence reactivation to maintain critical wedge <b>taper.</b> Multistage <b>structural</b> restorations show that forward progression of shortening involves: (1) initial development of a ∼ 10 – 25 km wide “proto-thrust” zone, comprising conjugate sets of moderately to steeply dipping low-displacement (∼ 10 – 100 m) reverse faults; and (2) growth of thrust faults that exploit {{some of the early}} proto-thrust faults and propagate up-section with progressive break-through of folds localized above the fault tips.

Progressive retro-deformations show that macroscopic thrust faults and folds account for less than 50 % of the margin-perpendicular shortening imposed by plate convergence.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{aircraft}} structures requires {{the use of}} advanced structural models able to provide accurate results also when complex configurations are considered. Wing boxes are a well­known example of these structures, they have a thin skin, transversal and longitudinal reinforcements and in the most of the cases they are tapered, the cross­section is therefore not constant. The solution of the structural problems becomes even more complex when advanced materials, e. g. composite materials, are considered. For these reasons the finite element method, FEM, is widely used the structural analysis. In particular three­dimensional, 3 D, elements appear to be very accurate in the evaluation of displacements, stresses and strains fields of complex structures. Despite these advantages, the 3 D models require a huge computational cost, the development of reduced structural models able to provide reliable results is, therefore, mandatory. One­ and two­dimensional elements can be used to simplify the computational model but they are limited by their kinematic approximations that restrict the use of these model only in those case in which the fundamental assumptions are respected. The introduction of refined kinematic approximations could extend the range of applicability of the classical structural models, in this case accurate results can also be achieved when one­ and two­dimensional elements are used. The present work proposes the use of advanced one­dimensional FE models based on the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF) for the analysis of tapered structures. These models introduce a cross­sectional expansion able to describe complex displacement fields. The kinematic approximation can be refined in according to the accuracy required in the analysis. In this particular case, the Lagrange functions are used in the expansions. The use of refined kinematic permits to describe with high­fidelity the geometry of the model, in fact, the solution is not referred to the nodes on the beam axis but is evaluated in the nodes placed on the cross­section. These models, in contrast with the classical beam elements, only have displacements as degrees of freedom, these elements ca be arbitrary oriented in the space and easily connected each other. These features of these model make them suitable for the analysis of complex structure as the thin­walled <b>tapered</b> beams. Each <b>structural</b> component can be modeled with an independent beam element and then joined by imposing the displacement compatibility at the shared nodes. This work focuses on the studies of reinforced thin­walled structure. Initially, simple cases of reinforced rectangular thin­walled structure are considered. Afterwards, a tapered panel is introduced. Static analyses are performed to verify the accuracy of the shear stress results inside the panel. The dynamic behavior was also analyzed. The work continues with an analysis of a single­bay and multi­bay tapered wing­box. Both static and dynamic analyses are performed. Isotropic aluminum alloy is used for the cases presented, but the work also explores, in some cases, the use of composite materials because their use is increasingly important in the aerospace field. The results have been compared with those from commercial FEM codes. Classical solid model and a beam­shell model are used as comparison. The research demonstrates that the advanced FE model used can provide accurate analyses and 3 D­like results. Tapered reinforced thin­walled structures can, therefore, be easily studied considering an high­fidelity geometrical descriptio...|$|R
