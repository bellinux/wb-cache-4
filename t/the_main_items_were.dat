Many 'common' Tequesta relics were found at the site — tools and perhaps decorative items made from shells and other aquatic materials like sharks' teeth — {{but there were a}} few pieces discovered that did not fit. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> two basalt axe heads.

Further analysis of the stone by Dr. Jacqueline Dixon, University of Miami, found that the basalt was likely from the region of Macon, Georgia, some 600 mi away. Additional items that may have been placed in, or buried under the structure were a complete 5 ft long shark skeleton, aligned east to west, a dolphin skull, and a complete carapace of a sea-turtle. Four human teeth were also found, though no other evidence pointed to its being a burial site.|$|E

Here we report on {{an analysis of the}} diet of Pachyurus bonariensis Steindachner, 1879, a freshwater sciaenid. Fish were collected bimonthly from December 1999 to January 2002 at three locations along the Ibicuí River in the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil.

Annelida, plant matter, Decapoda, Diptera (pupae), Coleoptera and Mollusca were present in small amounts. The fish consumed smaller amounts of food in winter than in other seasons. The most important source of dietary variation for P. bonariensis was the ontogenetic, related to intrinsic biological characters. However, spatial variation was also found, suggesting that this species can adapt its diet to environmental changes.

Stomach contents were analyzed by frequency of occurrence (O%), percent number (N%), percent mass (M%), and feeding index (FI% = O% * M%). Rough scad fed on mollusks (Gastropoda, Crepidula sp.), crustacean (Ostracoda, Copepoda, decapod larvae), chaetognat and teleostean fish. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> calanoid copepods (Eucalanus sp. and Centropages sp.). According {{to the analysis of}} the stomach fullness and prey digestion, T. lathami is both a diurnal and nocturnal feeder, showing some seasonal variation in feeding time.

A ecologia alimentar de uma espécie é muito importante para o entendimento do funcionamento das comunidades de água doce. Neste trabalho analisamos a dieta de Pachyurus bonariensis, um sciaenídeo restrito a ambientes dulceaquícolas. Os peixes foram coletados bimestralmente de dezembro de 1999 a janeiro de 2002 em três locais do rio Ibicuí no Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. Em cada local os espécimes foram coletados em ambiente lótico e lêntico. Estômagos de 324 indivíduos foram analisados quanto ao seu conteúdo e grau de repleção. Os principais itens foram Ephemeroptera, Diptera (larva), Trichoptera e Odonata. Os itens Anellida, matéria vegetal, Decapoda, Diptera (pupas), Coleoptera e Mollusca estiveram presentes em menor quantidade. No inverno os peixes consumiram menor quantidade de alimento, quando comparado com as demais estações. A principal fonte de variação na dieta desse sciaenídeo foi proveniente de mudanças ontogenéticas, relacionadas a fatores biológicos intrínsecos. Entretanto também foi observada variação espacial na dieta de P. bonariensis, sugerindo que essa espécie pode adaptar sua dieta a mudanças ambientais. Apesar de P. bonariensis apresentar mudanças ontogenéticas e espaciais na sua dieta, os principais itens foram sempre insetos, caracterizando essa espécie como um peixe com hábitos insetívoros no rio Ibicuí...|$|E

This study aimed to identify the disclosure of environmental items in Metal Mining companies registered in at BM & FBOVESPA. The research is relevant in the Metal sector, because it represents companies with highly polluting activities, which use non-renewable natural resources. This was a qualitative, descriptive and documentary research, in which we used the content analysis technique of environmental items in Notes in the Reports of Directors and four mining companies sustainability reports from 2009 to 2013. Through a ranking, we analyzed the degree of clarity in the disclosure of environmental companies, which ranked first in the Vale SA, then Manabi SA a second, MMX Metálicos SA mining in the third place and, lastly, Litel Participações SA.
