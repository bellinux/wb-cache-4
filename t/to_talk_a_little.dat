60|$|After that, Aunt Olive {{allowed the}} two boys <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> {{and a few days}} later Mr. Stubbs's brother was brought in to pay his respects to the invalid.|$|E
60|$|So he {{goes with}} {{her through the}} field, {{stopping}} on the way <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to the cow, and to feed her with an apple which he has in his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... “Please don’t {{discourage}} her, Lady Canterville,” Jackson firmly said; “and give me <b>a</b> chance <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more myself. You haven’t {{given me}} much chance, you know.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was not to}} honour you I did it; I've {{called on}} you before and I know you don't like it. It was <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "General Noseworthy is just {{returned}} from India, Colonel Mayson," [...] Korust said, in his usual quiet, tired tone. [...] "You will, perhaps, find it interesting <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> together <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> <b>As</b> for me, I play because all are polite enough to wish it, but conversation disturbs me not in the least." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Major {{will you}} tell Captain Boggs to come over after supper? Isaac will be able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> by then, and he has some news of the Indians," [...] said Colonel Zane.|$|E
6000|$|Seaforth {{noticed the}} glint in his comrade's eyes, and {{departed}} a little from veracity. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are times when}} a man is apt <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> at random." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no further comment. A huge, magnificently-equipped {{hospital}} for sick children had been thrown open in Paris that very morning, {{a gift to the}} nation from Citoyen Déroulède. Surely he was privileged <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> if it pleased him. His hospital would cover quite a good many defalcations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Careful, Cap!" [...] warned Wade. [...] "It'd {{be a shame}} not <b>to</b> hear me <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little....</b> Turn {{around now}} an' greet an old pard of the Gunnison days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh! Who cares! I am a {{stranger}} in New York, and I have taken a fancy to you. You are a young man of gallantry, {{and you are going}} to take me out.... We often used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> excursion like this in London. We'll have it in New York instead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Always," [...] he declared, [...] "in Engl{{and it is}} bridge. One dines with one's friends, and {{one would}} like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time, and it is bridge. It must be very dull for you little girls who are not old enough to play. There is no one left <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With all his {{firmness}} and self-control," [...] thought I, [...] "he tasks himself too far: locks every {{feeling and}} pang within--expresses, confesses, imparts nothing. I am {{sure it would}} benefit him <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make him talk." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{did not see}} {{him until}} lunch was announced, {{when he came to}} the table in his riding clothes. It may have been that he began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> eagerly about the {{excursion}} he had made to an outlying farm and the conversation he had had with the farmer who leased it.|$|E
6000|$|When he {{was gone}} the landlady came up <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> with Sue, and gather {{something}} of {{the circumstances of the}} family she had taken in. Sue had not the art of prevarication, and, after admitting several facts as to their late difficulties and wanderings, she was startled by the landlady saying suddenly: ...|$|E
6000|$|GIRL. [Laughing] You are a funny boy; {{but you are}} veree good. <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> me <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> then. No one <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> me. Tell me, haf {{you seen}} many German prisoners? ...|$|R
60|$|They {{walked up}} and down for <b>a</b> few moments <b>talking.</b> <b>As</b> they passed the front of the hotel, they heard a shrill peal of laughter. Blanche and her friend were <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> group of men. The Baron smiled.|$|R
6000|$|She laughed. [...] "You are a funny boy, {{but you are}} veree good. <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> me <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> then. No one <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> me. I {{would much}} rather talk, anyway. Tell me, haf you seen many German prisoners?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{kissed the}} hand {{she had given}} me, and we now began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more like people of the world, {{concerning}} our movements. The interview lasted an hour longer, when the heaven. [...] "You never yet were so unkind to one who was offensive; much less could you willingly have plotted this cruelty to one you regard!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still, {{when he is}} in the room, {{you might}} show him more attention. He may not be a phoenix of cleverness in your sense; his {{profession}} is different; but it would be all the better for you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> on his subjects. I think his conversation is quite agreeable. And he is anything but an unprincipled man." ...|$|E
60|$|After this Buckley {{allowed him}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> on the subject, but Jack felt {{the work to}} be very distasteful. Eventually he gave it up, consoling himself with the {{reflection}} that at all events he had brought the man away on an expedition where nothing stronger than cold water and hot tea was to be had for love or money.|$|E
60|$|But Mr. Meredith did no combing down or {{pitching}} into. He {{sat down}} and gathered his small culprits close <b>to</b> him and <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> them, tenderly and wisely. They were overcome with remorse and shame, and felt that they could never be so silly and thoughtless again.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{came in a}} tall, large, handsome, dashing-looking man, {{with the}} air of a [...] "beau sabreur," [...] whom Lady Belamour {{presented}} to her cousins as [...] "Colonel Mar, my son's commandant, you know who has been kind enough to take Carminster on his way, so as to escort me to the Bath. I am such a sad coward about highwaymen. And we are to meet dear Lady Aresfield there <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over <b>a</b> <b>little</b> matter of business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} boy, [...] "I am sure he will. He is always {{very glad to}} have us meet with an {{opportunity}} to speak French. Besides, there are some boys in the school who are learning English, and he would like <b>to</b> have you <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> with them." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pettifer {{got through}} her {{household}} work {{as soon as}} she could, and sat down with her sewing, hoping that Janet would perhaps be able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of what had passed, and find some relief by unbosoming herself in that way. But Janet could not speak to her; she was importuned with the longing to see Mr. Tryan, and yet hesitating to express it.|$|E
6000|$|... "After hours," [...] she {{reassured}} him. [...] "Susan and I {{are going}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nonsense after the day's work. You may join in {{if you can}} unbend so far. We shall probably eat more than is good for us--I had {{a cup of coffee}} for lunch--and if you decide to be magnificent and offer us wine, we shall drink it and talk more nonsense than ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, fear {{has brought}} him <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{rational}} sense! It is not natur', truly, to abandon a brother in distress; and the Lord He knows that I have never yet done the shameful deed. You are right, friend, you are right; {{we must all}} be hidden, and that speedily. But {{what to do with}} the ass! Friend Doctor, do you truly value the life of the creatur'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] said Zephaniah, [...] "I wish you'd call Lowiny here, and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about Dus Malbone. There she is, with Tobit's {{wife and}} mother, looking round among the cabbages, as {{if a man}} could be hid in such a place." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Friends, one and all, I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>a</b> <b>little</b> before I die. My {{last words}} {{on earth to}} you are to take warning from my fate. bad whiskey and bad women have brought me where I am. I hope you ladies will take no umbrage at this, for I have told you the God's truth. To you, little children, who {{were the first to}} be blessed by Jesus, I will give this warning: Don't drink whiskey and don't do as I have done. I want {{everyone}} in this vast crowd who does not wish {{to do the things that}} I have done, and to put themselves in the place I know occupy to hold their hands'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's a {{baby for}} sale," [...] shouted the auctioneer. [...] "A genuine article, pretty near {{as good as}} brand-new. A real live baby, {{warranted}} <b>to</b> walk and <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> Who bids? <b>A</b> dollar? Did I hear anyone mean enough to bid a dollar? No, sir, babies don't come as cheap as that, especially the curly-headed brand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the reason}} I don't feel it wrong to like to have papa sitting with me all the evening," [...] said Margaret, [...] "though it may make it worse {{for you to have}} him away. I don't think it selfish in me to keep him. He wants quiet so much, or <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> when it suits him; we are too many now, when he is tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{will you}} kindly 'low me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> Wrenn? I {{know a little}} {{something}} about how things go in the office myself! I don't deny you're a good man. Maybe some day you may get to be assistant manager. But I'm {{going to give the}} first try at it to Glover. He's had so much more experience with meeting people directly--personally. But you're a good man--" ...|$|E
60|$|William Bannister at {{this time}} was {{at an age when}} he was {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> and walk a little and take a great interest in things. His walking was a bit amateurish, and his speech rather hard to follow unless you had the key to it. But nobody could have denied that his walk, though staggery, was a genuine walk, and his speech, though limited, genuine speech, within the meaning of the act.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{said the}} doctor, with some dignity. [...] "I {{think you will}} trust him when you have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> And now," [...] he added {{with an air of}} amiably {{relaxing}} into lighter matters, [...] "let us talk about the murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stubborn?" [...] he said, [...] "and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. I put {{my request}} in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon. The fact is, once for all, I don't wish {{to treat you}} like an inferior: that is" [...] (correcting himself), [...] "I claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years' {{difference}} in age and a century's advance in experience. This is legitimate, et j'y tiens, as Adele would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a rusty nail." ...|$|R
60|$|One evening, about a {{week after}} the affair of the picture, as he was sitting <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his study, and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while.|$|R
