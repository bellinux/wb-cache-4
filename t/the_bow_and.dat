5|$|During the Woodland period, many American Indians in Iowa shifted {{away from}} hunting and {{gathering}} and used more domesticated plants, although wild food was still important. Ceramics, <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow, burial mounds, and evidence {{of political and social}} hierarchy became common at Woodland sites in Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Hide glue or gelatin {{made from}} fish gas {{bladders}} {{is used to}} attach layers of sinew {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> <b>and</b> to attach the horn belly to the wooden core.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak was {{initially}} armed with 24 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder {{guns on the}} main deck and 11 rifled breech-loading (RBL) Armstrong seven-inch, 110-pounder guns. Eight of these were also on the main deck {{and the other three}} served as chase guns on the upper deck, two at <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> one aft.|$|E

5|$|When Tulsidas recited this couplet, the idol of Krishna {{holding the}} flute and stick in hands changed to the idol of Rama holding <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow in hands. Some authors have {{expressed}} doubts on the couplet being composed by Tulsidas.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated in <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> {{exploded}} {{the forward}} ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; {{in about half}} an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot bear paying,' said Lady Bellair. 'But will he dance, {{and will}} he bring his <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows? Lord Dorfield protests 'tis nothing without <b>the</b> <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows.' ...|$|R

5|$|Gun {{armament}} of {{the class}} consists of two Bofors /70 Mk1 gun mounted on <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> towards the stern. During the development phase, the designers planned on using French Exocet anti-ship missiles as the class's main weapon system. However, due to the high price the French asked for the missile, possibly because of political reasons, the project was changed and two Soviet P-20 (SS-N-2B) were used instead. Self-defense measures include two Wallop Barricade chaff launchers.|$|E
5|$|However, when Collins {{returned}} to the ASC facility in April 2001 for a year-long maintenance docking, multiple welding defects were found in <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> escape tower sections of the submarine (the two sections constructed by Kockums), while almost no problems {{were found in the}} welding of the four Australian-built sections. Repairing these welds quadrupled the time Collins spent in dock.|$|E
5|$|The Ingeborg, {{built in}} 1776, had an eight-12-pounder {{centerline}} armament which {{was open to}} the elements, but two heavy 18-pounders in <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> two 6-pounder chase guns in the stern. The rowing benches with room for three men per bench were {{on either side of}} the centerline battery, but had to swing forwards and outwards to allow the guns to pivot to either side.|$|E
50|$|The Seth Low {{had a small}} lounge for her {{officers}} in <b>the</b> <b>bows,</b> <b>and</b> a small bunkroom, with four bunks, for off-duty sailors in the stern.|$|R

5|$|The {{new owners}} decided {{not merely to}} give the vessel a total refit. The keel, badly damaged during the grounding, was {{completely}} renewed along a length of , and the owners {{took the opportunity to}} further strengthen the hull. The old keelsons were replaced and ten new ones laid, which ran {{the entire length of the}} keel. Both <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double angle iron.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} also armed with six 45cm torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts. Four tubes were {{mounted on the}} sides of the ship, another in <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> <b>and</b> the last in the stern. These weapons were 5.1m (16ft9in) long and carried an 87.5kg (193lb) TNT warhead. They could be set at two speeds for {{different}} ranges. At , the torpedoes had a range of 800m (870yd). At an increased speed of , the range was reduced to 500m (550yb).|$|E
5|$|Titanics lower decks {{were divided}} into sixteen {{compartment}}s. Each compartment was separated from its neighbour by a bulkhead running {{the width of the}} ship; there were fifteen bulkheads in all. Each bulkhead extended at least to the underside of E Deck, nominally one deck, or about , above the waterline. The two nearest <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> the six nearest the stern went one deck further up.|$|E
60|$|Everybody was {{bowing to}} them--cabmen, little children, and {{everybody}} else--and they were returning all <b>the</b> <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> overlooking nobody, {{when a young}} lady met them and made a deep courtesy.|$|R
60|$|Although the Spanish {{ships were}} still {{three-quarters of a}} mile away, a bustle was at once {{observable}} on their decks. Men clustered at <b>the</b> <b>bows,</b> <b>and</b> could be seen at work there.|$|R
50|$|A {{survey by}} Royal Navy divers found that <b>the</b> <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> stern were {{reasonably}} intact, but a 100 ft {{section of the}} port side had been blown out. The wreck was abandoned as a total loss.|$|R
5|$|At 10:00 on {{the morning}} of 31May, Laforey sent the boats from his {{squadron}} inshore to attack the grounded Confiante. Coming alongside the wreck at 12:45, the British boarding party, under Lieutenants George Acklom and William J. Simonds, found no one alive on the ship, but counted a large number of French dead still on board. Removing the French colours and paperwork, the boarding party started fires in <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> stern of the corvette before withdrawing, despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from French troops overlooking the beach and a force of cavalry moving along the shore. The fire rapidly destroyed Confiante and the British boarding party retired without casualties.|$|E
5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> <b>and</b> Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted {{on the port side}} of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Tom had {{followed}} these instructions, Ned handed him up <b>the</b> <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows and spears, and then clambered up beside him. As the fire again burned low, an animal {{was seen to}} approach, cautiously.|$|R
60|$|Among others, I remember, was {{a little}} brig from the Coast of Guinea. In appearance, she was the ideal of a slaver; low, black, clipper-built about <b>the</b> <b>bows,</b> <b>and</b> her decks {{in a state of}} most piratical disorder.|$|R

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that after the}} collapse of the Hopewell, Indiana had a low population until the rise of the Fort Ancient and Mississippian culture around 900 AD. The Ohio River Valley was densely populated by the Mississippians from about 1100 to 1450 AD. Their settlements, like those of the Hopewell, were known for their ceremonial earthwork mounds. Some of these remain visible at locations near the Ohio River. The Mississippian mounds were constructed on a grander scale than the mounds built by the Hopewell. The agrarian Mississippian culture was the first to grow maize in the region. The people also developed <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow and copper working during this time period.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, {{was seen}} as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the {{southern}} stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow depiction with that of a dog.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions {{found on}} caves and pottery are another source for {{studying}} the history of Tamilakam. Writings in Tamil-Brahmi script {{have been found in}} many locations in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and also in Egypt and Thailand. mostly recording grants made by the kings and chieftains. References are also made to other aspects of the Sangam society. Coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of the coins carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty on their reverse, such as <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow of the Cheras; some of them contain portraits and written legends helping numismatists assign them to a certain period.|$|E
