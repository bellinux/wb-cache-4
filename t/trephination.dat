25|$|The oldest {{operation}} for which evidence exists is trepanation (also known as trepanning, <b>trephination,</b> trephining or burr hole from Greek τρύπανον and τρυπανισμός), {{in which a}} hole is drilled or scraped into the skull for exposing the dura mater to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases. In the case of head wounds, surgical intervention was implemented for investigating and diagnosing {{the nature of the}} wound and the extent of the impact while bone splinters were removed preferably by scraping followed by post operation procedures and treatments for avoiding infection and aiding in the healing process. Evidence has been found in prehistoric human remains from Proto-Neolithic and Neolithic times, in cave paintings, and the procedure continued in use well into recorded history (being described by ancient Greek writers such as Hippocrates). Out of 120 prehistoric skulls found at one burial site in France dated to 6500 BCE, 40 had trepanation holes. Folke Henschen, a Swedish doctor and historian, asserts that Soviet excavations of the banks of the Dnieper River in the 1970s show the existence of trepanation in Mesolithic times dated to approximately 12000 BCE. The remains suggest a belief that trepanning could cure epileptic seizures, migraines, and certain mental disorders.|$|E

If the patient manages to survive the procedure, the bone begins to slowly grow back from the rim of the hole towards the center. This new bone growth is measurably thinner than the undamaged bone at the rim, providing scientists examining a trephinated skull with a means to establishing whether or not the person lived beyond the operation.|$|E

This spawned a symbiotic relationship of neurologist and neurosurgeon, the former often guiding the latter to a presumptive operative target. Intraoperative imaging was revolutionized by the pioneering efforts of Walter Dandy 10 in pneumoencephalography. In 1927, the neurologist Egas Moniz and the neurosurgeon Almeida Lima performed cerebral angiography, 11 ushering in a new era in the operative management of patients with cerebrovascular disease. 5, 12, 33 Intraoperative ultrasound, both cranial and spinal, has also been successfully applied to lesion localization. 8, 13, 42 However, it was the invention of computerized tomog- 804 A mobile high-field magnetic resonance system for neurosurger...|$|R

A 4-5 mm diameter hole is drilled into the anterior table of the sinus. The best location of the trephine is the floor of sinus or through brow ridge. If there is possibility of development of osteomyelitis, trephine should be made inferiorly. Precaution is taken not to injure the supraorbital nerve. The pus is cultured and irrigated, and the sinus is cleared with a saline or an antibiotic solution. Extra holes are cut in two pieces of french red Robinson rubber catheter or Silastic tubing. The two tubing pieces are inserted through trephine and sutured. An alternative method is the minitrephine system manufactured by Medtronic-Xomed, in which a metal cannula wedged firmly into an accurately shaped hole is used.|$|E

Methods: Eleven fresh human cadaveric eyes were trephined using 8. 0 mm Moria single-use adjustable vacuum trephines. Prior to <b>trephination,</b> the average corneal pachymetry in the peripheral 7 – 10 mm range was obtained using anterior segment optical coherence tomography. The <b>trephination</b> depth was set to 80 % of that value. Light microscopy was used to image anteroposterior cross-sections of each corneal specimen. Digital protractor software {{was used to evaluate}} the <b>trephination</b> angle, depth, and length. All adequately processed specimens were included in the analysis. In addition, <b>trephination</b> angle data from a previous publication by Moshirfar et al were used as a comparison with those of this study. Results: <b>Trephination</b> analysis of depth compared with pachymetry revealed a mean of 83. 7 %± 6. 53 % (95 % confidence interval 79. 8 – 87. 6). Maximum and minimum trephined depths were 95. 35 % and 71. 3 %, respectively. <b>Trephination</b> depth compared with angular corneal thickness yielded a mean of 66. 2 %± 4. 79 % (95 % confidence interval 63. 0 – 69. 4). Maximum and minimum depths were 73. 7 % and 59. 7 %, respectively. Analysis of <b>trephination</b> angle yielded a mean of 130. 2 ± 3. 57 degrees (95 % confidence interval 127. 8 – 132. 61). Maximum and minimum angles were 135. 5 degrees and 126 degrees, respectively. The standard deviation of the <b>trephination</b> angle of the Moria trephine was found to be significantly less than that of Hessburg-Barron and Hanna trephines calculated in the previous study. Conclusion: The Moria adjustable vacuum trephine is an accurate method of <b>trephination</b> when a specific depth is desired.
