Stability and/or instability of the straight micro-crack paths is investigated for a periodic array of originally collinear, slowly growing microcracks with fibres located in between the neighbouring micro-cracks tips. The relevant application e. g. refers to matrix cracking in 90 ° plies of cross-ply ceramic composites. The problem is solved using the technique of distributed dislocations and an approximate fundamental solution for a single edge dislocation lying in a general point between inclusion centres. The Muschelishvili complex potentials and the Galerkin method for a numerical evaluation of coefficients of suitable chosen bas functions are employed. Numerical results are presented showing an influence of mutual microcracks-fibres geometry and the mismatch of elastic properties on micro-crack path stability/instability...|$|E
40|$|A {{post-tensioned}} prestressed system basically {{consists of}} a high strength tendon or strand running through {{the length of the}} concrete structure. The strand is stressed using a hydraulic jack, the <b>tensile</b> <b>stressing</b> force of the strand is transferred into the concrete by the use of anchorages. One of the most critical aspects of post-tensioned construction, which is also necessary for the success of the system, is the "anchorage zone". The relatively large compressive forces generated from the strand are applied to the concrete over a small area. For this reason steel reinforcement known as anti-burst is used in the anchorage zone to control cracking caused by tensile forces {{as a result of the}} tensioning. Eight 150 mm thick 400 mm x 1000 mm post-tensioned concrete slabs with varying types of anti-burst reinforcements and two different concrete strengths were designed and tested to failure. Pull out tests were conducted at up to 95 % of the tendon's tensile strength to find out the most effective type of anti-burst reinforcement and the effect of variation in concrete strengths. The rectangular helices type was found to be the best performer while the higher concrete strength was the better. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|E

The effect of the microstructural constituents: the primary alloy carbides and the tempered martensite matrix, and their interaction, was identified through fractographic analysis and determination of mechanical properties such as the bending strength, σR, the fatigue limit, Δσfat, and the fracture strength of the primary carbides under static <b>tensile</b> <b>stressing,</b> σRC. The response under monotonic loading {{was found to be}} governed by the fracture of primary carbides. The cracks nucleated when the applied stresses were higher than the carbides fracture strength, accordingly depending on their properties, morphology and arrangement. Under cyclic loading, despite failure origins were located at the primary carbides and cracks emanating from them and propagating through the metallic matrix were evidenced, crack nucleation phenomena could not be explained as in monotonic loading since the applied stresses in fatigue were lower than the determined σRC. Carbides fracture was then probably caused by damage observed in the metallic matrix. Primary carbides acted as stress concentrators and strain localization was more likely occurring in the matrix around them. Thus, fatigue failure was attributed to the destabilization of the tempered martensite of the matrix, induced by the strain localization processes around carbides, which produced their breakage and gave rise to fatigue propagating cracks...|$|E

The objectives of the paper are to: identify the physics of the processes controlling global failure modes; and, describe the global behaviour using physics-based constitutive equations. Two sets of constitutive equations are used to model the softening which takes place in tertiary creep of Nimonic 80 A at 750 °C. Softening by multiplication of mobile dislocations is firstly combined, for low stress, with softening due to nucleation controlled creep constrained cavity growth; and secondly combined, for high stress, with softening due to continuum void growth. The Continuum Damage Mechanics, CDM, Finite Element Solver DAMAGE XX {{has been used to}} study notch creep fracture. Low stress notch behaviour is accurately predicted provided that the constitutive equations take account of the effect of stress level on creep ductility. High stress notch behaviour is accurately predicted from a normalized inverse cavity spacing d/ 2 ℓ= 6, and an initial normalized cavity radius rhi/ℓ= 3. 16 × 10 − 3, where 2 ℓ is the cavity spacing, and d is the grain size; however, the constants in the strain rate equation required recalibration against high stress notch data. A void nucleation mechanism is postulated for high stress behaviour which involves decohesion where slip bands intersect second phase grain boundary particles. Both equation sets accurately predict experimentally observed global failure modes...|$|E

40|$|To {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of}} how opening-mode fractures (joints) form and open or close at depth in layered rocks, we present a 2 D numerical study aiming to determine whether <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> can develop in pre-fractured elastic multilayers submitted to biaxial compressive strain conditions. First, we investigate the role of the elastic and geometrical properties of the layers on the development of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in models with five bonded layers and containing one open fracture in the central layer. Our results indicate that, in absence of elastic contrast (in Young's modulus) between the layers, no <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> develops in the models. However, when the fractured layer is stiffer than the two adjacent layers directly above and below, a lobe of horizontal <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> develops centered on the pre-existing fracture. The creation of this <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> is contingent upon the partial closing of the fracture. The levels of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> and the thickness of the lobe of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> increase logarithmically with an increase in the elastic contrast and are systematically larger for a larger Soft/Stiff ratio (ratio of the total thickness of the soft layers with the total thickness of the stiff layers). Second, we investigate the role of fracture interaction in the development of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in models containing a pair of open fractures. We observe that the levels of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in the region between the fractures are systematically higher than those observed in identical models containing a single fracture. This increase in <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> is very large for small elastic contrasts between the layers but diminishes when the elastic contrast increases. Furthermore, the spacing between the pre-existing fractures {{plays an important role in}} the stress distribution in the region between them. When the fracture spacing is equal to or lower than 1. 15 times the height of the fractured layer for the experimental conditions chosen, the lobes of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> centered on the fractures coalesce. This results in the formation of vast areas of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in models under remote compressive loading conditions. Such tensile areas are likely to allow the initiation and propagation of subsequent opening-mode fractures.
