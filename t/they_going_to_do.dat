500|$|Even {{though the}} episode aired during the {{beginning}} of the fifth season, it was produced by the crew of the fourth season. A large part of the original crew left the show after season four. This led to the addition of several scenes, which normally would not have been considered, because the mentality of the departing crew was [...] "what are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> get us fired?" [...] Although most of the episode was completed by the staff of season four, the end was rewritten by the team of season five.|$|E
500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. What are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with all this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony. People will say they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hoggard was {{considered}} a scapegoat for his sudden falling out of favour the England and Wales Cricket Board. [...] "We've had the same problems with the ECB since I started international cricket," [...] {{he wrote in his}} book. [...] "There were people slagging them off when I first came in and there are people still slagging them off. [...] And it's not the ECB who pick the side anyway. [...] See {{if you can find a}} player with a good word to say about the ECB. [...] What are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> sue me for telling the truth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and I {{heard that}} those Longley fellows were boasting <b>they</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> up Hixley, {{just the same}} as <b>they</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> us up." ...|$|R

2500|$|Fifty {{motions to}} reopen divorce cases {{that had been}} handled by Garson were {{received}} by New York's chief administrative judge for matrimonial cases. Of those, three or four were granted a hearing, and eventually settled. However, even in cases that involved both Garson and Siminovsky, rulings were not necessarily reviewed or overturned. To receive a hearing, parties were required to demonstrate some likelihood {{that they had not}} received a fair trial. Criticizing a process that required parties who did not have subpoena powers or wiretaps to prove corruption in each case, the President of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women said: [...] "The burden of proof is going to fall on them to show the case is corrupted; and how are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Moir's article {{resulted}} in over 25,000 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) that day, causing its site to crash for several hours. Derren Brown and Stephen Fry used Twitter to front an online {{campaign against the}} Daily Mail and Jan Moir throughout the afternoon and a Facebook page was set up urging followers to complain to the brands whose advertisements featured alongside the article. Fry wrote, [...] "I gather a repulsive nobody writing in a paper no one of any decency would be seen dead with has written something loathesome and inhumane". Brown wrote, [...] "If Gateley's [...] passing causes today's kind of gutter-journalism to be held to account, we can perhaps {{take that as a}} tribute". Father Ted and The IT Crowd writer Graham Linehan called for a complete boycott of the Daily Mail, tweeting [...] "Which brands advertise in the Mail? Are they aware of Jan Moir's piece?...what are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about it?". Details of companies with advertisements on the same web page as Moir's article were posted on a specially established Facebook page named [...] "The Daily Mail should retract Jan Moir's hateful, homophobic article". According to The Guardian details about where Moir lived were posted on the Internet and a false rumour that the Daily Mail had reported Cowles as Gately's murderer was repeated on Twitter.|$|E

5000|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a deathly silence. Shmuel the Yellow's voice is heard: [...] "Rothenberg! Ask the Germans what <b>they</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with us!" ...|$|R
60|$|Aside {{from his}} {{personal}} desires, what were <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> They had left, in actual money, less than fifty dollars.|$|E

6000|$|That {{was just}} what I came to inquire about. What were <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the Chinese {{decoration}} all over Penang? Would they try to wisely obliterate that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know that}} <b>they</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this. If I had I'd have died before I'd have written that note," [...] he added rather lamely.|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't {{a chance}} for any one in Mossvale," [...] put in Nancy. She herself had been {{secretly}} wondering what <b>they</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for support.|$|R
60|$|When {{the meal}} was over, one of the duke's pages who {{was about the same}} age as Beorn asked him what <b>they</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kari," [...] I said, {{without turning}} my head, [...] "what are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with us? Set us in yonder temple to be worshipped {{with nothing to}} eat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON. What {{on earth}} are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> (Going out.) I really must go and stop this--- (She follows them, {{speaking}} as she disappears. Gloria stares coolly at Valentine, and then deliberately looks at her watch.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with me?" [...] {{asked the}} Englishman. [...] "My {{country is not}} at war with these people. You speak their language.

6000|$|Mrs. Leigh went, as {{a matter}} of course, and Ayacanora would needs go too. She was very anxious to know what <b>they</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the [...] "Carib." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Talking of stakes,' said Lord St. Jerome, who pricked up {{his ears}} at a congenial subject, 'do {{you know what}} <b>they</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about that affair of Anderson's?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{does not}} look like a prison. I should say that it was a cellar, in the house of one of the gang that set upon me. It is evident that someone has betrayed me, {{probably}} that Jew, Ben Soloman. What have they brought me here for? I wonder what are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with me." ...|$|E
60|$|His mind next {{turned to}} his {{immediate}} future. What were <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him? On this point he felt tolerably comfortable. This imprisonment could mean {{nothing more than that}} he would be compelled to disgorge a ransom. This did not trouble him. He was rich, and, now that the situation had been switched to a purely business basis, he felt that he could handle it.|$|E
6000|$|The crowd {{gathered}} around them, still very threatening in attitude, yet clearly afraid to approach within arm's-length of the strangers. Muriel was much frightened at their noise and at their frantic gestures. [...] "Come away," [...] she cried, catching Felix {{by the arm}} once more. [...] "Oh, what are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to us? Will they kill us for this? I'm so horribly afraid! Oh, why did I ever do it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am tired}} of her father's soul," [...] said Dickory. [...] "I wonder what new piece of {{mischief}} <b>they</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> here; there are no ships to be robbed?" ...|$|R

60|$|But {{behind all}} these {{conceivable}} triumphs of scientific adjustment and direction lies the infinitely greater difficulty {{on our way}} to the Great State, the difficulty of direction. What sort of people are going to distribute the work of the community, decide what is or is not to be done, determine wages, initiate enterprises; and under what sort of criticism, checks, and controls are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this delicate and extensive work? With this we open the whole problem of government, administration and officialdom.|$|E
6000|$|When {{she went}} down-stairs she {{encountered}} her father. He looked impressive, triumphant! His effort at evasion did not deceive Lenore. But she realized {{at once that}} in this instance she could not get any news from him. He said everything was all right and that I.W.W. men were to be deported from Washington. But {{he did not want}} any supper, and he had a low-voiced, significant interview with Dorn. Lenore longed to know what was pending. Dorn's voice, when he said at his door, [...] "Anderson, I'll go!" [...] was ringing, hard, and deadly. It frightened Lenore. Go where? What were <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Lenore thought of the vigilantes her father had organized.|$|E
6000|$|... "Number three answers that," [...] he said, [...] "and here it is: Men {{and things}} are so made that they have {{different}} likes. A rabbit likes a vegetarian diet. A lynx likes meat. Ducks swim; chickens are scairt of water. One man collects postage stamps, another man collects butterflies. This man goes in for paintings, that man goes in for yachts, and some other fellow for hunting big game. One man thinks horse-racing is It, with a big I, and another man finds the biggest satisfaction in actresses. They can't help these likes. They have them, and what are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about it? Now I like gambling. I like to play the game. I want to play it big and play it quick. I'm just made that way. And I play it." ...|$|E
50|$|Soon, {{the four}} of them leave the camping site at night thanks to Marco's {{spontaneous}} idea. Crossing the Germany border to Poland, they have no idea what <b>they</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> there.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was very}} wise, Dinah. Now mind, what we {{particularly}} {{want to know}} is not only what the negroes have done, but what <b>they</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> march away to the hills, or are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attack the town?" ...|$|R
60|$|The old {{hands had}} kept the matter quiet from us greenhorns, so that, {{although}} we knew <b>they</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some sort of mischief, we didn't exactly understand {{what it was to}} be.|$|R
