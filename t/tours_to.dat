5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, his cocaine {{addiction}} intensified. Jennings {{claimed to have}} spent $1,500 a day on his habit, draining his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt with debt up to $2.5million. Though he insisted on repaying the debt and did additional <b>tours</b> <b>to</b> earn the funds, his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated. Jennings decided to quit his addictions, leased {{a home in the}} Phoenix area, and spent a month detoxing himself, intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward.

Due to the time spent in Australia, he became eligible to contest for national titles, unsuccessfully challenging Les Darcy for the welterweight belt in 1915. The highpoint {{of his time in}} America, then during the 'no decision' era, was a win over Panama Joe Gans.

5|$|Saffron {{cultivation}} in Europe declined steeply {{following the}} fall of the Roman Empire. For several centuries thereafter, saffron cultivation was rare or non-existent throughout Europe. This was reversed when Moorish civilisation spread from North Africa to settle the Iberian peninsula as well as parts of France and southern Italy. One theory states that Moors reintroduced saffron corms to the region around Poitiers after they lost the Battle of <b>Tours</b> <b>to</b> Charles Martel in AD 732. Two centuries after their conquest of Spain, Moors planted saffron throughout the southern provinces of Andalucia, Castile, La Mancha, and Valencia.|$|E
