However, optimization models in most applications use data that is subject to uncertainty. Recently, robust optimization {{has been used as}} an optimization model that incorporates uncertainty. This paper proposes a linear programming model with the objective of maximizing the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> for the delivery of water to agricultural areas that cover an irrigation network over a planning horizon. The writers apply uncertain data in this system {{in the form of a}} robust optimization approach. The writers also consider analysis of the sensitivity of the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> in accordance with the variations of the degree of conservatism (reliability), irrigation efficiency, and price of irrigation water. The results of changes to these parameters in a wide range of variations caused large changes in the optimal <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> of the planning horizon. Application of the proposed model to the case study of the Nekooabad irrigation network in the province of Isfahan, Iran, over a 3 -year planning horizon (2012 – 2014) demonstrates the reliability and flexibility of the model.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether there}} is room for the improvement of farm program decisions through the incorporation of mathematical optimization in the practical planning process. Probing the potential for improvement, we investigate the cases of four German cash crop farms over the last six years. The formal planning approach includes a systematic time series analysis of farmspecific single gross margins and a stochastic optimization model. In order to avoid solutions that simply exceed the farmer's risk tolerance, the apparently accepted variance of the observed program's <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> which represents an observable reflection of the individual farmer's risk attitude is used as an upper bound in the optimization. For each of the 24 planning occasions, the formal model is used in a quasi ex-ante approach that provides optimized alternative programs. The total gross margins that could have been realized if the formally optimized programs had been implemented are then ex-post compared to those that were actually realized. We find that the farmers could have increased their total gross margins significantly if - instead of using simple routines and rules of thumb - they had used the more sophisticated formal planning model. However, we also find that the superiority of formalized planning approaches depends on the quality of statistical analysis and the resulting forecasting model. Using our approach for practical decision support implies that farmers first specify their "own" production programs without the formal planning aid. Then, an alternative program can be provided which leads to superior expected total gross margins without exceeding the farmer's accepted <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> variance. production program planning, optimization, uncertainty, static distributions, stochastic processes, Crop Production/Industries, C 1, C 61, M 11, Q 12,...|$|E

The objective {{of this article is to}} present a bio-economic farm model that is generic and re-usable for different bio-physical and socio-economic contexts, facilitating the linking of micro and macro analysis or to provide detailed analysis of farming systems in a specific region. Model use is illustrated in this paper with an analysis of the impacts of the CAP reform of 2003 for arable and livestock farms in a context of market liberalization. Results from the application of the model to representative farms in Flevoland (the Netherlands) and Midi-Pyrenees (France) shows that CAP reform 2003 under market liberalization will cause substantial substitution of root crops and durum wheat by vegetables and oilseed crops. Much of the set-aside area will be put into production intensifying the existing farming systems. Abolishment of the milk quota system will cause an increase of the average herd size. The average <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> of farm types in Flevoland decreases while the average <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> of farms in Midi-Pyrenees increases.

In total 227 respondents comprising 162 chickpea producers; 11 local assemblers; 8 rural wholesalers; 8 urban wholesalers and 38 retailers were interviewed. The study finding shows that the chickpea value chain actors are broadly classified into three viz., inputs suppliers, direct market actors and enablers. Chickpea producers sold their chickpea products to different market intermediaries and final consumers. About nine chickpea marketing channels were identified. The total amount of chickpea that was transacted through these marketing channels in 2012 / 13 was 9, 181 qts. Out of which the project site farmers supply 77 % while 27 % were imported from other chickpea producing areas. The study result shows that the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> marketing <b>margin</b> was 45. 8 % with producer participation margin of 54. 2 %.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} facing Egypt is the ever increasing demand for water against the fixed water supplies. Therefore, {{a greater emphasis}} is currently being placed {{on the need to}} improve the efficiency {{in the use of the}} available water resources for crop production. The study presents a practical approach to manage and optimise the irrigation water use given water, land and organisational constraints. A linear programming (LP) mathematical model was developed to make decisions about irrigation water management options in conjunction with optimal cropping patterns to ensure optimal use of water. The results showed that there is potential to increase net income from crop production through efficient allocation of irrigation water under the prevailing irrigation situation. The results also showed the impacts of different water policies on the area allocated for each crop, resource use and farm income using comparative-static planning models. Three scenarios were evaluated. Under increased water supply scenario, the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> for all crops increased. However under the drought scenario, the total margins decreased. Finally under water charging (partial cost recovery) scenario, farm income decreased reflecting the increased production costs.

In spite of its well known problem solving capacity, some methodological obstacles have persisted over the years. The main problem is that stochastic variables and their correlations cannot be adequately accounted for within traditional optimization procedures. In this paper, we develop a methodological mix of stochastic simulation and a heuristic optimization procedure which {{has become known as}} genetic algorithms. The simulation part of the mix allows for the consideration of complex information such as stochastic processes; the genetic algorithms-part ensures that the method remains manageable in terms of required time and resources. We demonstrate the decision support potential of the approach by optimizing the production program of a Brandenburg crop farm. We account for the risky environment by using existing stochastic information: on the one hand, we model man-days which are available in critical seasons (particularly harvesting) as triangular distributions according to expert estimations. On the other hand, we use empirical time series and estimate stochastic processes for the <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> of different activities (wheat, barley etc.). Additionally, variant calculations are made in order to take into account different risk attitudes of decision-makers. Model results in terms of optimal production programs and expected <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> are highly sensitive both to the risk attitudes of decision-makers and the stochastic processes which are estimated for different activities. optimization, optimal production program, stochastic simulation, genetic algorithms, uncertainty, stochastic processes, Farm Management, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

Results showed increasing production variability with increasing levels of deficit irrigation, especially when rainfall has significant potential to contribute to the production process. Risk-averse decision makers are more willingly to adopt deficit irrigation schedules for maize due to increased effective rainfall. The conclusion is that the potential to use rainfall more effectively through deficit irrigation is a key variable determining adoption of deficit irrigation strategies by risk-averse decision makers. Localized weather forecasts may improve acceptance of deficit irrigation by risk-averse decision makers. The value of information for weather forecast might be low because of high risk premiums placed on full irrigation by risk-averse decision makers. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|Mathematical {{programming}} has for a {{long time}} been recognized as a powerful tool. Despite its capacity for solving constrained optimization problems under uncertainty, some methodological obstacles have persisted over the years. The main problem is that the eventually complex results of an unbiased statistical analysis (multiple correlated stochastic variables with different distributions and nonadditive links between) cannot be adequately accounted for within minimization of total absolute deviation (MOTAD) or expected value-variance (EV) models that rely on the algorithmic determination of the variability measure. In this paper, we develop a methodological hybrid consisting of Monte Carlo simulation and genetic algorithms: the Monte Carlo simulation facilitates the easy representation of diverse stochastic processes and correlation, and the genetic algorithm ensures that the optimization procedure remains applicable even in the case of complex stochastic information. This hybrid approach is applied to the production-planning problem of a German crop farm. Variant calculations are used to account for the unknown risk attitude of the farmer. Model results demonstrate that optimized production programs and expected <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> are not only highly sensitive to the risk attitude, but also to the stochastic processes that are estimated (or assumed) for various activities. We furthermore find evidence that the hybrid approach is able to generate considerable improvement in farm-program decisions and outperforms planning models that assume static distributions.

40|$|Different {{patterns}} of nutrition during {{pregnancy and lactation}} can influence cow productivity {{and the performance of}} their offspring. An experiment was conducted on the North Coast of NSW whereby “low” and “high” pasture nutritional systems were imposed on a herd of Hereford cows during pregnancy, and then again from birth to weaning, with a crossover design also imposed to select offspring with extremes of growth to birth and/or weaning. Thus, four growth groups resulted – low-low, low-high, high-low, and high-high. Piedmontese and Wagyu bulls were used. After weaning, these offspring were grown out on the NSW Northern Tablelands and then finished to heavy market weights in a feedlot. The results of the experiment indicated that restricted early-life growth resulting in differences in weight of calves at weaning persisted until slaughter at 30 months of age. Animals that were smaller at weaning remained smaller at slaughter. Some compensation occurred following restriction of growth during lactation, but not following restriction of growth during pregnancy. However, neither carcass quality nor eating quality of the beef was adversely affected by growth restriction during early-life. An economic analysis of these data was done using the Beef-N-Omics decision support package. Two methods were used. The main results showed that for the representative cattle enterprise modelled, <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> ranged from $ 45, 500 for the low-low system to $ 52, 600 for the high-low system. <b>Gross</b> <b>margin</b> per hectare ranged from $ 114 for the low-low system to $ 132 for the high-low system, while <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per breeding cow ranged from $ 303 for the low-low system to $ 387 for the high-high system. In all cases, the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> for those groups with foetal growth based on a higher level of nutrition exceeded their peers on a lower level of nutrition. Therefore, it is more profitable for cows and calves to have access to a high standard of nutrition during pregnancy and up to weaning than for them to have access only to a poor standard of nutrition during this time period. beef, early-life nutrition, economic, evaluation, Australia, Agribusiness, Farm Management, Livestock Production/Industries, Production Economics, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Q 12, Q 16,...|$|R

The simulated results indicate that increasing the agricultural area reduces the sustainability of the irriga-tion system because the demand of water increased despite in-crease in the gross margin. The scenarios show that imposed water trading and ground water pumping would considerably increase the supply system having a positive impact on the sustainability.

40|$|International audienceThe issue {{addressed}} in this paper is whether implementation of the CAP MTR, (involving decoupled payments reduced by "modulations" and subject to cross-compliance measures) can be effective in improving {{the environmental impact of}} arable farming. The focus is on two French cross-compliance measures (compulsory buffer strips along rivers and crop diversity). A farm-level bio-economic model incorporating yield uncertainty is built and adjusted to represent two typical arable farms in the Southwest of France. The model also combines agro-environmental indicators. The results indicate that a simple decoupling of direct payments, without cross-compliance measures, has no impact on allocations between different crops. If cross-compliance measures are imposed, a small reduction in the cultivated area of irrigated crops is observed. The penalty levied (1 % of the total subsidy paid) when farmers do not comply with the "buffer strips" requirement is sufficient for both farm-types. Decoupling and modulation result in a fall in the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> of around 3 %, principally because of the 5 % modulation rate, while the "buffer strips" requirement leads to a further decrease of around 1 %.

40|$|Crop {{production}} {{is associated with}} a range of potential environmental impacts, including field 9 emissions of greenhouse gases, loss of nitrogen and phosphorous nutrients to water and toxicity 10 effects on humans and natural ecosystems. Farmers can mitigate these environmental impacts 11 by changing their farming systems; however these changes have implications for production 12 and profitability. To address these trade-offs, a farm-level model was constructed to capture 13 the elements of a rice-based production system in northern Thailand. Life Cycle Assessment 14 (LCA) was used to generate environmental impacts, across a range of indicators, for all crops 15 and associated production processes in the model. A baseline, profit maximising combination 16 of crops and resource use was generated and compared with a greenhouse gas minimising 17 scenario and an alternative inputs (fertilisers and insecticides) scenario. Greenhouse gas 18 minimisation showed a reduction in global warming potential of 13 %; other impact indicators 19 also decreased. Associated profit foregone was 10 % as measured by <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> With 20 the alternative farm inputs (ammonium sulphate, organic fertiliser and fipronil insecticide), 21 results indicated that acidification, eutrophication, freshwater and terrestrial ecotoxicity 22 impacts were reduced by 43, 37, 47 and 91 % respectively with relatively small effects on profit...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{aimed to}} analyze the EU- 27 {{agricultural}} land, farms structure and size based on Eurostat data. In the EU, farm structure shows that farms have a small size accounting for 12 ha in average. The highest farm size is in Czech Republic (152 ha) and the smallest one in Romania and Cyprus (3 ha). The size of farms has slowly increased from a year to another {{while the number of}} farms declined. About 80 % farms are situated in Romania, Italy, Poland, Spain, Greece, Hungary and France. Three countries France, Italy and Germany produces 50. 51 % gross margin of the EU- 27 which accounted for Euro 278. 33 Billion in 2010. A number of 199, 400 farms achieved 46. 6 % of the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> more exactly Euro 129, 810 million. These farms utilized 25 % of the Eu- 27 agricultural land. The farms with less than Euro 2, 000 gross margin represent 45. 44 % {{of the total number of}} farms and keep 5 % of the utilized agricultural land and produce 3. 39 % of the EU- 27 gross margin. The farms with a higher dimension produce the highest gross margin proving that farm size has a direct influence on profitability and economic efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The issue {{addressed}} in this paper is whether implementation of the CAP MTR, (involving decoupled payments reduced by "modulations" and subject to cross-compliance measures) can be effective in improving {{the environmental impact of}} arable farming. The focus is on two French cross-compliance measures (compulsory buffer strips along rivers and crop diversity). A farm-level bio-economic model incorporating yield uncertainty is built and adjusted to represent two typical arable farms in the Southwest of France. The model also combines agro-environmental indicators. The results indicate that a simple decoupling of direct payments, without cross-compliance measures, has no impact on allocations between different crops. If cross-compliance measures are imposed, a small reduction in the cultivated area of irrigated crops is observed. The penalty levied (1 % of the total subsidy paid) when farmers do not comply with the "buffer strips" requirement is sufficient for both farm-types. Decoupling and modulation result in a fall in the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> of around 3 %, principally because of the 5 % modulation rate, while the "buffer strips" requirement leads to a further decrease of around 1 %. Moreover, this requirement improves the environmental indicators at the farm level.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{scenarios of}} cultivating energy crops in the German Federal State of Baden-Württemberg to identify potentials {{and limitations of}} a sustainable bioenergy production. Trade-offs are analyzed among income and production structure in agriculture, bioenergy crop production, greenhouse gas emissions, {{and the interests of}} soil, water and species habitat protection. An integrated modelling approach (IMA) was implemented coupling ecological and economic models in a model chain. IMA combines the Economic Farm Emission Model (EFEM; key input: parameter sets on farm production activities), the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model (EPIC; key input: parameter sets on environmental cropping effects) and GIS geo-processing models. EFEM is a supply model that maximizes <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> on farm level with simultaneous calculation of greenhouse gas emission from agriculture production. Calculations by EPIC result in estimates for soil erosion by water, nitrate leaching, Soil Organic Carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from soil. GIS routines provide land suitability analyses, scenario settings concerning nature conservation and habitat models for target species and help to enable spatial explicit results. The model chain is used to calculate scenarios representing different intensities of energy crop cultivation. To design scenarios which are detailed and in step to practice, comprehensive data research as well as fact and effect analyses were carried out. The scenarios indicate that, not in general but when considering specific farm types, energy crop share extremely increases if not restricted and leads to an increase in income. If so this leads to significant increase in soil erosion by water, nitrate leaching and greenhouse gas emissions. It has to be expected that an extension of nature conservation leads to an intensification of the remaining grassland and of the arable land, which were not part of nature conservation measures, and thus do not lead to a significant decrease in income. It is concluded that an environment friendly extension of energy crops is possible when using scenario technique which enables to formulate more precise agri-environmental policies...|$|R

40|$|Pasture degradation, {{particularly}} that attributable to overgrazing, {{is a significant}} problem across the northern Australian rangelands. Although grazing studies have identified the scope for wet season resting strategies {{to be used to}} rehabilitate degraded pastures, the economic outcome of these strategies has not been extensively demonstrated. An exploratory study of the prospective economic value of wet season resting is presented using an economic simulation model of a 28000 ha beef enterprise located in the Charters Towers region of north-eastern Australia to explore seven hypothetical scenarios centred on the projected performance of a wet season resting strategy. A series of 20 -year simulations for a range of pasture recovery profiles, stocking capacity, animal productivity responses, beef prices and agistment options are compared with a baseline scenario of taking no action. Estimates of the net present value of the 20 -year difference in <b>total</b> enterprise <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> between the various resting options and the 'do nothing' option identify that wet season resting can offer a positive economic return for the range of scenarios examined, although this is contingent on the assumptions that are made concerning the trajectories of change in carrying capacity and animal productivity. Some implications for management and policy making to support the practical implementation of wet season resting strategies are discussed...|$|R
