5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something {{he loved to}} do on the farm), he made the mistake of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E
25|$|The tomb {{is thought}} to have stood until the Byzantine era before falling into ruin. The ruins were rediscovered by British {{traveller}} Charles Fellows in the early 1840s. Fellows had them shipped to the British Museum, where some of them have been reconstructed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> the East façade of the monument would have looked like.|$|E
50|$|Several museums, {{particularly}} open-air museums, move {{historic buildings}} into their surroundings, with some dedicated <b>to</b> <b>showing</b> <b>what</b> {{life was like}} in previous centuries called living history.|$|R

25|$|According to Simplicius, Diogenes the Cynic {{said nothing}} upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but {{stood up and}} walked, in order to {{demonstrate}} the falsity of Zeno's conclusions. To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> {{is wrong with the}} argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.|$|E
25|$|A {{slightly}} different {{edition of the}} fragment of the Thalia from De Synodis is given by G.C. Stead, and served {{as the basis for}} a translation by R.P.C. Hanson. Stead argued that the Thalia was written in anapestic meter, and edited the fragment <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> it would look like in anapests with different line breaks. Hanson based his translation of this fragment directly on Stead's text. Here is Stead's edition with Hanson's translation.|$|E
25|$|Louis XIV {{had promised}} {{to build a new}} church {{dedicated}} to Saint Genevieve, but it had never gotten underway. Louis XV laid the first stone for the new church on 6 September 1764. For the opening, a temporary portico of light materials was erected, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> the church would look like. It was not completed until 1790, {{at the time of the}} French Revolution of 1789, when it became the Panthéon.|$|E

25|$|Seeming {{to be at}} {{the peak}} of his career, he had {{cartilage}} trouble at the start of the 1966 season. He was only able to play in a handful of matches thereafter – just one that season, eight in 1967, none in 1968 and four in 1969 – before being forced to retire. He did enough in his eight matches in 1967 <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> Surrey had been missing, with 300 runs at 37.50 and 18 wickets at 24.55.|$|E
25|$|As of 2009 Krystyna Matyjaszkiewicz was Gallery Exhibitions {{manager for}} Canterbury City Council {{galleries}} and museums service. She {{said that the}} museum aims <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> the Roman city was like, and to reveal the secret city beneath {{the feet of the}} visitor, thereby educating the public to appreciate local history. Each step by which one descends to the Roman pavement represents 100 years-worth of archaeological layers down to the 300 AD layer of the pavement. Ken Reedie has been curator of Canterbury museums since the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The National War Aims Committee {{was set up}} in 1917 {{to focus}} on {{domestic}} propaganda. Caine was recruited for the committee by the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to write the screenplay for the propaganda film Victory and Peace, designed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> would happen in a German invasion. Most of the negative of the newly finished film was destroyed in a fire at the offices of the London Film Company in June 1918. It was re-filmed over four-months, just as the war ended and was never released.|$|E

25|$|In his Medical Nemesis, first {{published}} in 1975, also known as Limits to Medicine, Illich subjected contemporary Western medicine to detailed attack. He argued that the medicalization in recent decades {{of so many of}} life's vicissitudes—birth and death, for example—frequently caused more harm than good and rendered many people in effect lifelong patients. He marshalled a body of statistics <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> he considered the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects and drug-induced illness in advanced industrial society. He introduced to a wider public the notion of iatrogenic disease, which had been scientifically established a century earlier by British nurse Florence Nightingale (1820–1910). Others have since voiced similar views.|$|E
25|$|The city still {{contains}} {{a number of}} mansions from the colonial era, most {{of which have been}} converted into a number of uses. One of these is the La Casa de la Zacatecana (The Zacatecana House) on Independencia 51, which has been restored as a museum <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> many of these mansions were like. Associated with this house as well as others are stories about love, murder and retribution. Another of these houses is the La Casa de la Marquesa (Marquesa House), which was an opulent residence that now serves as a hotel. The courtyard is in the Mudéjar or Spanish Moorish style, with Moorish arches and pattered walls. This area serves as the hotel's lobby.|$|E
25|$|The Painted Chamber is {{furnished}} with reproduction oak furniture <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> {{it looked like}} when new (not dark with age and polish). The painted panelling has a larger design than that the Great Parlour and is less decorative. It was discovered under layers of emulsion paint and thought to date from the 17th century. The room is displayed as the mistress's chamber; a small table by the window obtains the maximum light for sewing. The floorboards have been relaid in a 17th-century manner. In 1609, a floor was laid {{at a cost of}} five shillings and tenpence for seven days' work, as recorded in the account book. The painted panelling creates a three-dimensional effect imitating the grainy effect of wood. The wild 'squiggles' were intended to imitate walnut, a wood becoming more fashionable in the late-17th century. It was expensive so painting was used to imitate it. The paint had a linseed oil base, and feathers and combs were dragged over it to create the grained effect.|$|E
60|$|When {{the drinks}} which {{followed}} the ceremony of initiation {{had all been}} disposed of, {{the business of the}} lodge proceeded. McMurdo, accustomed only to the prosaic performances of Chicago, listened with open ears and more surprise than he ventured <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> followed.|$|R
50|$|In particular, the Court {{held that}} patentee's {{decision}} to narrow claims through amendment {{in order to}} comply with the Patent Act automatically assumes surrender of the territory between the original claim and the amended claim, i.e., a presumption of surrendering all equivalents for the particular claim limitation that was narrowed by the amendment. The Court thus placed the burden on the applicant as <b>to</b> <b>showing</b> <b>what</b> equivalents were not surrendered.|$|R

25|$|The second cell {{is built}} {{on one of the}} sides of the first cell, and each cell {{thereafter}} is built from two adjacent cells so that only four sides of the hexagon need to be constructed. Eggs are laid within the cells once they are constructed. Once the larvae start growing in the cells, workers come around and raise the cell height to keep up with growing larvae; the cell walls keep the larvae safe. Workers will move around the nest looking for cell walls to heighten and inspect the cell with their antennae. A worker will choose a cell wall to raise based on the ratio of cell wall height to the height of the larvae as opposed to the cell height in relation to other cells. Workers add to the cell walls with pulp. Strangely, when workers approach with pulp, the larvae begin stretching, perhaps as a signal <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> cells are in most desperate need of heightening. When heightening walls, the pulp is first laid on the walls and then worked by the worker's mandible to the proper texture and thickness. Once the larvae have matured into adults, the cells are vacated and new eggs are laid. Since a high wall is no longer needed, a worker chews down the wall and uses the extra pulp elsewhere in the nest.|$|E
500|$|Upon the album's {{release in}} January 1970, Malcolm Jones {{was shocked by}} the {{substandard}} musicianship on the Gilmour and Waters-produced songs: [...] "I felt angry. It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind". Gilmour said: [...] "Perhaps we were trying <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> Syd was really like. But perhaps we were trying to punish him". Waters was more positive: [...] "Syd is a genius".|$|E
500|$|Solti {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{conductors}} who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, [...] "Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> he could do." ...|$|E

500|$|McCracken next {{appeared}} on Broadway in the 1953 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Me and Juliet. The choreography was by Robert Alton, {{who had worked}} with McCracken on Good News. The play was meant <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> {{it was like to be}} backstage during the run of a hit Broadway show, and she performed opposite Ray Walston in the [...] "show within a show." [...] Although her performance received good reviews, the play did not, and it did little to help her career.|$|E
500|$|Gerry Anderson {{remembered that}} AP Films had never {{attempted}} to film skiing sequences previously, but judged {{the scenes of}} Penelope and Tin-Tin travelling to Olsen's lodge to be suitably realistic. Anderson himself conceived the [...] "ski thrusters" [...] that the agents use to power their ascent up the mountainside while returning to Paradise Peaks. Praising production designer Bob Bell's visuals, he opined that the episode [...] "gave our art and design departments a chance <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> they could really do, and they didn't let us down." ...|$|E
500|$|Depp {{was deeply}} {{involved}} with the story design, frequently meeting the writers <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>what</b> {{he was interested in}} doing, and in the words of Rossio, being [...] "involved in coming up with story lines, connecting characters, creating moments that we would then fashion, shape and then go back." [...] Among Depp's suggestions were turning Phillip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists. Afterwards, Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot, and did alterations of their own, including building the female lead.|$|E

50|$|In Bisei one {{can visit}} the famous astronomical observatory, known as Bisei Tenmondai, as well as Chuusei Yume-ga-Hara, a sort of themepark devoted <b>to</b> <b>showing</b> <b>what</b> a typical Medieval Japanese {{mountain}} village looked like. There you can enjoy making traditional crafts such as indigo dying, Shakuhachi (Japanese flute), and various children's games. Tenmondai and Yume-ga-Hara are conveniently located next to one another. Bisei {{takes its name from}} the stars (Bisei means Beautiful Stars).|$|R
