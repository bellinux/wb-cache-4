5|$|Although female life {{expectancy}} in Byzantium {{was lower than}} that of men, due to death in childbirth, wars and the fact that men married younger, female widowhood was still fairly common.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of criticism against using a Shabbat elevator. First, even in Shabbat mode, the user is indirectly violating Shabbat. Second, {{even if it is}} altogether permitted, a healthy person should not resort <b>to</b> <b>circumventing</b> the laws of Shabbat by performing an otherwise prohibited activity in a technically permissible manner. Finally, they are inefficient due to their continuous energy usage.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{aforementioned}} anti-cheating protocols, some participants {{felt that this}} was merely a display without effect.

5|$|The Order of the Pug The Order of the Pug, or Mops-Orden, is {{believed}} to have been founded in Bavaria in about 1740, <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> the Papal ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons.

5|$|Thus, most {{einsteinium}} {{samples are}} contaminated, and their intrinsic properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time.

5|$|After {{serving as}} the most {{influential}} policymaking body of the dynasty {{for more than a}} century, the Deliberative Council was displaced and then made obsolete by the more ethnically mixed Grand Council, which the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735) created in the late 1720s <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> the influence of the deliberative princes and ministers. The Deliberative Council was formally abolished in 1792.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E
50|$|Sociolismo is the {{informal}} term used in Cuba {{to describe the}} reciprocal exchange of favors by individuals, usually relating <b>to</b> <b>circumventing</b> bureaucratic restrictions or obtaining hard-to-find goods.

In addition <b>to</b> <b>circumventing</b> regional lockout and copy protection mechanisms, modern modchips may introduce more sophisticated modifications to the system, such as allowing the use of user-created software (homebrew), expanding the hardware capabilities of its host system, or even installing an alternative operating system to completely re-purpose the host system (e.g. for use as a home theater PC).|$|R

5|$|Each {{character}} {{has their own}} unique abilities. Verne has the strength to push and carry large items and can retract into his shell {{in order to avoid}} detection, but cannot jump as high or run as swift as the other characters. RJ has average strength and agility. He can climb, lift items and also throw Verne. Hammy is the most agile of the three, running swifter and jumping higher. This enables him <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> security more easily.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rapid}} secessions of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, Congress began {{preparing}} {{the nation for}} war, including by strengthening the army and navy and raising funds for the treasury.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether set-based items affected IRT model-data fit. We also evaluated fit after combining dependent items into composites {{and treating}} them as polytomous items.

Model fit improved when we analyzed the data using composites. Our findings suggest that conducting IRT analyses on composites provides a viable approach <b>to</b> <b>circumventing</b> problems of local dependence for set-based items...|$|R

50|$|In theory, it is {{possible}} to bypass all these measures by constructing a player that creates a copy of every frame and sound it plays. Although this is not within the capability of most people, many bootleggers simply record the video being displayed with a video camera or use recording and playing devices that are not designed to use the protection measures. In fact, the Motion Picture Association of America has recommended use of a camcorder as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>circumventing</b> the Content Scrambling System on DVDs.|$|R

5|$|The {{album was}} the idea of Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager. Parker wished to release an Elvis Presley album through Boxcar Records—a company that he formed to manage Presley's {{commercial}} rights, so that he could profit directly from it. However, since Presley was signed to RCA Records, any recordings made would legally belong to RCA. <b>To</b> <b>circumvent</b> this restriction, Parker compiled audio of Presley talking—material over which RCA could not claim rights.|$|E
5|$|The bay {{serves as}} a nursery for shrimp and as an {{ecosystem}} for diverse species of birds and fish. Shrimp farms have been established inland <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> restrictions on the bay. The area close to shore is prone to flooding, and can sometimes accumulate large populations of mosquitos. As a consequence, no major settlements have been founded on the bay. However, the small communities of Port Alto and Carancahua have been established on the western and eastern shores, respectively.|$|E
5|$|A scheme <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> the settler grants {{altogether}} soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter {{to round}} up people from Portland saloons, and then {{take them to the}} land office where they would register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
