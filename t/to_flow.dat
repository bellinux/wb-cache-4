5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|ATP synthase {{releases}} this {{stored energy}} by completing the circuit and allowing protons <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> down the electrochemical gradient, {{back to the}} N-side of the membrane. The electrochemical gradient drives the rotation of part of the enzyme's structure and couples this motion to the synthesis of ATP.|$|E
5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making {{the reading of the}} clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E

40|$|Consider a space M {{endowed with}} two or more Lie group actions. Under a certain {{condition}} on the orbits of the Lie group actions, we show how <b>to</b> construct a <b>flow</b> on M that projects <b>to</b> prescribed <b>flows</b> on the orbit spaces of the group actions. Hence, in order <b>to</b> design a <b>flow</b> that converges <b>to</b> the intersection of given orbits, it suffices <b>to</b> design <b>flows</b> on the various orbit spaces that display convergence to the desired orbits, and then <b>to</b> lift these <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> M using the proposed procedure. We illustrate the technique by creating a flow for principal component analysis. The <b>flow</b> projects <b>to</b> a <b>flow</b> on the Grassmann manifold that achieves principal subspace analysis and <b>to</b> a <b>flow</b> on the "shape" manifold that converges to the set of orthonormal matrices...|$|R
40|$|Optimal co-ordinates were {{introduced}} by Kaplun (1954) {{as a result}} of his study on the role of co-ordinate systems in boundary-layer theory. In this paper the basic ideas of optimal co-ordinates are examined and many restrictions of Kaplun's optimal co-ordinates are removed. His rule for constructing optimal co-ordinates is found to apply unaltered <b>to</b> axisymmetric <b>flows,</b> <b>to</b> <b>flows</b> with oncoming streams containing vorticity, to free boundary layers such as jets, <b>to</b> free-convection <b>flows</b> and <b>to</b> compressible <b>flows.</b> It is also extended to unsteady boundary layers, and to three-dimensional boundary layers using a pair of stream functions...|$|R
5|$|Anne was crowned on St George's Day, 23 April 1702. Afflicted with gout, she {{was carried}} to Westminster Abbey {{in an open}} sedan chair, with a low back to permit her train <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> out behind her. On 4 May, England became embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which England, Austria and the Dutch Republic fought against France and Spain. Charles II of Spain had died childless in 1700, and the {{succession}} was disputed by two claimants: the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria and the Bourbon Philip, Duke of Anjou.|$|E
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Between one of Stafford Meadow Brook's {{reservoirs}} {{and southern}} Scranton, the watershed {{of the stream}} is glacially deformed. At a saddle in this reach, the stream was once able <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> through Rocky Glen into Spring Brook during high flow conditions. There is an inner ridge between the gorge of Stafford Meadow Brook and that or Roaring Brook.|$|E
40|$|FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the MENA {{region have}} been disappointing {{relative}} to other developing countries. Using fixed effects panel regressions, this paper investigates whether the determinants of FDI affect MENA countries differently. The results indicate {{that some of the}} variables that influence FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> developing countries are not important for <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> MENA countries. These include the rate of return on investment, infrastructures, economic growth, and inflation. While trade openness increases FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> MENA countries, corruption/bureaucratic red tape were found <b>to</b> reduce <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the region. Thus, trade liberalization and privatization are important preconditions for FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the region...|$|R

5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it.

5|$|Flower was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor <b>to</b> <b>Flow.</b> Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to the 2011–17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was turned off in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason {{it had not been}} reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> again was approximately US$500,000.|$|E
