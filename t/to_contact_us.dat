2500|$|Although Fermi's name is most {{commonly}} associated with the paradox, {{he was not the}} first to ask the question. An earlier implicit mention was by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in an unpublished manuscript from 1933. He noted [...] "people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe" [...] because [...] "(i) if such beings exist they would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed then they would have given us some sign of their existence." [...] This was not a paradox for others, who took this to imply the absence of ETs, but it was for him, since he himself was a strong believer in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel. [...] Therefore, he proposed what is now known as the zoo hypothesis and speculated that mankind is not yet ready for higher beings <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> <b>us.</b> That Tsiolkovsky himself {{may not have been the}} first to discover the paradox is suggested by his above-mentioned reference to other people's reasons for denying the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.|$|E
