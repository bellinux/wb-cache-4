5|$|Development {{continued}} {{with a more}} experimental ethos until the company began {{to run out of}} capital. The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher <b>Trapdoor</b> offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. <b>Trapdoor</b> assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E
5|$|In Quinnimont, West Virginia, {{a team of}} {{soldiers}} arrives at an abandoned leprosy research compound, rounding {{up most of the}} patients. One patient, Escalante, hides beneath a <b>trapdoor</b> during the arrival and follows the group to a secluded field nearby. He watches as the soldiers shoot the other patients, including apparent alien-human hybrids, into a mass grave.|$|E
5|$|Polytron later ran out {{of money}} and {{was on the verge of}} folding when the company's Québécois neighbor, developer-producer <b>Trapdoor,</b> offered to help Polytron without {{transferring}} its intellectual property rights. According to Fish, the partnership saved Fez. The game was delayed several times over the next few years for which it received some notoriety.|$|E
5|$|Fez (stylized as FEZ) is an indie puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Polytron Corporation {{and published by}} <b>Trapdoor.</b> The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world {{to be one of}} four sides of a three-dimensional (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments to restore order to the universe.|$|E
5|$|Fish and Shawn McGrath {{collaborated on}} a puzzle game that became Fez. When McGrath left the project due to {{creative}} differences, Fish, the game's artist, pursued a platform game direction with Renaud Bédard, the game's programmer, {{who wrote the}} game's level editor and game engine from scratch. Levels were built in 3D by extruding surfaces with Photoshop-created textures. Bédard and Fish were joined by three different animators and other collaborators. The game was first announced in June 2007 and won an award at the 2008 Independent Games Festival and entered the public spotlight. Fish created a studio, Polytron Corporation, and was later aided by nearby developer-publisher <b>Trapdoor</b> when Polytron ran out of money. Fez won several more prerelease awards, including the 2012 Seumas McNally Grand Prize.|$|E
5|$|In Apison, Tennessee, {{authorities}} {{receive a}} tip from someone named Sidney alleging child abuse and weapons possession by a local cult called the Temple of the Seven Stars. The FBI and BATF stage a raid on the Temple's compound, but are unable to find its leader, Vernon Ephesian (Michael Massee). Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) experiences déjà vu and walks into a field on the compound, where he finds a <b>trapdoor.</b> Inside, Mulder and Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) find Ephesian preparing to drink a red liquid with his six wives. Mulder stops them and handcuffs Ephesian, but he feels a strange connection {{to one of the}} wives, Melissa Riedal-Ephesian (Kristen Cloke).|$|E
5|$|On the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan {{with the}} anti-virus. However, the Licker is hiding {{on the train}} and attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. In the ensuing battle, Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is {{attacked}} by a now-zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, causing her head to hit a <b>trapdoor</b> button, opening it and dropping the Licker under the train which ultimately kills it for good. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open {{and a group of}} Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the Nemesis Program.|$|E
5|$|The voice {{once again}} speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must {{be cut off}} from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still {{questions}} her devotion, and tells her to sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife {{from the kitchen and}} walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a <b>trapdoor</b> hidden under his rug and jumps in, just before his mother opens his bedroom door. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which becomes the title screen.|$|E
5|$|A beggar woman {{enters the}} shop {{in search of}} Bamford, and Johanna hides in the trunk. The woman recognizes Todd, but upon hearing Turpin coming, Todd kills her and sends her through a <b>trapdoor</b> in the floor. As Turpin enters, Todd {{explains}} that Johanna had repented and is coming to him, then offers a free shave in the meantime. When Turpin finally recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker, Todd stabs him several times, cuts his throat and sends his body down a trap door to the bakehouse, killing him. Johanna comes out of her hiding place, still in disguise, and Todd prepares to kill her as well, not recognizing her as his daughter. However, hearing Mrs. Lovett scream in horror in the basement after discovering Turpin's body, Todd lets Johanna go.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a <b>trapdoor.</b> Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|The main centre for {{administration}} {{was at the}} entrance to the prison, which included the warden's office. The office contained a desk with radio and telegraph equipment, typewriter, and a telephone. The administrative office section also had the offices of the associate warden and secretary, mail desk, captain's desk, a business office, a clerk's office, an accounting office, a control room which was added with modern technology in 1961, the officer's lounge, armory and vault, and a visitation centre and restrooms. The basement of Alcatraz prison contained dungeons and the showers. The main stairway to the dungeon lay along Sunrise Alley at the side of A-Block, but the dungeons were also accessible by a staircase in a <b>trapdoor</b> along the corridor of D-Block. All visits to Alcatraz required prior written approval from the warden.|$|E
5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including <b>trapdoor</b> spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E
5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries {{to figure out what to}} do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the <b>trapdoor.</b> After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>trapdoor</b> to {{the cellar}} mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty {{go down to}} {{investigate}} and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recorder belonging to the archaeologist who owned it. When Scotty plays it, the archaeologist's voice recites a series of incantations, resurrecting a mysterious, demonic entity. Cheryl becomes increasingly hysterical and locks herself in her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. Meanwhile, Ash gives Linda a silver necklace, which she absolutely loves. Cheryl is then attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. Unable to convince the others of what happened, she asks Ash to take her into town for the night. However, Ash soon discovers that the bridge has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape, learning {{that the only way}} to kill the entity is to dismember it when it possesses a host. Cheryl succumbs to the entity and attacks the others, stabbing Linda in the ankle with a pencil before Scotty is able to force her into the cellar.|$|E
25|$|Ctenizidae is {{a family}} of {{medium-sized}} mygalomorph spiders that construct burrows with a cork-like <b>trapdoor</b> made of soil, vegetation and silk. They may be called <b>trapdoor</b> spiders, as are similar species, {{such as those of}} the families Liphistiidae, Barychelidae, Cyrtaucheniidae and some species in Idiopidae and Nemesiidae. Some Conothele species do not build a burrow, but construct a silken tube with <b>trapdoor</b> in bark crevices.|$|E
25|$|Blunt {{enters the}} bedroom and undresses to his shirt and drawers. Lucetta tells him to turn out the light. When the room is dark, the bed vanishes (with Lucetta) using a <b>trapdoor</b> system. Blunt stumbles around and then falls through another <b>trapdoor.</b> Lucetta, her servant, and her pimp enter and steal Blunt's money.|$|E
25|$|A giant three-headed dog named Fluffy placed {{specially}} {{to guard}} the <b>trapdoor</b> by Hagrid.|$|E
25|$|The Spider Wasps of the {{subfamily}} Ctenocerinae {{found in}} the Neotropics, Africa and Australia are specialised hunters of <b>trapdoor</b> spiders.|$|E
25|$|A <b>trapdoor</b> is a {{door that}} is {{oriented}} horizontally in a ceiling or floor, often accessed via a ladder.|$|E
25|$|Accessed by {{entering}} a <b>trapdoor</b> in the forbidden corridor {{on the third}} floor, and protected by a gauntlet of seven magical challenges {{set up by the}} teachers.|$|E
25|$|The Angelina Jolie <b>trapdoor</b> spider (Aptostichus angelinajolieae, often misspelled angelinajoleae) is {{a species}} of Euctenizidae, nocturnal {{arthropods}} who seize their prey after leaping out of their burrows and inject it with venom. It was described by the Auburn University professor Jason Bond in 2008, who named it after the American actress Angelina Jolie in recognition of her work on the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. It {{was one of only}} seven described species of Aptostichus until 2012, when it was joined by Bono's Joshua Tree <b>trapdoor</b> spider and 32 other species.|$|E
25|$|A hungry {{individual}} will wait halfway outside its burrow for a meal. Male <b>trapdoor</b> spiders can overcome the female's aggressive reactions to their approach, {{but it is}} not known how. Females never travel far from their burrows, especially if they have an egg sac. During this time, the female will capture food and regurgitate it to feed her spiderlings. Enemies of the <b>trapdoor</b> spider include certain pompilids (spider wasps), which seek out the burrows and manage to gain entrance. They sting the owner and lay their eggs (usually one per spider) on its body. When the egg hatches, the larva devours the spider alive.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being widespread and abundant in its range, the Angelina Jolie <b>trapdoor</b> spider flourishes in moderately developed residential areas. Therefore, {{in terms of its}} conservation status, it is not considered to be a threatened species.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{funicular}} {{that connects}} the basilica with {{the base of the}} cross. There is a spiral staircase and a lift inside the cross, connecting the top of the basilica dome to a <b>trapdoor</b> on top of the cross, but their use is restricted to maintenance staff.|$|E
25|$|Many of her MGM films, such as Million Dollar Mermaid and Jupiter's Darling, {{contained}} elaborately staged {{synchronized swimming}} scenes, with considerable risk to Williams. She broke her neck filming a 115ft dive off a tower during a climactic musical {{number for the}} film Million Dollar Mermaid and was in a body cast for seven months. She subsequently recovered, although she continued to suffer headaches {{as a result of}} the accident. Her many hours spent submerged in a studio tank resulted in ruptured eardrums numerous times. She also nearly drowned after not being able to find the <b>trapdoor</b> in the ceiling of a tank. The walls and ceiling were painted black and the <b>trapdoor</b> blended in. Williams was pulled out only because a member of the crew realized the door was not opening.|$|E
25|$|Expansion ports {{are limited}} to a side {{expansion}} port and a <b>trapdoor</b> expansion {{on the underside of}} the machine. The casing can also be opened up (voiding the warranty), all larger chips are socketed rather than being TH/SMD soldered directly to the motherboard, so they can be replaced by hand.|$|E
25|$|Judy begs Scottie {{to forgive}} her, because she loves him. He embraces her, but a shadowed figure {{rises from the}} <b>trapdoor</b> of the tower, startling Judy, who steps {{backward}} and falls to her death. Scottie, bereft again, stands on the ledge, while the figure, a nun investigating the noise, rings the mission bell.|$|E
25|$|Very thin {{strands of}} albumen could be soft and fine {{enough to allow}} the <b>trapdoor</b> to close completely; these would not be drawn in any further unless the trigger hairs were indeed stimulated again. On the other hand, a human hair, finer still but {{relatively}} hard and unyielding, could prevent a seal being formed; these would prevent the trap from resetting at all due to leakage of water.|$|E
25|$|The tomb of Philippe D'Aubigny (Philip Daubeny, d. 1236)—a knight, tutor, and royal {{councilor}} to King Henry III of England and signer of the Magna Carta—one {{of the few}} tombs of crusaders {{and other}} Europeans not removed from the Church after the Muslim recapture of Jerusalem in the 12th century, sheltered by a wooden <b>trapdoor</b> in the parvise. A stone marker was placed on his tomb in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Fluffy {{is a giant}} three-headed dog {{provided}} by Hagrid to guard the <b>trapdoor</b> leading to the underground chamber where the Philosopher's Stone was hidden {{until the end of}} Philosopher's Stone. The only known way to get past Fluffy is to lull him to sleep by playing music. Fluffy is based on Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Greek mythology that guards the gates to the underworld. As with Fluffy, Cerberus was lulled to sleep with music by Orpheus.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} Callum's hanging, he {{asks his}} guard, Jack, to deliver a letter to Sephy personally. Callum is then led to the gallows. He fails to find Sephy in the crowd before the hood is put on. He then hears Sephy {{shouting}}, 'I love you'. He shouts back, 'I love you too'. Sephy watches the <b>trapdoor</b> open and sees Callum's limp, lifeless body hanging from the noose. She hears Callum shouting to her but is unsure if she heard the word 'too' so she cannot be sure that Callum heard her.|$|E
25|$|After he {{finished}} reading his poem, a black hood was {{placed over the}} smiling Guiteau's head and moments later the gallows <b>trapdoor</b> was sprung, the rope breaking his neck instantly with the fall. Guiteau's body was not returned to his family, as {{they were unable to}} afford a private funeral, but was instead autopsied and buried {{in a corner of the}} jailyard. Upon his autopsy it was discovered that Guiteau had the condition known as phimosis, an inability to retract the foreskin, which at the time was thought to have caused insanity that led him to assassinate Garfield.|$|E
25|$|Extending {{outwards}} {{from the}} bottom of the <b>trapdoor</b> are several long bristle-stiff protuberances that are sometimes referred to as trigger hairs or antennae but which have no similarity to the sensitive triggers found in Dionaea and Aldrovanda. In fact, these bristles are simply levers. The suction force exerted by the primed bladder on the door is resisted by the adhesion of its flexible bottom against the soft-sealing velum. The equilibrium depends quite literally on a hair trigger, and the slightest touch to one of the lever hairs will deform the flexible door lip enough to create a tiny gap, breaking the seal.|$|E
25|$|Carter is {{rescued by}} {{friendly}} ghouls, amongst them Richard Pickman, {{a friend of}} Carter's, the protagonist of another of Lovecraft's stories, Pickman's Model and who is now also a ghoul, who agree to return him to the upper Dreamlands. They {{make their way to}} the terrible city of the gugs to reach the Tower of Koth, wherein a winding stairway leads to the surface. Finding the city asleep, Carter and the ghouls attempt to sneak past the snoring gugs. The ghasts, the gugs' traditional enemies, begin an attack, but the group manages to ascend the stairway and open the great <b>trapdoor</b> to the Enchanted Wood.|$|E
25|$|Although many real dungeons {{are simply}} a single plain {{room with a}} heavy door or with access only from a {{hatchway}} or <b>trapdoor</b> in {{the floor of the}} room above, the use of dungeons for torture, along with their association to common human fears of being trapped underground, have made dungeons a powerful metaphor in a variety of contexts. Dungeons, in the plural, have come to be associated with underground complexes of cells and torture chambers. As a result, the number of true dungeons in castles is often exaggerated to interest tourists. Many chambers described as dungeons or oubliettes were in fact storerooms, water-cisterns or even latrines.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1998, Bischoff {{recruited}} The Ultimate Warrior, {{a former}} WWF star, to feud with Hogan (to {{capitalize on the}} Hogan/Warrior match at WrestleMania VI). Their October 1998 rematch at Halloween Havoc was considered {{as one of the}} worst matches in pay-per-view history, and, although the feud between Warrior and Hogan leading up to the match was initially well received, interest soon dissipated after several convoluted and unrealistic segments involving the two were aired on WCW programming. Warrior also insisted on elaborate and costly apparatuses, such as a <b>trapdoor</b> in the ring which badly injured The British Bulldog when he landed on it awkwardly earlier in the event. Warrior would vanish from WCW shortly afterwards.|$|E
