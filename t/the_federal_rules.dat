This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Civil Procedure.|$|E
5|$|When {{used in a}} {{court of}} law digital {{evidence}} falls under the same legal guidelines as other forms of evidence; courts do not usually require more stringent guidelines.

25|$|Garner {{has contributed}} to the field of {{procedural}} rules. From 1992 to 1994, he revised all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules—Civil, Appellate, Evidence, Bankruptcy, and Criminal—for the United States Judicial Conference. In the mid-1990s, he restyled <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Appellate Procedure and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Criminal Procedure, which were adopted by the Judicial Conference, then by the United States Supreme Court, and enacted by Congress. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Civil Procedure were restyled in 1993–1994 and adopted on December 1, 2007. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts has printed and distributed Garner's booklet Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court Rules (1st ed. 1996, 5th ed. 2007). Garner has revised the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Judicial Council Rules, the Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and the Rules on Judicial-Conduct and Disability Proceedings (for federal courts). In 2015, after a 15-year hiatus, he returned as a style consultant to the U.S. Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.|$|E

25|$|Examples {{of common}} law being {{replaced}} by statute or codified rule in the United States include criminal law (since 1812, U.S. federal courts and most {{but not all of}} the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), commercial law (the Uniform Commercial Code in the early 1960s) and procedure (<b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Civil Procedure in the 1930s and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Evidence in the 1970s).

25|$|There are {{two other}} common misconceptions {{concerning}} the hearsay rule. The first is that hearsay applies only to oral statements. The hearsay rule applies to all out-of-court statements whether oral, written or otherwise. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Evidence defines a statement as an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct of a person, if the conduct is intended by the person as an assertion. Even written documents made under oath, such as affidavits or notarized statements, {{are subject to the}} 'hearsay rule'.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{cases and}} some states follow Federal Rule 27 (a) (3) of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Civil Procedure {{concerning}} {{the production of}} documents in pretrial discovery, including those pertaining to depositions.

On December 26, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed Schiff's convictions except for the criminal contempt convictions.

40|$|Medical records {{contain some}} of the most {{intimate}} details about an individual that {{can be found in a}} single place. Health information privacy is based on the principle that individuals should be able to exercise control over this intimate information, both by having full knowledge about what information is contained in the records and by being able to control who has access to the information. Because professional ethical requirements do not adequately protect health information in today 2 ̆ 7 s complex health care system, we have increasingly turned to the law as a source of protection. Until the recent promulgation of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Health Privacy <b>Rule,</b> states have been the primary regulators of health information through their constitutions, common law, and statutory provisions. Although all three of these legal sources remain important, recent focus has been on the enactment of detailed health privacy statutes that apply the fair information practice principles to health information. However, for the most part states have adopted these principles in a fairly haphazard fashion resulting in a patchwork of legal protections both within and between states. <b>The</b> recently issued <b>Federal</b> Health Privacy <b>Rule</b> has effectively evened out some of this discrepancy by establishing a federal floor of privacy protections based on fair information practices. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule,</b> however, does not afford adequate protection of health information because it has limited applicability and areas of lax protection. Because <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule</b> only preempts conflicting, less protective state laws, there is still room for states to protect their own citizens by retaining or enacting health privacy protections that mirror and improve upon those in <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Health Privacy <b>Rule...</b>|$|R
