Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is <b>transmitted</b> through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores can be <b>transmitted</b> in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms {{that can cause}} spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily <b>transmitted</b> to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a 2 -dimensional water-filling (2 D-WF) based <b>transmit</b> {{weight that}} maximizes the channel {{capacity}} is theoretically derived for the downlink <b>transmit</b> diversity of single-carrier {{distributed antenna network}} (SC DAN) in a frequency-selective channel. The 2 D-WF <b>transmit</b> weight allocates the <b>transmit</b> power in both <b>transmit</b> antenna dimension and frequency dimension: power allocation across frequencies based on WF theory and across <b>transmit</b> antennas based on maximal ratio transmission (MRT). The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the achievable channel capacity by 2 D-WF <b>transmit</b> diversity is evaluated by the Monte-Carlo numerical computation method. Channel capacities achievable with 2 D-WF, MRT, and 1 D WF <b>transmit</b> weight are compared. It is shown that the 2 D-WF <b>transmit</b> weight provides the highest channel capacity among three <b>transmit</b> weights.

30|$|Each UE’s <b>transmit</b> {{power can}} be regulated. However, the <b>transmit</b> powers have not been {{calibrated}} as the experimental setup {{does not allow for}} such a measurement. Nevertheless, we can change the <b>transmit</b> power of the UEs by switching between predefined power amplifier (PA) <b>transmit</b> power settings, which are denoted by values from − 4 dB to − 32 dB. The PA <b>transmit</b> power setting of − 4 dB addresses the highest <b>transmit</b> power possible and equals approximately a total <b>transmit</b> power of 23 dBm at a bandwidth of 30 PRBs. Since a PA <b>transmit</b> power setting ensures a constant <b>transmit</b> power density over the complete bandwidth that is allocated, the total UE <b>transmit</b> power changes when changing the bandwidth of the UE. In order to decrease the receive power of UE 0 even more than it is possible with the <b>transmit</b> power, we add a fixed 20 dB attenuator for this UE’s UL transmission (see Fig. 2).|$|R

Additionally, we show that the FDD <b>transmit</b> matched filter is a type of Eigenbeamforming. The simulation results reveal the excellent performance of the two FDD <b>transmit</b> filters.
