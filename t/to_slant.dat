According to Sinclair, Hearst's newspapers distorted world events and deliberately tried to discredit Socialists. Another critic, Ferdinand Lundberg, extended the criticism in Imperial Hearst (1936), charging that Hearst papers accepted payments from abroad <b>to</b> <b>slant</b> the news. After the war, a further critic, George Seldes, repeated the charges in Facts and Fascism (1947).|$|E

Then the CMG control program will command the gimbal motors of the CMGs <b>to</b> <b>slant</b> the rotors' spin axes gradually more and more forward, so that the angular momentum vectors of the rotors point more nearly along the forward axis. While this gradual change in rotor spin direction is in progress, the rotors will be creating gyroscopic torques whose resultant is anticlockwise about the forward axis, holding the spacecraft steady against the unwanted waste gas torque.|$|E

[...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media called the synthesizer [...] "sinister" [...] and, according <b>to</b> <b>Slant</b> Magazine's Eric Henderson, it has Middle Eastern tones.

[...] According <b>to</b> <b>Slant</b> Magazines Barry Walsh, Fleetwood Mac drew on romantic dysfunction and personal turmoil to create a timeless, five-star record, while Andy Gill of The Independent claimed it [...] "represents, along with The Eagles Greatest Hits, the high-water mark of America's Seventies rock-culture expansion, the quintessence of a counter-cultural mindset lured into coke-fuelled hedonism".

500|$|... "Love On Top" [...] is an up-tempo R song {{viewed as}} a modern take on old school music.

According <b>to</b> <b>Slant</b> Magazine Eric Henderson, [...] "Love On Top" [...] is a [...] "bright, breezy tribute to the freshness of mid-80s, pre-new-jack-FM R reminiscent of Whitney Houston and Anita Baker." [...] He also noted the song to be the [...] "perfect and totally inverted fraternal twin" [...] of another song on 4, being [...] "Rather Die Young". [...] "Love on Top"s retro elements are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a [...] "distorted" [...] bass groove, and a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies, especially in the bridge and the chorus of the song.

Rosenberg compared the character to actress Marilyn Monroe's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk in the film Some Like it Hot (1959). Susie's lack of singing experience is balanced by an [...] "ineffable vocal quality that causes people to listen, because they might be missing something." [...] Steve Vineberg, writing in the journal Film Quarterly, agreed that, despite her unimpressive voice, Susie [...] "wears a lyric tight to her skin, liked a zipped-up sleeping bag." [...] According to Télérama's Guillemette Odicino, the character has been [...] "endowed with a voice and a charm to take the breath." [...] Susie remains a heavily guarded individual until she performs [...] "Makin' Whoopee", which finally allows her to lower her defenses. When Susie performs the song, she is – for the first time – not singing to the audience, but to her sole accompanist Jack instead. According <b>to</b> <b>Slant</b> film critic Chuck Bowen, [...] "When Susie sings 'Makin' Whoopee' in a traffic-stopping red dress, mounting Jack's piano as if it's an extension of his very essence... all bets of detached, business-collaborative stability between the two are understood to be off." [...] Bowen also compared the character's performance to actress Rita Hayworth's in the film Gilda (1946). Prior to this moment, it almost appears as though a romantic relationship might never actually develop between the two characters.
