5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast late on July 10. The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70miles (110km) east of Eleuthera. Initially <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> predicted to execute a clockwise loop and drift to the west {{in response to a}} high pressure system. Several models indicated the possibility of the storm to drift westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August28 and entered into the Atlantic Ocean. Initially, the wave had moderate amounts of deep convection and was already well organized, which allowed it to quickly become a tropical cyclone. Based on ship reports, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Ten beginning at 1200UTC on August30. Located 1,000miles (1,609km) southeast of Tropical Storm Felix, the depression tracked westward as a high pressure ridge formed between the two storms. Satellite imagery showed the depression developing a good outflow pattern. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gabrielle on August31. It was noted that by as early as 1200UTC later that day, Gabrielle was already rather large and well-defined. Gabrielle continued to move westward at 17mph (27km/h), and by early on September1, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> upgraded to a hurricane. However, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> not operationally upgraded to a hurricane until late on September2; Gabrielle was then located about 625miles (1006km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E
