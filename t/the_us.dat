5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the United States, Georgia geology has been included in maps produced for the entire country. The first geological map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. The results of his unaided endeavor were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, together with the nation's first geological map, which were published in the Society's journal Transactions, This precedes William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although Smith's map was constructed using a different classification of rocks. Several reports used Maclure’s geological map to accompany their description of the geology of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> (Beaujour, 1814 and Marcou, 1858). In 1816, within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology, Parker Cleaveland produced a geological map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> In 1843, Charles Moxon produced a small-scale geologic map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.,</b> where Ami Boué produced a geological structure map of the globe. In 1853, Marcou produced a geological map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> and the British provinces of North America. In 1856, Henry Darwin Rogers created a similar map of the geology of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> and British North America. There was a short description of the geologic map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> by Charles Henry Hitchcock in 1872, which had small-scale geological maps included. Hitchcock and William P. Blake published a general geologic map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> in R.W. Raymond’s Statistics of mines and mining. In 1874, they published a geological map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> and territories in <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> Census 9th Statistical Atlas. Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this map in the Geological Magazine in 1873. Gray’s geological map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers. A geological map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1inch to 105.5 miles by Frank H. Bradley. In the 1880s several geological maps of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> were produced. William John McGee offered a detailed description for <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> Geological Survey in 1884. In 1887, Hitchcock produced a geological map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> that accompanied the geological map of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> In 1895, McGee and J.B. Tolbert produced a 1:15,000,000 scale map of the geology of <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b>|$|E
