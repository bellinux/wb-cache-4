5|$|The IJN {{continued}} to suffer losses and damage to its ships {{in attempting to}} keep the Japanese on Guadalcanal resupplied. One destroyer was sunk by American warships at the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November. Another destroyer plus a submarine were sunk and two destroyers damaged by American PT boat and CAF air attacks during subsequent resupply missions from 3–12 December. Compounding the navy's frustration, {{very few of the}} supplies carried on these missions actually reached Japanese army forces on the island. Combined Fleet leaders began <b>telling</b> <b>their</b> army counterparts the losses and damage to warships engaged in the resupply effort threatened future strategic plans for protecting the Japanese Empire.|$|E

25|$|The law was so rigorously pro-slavery as to {{prohibit}} {{the admission of}} the testimony of a person accused of being an escaped slave into evidence at the judicial hearing to determine {{the status of the}} accused escaped slave.

25|$|In America, {{not only}} do U.S. {{students}} receive sex education within school or religious programs, {{but they are also}} educated by their parents.

They promote abstinence while educating their children with things that may make their adolescents not want to engage in sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|During 1909 and 1910 {{there were}} {{movements}} by Young Turks supporters {{to adopt an}} Arabic alphabet, as they considered the Latin script to be un-Islamic.

In 1911, the Young Turks dropped {{their opposition to the}} Latin script; finally, the Latin Bashkimi alphabet was adopted, and is still in use today.|$|E

The fight was believed to stem from the idea that Batista considered himself {{to be better than}} the rest of the roster due to his main event status and relatively quick climb to achieve it. It was said that wrestlers backstage were praising Booker for speaking his mind to Batista about his attitude.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Charles de Gaulle {{government}} {{cleaned up}} the French Penal Code, principally getting rid of the anti-Semitic laws. The article against homosexual relations between adults and minors, however, remained in force until 1982. The homophobic atmosphere of the 1940s-1960s meant that for the returning victims, the possibility of <b>telling</b> <b>their</b> story was thwarted by the fear of further stigmatisation. In his book, Seel also notes an increase of homophobic attacks in Mulhouse, after the war. In his family itself, Seel found a negative reaction to his homosexuality. His closest relatives decided to avoid broaching the subject while other members of the extended family made humiliating jokes. His godfather disinherited him.|$|E

Without <b>telling</b> <b>their</b> father, Spedan took out a bank loan and bought out Oswald's inheritance. After going round the world, Oswald embarked on a political career, becoming Conservative Party MP for Colchester in 1929, and holding the seat until 1945. John Lewis died aged 92 in 1928, and Spedan Lewis became sole owner of the Oxford Street business, in addition to Peter Jones. That same year, he bought the premises of T J Harries on the eastern side of Holles Street in Oxford Street, into which he expanded John Lewis.|$|E

After school, T.J. runs to the Wallace store, which the Logans forbid their children from visiting due to the Wallaces causing much of the black people's troubles. Stacey follows T.J. and the others follow Stacey. Mr. Morrison finds them fighting and separates them, much to the Wallace's anger. Instead of <b>telling</b> <b>their</b> mother, Morrison leaves Stacey to do it himself. Stacey tells her and she takes the children to visit the Berrys. Mr. Berry is badly burned, gruesomely disfigured and mute. Mama explains that the Wallaces are responsible for this and that is why they are never to go near Wallace's store again.|$|E
25|$|On July 20, 2003, the spam {{filtering}} organization Spam Prevention Early Warning System (SPEWS) {{added an}} entire class-B subnet with the Cogent ISP to their spammer list, since Cogent was hosting a known spammer that SPEWS found difficult to block. Something Awful {{was added to}} the list in the process, disrupting its ability to communicate with its customers who were using SPEWS. Upon appeal, SPEWS initially refused to delist SA. The Something Awful administrators responded by <b>telling</b> <b>their</b> users to post their support in the Usenet newsgroup news.admin.net-abuse.blocklisting. However, that group and news.admin.net-abuse.email were flooded with off-topic posts and trolls from Something Awful users, incensing SPEWS advocates. The SA administrators claimed that SPEWS was attempting to hack the Something Awful server. Forum users responded by threatening to perform a distributed denial of service attack on SPEWS, although this type of behavior was strongly discouraged by Kyanka and assistant editor Zack Parsons.|$|E
25|$|The Home Guard was immortalised in the British {{television}} comedy Dad's Army (1968–1977), {{which followed}} {{the formation and}} running of a platoon in the fictional south coast town of Walmington-on-Sea, and {{is widely regarded as}} having kept the efforts of the Home Guard in the public consciousness. Dad's Army is a BBC television sitcom about the British Home Guard during the Second World War. It was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft and broadcast on BBC television from 1968 to 1977. The sitcom ran for 9 series and 80 episodes in total, plus a radio version based on the television scripts, a feature film and a stage show. The series regularly gained audiences of 18 million viewers and is still repeated worldwide. In turning the popular impression of the Home Guard into a comedy organisation, the series put off a great many veterans from <b>telling</b> <b>their</b> stories and distorted research into the Home Guard for many years.|$|E

25|$|Today, it is run as {{a museum}} by Manx National Heritage, {{depicting}} {{the history of the}} Kings and Lords of Mann. Most rooms {{are open to the public}} during the opening season (March to October), and all open rooms have signs <b>telling</b> <b>their</b> stories. The exhibitions include a working medieval kitchen where authentic period food is prepared on special occasions and re-enactments of various aspects of medieval life are held on a regular basis, with particular emphasis on educating the local children about their history. Archaeological finds made during excavations in the 1980s are displayed and used as learning tools for visitors. A centre of the school activities at Castle Rushen is the recreation of the preparations and events surrounding the May 1507 visit to the castle by Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby and King of Mann. Stanley's visit in 1507 was a momentous occasion as most Kings of Mann rarely if ever visited the island, leaving the governing of the isle to lower ranking officials. The exhibitions at Castle Rushen are part of the Manx National Heritage Story of Mann collection of cultural, historical and heritage sites and attractions. In addition to its functions as a museum, the castle is still in use as an official court house.|$|E
