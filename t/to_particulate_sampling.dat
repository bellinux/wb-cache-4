40|$|Reconstructing {{the surface}} microtopography through data fusion {{from a range}} of microscopies offers a way to provide {{considerably}} more information than any one technique alone. This thesis explores several methods for combining the info rmation from different kinds of microscopes including height data, electron images and optical images. Each microscopy has distinct advantages and disadvantages that can be considered in terms of data leakage in the transfer function from the actual sampl e topography to any individual dataset. These leakage paths are identified for a range of microscopies including atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and white light interferometry. Existing techniques for reconstruction from multiple image datasets, such as shape-from-shading and stereomicroscopy are evaluated, again in terms of information leakage. A new approach is presented which attempts to minimize leakage by identifying a pathway of data fusion which first isolates the most reliable information in each dataset, and then maintains this information as the datasets are combined. The identification of the most trusted data requires knowledge of each imaging mechanism, while the final reconstruction is based on iterative matching between the datasets and a simulated image. Hence the final reconstruction incorporates both the datasets from the microscopes and their imaging physics to suppress data leakage. This approach is first validated with a model micromachined sample using a combination of height interferometer data together with back-scattered and secondary scanning electron microscope images. It is then applied <b>to</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate the capabilities of the approach. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the accomplishments of}} three subtasks completed {{in support of the}} current and future hot-gas cleanup activities at the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC). The overall objective of the EERC hot-gas cleanup task is to develop reliable methods <b>to</b> remove <b>particulate</b> matter from high-temperature, high-pressure gas streams produced from coal combustion and/or gasification. Near-term task objectives include (1) design, fabrication, and assembly of a high-temperature, high-pressure bench-scale filter vessel; (2) design, fabrication, and assembly of a high-temperature, high-pressure sampling train; and (3) the preliminary design of a pilot-scale high-temperature, high-pressure filter vessel and support systems.

40|$|Screening assays for {{environmental}} mycotoxins in bulk samples currently use cytotoxicity in cell cultures, but their application <b>to</b> air <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> often lacks {{sensitivity and specificity}} for fungal spores. An assay based on inhibition of protein synthesis using translation of firefly luciferase in a rabbit reticulocyte system has been developed {{for the detection of}} trichothecene mycotoxins found in the spores of toxigenic fungi. Ethanol extracts of air particulates trapped on polycarbonate filters are ultrafiltered and applied at several dilutions to a translation reaction mixture. The activity of translated luciferase is measured directly in a luminometer, eliminating the need for radioisotopes and time-consuming sample processing. Parallel standard curves using a commercially available trichothecene provide for expression of the results in T- 2 toxin equivalents per cubic meter of air. The assay can be completed in 2 h and is readily applicable to multiple samples. Comparison to the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay indicates a 400 -fold increase in sensitivity of trichothecene detection in addition to a much higher specificity for these toxins. Initial field testing indicates a strong correlation between the measured level of toxicity and the presence of toxigenic fungi detected with microbiological methods. In conclusion, this luciferase translation assay offers a rapid and highly sensitive and specific method for quantitative detection of trichothecene mycotoxin activity in air <b>particulate</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R

In particular, the project involved the identification and the characterization of homologous series of organic compounds (n-alkanes and carboxylic acids) that could be usually found in environmental samples, because they contain fundamental information to distinguish, for example, different types of emission sources, anthropic or biogenic. It has been developed a chemometric approach, which uses the AutoCoVariance Function (ACVF) computed on the digitized chromatogram, in order to quantificate the number of terms of the homologous series (nmax) and their distribution, with particular attention to the relative abundance and, consequently, the prevalance of the odd to even terms of the series (CPI).

40|$|Due to {{continually}} declining ore grades, increasing mineralogical complexity, and increasing metal demand, {{models for the}} design and optimisation of minerals processing operations are of critical importance. These models do not currently incorporate particle shape, which, although rarely quantified, is known to affect numerous unit operations. Automated Scanning Electron Microscopy (Auto-SEM-EDS) is a widely used tool for mineralogical analysis. It also {{provides an opportunity for}} simple, quantitative and mineral-specific shape characterisation. Existing mineralogical databases could therefore become useful resources to facilitate the incorporation of shape effects in minerals processing models. A robust Auto-SEM-EDS shape characterisation methodology is required to ensure that the particle shape information in these databases is interpreted appropriately. For this work, a novel methodology for Auto-SEM-EDS shape characterisation was developed that is suitable for the analysis of fine particles (< 75 μm). This involved testing the response of various shape descriptors to image resolution, and measurement with different devices and image processing routines. The most widely used shape descriptor in minerals processing, circularity, was found to be highly dependent on both image resolution and image processing settings, making it a poor choice for shape characterisation of fine particles. Roundness and aspect ratio were found to be more robust descriptors. However, in the interest of being able <b>to</b> compare <b>particulate</b> shape measurements across different studies, the precise definition of aspect ratio is important as variation in 'length' and 'width' definitions can significantly impact aspect ratio measurements. The possibility that preferential orientation of particles would introduce bias to the 2 -D cross-sectional measurements was also addressed through comparison of roundness distributions measured from orthogonal cross-sections of a <b>particulate</b> <b>sample</b> mounted within a block of resin. The excellent repeatability of these measurements indicated that the particles were randomly orientated, and thus it can be inferred that 2 -D measurements of a sufficient number of particles will be directly related <b>to</b> the <b>particulate</b> <b>sample's</b> 3 -D properties. Roundness and aspect ratio were then used in conjunction to produce surface frequency distributions that allow for distinction between non-rounded particles that were smooth and elongated and non-rounded particles that were neither elongated nor smooth. Three applications of the shape characterisation methodology developed were then demonstrated, which highlighted some of the potential contributions that this methodology can make towards minerals processing. The applications were all based on a case study of the Upper Group 2 (UG 2) Chromitite, a platinum group mineral (PGM) ore of key economic significance to South Africa...|$|R

This approach was applied {{in the analysis of}} PAHs in diesel emissions and other <b>particulate</b> <b>samples,</b> which are introduced into the GC and analyzed by MS using selected ion monitoring mode. Quantitation is based on the concentration of PAHs in a standard reference material (SRM), which are certified by US National Institute of Standard Technology to avoid matrix effects on extraction efficiency. A standard filter is prepared by deposition of small amount of SRM of diesel particulate or ambient PM on quartz fiber filter. By this method, the linearity for 12 kinds of PAHs (3 to 6 rings) was demonstrated from 0. 022 mg to 0. 65 mg of SRM 1650. The linearity of BaP, for example, was confirmed from 0. 028 to 0. 845 ng. The reproducibility of this method determined by analyzing the standard filter was 15. 4 %. By selecting an appropriate SRM as a standard material, this method is applicable for analyzing PAHs in fine particulate matter of less than 1 µm from various origins. Preliminary results for a series of ambient particulate matter, roadside PM, diesel soot and sidestream smoke, are presented.

The present study quantified the inflammatory response in a human macrophage cell line (U 937) after exposure <b>to</b> an ambient <b>particulate</b> <b>sample</b> from urban dust (UDP) and a diesel exhaust particulate (DEP). The effect of native UDP and DEP was compared with their corresponding organic extracts (OE-UDP/OE-DEP) and stripped particles (sUDP/sDEP) to clarify their respective roles. Exposure to OE-UDP, OE-DEP, UDP, DEP, and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin led to a greater increase of interleukin (IL) - 8, tumor necrosis factor-α, and cyclooxygenase- 2 mRNA expression than did the stripped particles, whereas sUDP, sDEP, UDP, and DEP led to a greater production of C-reactive protein and IL- 6 mRNA. The particles and the organic extract-induced expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 and cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 a 1 was significantly suppressed by co-treatment with an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonist, indicating that these effects are mainly mediated by the organic components, which can activate the AhR and CYP 1 a 1. In contrast, the induction of C-reactive protein and IL- 6 seems to be a particle-related effect that is AhR independent. The inflammatory response induced by particulate matter was associated with a subsequent increase of cholesterol accumulation, a hallmark of foam cells. Together, these data illustrate the interaction between particulate matter and the inflammatory response as well as the formation of cholesterol-accumulating foam cells, which are early markers of cardiovascular disease...|$|R

While other setups exist that can measure light scattering, our instrument is unique in its capability to measure individual particles which are held in place in mid-air.

We estimate its performance by measuring scattering from clear glass spheres and comparing the results to Mie scattering simulations. We also demonstrate the instrument's capability to handle real samples by measuring the light scattering properties of a rock sample taken from the Chelyabinsk meteorite.

40|$|Smoke' is {{a flight}} {{definition}} investigation whose {{purpose is to}} characterize the smoke particulate from microgravity smoke sources to enable improved design of future space-craft smoke detectors. In the earliest missions (Mercury, Gemini and Apollo), the crew quarters were so cramped that it was considered reasonable that the astronauts would rapidly detect any fire. The Skylab module, however, included approximately 30 UV-sensing fire detectors. The Space Shuttle Orbiter has nine particle-ionization smoke detectors in the mid-deck and flight deck. The detectors for the US segments of the International Space Station (ISS) are laser-diode, forward-scattering, smoke detectors. Current plans for the ISS call for two detectors in the open area of the module, and detectors in racks that have cooling air-flow. Due to the complete absence of microgravity data, {{all three of these}} detector systems were designed based upon 1 -g test data and experience. As planned mission durations and complexity increase and the volume of spacecraft increases, the need for and importance of effective, crew-independent, fire detection will grow significantly, necessitating more research into microgravity fire phenomena. In 1997 the Comparative Soot Diagnostics Experiment (CSD) flew in the Orbiter Middeck as a Glovebox payload. The CSD experiment was designed to produce small quantities of smoke from several sources <b>to</b> obtain <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> and <b>to</b> determine the response of the ISS and Orbiter smoke detectors to these sources.

In extreme cases, the detector used in the orbiter was completely blind to easily visible smoke from sources that were readily detected in 1 -g. It is hypothesized but as yet unverified that this performance difference was due to enhanced growth of liquid smoke droplets in low-g.

Particle samples in the PM 2. 5 and PM 2. 5 - 10 ranges have been collected in Bandung twice a week for 24 hours using a Gent stacked filter unit. The result showed that generally there was a systematic difference between INAA and PIXE results, which the values obtained by PIXE were lower than values determined by INAA. INAA is generally more sensitive and reliable than PIXE for Na, Al, Cl, V, Mn, Fe, Br and I, therefore INAA data are preffered, while PIXE usually gives better precision than INAA for Mg, K, Ca, Ti and Zn. Nevertheless, both techniques provide reliable results and complement to each other. INAA is still a prospective method, while PIXE with the special capabilities is a promising tool that could contribute and complement the lack of NAA in determination of lead, sulphur and silicon. The combination of INAA and PIXE can advantageously be used in air pollution studies to extend the number of important elements measured as key elements in source apportionment...|$|R

Both experimental and computational methods were used to investigate fluid and particle flows through a miniature dilution tunnel similar to those commonly used <b>to</b> <b>sample</b> <b>particulate</b> emissions from engines to help explain observed varabilities and bias, and to improve the repeatability of results. Laser Doppler Velocimetry, flow visualization, and a commercial CFD code were {{used to measure the}} flow field inside the apparatus. Slugs of NOx calibration gas and a high speed NOx concentration meter were used to measure mean velocities through the apparatus. An artificial aerosol generator was used in conjunction with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) to determine how tunnel geometry affects particle size distributions. These results were compared to a Monte Carlo type numerical simulation, accounting for Brownian motion and fluctuating turbulent velocities...|$|R

The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Automated <b>Particulate</b> <b>Sampler</b> was developed for the purpose of radionuclide particulate monitoring for use under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Its design was directed by anticipated requirements of small size, low power consumption, low noise level, fully automatic operation, and most predominantly the sensitivity requirements of the Conference on Disarmament Working Paper 224 (CDWP 224).

This system yields internally consistent results and is capable of frequent and convenient operation. This paper describes an auto exhaust <b>particulate</b> <b>sampling</b> system developed at Esso Research and Engineering Company. This system is capable of frequent and convenient operation, is compatible with constant volume sampling (CVS) of auto exhaust, and collects particulate matter at constant temperature during the 1972 or 1975 Federal Test Procedure. Compatibility is obtained because the <b>particulate</b> <b>sampler</b> requires {{only a small portion}} of the diluted exhaust, the major portion of the sample is available to the CVS system for the measurement of gaseous emissions. Conditions used in the measurement of exhaust <b>particulate</b> conform <b>to</b> those mandated by the Federal Test Procedures for gaseous emissions. Comprehensive investigations of auto exhaust particulate production have been hampered by the absence of collection and sampling systems that would allow meaningful and reproducible <b>particulate</b> emissions data <b>to</b> be obtained. While several laboratory methods are now being used <b>to</b> collect automotive <b>particulate,</b> they cannot be operated conveniently or frequently, and do not allow simultaneous assessment of gaseous emissions, that is, they are not compatible with the CVS system.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} global {{recognition of the}} effects of large scale land disturbance by wildfire {{on a wide range of}} water and ecosystem services. In 2003, the Lost Creek wildfire burned a contiguous area of 21, 000 ha on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in southern Alberta. This disturbance had a significant and prolonged impact on the water quantity and quality of downstream river reaches and reservoirs in the Oldman watershed. Previous research in this watershed demonstrates that dissolved metal concentrations in rivers draining burned landscapes were 2 to 15 times greater than in unburned reference streams (Silins et al. 2009 a). Currently there is no information on the effects of wildfire on the bioaccumulation and toxicity of sediment-associated metals in fire-impacted streams in Alberta. This study was designed to evaluate the linear downstream disturbance effects of wildfire in the Crowsnest River located in southern Alberta. The toxicity and bioaccumulation of particulate-associated metals from wildfire impacted tributaries to the Crowsnest River on freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca were evaluated. Phillips samplers were deployed to collect suspended solids in streams draining burned zone impacted by the Lost Creek wildfire and reference (unburned) zones within the area. Metal toxicity and bioaccumulation were determined in the laboratory by exposing the epi-benthic freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca <b>to</b> <b>particulates</b> collected from the Crowsnest River. A metal effects addition model (MEAM) was used to assess the impact of metal mixtures and to predict chronic mortality (Norwood et al. 2013). Increased concentrations of Al, Ba, Co, Cr, Mn and Zn were found in the tissues of H. azteca exposed <b>to</b> <b>particulates</b> from burned watersheds in comparison to the unburned watersheds. H. azteca mean survival was similar when exposed <b>to</b> the <b>particulates</b> <b>samples</b> from both burned and unburned sites indicating that 9 years after this landscape disturbance, there was little impact due to the wildfire. However, at burned site (B 1), the observed survival was lower than survival predicted by MEAM. The data suggests that factors other than the metals examined in this study were influencing the survival of H. azteca. The concentrations of sediment-associated metals have decreased in the nine years since the wildfire, and minimal metal toxicity was observed in H. azteca. Although metal toxicity in H. azteca was minimal 9 years after the Lost Creek Fire, the short term effects of wildfire on metal toxicity remain largely unknown. In addition, other factors such as burn severity, stream size and hydroclimatic conditions can influence the effects of wildfire on abundance and diversity of aquatic invertebrates (Minshall et al. 2001). Therefore, the influences of those factors on metal toxicity as a result of wildfire should be rigorously assessed in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Molecular marker {{analysis}} of environmental samples often requires time consuming preseparation steps. Here, {{analysis of}} low-volatile nonpolar molecular markers (5 - 6 ring {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} or PAHs, hopanoids, and n-alkanes) without the preseparation procedure is presented. Analysis of artificial sample extracts was directly conducted by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). After every sample injection, a standard mixture was also analyzed to make a correction on the variation of instrumental sensitivity caused by the unfavorable matrix contained in the extract. The method was further validated for the PAHs using the NIST standard reference materials (SRMs) and then applied <b>to</b> airborne <b>particulate</b> matter <b>samples.</b> Tests with the SRMs showed that overall our methodology was validated with the uncertainty of ~ 30 %. The measurement results of airborne particulate matter (PM) filter samples showed {{a strong correlation between}} the PAHs, implying the contributions from the same emission source. Analysis of size-segregated PM filter samples showed that their size distributions were found to be in the PM smaller than 0. 4 [*]μm aerodynamic diameter. The observations were consistent with our expectation of their possible sources. Thus, the method was found to be useful for molecular marker studies...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{aims and}} {{objectives}}: The aims {{and objectives of}} this study were to characterize and compare the airborne particulate matter in the tankhouse and crusher areas of a base metal refinery sampled with two separate methods, in terms of mass concentration, nickel content, and particle size distribution. Methods: Area sampling was conducted in the two areas. Two methods were applied <b>to</b> collect <b>particulate</b> <b>samples.</b> The first is a multi–stage virtual impactor, the Respicon, which was used to determine the three critical particle fractions (inhalable, thoracic and respirable). The NIOSH 7300 method determined the particle concentration and nickel percentage present in each fraction. Using formulas provided by the manufacturers two additional particle–size fractions (extra–thoracic and trachea–bronchial) could be calculated. The second was based on the standard NIOSH 0500 method, which determined particle size distribution depicted as cumulative percentages. The samples were analyzed using laser scattering instrumentation. Results: In the tankhouse the highest level of exposure was to particles bigger than 10 um, with the highest nickel percentage also falling into this range. However, high nickel percentages were present in all three cut–off sizes (4 um, 10 um and > 10 um). The particle concentration for the crusher area was the highest for particulates bigger than 10 um, with the highest nickel percentage present in this fraction. After comparing the tankhouse and crusher areas, {{it is clear that the}} particle concentration is much higher in the crusher area according to all sampling methods used. The nickel content present in the analysis of these areas is of great concern. Conclusion: With the knowledge obtained through this research one hopes to establish a basis for particle size sampling in the platinum mining industry. This may lead to the development of health based OEL's and reflect a more accurate evaluation of workers particulate exposure. This information will give a greater understanding of health risks workers are exposed to. Master...|$|R
40|$|Cement kilns {{can be used}} to co-process fly ash from {{municipal}} solid waste incinerators. However, this might increase emission of organic pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Knowledge of PCB concentrations and homolog and congener patterns at different stages in this process could be used to assess the possibility of simultaneously controlling emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and "dioxin-like" compounds. To date, emissions from cement kilns co-processing fly ash from {{municipal solid}} waste incinerators have not been analyzed for PCBs. In this study, stack gas and <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from two cement kilns co-processing waste incinerator fly ash were analyzed for PCBs. The average total tri- to deca-chlorinated biphenyl (Sigma 3 - 10 PCB) concentration in the stack gas samples was 10. 15 ng m(- 3). The Sigma 3 - 10 PCB concentration ranges in <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from different stages were 0. 83 - 41. 79 ng g(- 1) for cement kiln 1 and 0. 13 - 1. 69 ng g(- 1) for cement kiln 2. The Sigma 3 - 10 PCB concentrations were much higher in <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from the suspension pre-heater boiler, humidifier tower, and kiln back-end bag filters than in <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> from other stages. For these three stages, PCBs contributed to 15 - 18 % of the total PCB, PCDD/F, and polychlorinated naphthalene toxic equivalents in stack gases and particulate matter. The PCB distributions were similar to those found in other studies for PCDD/Fs and polychlorinated naphthalenes, which suggest that {{it may be possible to}} simultaneously control emissions of multiple organic pollutants from cement kilns. Homolog patterns in the <b>particulate</b> <b>samples</b> were dominated by the pentachlorobiphenyls. CB- 105, CB- 118, and CB- 123 were the dominant dioxin-like PCB congeners that formed at the back-end of the cement kiln. A mass balance of PCBs in the cement kilns indicated that the total mass of PCBs in the stack gases and clinker was about half the mass of PCBs in the raw materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
