5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from <b>the</b> <b>nobility.</b> Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of <b>the</b> <b>Nobility,</b> a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums {{of his own money}} in doing so.|$|E

5|$|In the Late Postclassic, {{the greater}} Q'umarkaj area is {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} population of around 15,000. The inhabitants of Q'umarkaj were divided socially between <b>the</b> <b>nobility</b> and their vassals. The nobles were known as the ajaw, while the vassals were known as the al k'ajol. <b>The</b> <b>nobility</b> were the patrilineal descendents of the founding warlords who appear to have entered as conquerors from the Gulf coast around AD 1200 and who eventually lost their original language and adopted that of their subjects. The nobles were regarded as sacred and bore royal imagery. Their vassals served as foot-soldiers and were subject to the laws laid out by <b>the</b> <b>nobility,</b> although they could receive military titles {{as a result of their}} battlefield prowess. The social divisions were deep seated and were equivalent to strictly observed castes. The merchants were a privileged class, although they had to make tributary payments to <b>the</b> <b>nobility.</b> In addition to these classes, the population included rural labourers and artisans. Slaves were also held and included both sentenced criminals and prisoners of war.|$|E

50|$|The exact {{relation}} of the Eupatridae {{to the other two}} classes has been a matter of dispute. It seems probable that the Eupatridae were the governing class, <b>the</b> only recognized <b>nobility,</b> <b>the</b> Geomori the country inhabitants of all ranks, and the Demiurgi the commercial and artisan population. The division attributed to Theseus is always spoken of by ancient authorities as a division of the entire population; but Georg Busolt maintained the view that the three classes represent three elements in <b>the</b> Attic <b>nobility,</b> namely, <b>the</b> city <b>nobility,</b> <b>the</b> landed <b>nobility</b> and <b>the</b> commercial <b>nobility,</b> and exclude altogether the mass of the population. At any rate it seems certain from the little we know of the early constitutional history of Athens, that the Eupatridae represent <b>the</b> only <b>nobility</b> that had any political recognition in early times.|$|R

5|$|Medieval {{society was}} highly stratified. In {{a time when}} famine was commonplace and social {{hierarchies}} were often brutally enforced, food was an important marker of social status {{in a way that}} has no equivalent today in most developed countries. According to the ideological norm, society consisted of the three estates of the realm: commoners, that is, the working classes—by far the largest group; the clergy, and <b>the</b> <b>nobility.</b> The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical, with <b>the</b> <b>nobility</b> and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners. Within <b>the</b> <b>nobility</b> and clergy there were also a number of ranks ranging from kings and popes to dukes, bishops and their subordinates, such as priests. One was expected to remain in one's social class and to respect the authority of the ruling classes. Political power was displayed not just by rule, but also by displaying wealth. Nobles dined on fresh game seasoned with exotic spices, and displayed refined table manners; rough laborers could make do with coarse barley bread, salt pork and beans and were not expected to display etiquette. Even dietary recommendations were different: the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality. The digestive system of a lord was held to be more discriminating than that of his rustic subordinates and demanded finer foods.|$|E
5|$|Sejmiks {{were usually}} {{held in a}} large, open field. <b>The</b> <b>nobility</b> would elect a {{presiding}} officer (marszałek sejmiku: sejmik marshal), whose role was analogous to the marshal of the sejm at national Sejms. (This term has been revived since 1999, but it now refers to {{the chairman of the}} voivodeship executive board rather than the presiding officer of the sejmik itself.) While the sejmiks were originally convened by the king, soon a loophole was exploited: the sejmiks would limit the number of issues discussed, using that as a pretext to reconvene later at a time chosen by the marshal. Voivodes and starosts also had the ability to convene some sejmiks. Until the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May, all <b>the</b> <b>nobility</b> residing in the territory that was holding a sejmik were eligible to participate in the sejmik.|$|E

5|$|Under the new system, {{newly elected}} magistrates were awarded with {{automatic}} {{membership in the}} senate, although it remained difficult for a Plebeian from an unknown family to enter the senate.

Ultimately, a new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy emerged, which replaced <b>the</b> old Patrician <b>nobility.</b> It was <b>the</b> dominance of <b>the</b> long-standing Patrician <b>nobility</b> which ultimately forced the Plebeians to wage their long struggle for political power. <b>The</b> new <b>nobility,</b> however, was fundamentally different from <b>the</b> old <b>nobility.</b> <b>The</b> old <b>nobility</b> existed through <b>the</b> force of law, because only Patricians were allowed to stand for high office, and it was ultimately overthrown after those laws were changed.
