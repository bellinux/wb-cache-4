5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} {{relatives}} of the Driscolls attempted <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> at the Regulators. They obtained an indictment against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E
5|$|When Catherine {{finds her}} {{colleague}} dead, she flees {{from the company}} premises and finds her husband, who has deduced that her job offer was simply a way for Odessa to reach him. Elsewhere, an Odessa agent murders the Old Man in Frank's home; the loss serves to reunite Watts, Means and Black, who contrive a plan <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> at Odessa. As the Elder conducts a funeral for the Old Man, a carbomb kills his assassin, while Odessa's Paraguayan headquarters is destroyed and Knight's company is raided and closed. The Elder finishes his rites and returns home, opening a package delivered from the Middle East; inside is the fragment of the True Cross.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{tensions}} between the Centauri Republic, an empire in decline, and the Narn Regime, a former dominion which rebelled and gained freedom, are increasing. Ambassador G'Kar of the Narn wishes for his people <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> at the Centauri for what they did, and Ambassador Londo Mollari of the Centauri wishes for his people to become again the great empire they once were. As part of these struggles, Mollari makes a deal with a mysterious ally <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> at the Narn, further heightening tensions.|$|E

25|$|Boulanger {{decided that}} it would be better to contest the general {{election}} and take power legally. This, however, gave his enemies the time they needed <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back.</b> Ernest Constans, the Minister of the Interior, decided to investigate the matter, and attacked the Ligue des Patriotes using the law banning the activities of secret societies.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} bomber offensive {{was born}} out of the need <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> at Germany during the years when the United Kingdom had no forces on the continent of Europe. Initially the bomber forces available for attacks were small, and the rules of engagement were so restricted that any attacks that were made were mostly ineffective. However, once France had fallen in the summer of 1940 that began to change.|$|E
25|$|The Burma Campaign {{took place}} between 11 December 1941 and 2 September 1945, during which time Japanese forces invaded Burma and drove British forces back to the Indian border. Since the Japanese held superiority in the Pacific Ocean, the Allies were not in a {{position}} <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> and regain a foothold in Burma until early in 1944. Total surrender of the Japanese came on 2 September 1945.|$|E

25|$|In mid-July, 'Ali ibn Muhammad decided <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> against Sa'id, {{and ordered}} his {{lieutenant}} Yahya ibn Muhammad al-Bahrani {{to send a}} contingent against him. The rebel force, which consisted of a thousand men and was commanded by Sulayman ibn Jami' and Abu al-Layth al-Isbahani, proceeded from the Nahr Ma'qil by night and managed to catch the government army unprepared. The Zanj inflicted a severe defeat on Sa'id, killing {{a large number of}} his men and setting fire to his camp.|$|E
25|$|The British and French {{would then}} argue that Egypt's control {{of such an}} {{important}} route was too tenuous, and that it needed be placed under Anglo-French management. David Ben-Gurion did not trust the British in view of their treaty with Jordan {{and he was not}} initially in favour of the plan, since it would make Israel alone look like the aggressor; however he soon agreed to it since such a good opportunity <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> at Egypt might never again present itself.|$|E

Moss tells Aaronow that they need <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to another real estate agency. Moss's plan would require Aaronow {{to break into the}} office, stage a burglary, and steal all the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss intimidates him, claiming that he is already an accomplice simply by listening to Moss's pitch.|$|E

25|$|Barbary piracy {{thrived on}} the {{competition}} among European powers. France encouraged the corsairs against Spain, and later Britain and Holland supported them against France. By {{the second half}} of the 17th century, the greater European naval powers were able <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> effectively enough to intimidate the Barbary States into making peace with them. However, those countries' commercial interests benefited by the pirates continuing attacks on their competitors. As a result, they did not cooperate to impose a more general cessation of corsair activity.|$|E
25|$|After being {{completely}} dominated {{up to that}} point, Seattle finally managed <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back,</b> moving the ball 74 yards in 10 plays and scoring on Zorn's 11-yard touchdown pass to running back Dan Doornink. Then Seattle linebacker Bruce Scholtz intercepted a pass that bounced out of Barnwell's hands on the Seahawks 25-yard line, but once again Los Angeles' defense proved too formidable, as a 2-yard loss on a screen pass to Curt Warner, a holding penalty, and incomplete passes pushed Seattle out of field goal range and forced a punt.|$|E
25|$|Dave Moss: A big-mouthed {{salesman}} {{with big}} dreams and schemes. Moss resents Williamson and agency owners Mitch and Murray for putting such {{pressure on him}} and plans <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> at them by stealing all their best sales leads and selling them to a competitor. Moss sees Aaronow as a potential accomplice, but eventually convinces Levene {{to work with him}} in selling the leads to Jerry Graff, a local competitor. During his final rant against Roma, his indignation reveals that his jealousy extends towards even his fellow salesmen, and he decides to go to Wisconsin to avoid further questioning.|$|E

25|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Norway on 9 April 1940, {{and the subsequent}} 62-day Norwegian Campaign that ended in June 1940 with the German conquest of the country, the Royal Norwegian Navy was exiled in the United Kingdom. One way the exiled Norwegian forces attempted <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> was by motor torpedo boat attacks on German-controlled shipping. After initial operations in the English Channel from July 1940 onwards, operations against the coast of occupied Norway from the Shetland Islands began in November 1942 and continued throughout the war in Europe. In total 30 motor torpedo boats served in the Royal Norwegian Navy during the war years.|$|E
25|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Balaclava {{was well known}} to both sides. Undertaking the siege operations around Sevastopol whilst securing the Allies' eastern flank was stretching the resources of Raglan's dwindling forces – British casualties at the Alma had been high, and many were still suffering from the cholera epidemic; others simply fell sick from exhaustion. With the arrival of further Russian reinforcements, Menshikov's total force in theatre (including 12 Division) numbered around 65,000. The remainder of 4th Corps – 10 and 11 Divisions – were also heading towards the Crimea, but Menshikov, under pressure from Nicholas I <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> at the Allies, decided not to wait for these troops before beginning the attack.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Henry took a {{force to}} Winchester where he laid siege to the royal castle which was garrisoned by Angevins. Winchester's royal castle was located on the {{southwest}} side of the city, while an episcopal castle was on the southeast side. Only two other English cities at the time {{had more than one}} castle, London with three and York with two. When she heard of the bishop's incursion Empress Matilda determined <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back.</b> She gathered an army of her adherents and sortied from her base at Oxford around 28 July 1141. When the empress appeared before Winchester on 31 July it was a complete surprise. Bishop Henry fled the city while his soldiers retreated to Wolvesey Castle, the one belonging to the church.|$|E

25|$|According to William Manchester, General Douglas MacArthur was a chivalric warrior {{who fought}} {{a war with}} the {{intention}} to conquer the enemy, completely eliminating their ability <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back,</b> then treated them with the understanding and kindness due their honour and courage. One prominent model of his chivalrous conduct was in World War II and his treatment of the Japanese {{at the end of}} the war. MacArthur's model provides a way to win a war with as few casualties as possible and how to get the respect of the former enemy after the occupation of their homeland. On May 12, 1962, MacArthur gave a famous speech in front of the cadets of United States Military Academy at West Point by referring to a great moral code, the code of conduct and chivalry, when emphasizing duty, honour, and country.|$|E
25|$|Some {{settlers}} soon returned, a few {{while the}} ruins of their homes still smoldered. Many of those who fled were recent immigrants from New Jersey, fleeing the war there. Many of those had been poorly equipped and were ill-equipped to withstand attacks, and simply returned to New Jersey. The government of Pennsylvania sent military aid. Colonel Thomas Hartley built Fort Muncy to protect returning settlers. On September 24, 1778 he led a force of about 200 men up the Sheshequin Path on Lycoming Creek to the North Branch of the Susquehanna <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> against the Iroquois. Hartley's expedition covered about 300miles (500km) in two weeks, defeated several bands of Iroquois and destroyed a few native villages. This proved the feasibility of operating in the Iroquois territory and preceded the Continental Army's major expedition into Iroquois territory the next year.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{policy was}} {{to support a}} swift war to destroy Serbia that would present a fait accompli to the world. Unlike the three earlier cases dating from 1912 when Austria had asked for German {{diplomatic}} support for a war against Serbia, {{this time it was}} felt that political conditions for such a war now existed. At this time, the German military supported the idea of an Austrian attack against Serbia as the best way of starting a general war, whereas Wilhelm believed that an Austro-Serbian war would be purely local. Austrian policy based upon pre-existing plans to destroy Serbia involved not waiting to complete judicial inquiries <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> immediately and not to strain its credibility in the coming weeks as it would become more and more clear that Austria was not reacting to the assassination. Likewise, Germany wished to give the impression of its ignorance of Austrian intentions.|$|E
50|$|In the manga Vagabond, the {{original}} Shishido Baiken was a bandit leader who did use the kusarigama {{only to be}} killed by Tsujikaze Kohei, who then took up the name and weapon and became the source for the kusarigamas notoriety. His duel with Musashi would be significant for Musashis use of both the long and short swords, allowing him <b>to</b> simply <b>strike</b> <b>back</b> with the katana after his wakizashi was ensnared. Kohei/Baiken would be defeated but survived thanks to Musashis medical assistance.|$|R
