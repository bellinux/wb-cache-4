5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, {{and the right to}} tax local areas.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of their children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in federal income <b>taxes,</b> <b>for</b> an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective federal tax rates were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} concerning {{the effects of}} child support. Many earlier studies have assumed full employment. However, in the real economy, there is unemployment. The relation {{between the number of}} children in the economy and unemployment was investigated. The overlapping generation model with involuntary unemployment was used because wages were set by labor unions. First, in the analytical research, {{it was found that the}} wage <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> child support and unemployment insurance both increased unemployment and that the wage <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> child support decreased equilibrium capital stock. Also, the wage <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> unemployment insurance reduced the number of the children in the economy. Second, a simulation {{was conducted}}, which revealed that there is a tax rate at which the number of the children is maximized. At <b>tax</b> rates <b>for</b> child support higher than this maximum, any increase in the <b>tax</b> rate <b>for</b> child support decreases the number of the children! The conclusion showed that <b>tax</b> rates <b>for</b> child support that are too high have a diminishing effect and policy makers should consider the effects of the wage <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> child support and unemployment. overlapping generation model, involuntary unemployment, child support...|$|R

5|$|During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again {{proposed}} his {{tax reform}} plan, and {{late in the}} session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether. The Assembly also passed a budget {{for the remainder of}} the biennium, abolished the state's public campaign finance laws, and passed new school nutrition guidelines.|$|E
5|$|Edward sent assurances to the Pope {{that the}} {{conflict}} surrounding Gaveston's role was at an end. On {{the basis of these}} promises, and procedural concerns about the how the original decision had been taken, the Pope agreed to annul the Archbishop's threat to excommunicate Gaveston, thus opening the possibility of Gaveston's return. Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward. At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the royal steward and the marshal of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of purveyance and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, the parliament agreed to fresh <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E
5|$|Governor Dayton {{formally}} {{proposed a}} state budget on February 15, calling for $37 billion in state spending, necessitating cuts of about 10 percent to most state agencies. Because {{the state was}} projected to take in only about $32 billion in taxes, {{the rest of the}} budget shortfall was covered by increases to income and property <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> wealthier Minnesotans, as he had promised during his campaign. Meanwhile, Republican legislators, led by House Speaker Kurt Zellers and Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch, demanded the budget be kept below $32 billion.|$|E
5|$|His reign {{was marked}} by the {{reversal}} of his predecessor's conservative policy; he abolished <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> poorer people, repealed penal laws which restricted Jews and discontinued public executions. The Medici were wanting in male heirs; his father, Cosimo III, wanted the Electress Palatine to succeed Gian Gastone. However, Spain, Great Britain, Austria and the Dutch Republic disregarded Cosimo's plan and appointed Charles of Spainwhose mother, Elisabeth Farnese, was a great-granddaughter of Margherita de' MediciGian Gastone's heir. Charles later transferred his claim to Francis Stephen of Lorraine pursuant to a preliminary peace that was finalized in 1738. Francis Stephen duly succeeded at Gian Gastone's demise, on 9 July 1737, ending almost 300 years of Medici rule over Florence. For {{the latter part of}} his reign, Gian Gastone chose to remain confined in his bed, tended by his entourage, the Ruspanti.|$|E
