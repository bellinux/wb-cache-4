25|$|As {{recorded}} by Archbishop Netzhammer, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș {{was open and}} cooperative in {{his relationship with the}} new authorities and the German community. In September 1917, the Romanian scholar greeted Wilhelm II, German Emperor, who was visiting the occupied half of Romania. Reportedly the only Romanian in attendance, he followed Wilhelm to the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral, where they both paid their respects to Carol I's tomb. Tzigara was also a personal guest at the imperial table, and Wilhelm had several long conversations with him in private. At the end of their encounter, Tzigara received from the emperor's hand a diamond-and-ruby <b>tie</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 83 × 67cm (33 × 26 in) {{painting}} shows a half-length {{portrait of}} the painter Édouard Manet. In this self-portrait as painter he depicted himself as a stylish Boulevardier {{in front of a}} dark background. The depicted wears a black top hat and a brown jacket, under which is a white shirt, of which only the collar can be seen. The neckline of the suit jacket covers a black silk tie which is affixed by a <b>tie</b> <b>pin.</b> In the right, only vaguely depicted hand he holds a long wooden brush with red paint on the tip; the left hand holds a painting palette with about three more brushes. No further accessories are shown. The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created. His pose is slightly turned to the right, so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward, left half. The painter's gaze is directed forwards at the viewer.|$|E

500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal <b>tie</b> <b>pin,</b> and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E

2500|$|The {{end of the}} war {{signified}} a {{slump in}} Tzigara's career. His imperial <b>tie</b> <b>pin,</b> Boia notes, became a [...] "corpus delicti" [...] for those accusing Tzigara of treason. Such accusations were given ample exposure in Rector Ion Atanasiu's essay Rătăciri naționale ("National Ravings", 1919), answered to in detail by Tzigara's own , Mărturisiri silite ("Forced Confessions", 1920), and later by his posthumously published Memorii ("Memoirs"). Athanasiu was the first who suggested holding Tzigara accountable for his wartime behavior, and, in his University report, alluded to the possibility of sacking both him and the Germanophile biologist Victor Babeș. Ornea finds that, in those years, Athanasiu and Tzigara's traditional foe Nicolae Iorga were waging [...] "a veritable war against Tzigara-Samurcaș".|$|E

6000|$|The {{orchestra}} {{played a}} wailing waltz that Medora {{had learned from}} the hand-organs. She followed the air with nodding head in a sweet soprano hum. Madder looked {{across the table at}} her, and wondered in what strange waters Binkley had caught her in his seine. She smiled at him, and they raised glasses and drank of the wine that boiled when it was cold. Binkley had abandoned art and was prating of the unusual spring catch of shad. Miss Elise arranged the palette-and-maul-stick <b>tie</b> <b>pin</b> of Mr. Vandyke. A Philistine at some distant table was maundering volubly either about Jerome or Gérôme. A famous actress was discoursing excitably about monogrammed hosiery. A hose clerk from a department store was loudly proclaiming his opinions of the drama. A writer was abusing Dickens. A magazine editor and a photographer were drinking a dry brand at a reserved table. A 36-25-42 young lady was saying to an eminent sculptor: [...] "Fudge for your Prax Italys!

50|$|Simon Archard is a detective. He is {{a master}} sleuth and {{extremely}} competent. He has an eidetic memory. He is feared by the criminals of Partington, and his presence apparently keeps the crime rate low. He is close to emotionless, remaining utterly calm in situations of crisis. He is also emotionally distant from other people. His character is based on Sherlock Holmes. It is implied that Simon Archard is his world's Sigil Bearer, {{but he does not}} receive the mark from anyone {{at the beginning of the}} series nor does he seem to have any special powers except his mental abilities (he does however wear the Sigil mark upon his <b>tie</b> <b>pin).</b> It is possible that Simon received the mark before the series began, gets his abilities from it and is able to hide it from everyone (and wears the mark on his <b>tie</b> <b>pin</b> as respect for the powers it gives him).|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} the first Hitchcock film to have nudity. There {{are a number of}} classic Hitchcock set pieces in the film, {{particularly}} the long tracking shot down the stairs when Babs is murdered. The camera moves down the stairs, out the doorway (with a rather clever edit just after the camera exits the door which marks where the scene moves from the studio to the location footage) and across the street where the usual activity in the market district goes on with patrons unaware that a murder is occurring in the building. A second sequence set {{in the back of a}} delivery truck full of potatoes increases the suspense as the murderer Rusk attempts to retrieve his <b>tie</b> <b>pin</b> from the corpse of Babs. Rusk struggles with the hand and has to break the fingers of the corpse in order to retrieve his <b>tie</b> <b>pin</b> and try to escape unseen from the truck.|$|E

Occasionally, a hybrid design is used, in which alternating stripes of colour are overlaid with repeated motif pattern.|$|E
