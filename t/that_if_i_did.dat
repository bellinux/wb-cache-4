25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
500|$|Khan married Hameedah Begum (the eldest {{daughter}} of Allama Mashriqi) in 1940. Together, {{they had three}} daughters (Mariam, Amina, and Rasheeda) and a son (Akbar). After Hameedah Begum's death in 1966, he married Shafiq Khan and had one daughter, Ayesha. During his ICS career, Khan worked as collector of revenue, a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of East Bengal. The Bengal famine of 1943 and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service in 1945. He wrote, [...] "I realised <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not escape while I was young and vigorous, I will forever remain in the trap, and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig." [...] During this period, he {{was influenced by the}} philosophy of Nietzsche and Mashriqi, and joined the Khaksar Movement. This attachment was brief. He quit the movement and turned to Sufism. According to Khan, [...] "I had a profound personal concern; I wanted to live a life free from fear and anxiety, a calm and serene life, without turmoil and conflict.when I followed the advice of old Sufis and sages, and tried to curb my greed, my pride and aggression, fears, anxieties and conflict diminished." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock {{returned}} to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short films in French for the British Ministry of Information: Bon Voyage and Aventure Malgache. The two British propaganda films made for the Free French were the only films that Hitchcock made in the French language, and they [...] "feature typical Hitchcockian touches". On his motivation for making the films, Hitchcock stated: [...] "I {{felt the need to}} make a little contribution to the war effort, and I was both overweight and over-age for military service. I knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> nothing, I'd regret {{it for the rest of}} my life." [...] From late June to late July 1945, Hitchcock served as [...] "treatment advisor" [...] on a Holocaust documentary which used footage provided by the Allied Forces. It was produced by Sidney Bernstein of the British Ministry of Information, and was assembled in London. Bernstein brought his future 1948–49 production partner Hitchcock on board as a consultant for the film editing process for the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information.|$|E

6000|$|... "How can I refuse?" [...] said Sihamba, with {{a bitter}} laugh, [...] "seeing <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{you will take}} both life and goods. But what is the second condition?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} to leave my clothes {{at the edge of}} the settlement, so <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not return before {{daylight}} I shall have something to wear through the streets." ...|$|R
60|$|Here was my chance. And I {{resolved}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not further enlighten John Paul, {{it would}} be no fault of mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "How do {{you know}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{it would not be}} more terrible, Preacher? How {{do you know}} indeed that this is not your last journey from which there is no return?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was anxious}} {{to get back to}} my regiment, sir, as I was afraid <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not return before the next {{campaign}} opened, some other officer might be appointed to its command." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that," [...] she assured him. [...] "The only thing is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> decide--to go--well, <b>I</b> shall have had a last glimpse of most of my friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{make it a}} rule, Sir Mungo," [...] replied Richie, [...] "always {{to speak}} any evil I know about my family myself, having observed, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not, it {{is sure to be}} told by ither folks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sink you for villains!" [...] he cried. [...] "I see well <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not shoot}} {{one of you}} {{from time to time}} you will forget the man I am. What mean you by {{entering}} my cabin {{as though it were a}} Wapping alehouse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you {{say that}} because you think <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> see him, I should be so disgusted with him that I'd never {{want to speak to}} him again. But what if I shouldn't?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why so?' {{repeated}} Alaric. 'Well, {{there are}} so many reasons. In the first place, there would be seven to one against me; and I must confess <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> stand I should not like to be beaten.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't talk nonsense," [...] Amelius rejoined {{a little}} impatiently. [...] "I don't blame you--but {{you have got}} me into a scrape, for all <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my duty, I should send for a cab, and take her back." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{explained}} {{after another}} turn what he meant. [...] "The {{only way for}} her not to come is {{for me to go}} home--as I believe that on the spot I could prevent it. But the difficulty as to <b>that</b> is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> go home--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madness {{or not it}} is my will, and beware how you thwart me in it, Metem, for {{at least}} I am the Lady Baaltis, and have power to kill without question. I swear to you <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not see him, you shall never leave this city living." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{letter from}} Croker {{of a very}} {{friendly}} tone and tenor, which I will answer accordingly, not failing, however, {{to let him know}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not reply it is not for fear of his arguments or raillery, far less from diffidence in my cause. I hope and trust it will do good.[227] ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have all}} my life been {{something}} of a coward, and my voice shook when I said this, so that Gavin again entreated me to remain at the school-house, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not he would accompany me.|$|E
60|$|As far as I remember, I {{have never}} met Mr. Carnegie. But I know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{he would tell me}} that he found it quite {{impossible}} to keep up with Mr. Rockefeller. No doubt Mr. Rockefeller has the same feeling.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good, Eva, {{you mean}} good. I should be {{incapable}} of anything, {{if it were}} not for my debts. I am naturally so indolent, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not remember in the morning that I was ruined, I should never be able to distinguish myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marry!" [...] quoth Gascoyne; [...] "I {{reason not}} of shame at this or that. All I {{know is that}} others serve them who are haply as good and maybe better than <b>I</b> be, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not serve them I get knocked i' th' head therefore, which same goeth soothly against my stomach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so. Dear Mrs. Roden, do {{not look}} at me like <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not say more to tell you {{immediately}} it is because I am not perhaps quite sure;--not sure, at any rate, of the reasons I may have to give. I will come to you to-morrow, and then I will tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am willing}} to take my risk," [...] I declared. [...] "I simply don't care. Once in a {{lifetime}} a man has that feeling for a woman. If he is wise he goes nap on it. I have never had it before and I {{am not going to}} let go. <b>I</b> feel <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> may regret it all my life. I don't want any other woman in this world except your daughter, and what I possess in life worth having I {{am willing to}} give to make sure of her." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{then asked}} me if I would swear to be secret, and <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not agree to what he proposed, I would {{nevertheless}} never betray him. I readily bound myself to that, upon the most solemn imprecations and curses that the devil and both of us could invent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw the toils closing round us. I knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not yield}} {{my father would}} be driven {{from his home in}} his old age, and that the place he loved would pass to strangers--would pass to you. No, father, do not stop me, I /will/ speak my mind! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This man has {{not only}} written to me, but has {{absolutely}} forced his way into my rooms when I was dressing for dinner; and absolutely had the impudence to tell me <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not honour some bill which he holds for eight hundred pounds he would proceed against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak {{not to me}} of children," [...] she said, [...] "for I {{think that}} there will be none, and talk not of future glories, since for these I care nothing. It is for our people that I care. You swear to me <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not go your armies will be {{defeated}} and that those who escape the spear will be enslaved?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted to}} tell her <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{anything}} at all, she had only to command.|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{all that}} I see and hear, mother," [...] he said, {{walking up and}} down the room, as was his habit, with his hands behind him, [...] "it is clear <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not go about it myself, the king will let the matter drop; for he is {{convinced}} that the girl has run off with some fellow, and will easily make her way home." ...|$|R
60|$|Then eagerly, quickly, almost fiercely, we fell to {{discussing}} the situation. Again I said that I would go, and again Mackenzie negatived it, and Curtis and Good, like the true men that they are, vowed <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> {{they would go}} with me, and die back to back with me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I say yes,' {{returned}} his friend. 'You shall find her out yourself. Don't think that I mean, when you can--I {{know as well}} as you <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> you could never get sight of her without me. No. I say you shall find her out--SHALL--and I'll put you in the way.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am really}} touched by your letter. I can most truthfully {{assure you that}} your part in the {{inconvenience}} of this mishap has given me much more concern than my own; and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hope to have our London Farewells yet, I {{should be in a}} very gloomy condition on your account.|$|E
6000|$|... "His sword,--the Ogre's,--his magic sword, which kills whomsoever it strikes. I coaxed the wretch {{to let me}} have it {{last night}} when he was tipsy, for fear he should quarrel with the young stranger; and I have kept it from him ever since by one excuse or another; {{and now he has}} sent one of his ruffians in for it, saying, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not give it up at once he will come back and kill me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My husband's leg is {{very painful}} this morning," [...] she said, [...] "and I {{fear that he}} will have to keep his bed for {{the next two or three}} days. When he is well enough to lie down on the sofa I will come down and fetch your son, for Mr. Godstone is of course anxious to see him, and <b>I</b> am afraid <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not come round myself we shall not get Jack to the inn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{want to see}} you once, and twice,--and always. Ayala, if {{you could}} know it! If you could only know it!" [...] Then he clasped his two hands high upon his breast, not as though {{appealing}} to her heart, but striking his bosom in very agony. [...] "Ayala, <b>I</b> feel <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not have you as my own, I can only die for the want of you. Ayala, do you believe me?" ...|$|R
