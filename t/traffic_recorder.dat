To illustrate the comparisons and understand their limitations, we conducted two simulated field tests in the Central Ohio region. We converted measures made from aerial photographs into flow estimates for several facilities, compared these to concurrent estimates obtained from automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorders,</b> and found good agreement. We propose that unobservable changes in vehicle velocities will probably be the most limiting factor in getting good agreement when using real satellite data.

To this end, the paper examines applications of vehicle probe data, automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorder</b> counts, and neural network models to estimate hourly volumes in the Maryland highway network, and proposes a novel approach that combines neural networks with an existing profiling method. On average, the proposed approach yields 26 % more accurate estimates than volume profiles, which are currently used by transportation agencies across the US to compute statewide performance measures. The paper also quantifies the value of using vehicle probe data in estimating hourly traffic volumes, which provides important managerial insights to transportation agencies interested in acquiring this type of data. For example, results show that volumes can be estimated with a mean absolute percent error of about 20 % at locations where average number of observed probes is between 30 and 47 vehicles/hr, which provides a useful guideline for assessing the value of probe vehicle data from different vendors...|$|E

This research quantifies the level of uncertainty in AADT estimates and compares these across sampling strategies. Variations in AADT estimation errors are investigated across roadway and area types, for both Minnesota and Florida automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorder</b> (ATR) sites. Errors as a function of distance to the nearest sampling site are also studied, using predictions of network travel patterns in Austin, Texas. Overall errors at ATR sites are found to be highest (averaging 24. 6 %) when data come from misclassified sites on weekends. Spatial and temporal (inter-sampling year) extrapolations can further add to such error, in a sizable way. The analytical results of this investigation suggest a variety of recommendations for agencies seeking to reduce and appreciate errors in their AADT estimates. These include sampling in spring and summer months (on weekdays), exercising greater caution with counts on multilane and low-AADT roadways, pursuing appropriate site assignment to ATR groups, and recognizing the effects of distance to the sampling site.

In addition, continuous traffic volume data (collected by automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorders)</b> is needed to factor short counts (24 hours or more) collected at key sites on the states highway network. This study evaluates the procedures used by the Oregon Department of Transportation for collecting continuous traffic volume data to determine: (1) if the current location and number of automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorders</b> (ATRs) on Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s highway network is adequate for estimating monthly seasonal factors, and (2) if the current procedure of using group means, based on geographical regions, to calculate seasonal adjustment factors is the best method. The use of simple regression versus (1) cluster specific means from computer generated clusters, and (2) weighted means based on the distance from one ATR to the three closest ATRs that triangulate the point, are evaluated as techniques for calculating monthly seasonal adjustment factors from ATR data. These adjustment factors are used to factor volume data where only short counts are available. The results show the current geographical location of ATRs used by ODOT compare favorably, statistically, with other siting criteria. However, it is shown that the task of factoring short count data for making inferences about traffic volume count data from known locations to unknown locations on the highway network can be improved by siting additional ATRs in high volume, small urban areas.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to (a) produce historic estimates of travel times on Twin-Cities arterials for 1995 and 2005, and (b) develop an initial architecture and database that could, in the future, produce timely estimates of arterial traffic volumes and travel times. Our Phase I field study indicated that on arterial links where both the demand traffic volume and the signal timing are known, model-based estimates of travel time that are on average within 10 % of measured values can be obtained. Phase II of this project then focused on applying this approach to the entire Twin Cities arterial system. The Phase II effort divided into three main subtasks: (1) updating estimates of demand traffic volume obtained from a transportation planning model to make them consistent with available volume measurements, (2) collecting information on traffic signal locations in the Twin Cities and compiling this into a geographic database, and (3) combining the updated traffic volumes and signal information to produce link-by-link peak-period travel time estimates. The traffic volume update took as inputs the predicted volumes generated by a traffic assignment model and measured average annual daily traffic from automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorders,</b> and gave as output updated estimates of the traffic volumes for links lacking automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorders.</b> A request to state, county and municipal agencies in the seven-county metro area produced Information on approximately 2, 900 traffic signals.

40|$|Annual {{average daily}} traffic (AADT) values have long played an {{important}} role in transportation design, operations, planning, and policy making. However, AADT values are almost always rough estimates based on the closest short-period traffic counts, factored up using permanent automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorder</b> data. This study develops Kriging-based methods for mining network and count data, over time and space. Using Texas highway count data, the method forecasts future AADT values at locations where no traffic detectors are present. While low-volume road counts remain difficult to predict, available explanatory variables are very few, and extremely high-count outlier sites skew predictions in the data set used here, overall AADT-weighted median prediction error is 31 % percent (across all Texas network sites). Here, Kriging performed far better than other options for spatial extrapolation − such as assigning AADT based on a point’s nearest sampling site, which yields errors of 80 %. Beyond AADT estimation, Kriging is a promising way to explore spatial relationships across a wide variety of data sets, including, for example, pavement conditions, traffic speeds, population densities, land values, household incomes, and trip generation rates. Further refinements, including spatial autocorrelation functions based on network (rather than Euclidean) distances and inclusion of far more explanatory variables exist, and will further enhance estimation...|$|E

40|$|Accurate traffic counts are {{important}} for budgeting, traffic planning, and roadway design. With thousands of centerline miles of roadways, {{it is not possible}} to install continuous counters at all locations of interest (e. g., intersections). Therefore, at the vast majority of locations, MnDOT samples axle counts for short durations, called portable <b>traffic</b> <b>recorder</b> (PTR) sites, and obtains continuous counts from a small number of strategically important locations. The continuous-count data is leveraged to convert short-duration axle counts into average-annual-daily- traffic counts. This requires estimation of seasonal adjustment factors (SAFs) and axle correction factors at short- count locations. This project focused on developing a method for estimating SAFs for PTR sites. The continuous- count data was grouped into a small number of groups based on seasonal traffic-volume patterns. Traffic patterns at PTR sites were hypothesized by polling professional opinions and then verified by performing statistical tests. PTRs with matching seasonal patterns inherited SAFs from the corresponding continuous-count locations. Researchers developed a survey tool, based on the analytic hierarchy process, to elicit professional judgments. MnDOT staff tested this tool. The statistical testing approach was based on bootstrapping and computer simulation. It was tested using simulated data. The results of this analysis show that in the majority of cases, three weekly samples, one in each of the three seasons, will suffice to reliably estimate traffic patterns. Data could be collected over several years to fit MnDOT’s available resources. Sites that require many weeks of data (say, more than five) may be candidates for installation of continuous counters...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} examine potential areawide congestion indices using loop detector data, and to select one that best explains the congestion of a freeway system. Another objective was to determine the accuracy of the loop detector data. Seven potential congestion indices were calculated from TransGuide loop detector data for an entire month. These indices were evaluated to see which measures best fit the requirements of an effective areawide congestion index. From this research, it was determined that the travel rate ratio met all but one of the criteria of a successful index. Travel rate ratio is the ratio of congested travel time to travel time in free-flow conditions. The weakness of travel rate ratio is that it is an averaged value, so it cannot measure the extent (coverage) of the congestion. The average delay per vehicle in delay and congestion severity index met all but two of the criteria. Hourly traffic volume data from the TransGuide loop detector system and the Automatic <b>Traffic</b> <b>Recorder</b> (ATR) stations were checked for data accuracy. On average, the ATR traffic volumes were slightly more accurate than the TransGuide volumes. The volumes from two ATR stations were compared with nearby TransGuide loop detector volumes to evaluate the similarity of TransGuide and ATR volumes. It was concluded that even though the traffic volumes may be inaccurate, most of the loop detectors studied were strongly correlated with the ground truth due to consistent over-counting or under-counting...|$|E

Two basic questions: 2 ̆ 2 what are the traffic conditions on roadways now? 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 which traffic improvements are the best to choose? 2 ̆ 2 should be answered during the planning process. This study develops a new integrated statewide transportation and land use model system to help evaluate the effect of policy strategies and traffic network improvements. The research also proposes new methods to improve estimation of traffic volumes through the traffic monitoring system. ^ Research has shown that transportation and land use have a close relationship. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 required that metropolitan and statewide transportation plans be integrated with land-use plans. Therefore the integrated transportation and land use models are needed to assess the performance of urban policy strategies. In this study, the Land Use in Central Indiana 2 (LUCI 2) statewide urban simulation model is integrated with the statewide travel demand model (ISTDM) to form an integrated model system and to predict Indiana statewide travel demand. Different transportation and land use policy scenarios can be tested and compared using the INTRLUDE model system. The univariate sensitivity of VMT outputs on the model parameters and input data are carried out and analyzed. ^ To improve estimation of current traffic volumes, estimation of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), {{an essential element of}} statewide traffic monitoring program, is studied. Several new methods—Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Fuzzy Basis Function Network (FBFN) and Smooth Splines—are compared with the traditional method by using continuous traffic volume data from automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorder</b> (ATR) sites in Indiana. Novel unsupervised and supervised K-nearest neighbor algorithms using geographic information system (GIS) technology are developed and tested for the factor group process.

40|$|The National Park Service (NPS) is {{currently}} contemplating {{the implementation of}} a system-wide traffic monitoring program. While several of the national parks within this network collect continuous vehicle data at multiple stations within each park, these programs have not been examined for their efficiency and cost effectiveness. Therefore, as the NPS looks to expand their count program, this thesis investigates potential improvements using a sample set of five parks. To determine whether the national park seasonal and day-of-week traffic patterns exhibit consistency from one year to the next, the seasonal and day-of-week factors were compared across all five years. Using the Kruskal-Wallis test, it was determined that the seasonal and day-of-week factors were not statistically different from 2002 to 2006 for all five national parks. Therefore, it is recommended that the NPS consider reducing the amount of data that they collect by using short-duration counts in conjunction with a modest number of permanent counts. To determine whether data collection efforts can be shared amongst various entities, the national park traffic counts for 2002 to 2006 were compared to those of nearby state highway automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorder</b> (ATR) locations using correlation analyses. While the correlation values ranged from ?high? to ?negligible?, the distance between the park and ATR location had a direct effect on the magnitude of the value. Therefore, in order to achieve the greatest probability that the correlation will be ?high?, it is suggested that the NPS share data collection efforts using ATR locations within 20 miles of the park. To determine which design volume calculation method was most appropriate for the parks, design volumes were computed using two methods. Using the traditional Kfactor plot, it was determined that the 30 th highest hourly volumes should be used for urban parks as this is where the ?knee? occurs. Although {{this is not the case}} for rural parks, there is no compelling evidence to suggest a more appropriate design hour. Additionally, the method recommended by AASHTO for recreational roadways resulted in volumes that were frequently exceeded. Therefore, the K-factor plot method is most appropriate for both the urban and rural parks...|$|E

A {{literature}} review indicates that many highway and transportation agencies in North America and Europe use various traditional methods to impute their traffic counts. These methods can be broadly categorized into factor and time series analysis approaches. However, little or no {{research has been conducted}} to assess the imputation accuracy. The literature indicates that the current practices are varied, and the methods used by highway agencies are intuitive in nature. Typical imputation methods used by highway agencies are identified and applied to data from six automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recorders</b> (ATRs) in Alberta, Canada, to evaluate their accuracy. Statistical analysis shows that these traditional methods result in varying accuracy for traffic counts from different types of roads. In some cases, the imputation errors can be unacceptably high. Therefore, improved imputation methods are proposed. Study results indicate that imputation accuracy can be significantly improved by incorporating correction fac-tors and data from {{both before and after the}} failure periods into the traditional models. The improved imputations should provide transportation practitioners better information for decision marking purposes...|$|R
50|$|A {{traffic counter}} is a device, often {{electronic}} in nature, used to count, classify, and/or measure {{the speed of}} vehicular traffic passing along a given roadway. The device is usually deployed in near proximity to the roadway and uses an on-road medium, such as pneumatic road tubes laid across the roadway, piezo-electric sensors embedded in the roadway, inductive loops cut into the roadway, {{or a combination of}} these to detect the passing vehicles. Pneumatic road tubes are generally used for temporary studies to study a sample of traffic, while piezo-electric sensors and inductive loops are used for permanent studies which can ascertain seasonal traffic trends and are often used in congestion monitoring on major roads. One of the first traffic counting units, called <b>traffic</b> <b>recorders,</b> was introduced in 1937, operated off a strip laid across the street, and used a six volt battery. Each hour it printed off a paper strip with the total for that hour. Recently, off-road technologies have been developed. These devices generally use some sort of transmitted energy such as radar waves or infrared beams to detect vehicles passing over the roadway. These methods are generally employed where vehicle speeds and volume are required without classification which require on-road sensors.|$|R
