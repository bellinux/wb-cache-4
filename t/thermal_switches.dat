50|$|Unlike {{a thermal}} fuse, a thermal switch is usually reusable, and is {{therefore}} suited to protecting against temporary situations which are common and user-correctable. <b>Thermal</b> <b>switches</b> are used in power supplies in case of overload, and also as thermostats in some heating and cooling systems.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>thermal</b> <b>switches</b> must be reset {{manually}} {{after they}} have been tripped. This design is used when an automatic and unattended restart would create a hazardous condition, such as sudden startup of a powerful motor without warning. These types of thermal cutouts are usually reset by pressing a push-button by hand or with a special tool.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>switches</b> are {{included}} in some light fixtures, particularly with recessed lights, where excessive heat {{is most likely to}} occur. This may lead to [...] "cycling", where a light turns off and back on every few minutes. Flashing incandescent Christmas lights take advantage of this effect. Some flasher bulbs interrupt power when heated, while other twinkle/sparkle mini-bulbs momentarily shunt current around the filament.|$|E
50|$|Better-quality {{dehumidifiers}} {{may have}} a frost or ice sensor. These will turn off the machine and allow the ice-covered coils to warm and defrost. Once defrosted, the machine will automatically restart. Most ice sensors are simple <b>thermal</b> <b>switches</b> and do not directly sense {{the presence or absence}} of ice buildup. An alternative design senses the impeded airflow and shuts off the cooling coils in a similar manner.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>switches</b> on {{microprocessors}} often stop {{only the}} fetching of instructions to execute, reducing the clock rate to zero until a lower temperature is reached, while maintaining {{power to the}} cache to prevent data loss (although a second switch, with a higher triggering temperature, usually turns off even the cache and forces the computer to reboot). This mitigates the impact of programs resembling power viruses on the processor's longevity, while still accommodating their possible legitimate uses; it can also make overclocking possible with less risk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{satellite}} had a one-watt, [...] radio transmitting unit inside, {{developed by}} Vyacheslav I. Lappo from NII-885, the Moscow Electronics Research Institute, that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002MHz. Signals {{on the first}} frequency were transmitted in 0.3 sec pulses (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on-board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual <b>thermal</b> <b>switch,</b> and a control <b>thermal</b> <b>switch.</b> If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded [...] the fan was turned on and when it fell below [...] the fan was {{turned off by the}} dual <b>thermal</b> <b>switch.</b> If the temperature exceeded [...] or fell below , another control <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses. Sputnik 1 was filled with dry nitrogen, pressurized to 1.3 atm. The satellite had a barometric switch, activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> (sometimes <b>thermal</b> reset or {{thermal cutout}} (TCO)) is a device which {{normally}} opens {{at a high}} temperature (often with a faint [...] "plink" [...] sound) and re-closes when the temperature drops. The <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> may be a bimetallic strip, often encased in a tubular glass bulb {{to protect it from}} dust or short circuit. Another common design uses a bimetallic shallow dome-shaped cap which [...] "clicks" [...] to an inside-out inverted cap shape when heated, such as the [...] "Klixon" [...] brand of thermal cutouts.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{stability}} of output performance plays {{a very important}} role in the thermoelectric generation (TEG) system, but the fluctuation problem of heat source widely exists in the industry which releases the waste heat, and the fluctuating process will cause the instability and low efficiency of the TEG system. In this article, a novel TEG system with <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> was proposed to solve this serious problem. In order to get the detailed characteristics of the TEG system with <b>thermal</b> <b>switch,</b> experimental and dynamic modelling methods were used. The experimental and modelling results show that the <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> can efficiently reduce the temperature fluctuation and increase the output power and efficiency of the TEG system, and there is an optimal turning on temperature and turning off temperature to maximally increase the output power and electricity efficiency of the TEG system.

40|$|A {{bistable}} {{switching element}} {{is made of}} a material whose electrical resistance reversibly decreases in response to intercalation by positive ions. Flow of positive ions between the bistable switching element and a positive ion source is controlled {{by means of an}} electrical potential applied across a <b>thermal</b> <b>switching</b> element. The material of the <b>thermal</b> <b>switching</b> element generates heat in response to electrical current flow therethrough, which in turn causes the material to undergo a thermal phase transition from a high electrical resistance state to a low electrical resistance state as the temperature increases above a predetermined value. Application of the electrical potential in one direction renders the <b>thermal</b> <b>switching</b> element conductive to pass electron current out of the ion source. This causes positive ions to flow from the source into the bistable switching element and intercalate the same to produce a non-volatile, low resistance logic state. Application of the electrical potential in the opposite direction causes reverse current flow which de-intercalates the bistable logic switching element and produces a high resistance logic state...|$|R

40|$|As small {{satellites}} 2 ̆ 7 power-to-external area ratios increase, so {{does the}} ordeal of securing the necessary thermal radiator area. To provide robust temperature control for any conceivable power density, two new concepts are proposed: a satellite architecture based on deployed equipment modules for increased radiator area, and <b>thermal</b> <b>switches</b> on each package mounted to module panels. A beneficial synergy comes from employing these independent concepts on small satellites whose exterior panels serve as both equipment mounting decks and thermal radiators. Hypothetical examples of multiple module deployments demonstrate the potential for dramatic increases in effective radiator area that allows a comfortably large hot-case margin. Cold-case temperature control comes from <b>thermal</b> <b>switches</b> that vary package-to-deck interface pressure {{as a function of}} package temperature to provide high interface resistance at low temperature. Two such switches based on the temperature dependent properties of shape memory alloy and paraffin are described. Positive and negative comparisons are made to conventional thermal design and deployed radiators. The efficient and effective temperature control subsystem described reduces the need for: auxiliary heaters to maintain minimum temperatures, rigorous thermal design and analysis, design verification testing, sophisticated thermo-optical surfaces, and active temperature control (in the conventional sense) for the entire satellite. This has been a feasibility of concept study with no development hardware or testing. Opinions on usefulness, future direction, and potential application are solicited...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that the loss of {{aromaticity}} of gaseous molecules leads to a large increase of the enthalpy and to a tiny increase of the entropy. Generally, the calculated transition temperature from an aromatic structure towards a non-aromatic structure at which these two contributions cancel is very high. The entropy associated to the loss of aromaticity of adsorbed molecules, such as pyridine on Si(100) and on Ge(100), is roughly the same while the associated enthalpy is much smaller, a consequence of which is a low transition temperature. This allows us to imagine monomolecular devices, such as <b>thermal</b> <b>switches,</b> based on the difference of electrical conductivity between aromatic and non-aromatic species adsorbed on Si(100) or on Ge(100) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Recently, a novel single-switch access {{technology}} {{based on}} infrared thermography was proposed. The technology exploits the temperature {{differences between the}} inside and surrounding areas of the mouth as a switch trigger, thereby allowing voluntary switch activation upon mouth opening. However, for this technology to be clinically viable, it must be validated against a gold standard switch, such as a chin switch, that taps into the same voluntary motion. Methods In this study, we report an experiment designed to gauge the concurrent validity of the infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>switch.</b> Ten able-bodied adults participated {{in a series of}} 3 test sessions where they simultaneously used both an infrared thermal and conventional chin switch to perform multiple trials of a number identification task with visual, auditory and audiovisual stimuli. Participants also provided qualitative feedback about switch use. User performance with the two switches was quantified using an efficiency measure based on mutual information. Results User performance (p = 0. 16) and response time (p = 0. 25) with the infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> were comparable to those of the gold standard. Users reported preference for the infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> given its non-contact nature and robustness to changes in user posture. Conclusions Thermal infrared access technology appears to be a valid single switch alternative for individuals with disabilities who retain voluntary mouth opening and closing. </p...|$|R
