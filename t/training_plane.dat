2500|$|In August 1943, an Army {{newspaper}} reported that Westfall had [...] "washed out" [...] of the Army Air Corps flight school because, [...] "of all things, {{he was too}} nervous." [...] According to another account, he [...] "cracked up his plane while training." [...] (In actuality, he suffered from air sickness which culminated in his damaging a <b>training</b> <b>plane</b> during an attempted landing.) Westfall was subsequently reassigned to the Air Corps radio operator program at Scott Field in Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{while the}} RFI is {{specifically}} for a USAF trainer, it asked potential suppliers about {{the feasibility of}} a fighter/attack variant of the aircraft and a carrier-capable variant for the United States Navy. However, the requirements manager for the program, Stephan Lyon, has stated that {{it is unlikely that}} potential combat performance will be considered. Similarly, while Navy officials will be participating in some stages of the program, carrier suitability will not be part of the evaluation. Similarly, the Air Force considered the possibility of adapting the T-X aircraft to perform light attack and close air support as part of their effort to retire the A-10 Thunderbolt II. [...] With the T-X already invested in, making it a multirole combat and <b>training</b> <b>plane</b> could defray costs of developing a new attack jet that can operate efficiently in a low-threat environment. However, by 2016 the Air Force decided to pursue other aircraft to meet CAS requirements and not [...] "dilute" [...] the trainer program to support other missions.|$|E

[...] On 9 August 1941, a 17-year-old high school senior, Kenneth A Turner, won [...] "Flitfire New Jersey" [...] at the Basking Ridge Fire Company's 32nd annual carnival. [...] Turner immediately sold it for $1,200.00 to the Army Air Corps flight training facility at Somerset Hills Airport. [...] In September 1941, Ivan Stone of West Virginia flew his Flitfire to the now abandoned Princeton Airport in West Virginia. [...] Also in 1941, Leo Arany flew a Flitfire to Clatsop Airport in Astoria, Oregon. [...] In June 1941 Lon Cooper, a Civilian U.S. Army Air Corps Primary Flight Instructor, reported training in a silver Flitfire at Johnston Flying Service at Albert Whitted Airport in St. Petersburg, Florida. [...] "Flitfire Wisconsin" [...] was purchased 24 April 1941 by Stainislaw Aircraft Inc., a Piper dealer in West Bend, Wisconsin. It was sold to Racine Flying Service, Inc. in July 1941, who operated it in Wisconsin until 1951.|$|E
