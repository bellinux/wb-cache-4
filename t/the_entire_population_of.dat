5|$|Japanese ethnographer Ino Kanori {{was charged}} {{with the task of}} {{surveying}} <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Taiwanese aborigines, applying the first systematic study of aborigines on Taiwan. Ino's research {{is best known for his}} formalization of eight peoples of Taiwanese aborigines: Atayal, Bunun, Saisiat, Tsou, Paiwan, Puyuma, Ami and Pepo (Pingpu). This is the direct antecedent of the taxonomy used today to distinguish people groups that are officially recognized by the government.|$|E
5|$|The World Cup is {{the most}} prestigious {{association}} football tournament {{in the world as}} well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> the planet.|$|E
25|$|Norfolk Island, with {{neighbouring}} Nepean Island, {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> white-chested and slender-billed white-eyes, Norfolk parakeets and Norfolk gerygones, as well as over 1% <b>of</b> the world <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> wedge-tailed shearwaters and red-tailed tropicbirds.

5|$|Zou began a {{rebellion}} against the Han after learning of Yang's plot against him. A Han military campaign was dispatched and led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, military commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The revolt was repressed and the Han annexed Dongyue in {{the last months of}} 111 BC, conquering the remaining territory of the former Minyue. Sima Qian records that <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Dongyue was exiled, a claim that is implausible.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on the island. Eighteen species of land birds breed {{on the island and}} there are many more migratory species that occur on the island and its adjacent islets, many tame enough that it is possible for humans to get quite close. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's funeral train left Long Branch on {{the same}} special track that brought him there, {{traveling}} over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial. More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body lay in state in Washington; later, on September 25, 1881, in Cleveland, more than 150,000—a number equal to <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> that city—likewise paid their respects. His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built.|$|E

50|$|Violence {{increased}} as atrocities were committed {{on both sides}} : massacres in Catholic villages such as Fraissinet-de-Fourques, Valsauve and Potelières by camisards. Basville, a government administrator with a reputation founded on torture, deported <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> Mialet and Saumane. Then {{in the autumn of}} 1703 , with the king’s consent, the systematic « Burning of the Cévennes » destroyed 466 hamlets and exiled their populations.|$|R
5|$|In October 1810, Dubourdieu landed 700 Italian {{soldiers}} on Lissa while Hoste searched {{in vain for}} the French squadron in the Southern Adriatic. The island had been left in the command of two midshipmen, James Lew and Robert Kingston, who withdrew <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> the island into the central mountains along with their supplies. The Italian troops were left in possession of the deserted main town, Port St. George. The French and Italians burnt several vessels in the harbour and captured others, but remained on the island {{for no more than}} seven hours, retreating before Hoste returned. The remainder of the year was quiet, the British squadron gaining superiority after being reinforced by the third-rate ship of the line HMS Montagu.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there {{does not seem to have}} been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard {{remained}} {{unaffected by}} the German occupation of Norway in 1940. However, from 1941 the archipelago became of strategic importance in the supply chain between the Allied powers, {{as well as a}} source of badly needed coal. The Norwegian government-in-exile rejected a Soviet–British occupation; instead the British Army started Operation Gauntlet to evacuate Spitsbergen. On 29 August 1941, <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Ny-Ålesund was evacuated to Longyearbyen, and on 3 September 765 people were evacuated from Longyearbyen to Scotland. Later the last 150 men were also evacuated. With Longyearbyen depopulated, a small German garrison and air strip was established in Adventdalen, mostly to provide meteorological data. After the British Operation Fritham regained control of Barentsburg, the German forces left Longyearbyen without combat.|$|E
25|$|Florence is {{the central}} city of a {{metropolitan}} area with a total <b>population</b> <b>of</b> 205,566 (2010 US census), including <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> Florence and Darlington counties. However, in the more detailed 2000 Census data, only about 54% of this metro was urbanized, consisting of the urban areas Florence (2000 pop.: 67,314), Hartsville (14,907), Darlington (12,066), and Lake City (8,728). The remainder of the Florence metro is considered rural.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Jewish <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Biržai was annihilated. 15 Jews {{were shot}} to death by German {{soldiers}} at the Biržai Jewish cemetery in July 1941. On 8 August 1941, Gestapo and Lithuanian collaborators murdered <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Jewish <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, some 2,400 people, by shooting them to death at a mass grave in a forest grove 3 km outside the town.The town was almost completely burned down during the war.|$|R

5|$|The game is set {{during a}} fictional war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, {{in which both}} sides use nuclear and {{chemical}} weapons against each other. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fight conventional battles in continental Europe, whilst trying to avoid a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations will be destroyed by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Europe perishes. In order to request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code.|$|E
5|$|While the two fight, Strange {{activates}} Protocol 10, {{which is}} {{revealed to be}} a scheme to wipe out <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker {{can take advantage of}} the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population {{did not allow}} Rafael de Sobremonte to continue as Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a safe location {{in the case of}} a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires did not allow his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment at a later time. Liniers armed <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E

50|$|Yellowhead disease (YHD) is a viral {{infection}} of shrimp and prawn, in particular {{of the giant}} tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon), {{one of the two}} major species of farmed shrimp. The disease is highly lethal and contagious, killing shrimp quickly. Outbreaks of this disease have wiped out in a matter <b>of</b> days <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> many shrimp farms that cultivated P. monodon, i.e. particularly Southeast Asian farms. In Thai, the disease is called Hua leung.|$|R

The problem that causes the biggest disputes is the considerable percentage of disabilities, particularly mental ones, registered in this population, which exceeds manyfold their occurrence in <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two countries...|$|R
5|$|Although {{well above}} the draft age at 41 years old, Cooper enlisted for service in the United States Army in World War II in 1942. Immediately offered an officer's commission, he chose instead to enlist as a private. After basic training, he {{enrolled}} in Officer Candidate School at the Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan. He studied military government and graduated second in his class of 111 students. In 1943, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the XV Corps of General George Patton's Third Army as a courier in the military police. Cooper served in France, Luxembourg, and Germany. After liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp, Patton ordered <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> the nearby city of Weimar {{to go through it}} and observe the conditions; Cooper also viewed the camp at that time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan for the {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
5|$|In 431 BC, while peace {{already was}} precarious, ArchidamusII, Sparta's king, sent a new {{delegation}} to Athens, {{demanding that the}} Athenians submit to Sparta's demands. This deputation {{was not allowed to}} enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded Attica, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> the region to within the walls of Athens.|$|E

50|$|White spot {{syndrome}} {{virus is}} the lone virus (and type species) {{of the genus}} Whispovirus (white spot), {{which is the only}} genus in the family Nimaviridae. It is responsible for causing white spot syndrome {{in a wide range of}} crustacean hosts. White spot syndrome (WSS) is a viral infection of penaeid shrimp. The disease is highly lethal and contagious, killing shrimps quickly. Outbreaks of this disease have wiped out within a few days <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> many shrimp farms throughout the world.|$|R
5|$|The World Cup {{was first}} {{televised}} in 1954 {{and is now}} the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion. 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers. The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event. It was predicted that Brazil will bring in more than $11 billion in revenue for the 2014 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|A former colonial marshal on the {{backwater}} {{planet of}} Mar Sara, Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolutionaries in their {{fight against the}} tyrannical and corrupt Confederacy of Man, where he develops a relationship with Sarah Kerrigan, Mengsk's second in command. However, he quickly comes to realise that Mengsk {{is far from the}} force for good when he abandons Kerrigan and <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> a planet to die by the hand of the Zerg to satisfy his own thirst for power. Disillusioned and embittered, Raynor deserts Mengsk and becomes a persona non grata in the new Terran Dominion. The situation gets no better when Kerrigan, who was captured by the Zerg, is assimilated into the swarm and becomes one of their most powerful assets. After desertion, Raynor and his forces take part in major combat operations across the sector: He fights alongside the Protoss templar Tassadar in the battle that leads to the fall of the Zerg ruler, the Overmind, and splinters the Zerg into several factions. When the expeditionary forces of United Earth Directorate (UED) arrive in the sector to subjugate it, Raynor, Mengsk and Kerrigan (now calling herself the Queen of Blades) combine their Terran, Zerg and Protoss allies to repel the invasion. No sooner than they fall, the alliance shatters.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} for the Junta, {{he led the}} ill-fated Paraguay campaign. His troops were defeated by Bernardo de Velasco at the battles of Campichuelo and Paraguarí. Though he was defeated, the campaign initiated the {{chain of events that}} led to the Independence of Paraguay in May 1811. He retreated to the vicinity of Rosario, to fortify it against a possible royalist attack from the Eastern Band of the Uruguay River. While there, he created the flag of Argentina. The First Triumvirate did not approve the flag, but because of slow communications, Belgrano would only learn of that many weeks later, while reinforcing the Army of the North at Jujuy. There, knowing he was at a strategic disadvantage against the royalist armies coming from Upper Peru, Belgrano ordered the Jujuy Exodus, which evacuated <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Jujuy Province to San Miguel de Tucumán. His counter-offensive at the Battle of Tucumán resulted in a key strategic victory, and it was soon followed by a complete victory over the royalist army of Pío Tristán at the Battle of Salta. However, his deeper incursions into Upper Perú led to defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, leading the Second Triumvirate to order his replacement as Commander of the Army of the North by the newly arrived José de San Martín. By then, the Asamblea del Año XIII had approved the use of Belgrano's flag as the national war flag.|$|E
