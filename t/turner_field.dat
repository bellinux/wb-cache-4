The first regular season game played at <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> was on April 4, 1997 against the Chicago Cubs. The Braves were losing 4–3 {{in the eighth inning}} when Chipper Jones drove in the tying run. A Michael Tucker single gave the Braves the lead as they won their first regular season game at <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> 5–4.|$|E
25|$|Of the 10 Braves whose {{numbers were}} retired prior to Turner Field's closure, eight (Spahn, Mathews, Aaron, Niekro, Cox, Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz) were {{elected to the}} National Baseball Hall of Fame, while Jones was not yet eligible, and Murphy's {{eligibility}} expired without election. Only Glavine, Jones, Maddux, and Smoltz appeared in games at <b>Turner</b> <b>Field.</b> Cox managed the team for 25 seasons in all, including its first 14 seasons in <b>Turner</b> <b>Field.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Braves {{selected}} {{a type of}} grass called [...] "Seashore Paspalum, Platinum TE" [...] for the stadium. The Braves replaced <b>Turner</b> <b>Field's</b> Tifway 419 hybrid Bermuda grass in the infield in 2012 in hopes the softer, thicker paspalum would slow down the playing surface a bit {{for the benefit of}} their infielders. The Bermuda remained in <b>Turner</b> <b>Field's</b> outfield, while the grassed areas of foul territory also were switched to paspalum. At SunTrust Park, the entire field is paspalum. It is a popular choice for beach golf courses. It also is used at Minute Maid Park and Marlins Park.|$|R

25|$|In April and May 2014, Georgia State University {{officials}} {{expressed an}} interest in acquiring <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> and converting it into a 30,000-seat open-air stadium for the Panthers football program. New development, including retail, residential and student housing, would also be put into use on the <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> site. Additionally, a new baseball field would be built on the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium site, incorporating the outfield wall where Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run. While Mayor Reed showed preference towards Georgia State's plan, at least three offers from other developers were up for consideration. On August 13, 2015, the Braves officially gave notice to the city of Atlanta and Fulton County that the team would not exercise the option to extend their lease at <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> and would vacate the stadium by December 31, 2016, allowing the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority to move forward with any redevelopment plans. On November 23, 2015, Georgia State submitted an alternative proposal for redeveloping <b>Turner</b> <b>Field,</b> where portions of the current ballpark would be rebuilt into a mixed retail and housing development and a new football-specific stadium would be constructed north of <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> along with the new baseball field. While vetting bids for redevelopment, two casino firms showed interest in the <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> property; however, they did not submit bids due to Mayor Reed's and the community's opposition to casino gaming. On December 21, 2015, the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority announced that they have accepted the joint bid by Georgia State University and real estate firm Carter for the stadium property. Georgia State was considered the front-runner for the property as the other two bids submitted were from little known entities with no documented redevelopment experience. Residents of the Summerhill neighborhood expressed their criticism for Turner Field's quick sale without their input; however, city and county officials stated that a quick sale was necessary to keep the burden of the stadium's security and upkeep from falling on the tax payers' shoulders once the Braves move out. On August 18, 2016, Georgia State and the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority reached a tentative purchase agreement for <b>Turner</b> <b>Field,</b> and the purchase and redevelopment plan was approved by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia on November 9, 2016. On January 5, 2017, the sale of the <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> property to Georgia State was officially closed, with the stadium conversion project beginning in February 2017. The stadium conversion will occur over multiple phases, while the first phase was completed in time for Georgia State's opener on August 31, 2017.|$|E

The only Major League Baseball All-Star Game ever to be played at <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> was in 2000.

Then, after forcing the Colts to punt again, Namath completed 4 passes for 40 yards to set up <b>Turner's</b> 30-yard <b>field</b> goal to increase the lead, 13-0. On that drive, Namath temporarily {{went out of the}} game after injuring his right thumb, and was replaced by backup quarterback Babe Parilli for a few plays.

5000|$|The {{ballpark}} {{features an}} expanded protection from foul balls. The protective netting extends from behind home plate {{to the far}} end of both dugouts at SunTrust Park. Although longer, SunTrust Park's protective netting isn't quite as high as <b>Turner</b> <b>Field's.</b> The screen is 31 ½ feet high, compared to 35 feet high at the former stadium. Derek Schiller attributed that difference to the geometry of SunTrust Park and where the cables that hold up the screen are secured to stadium structures. From directly behind home plate, the screen extends 145 feet down the third-base line and 149 feet down the first-base line, according to Braves field director Ed Mangan. Schiller said innovations have made protective screens [...] "thinner but in fact stronger," [...] meaning [...] "we're getting the ability to cover the most number of seats with the least view issues as possible." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{third quarter}} {{belonged to the}} Jets, who {{controlled}} the ball for all but three minutes of the period. Baltimore ran only seven offensive plays all quarter, gaining only 11 yards.

25|$|<b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> {{was also}} home to the first NL Wild Card Game in 2012 between the Braves and St. Louis Cardinals. The Braves were behind 6–3 {{in the bottom of}} the 8th inning when Andrelton Simmons hit a fly ball to shallow left field that dropped in between Cardinals shortstop Pete Kozma and left fielder Matt Holliday. Umpire Sam Holbrook called Simmons out, citing the infield fly rule. Had an infield fly not been called, Simmons would have been {{credited}} with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out. Fans at <b>Turner</b> <b>Field</b> began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes. The Braves lost the game 6–3, ending their season.|$|E
25|$|With the Mets, on April 10, 2005, at <b>Turner</b> <b>Field,</b> Martínez outdueled John Smoltz, {{pitching}} a two-hit, one-run, complete game {{en route to}} his first Mets victory.

25|$|In 1930, {{crude oil}} was {{discovered}} in the <b>Turner</b> Valley <b>field,</b> below and {{to the west of}} the gas cap.

50|$|The last of <b>Turner's</b> three <b>field</b> {{goals in}} Super Bowl III was for 9 yards, the {{shortest}} in Super Bowl history.

Mike Clark of the Dallas Cowboys tied Turner's record for the shortest Super Bowl field goal in Super Bowl VI.|$|R

[...] After <b>Turner's</b> second <b>field</b> goal, with 4 minutes {{left in the}} third quarter, Colts head coach Don Shula took Morrall out of the game and put in the sore-armed Johnny Unitas {{to see if he could}} provide a spark to Baltimore's offense.
