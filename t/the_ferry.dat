5|$|In 1947 Hammerton {{retired after}} 38 years of {{operating}} <b>the</b> <b>ferry,</b> leaving <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> and boathouse to Sandy Scott.|$|E
5|$|Local {{resident}} William Windham {{had been}} sub-tutor to Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, {{and was the}} former husband of Mary, Lady Deloraine, mistress to George II. As a reward for his services, George II leased Windham the right to operate <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> until 1798. Windham sub-let the right to operate <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> to local resident Henry Holland. With <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> unable to serve {{the demands of the}} area, in 1772 Windham sought Parliamentary approval to replace <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> with a wooden bridge, to be paid for by tolls.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ferry</b> {{currently}} operates {{between a}} floating boathouse {{on the north}} bank of the Thames and a rudimentary jetty on the south bank. The boathouse is also in use as a private mooring for leisure craft. <b>The</b> <b>ferry</b> operates on all weekends, and weekdays between February and October. As well as <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> service, rowboats, canoes and motorboats can also be hired from the boathouse.|$|E
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> {{domestic}} <b>ferry</b> routes gradually disappeared after World War II. They {{were replaced}} by <b>the</b> Oslo <b>Ferries</b> in 1974 {{and a few years}} later followed <b>the</b> Bornholm <b>Ferries.</b> <b>The</b> Oslo <b>Ferries</b> moved to <b>the</b> northern tip of Amerikakaj in the 2000s while <b>the</b> Bornholm <b>Ferries</b> moved to Køge.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of bridges, tidal <b>ferries</b> provided <b>the</b> only means to cross the river. Tides propelled <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> along guide ropes anchored on both sides. However, <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> were unable to operate during bad weather, and travelers could be stranded on each side. Replacing <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> with bridges would be a major advance in transportation.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to revitalize a {{shipbuilding}} industry, Clark undertook <b>the</b> B.C. fast <b>ferries</b> initiative, {{which was designed to}} upgrade <b>the</b> existing BC <b>Ferries</b> fleet as well as jump start the shipbuilding industry in Vancouver. Although <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> were eventually produced, the project had massive cost overruns and long delays, and <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> were never able to function up to expectations. <b>The</b> <b>ferries</b> were later sold by the incoming Liberal government, for a fraction of their original price, to the American owned Washington Marine Group.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ferry</b> {{marks the}} {{starting}} point of the Great River Race and is on the course of the Twickenham Regatta. As <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> has right-of-way over rowed craft, the races have to be carefully timed to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> does not interfere with their running.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{seasonal}} ferry to Provincetown {{and several other}} excursion lines that offer cruises of Plymouth Bay and Cape Cod Bay. <b>The</b> <b>ferry</b> is operated by Capt. John Boats and offers one round trip daily from June to September. <b>The</b> <b>ferry</b> leaves from the State Wharf in Plymouth Center. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>ferry,</b> Plymouth Harbor offers service for harbor excursions, whale watching tours, and deep sea fishing.|$|E
5|$|After Lee's death, {{his wife}} Emma {{continued}} to operate <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below {{the confluence of}} the Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee's Backbone segment. However, this route could not be used in the summer months due to dangerous high water levels from snowmelt. In 1879, the LDS Church bought <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family. In 1896 <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> was transferred to Jim Emett, who installed a cable across the Colorado River {{to reduce the risk of}} boats washing downstream during high water.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ferries</b> are {{catamarans}} constructed out of aluminium, {{which was}} quite rare when the initial two crafts were constructed in <b>the</b> 1970s. <b>The</b> <b>ferries</b> are double-ended {{so that they}} can travel in either direction without turning around. There are four diesel engines in each vessel, one for each propeller. The propulsion system uses a marine version of the same diesel engine used to power many of the diesel buses on the transit system. <b>The</b> <b>ferries</b> can operate with only three engines if required. <b>The</b> <b>ferries</b> are equipped with radar, allowing them to operate in dense fog.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Kammon <b>ferry</b> {{connected}} Shimonoseki Station and Mojikō Station {{crossing the}} Kanmon Strait connecting Honshū and Kyūshū. This was <b>the</b> first train <b>ferry</b> service in Japan starting operation on 1 October 1911. <b>The</b> train <b>ferries</b> used piers at Komorie station. After {{the completion of}} the Kanmon Tunnel on 1 July 1942, the service was discontinued and <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> were transferred to <b>the</b> Ukō <b>Ferry</b> operation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ferrys</b> {{said that}} they often spent time {{skimming}} newspaper articles for noteworthy organizations or individuals who needed money, and they would often write checks without being asked. For instance, <b>the</b> <b>Ferrys</b> once supported a doctor in a small, poor, all-black neighborhood who was running his own clinic there; the doctor had {{never even heard of}} <b>the</b> <b>Ferrys</b> when until he received their first check, and they continued to support him for several years.|$|R
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1842, the {{existing}} route became impassable, and Clifton undertook {{the creation of the}} proposed coastal route. He sent his company's men to clear the path and make a road. The first report of the new road was on 19 October, praising the new route but deriding the almost impassable obstacles presented by the large rivers en route. The Australind–Mandurah route was completed by 2 November, and the speed of the new route allowed almost daily communication. It could be travelled in 32 hours, with a ferry to cross the estuary at Mandurah. <b>The</b> <b>ferry</b> was operated, and later owned, by nearby resident Mrs Lyttleton, as the government was not interested at that time in owning or leasing out <b>the</b> <b>ferry.</b> The government later appropriated <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> on 2 February 1843, and imposed standardised tolls for passengers and livestock. Ten years later, <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> service was made available to the public free of charge.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ferry</b> {{typically}} attracts {{about two}} million passengers a year; occupants of vehicles (including drivers) are counted as passengers. Ferry patronage is still high for vehicles, but has fallen away to minimal numbers for foot passengers. In 2012 <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> carried around 20,000 vehicles and 50,000 passengers weekly.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} route also {{follows the}} river {{along the edge}} of the Laramie Mountains to an area near the current towns of Casper and Glenrock. In 1847, during the first Mormon emigration, Brigham Young established a ferry near present-day Casper known as Mormon Ferry. The next year <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> was moved a few miles downriver. <b>The</b> <b>ferry</b> was free for Latter Day Saints, but charged a toll for other users. <b>The</b> <b>ferry</b> was manned by groups of Mormons every summer from 1848 until 1852. In 1853 John Baptiste Richard built a toll bridge near <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> site, which would eventually put all ferries on the North Platte out of business. In 1859, Louis Guinard built the Platte Bridge near the site of the original Mormon Ferry. Guinard also built a trading post at one end of the bridge which eventually became Fort Caspar.|$|E
50|$|Ferries operate between Port of Spain and Scarborough. Cars can {{be brought}} onto <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> and kept in <b>the</b> cargo areas. <b>Ferries</b> run daily, Sundays to Sunday (less sailings on <b>the</b> weekend). <b>The</b> <b>ferries</b> are inexpensive, {{in spite of the}} minimum 2½-3 hour travel time between Port of Spain and Scarborough.|$|R
5000|$|Styrsöbolaget, a ferry {{company in}} Gothenburg, which {{operates}} <b>the</b> cross-river <b>ferries</b> (Älvsnabben) {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> to <b>the</b> south archipelago.|$|R
2500|$|Tsawwassen is {{also home}} to <b>the</b> Tsawwassen <b>Ferry</b> Terminal, which is served by BC <b>Ferries.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ferries</b> go to <b>the</b> {{following}} destinations: ...|$|R
5|$|A local {{tradition}} {{holds that}} a tunnel connects Ham House and Marble Hill House, paralleling {{the route of}} <b>the</b> <b>ferry.</b> However, {{there is no evidence}} that this is the case.|$|E
5|$|According to an August 2017 {{customer}} satisfaction survey, passengers had a mostly positive {{view of the}} NYC Ferry system, with 93% of riders giving positive ratings. Almost 70% of the 1,300 riders surveyed gave <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> the highest possible rating.|$|E
5|$|Air Greenland co-owns the Arctic Umiaq Line jointly (50% each) with Royal Arctic, Greenland's government-owned {{shipping}} line. Arctic Umiaq runs <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> M/S Sarfaq Ittuk among Greenland's {{coastal communities}} from Ilulissat {{in the north}} to Narsaq in the south.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, before <b>the</b> BC <b>Ferry</b> Corporation {{took over}} services, Departure Bay was served by <b>the</b> Black Ball <b>Ferries</b> Kahloke and Chinook. See {{the section on}} the history of <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> in <b>the</b> area above.|$|R
50|$|On April 6, 2012, a NY Waterway <b>ferry</b> rescued <b>the</b> {{crew of the}} Katherine G, a tugboat that capsized near Liberty Island. <b>The</b> <b>ferry's</b> captain, Mohamed Gouda, {{had also}} {{commanded}} one of <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> that participated in the flight 1549 rescue.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Guangdong-Hainan <b>Ferry,</b> or <b>the</b> Yuehai <b>Ferry</b> (part of <b>the</b> Guangdong-Hainan Railway) [...] is {{a vehicle}} and Train ferry {{connecting}} Hainan Island to Guangdong in mainland China. <b>The</b> <b>ferries</b> run across <b>the</b> Qiongzhou Strait, between Zhanjiang, Guangdong and Haikou, Hainan.|$|R
5|$|Despite Coventry's warning Royal {{dissatisfaction with}} the inefficient service {{provided}} by the Hale Family, who by 1706 had kept <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> for over 150 years, continued to grow. This culminated in the decision by Queen Anne to provide a fixed bridge crossing on the site.|$|E
5|$|Highway 33 has two sections, {{which are}} joined by the Glenora Ferry, an auto ferry {{crossing}} the Bay of Quinte from Glenora to Adolphustown. The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), which maintains Highway33, also provides <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> service free of charge.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, the South Beach Branch was {{extended}} from Arrochar {{to a new}} terminal at South Beach. In 1897, the terminal at Saint George, which served the railroad and <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> to Manhattan, was completed.|$|E
5000|$|John Doty {{became a}} shareholder, and the vessels {{belonging}} to <b>the</b> Doty <b>Ferry</b> Company were purchased {{as part of}} the venture. <b>The</b> Island Park <b>Ferry</b> Company and most of the other vessels in <b>the</b> city's <b>ferry</b> boat business were also acquired, giving <b>the</b> Toronto <b>Ferry</b> Company a virtual monopoly on hauling the public to and from the Island. It was reported that, [...] "six of <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> were built by The John Doty Engine Works." ...|$|R
50|$|Bastø Fosen AS is a {{shipping}} company that operates <b>the</b> Moss-Horten <b>Ferry,</b> <b>the</b> most trafficked <b>ferry</b> route in Norway. The company, which operates <b>the</b> three <b>ferries</b> MF Bastø I, MF Bastø II and MF Bastø III, carried 1.3 million cars and 2.5 million passengers in 2006. The crossing takes 30 minutes, and <b>the</b> <b>ferries</b> provide two departures per hour {{throughout the day}} in each direction, with reduced schedules on the weekends.|$|R
50|$|Kingswear {{is linked}} to Dartmouth, {{on the other side}} of the River Dart, by three <b>ferries.</b> <b>The</b> Higher <b>Ferry</b> and <b>the</b> Lower <b>Ferry</b> are both {{vehicular}} <b>ferries.</b> <b>The</b> Passenger <b>Ferry,</b> as its name suggests, carries only passengers. The nearest bridge across the Dart is in Totnes, some 12 mi away by road.|$|R
5|$|In July 2007 <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> briefly made {{headlines}} when owner Francis Spencer saved from drowning a woman found {{floating in the}} Thames. After the rescue, the woman left the scene and was never identified.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the master}} plan {{was passed by}} the Council of State. On 10 December 1992, Parliament {{approved}} advanced payment of tolls on <b>the</b> <b>ferry,</b> which were made effective from 1 January 1993. Ticket prices increased with between NOK10 and 12. This resulted in protests from <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> employees who stated {{that they would have to}} collect the tolls which would remove their jobs; Norwegian Seafarers' Union representatives stated that they considered suing the state. Work on the development plan started in 1992. It included safety and environmental improvements which increased the project's cost by NOK200 million. In May 1994, it was made subject to consultative statements.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, the NY Waterway-operated East River Ferry line started operations. The {{route is}} a 7-stop East River service that {{runs in a}} loop between East 34th Street and Hunters Point, making two {{intermediate}} stops in Brooklyn and three in Queens. <b>The</b> <b>ferry,</b> {{an alternative to the}} New York City Subway, cost $4 per one-way ticket. It was instantly popular, with two to six times the number of passengers that the city predicted would ride the ferries. From June to November 2011, <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> accommodated 2,862 riders on an average weekday, as opposed to a projection of 1,488 riders, and it had 4,500 riders on an average weekend, six times the city's projected ridership; in total, <b>the</b> <b>ferry</b> saw 350,000 riders in that period, over 250% of the initial ridership forecast of 134,000 riders.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Likoni <b>Ferry</b> is a boat service {{across the}} Kilindini Harbour, serving both the island city of Mombasa and the Kenyan {{mainland}} town of Likoni. Two - four double-ended <b>ferries</b> alternate across <b>the</b> harbour, carrying both road and foot traffic. <b>The</b> <b>ferries</b> are operated by <b>the</b> Kenya <b>Ferry</b> Services (KFS), and is <b>the</b> only remaining <b>ferry</b> service by KFS. <b>The</b> Likoni <b>ferry</b> started operating in 1937. Passenger services are free while vehicles, tuktuks and motorcycles {{have to pay}} a ferry toll.|$|R
50|$|There is {{service to}} <b>the</b> Oakland <b>Ferry</b> Terminal, <b>the</b> Sausalito <b>Ferry</b> Terminal, and <b>the</b> Ayala Cove <b>Ferry</b> Terminal on Angel Island.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Webbs Creek <b>Ferry</b> {{is one of}} two cable ferry {{crossings}} at Wisemans <b>Ferry,</b> <b>the</b> other being <b>the</b> eponymous Wisemans <b>Ferry,</b> which crosses <b>the</b> Hawkesbury River to a point downstream of {{the confluence}} with the Macdonald River.
