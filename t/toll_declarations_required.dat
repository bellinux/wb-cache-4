40|$|The {{main focus}} of the master thesis lies on {{developing}} a methodology to analyse the accuracy of <b>toll</b> <b>declarations</b> within a satellite based toll system. This methodology employs two different approaches to determine reasons why Toll Service Providers (TSP) deliver <b>toll</b> <b>declarations</b> that show charge inaccuracies. Both approaches are carried out to analyse {{the results of the}} ARENA project’s field test which was held in April 2010 to test On Board Unit (OBU) solutions for toll collection. In particular, the charge reports of companies that participated in the field test are analysed. An overview of satellite based tolling systems with regards to the design of the associated pricing lists and <b>toll</b> <b>declaration</b> requirements has shown that many differences among the tolling systems in Europe exist. In addition a practical analysis of the available test data is performed. The first approach is to use the delivered raw data from the compliance check reports to create a new set of charge reports. This set of newly created charge reports is then compared to the TSPs’ delivered charge reports and the known true charge report. Significant correlations between the TSP’s charge reports and the newly created ones are identified which lead {{to the conclusion that the}} raw data has been facilitated by the TSP to calculate the fees within the charge reports. The results of the comparison when applying the first approach to the ARENA test data prove that the reason for the inaccuracies does not lie in the wrong calculation of the fees according to the ARENA pricing list but lies within the raw GPS data itself. The second facilitated approach is to visualise the GPS data in ArcGIS in order to analyse the reported trajectories. Therefore the true route, the reported trajectory and data from a reference OBU is used as an input. The results of applying the second approach to the ARENA test results show that inaccuracies were caused by failing to collect GPS data during power outages. Furthermore it is determined that there were data management problems on the TSP side regarding the time stamps of the reported test data...|$|R

Liberal and secular groups walked out of the constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamism, while the Muslim Brotherhood supported Morsi.|$|R
50|$|Although Parliament passed <b>declarations</b> <b>requiring</b> {{conformity}} to episcopacy and the liturgy, and ordering {{the burning of}} the Covenant, Bramhall could not carry his bills for a uniform tithe system, and for extending episcopal leases.

The ejection of Irish nonconformists was carried out by episcopal activity, some time before the passing of the English Act of Uniformity of 1662. Armagh was not a specially presbyterian diocese, and Bramhall used moderation.|$|R

5000|$|Netstrings can {{be stored}} recursively. The result of {{encoding}} a sequence of strings is a single string. Rewriting the above [...] "hello world!" [...] example to instead be a sequence of two netstrings, itself encoded as a single netstring, gives the following: 17:5:hello,6:world!,,Parsing such a nested netstring {{is an example of}} duck typing, since the contained string ("5:hello,6:world!,") is both a string and a sequence of netstrings. Its effective type is determined by how the application chooses to interpret it, not by any explicit type <b>declaration</b> <b>required</b> by the netstring specification. However, an application could use a tagged union convention to describe the types of nested netstrings, thereby establishing a self-describing hierarchical format.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{his or her}} accession, a new {{sovereign}} {{is required}} by law to make and subscribe several oaths. The Bill of Rights of 1689 first required the sovereign to make a public declaration of non-belief in Roman Catholicism. This declaration, known as the Accession <b>Declaration,</b> is <b>required</b> to be taken at either the first meeting of parliament of his or her reign (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation, whichever occurs first. The current wording of this declaration was adopted in 1910 as the previous wording was deemed to be controversial and overtly anti-Catholic. Rather than denouncing Roman Catholicism, the sovereign now declares him or herself to be a Protestant and that he or she will [...] "uphold and maintain" [...] the Protestant succession. In addition to the Accession Declaration, the new sovereign is required by the Acts of Union 1707 to make an oath to [...] "maintain and preserve" [...] the Church of Scotland. This oath is normally made at the sovereign's first meeting of the Privy Council following his or her accession. According to the Regency Act 1937, should the sovereign be under the age of 18, such oaths and <b>declarations</b> <b>required</b> to be taken by the sovereign shall be made upon his attainment of that age.|$|R

40|$|Object-oriented {{languages}} offer {{mechanisms to}} help structure large programs. However, the semantics of these constructs {{are often not}} very precisely defined. For example, the use of inheritance {{as a substitute for}} subtype polymorphism in many object-oriented languages either leads to an unsound or a too inflexible type system. In addition, ideas from module constructs of functional languages could increase the expressiveness of object-oriented languages and vice versa. We propose to design module constructs incorporating the best features found among module constructs of object-oriented languages and of functional languages. In particular, we plan to incorporate parametric polymorphism, subtype polymorphism, overloading, type abstraction, and compile-time type inference in a semantically clean manner. We try to achieve this with a minimumamount of <b>declarations</b> <b>required</b> from the programmer and a minimum amount of run-time type information. 1 Introduction Module constructs are generally [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The notable {{omissions}} {{in language}} {{used to refer}} to withdrawal are the words the, all, and the June 5, 1967, lines. I refer to the English text of the resolution. The French and Soviet texts differ from the English in this respect, but the English text was voted on by the Security Council, and thus it is determinative. In other words, there is lacking a <b>declaration</b> <b>requiring</b> Israel to withdraw from the (or all the) territories occupied by it on and after June 5, 1967. Instead, the resolution stipulates withdrawal from occupied territories without defining the extent of withdrawal. And it can be inferred from the incorporation of the words secure and recognized boundaries that the territorial adjustments to be made by the parties in their peace settlements could encompass less than a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied territories by Goldberg.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system that}} we are developing, whose purpose is to automatically transform data parallel Fortran 90 programs for execution on MIMD distributed memory architectures. The system is called ADAPT (for `Array Distribution Automatic Parallelisation Tool'). Programs for the system should make full use of the array features of Fortran 90, as parallelism is automatically extracted from the array syntax. Parallelisation is by data-partitioning, guided by `distribution' declarations that the user inserts in his program [...] -these being the only additions required to standard Fortran 90 programs. This paper gives {{a brief overview of}} the array features of Fortran 90, describes the `distribution' <b>declarations</b> <b>required</b> by ADAPT, and gives details of the parallelisation scheme. 1 Introduction It is evident that distributed memory MIMD architectures have several advantages over shared memory and vector systems, among which are cost effectiveness, scaleability and, for suitable applications, [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The {{house was}} {{subjected}} to an attack on its rights and property in 1533 by one Verney, when Thomas Cromwell showed himself disposed in their favour. Richard Yngworth, the prior, on 16 December sent him a present of apples, and thanked him for his help and counsel to the provincial superior, John Hilsey, by which he himself was enabled to serve God quietly and keep his study and office without trouble. Verney several months later was still causing the convent annoyance and loss, but the prior would not take steps against him without Cromwell's leave. Yngworth's attitude here expresses his policy, which was complete subservience to Cromwell, naturally for his own advancement. In April 1534 he went on a visitation to the eastern counties to secure the acknowledgement by the friars of the king's claim to be supreme head of the English Church, and later made himself useful to Hilsey elsewhere in the same business. The convent at Langley, needless to say, made the formal <b>declaration</b> <b>required.</b>|$|R
