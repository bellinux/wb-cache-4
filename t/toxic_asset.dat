50|$|<b>Toxic</b> <b>asset</b> is {{a popular}} term for certain {{financial}} assets whose value has fallen significantly and {{for which there is}} no longer a functioning market, so that such assets cannot be sold at a price satisfactory to the holder. Because assets are offset against liabilities and frequently leveraged, this decline in price may be quite dangerous to the holder. The term became common during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, in which they played a major role.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the market}} for toxic assets ceases to function, it is {{described}} as [...] "frozen". Markets for some toxic assets froze in 2007, and the problem grew much worse {{in the second half}} of 2008. Several factors contributed to the freezing of <b>toxic</b> <b>asset</b> markets. The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions, and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets. Banks and other major financial institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices, since lower prices would force them to reduce significantly their stated assets, making them, at least on paper, insolvent.|$|E

50|$|On March 23, 2009, Geithner {{announced}} a Public-Private Investment Program (P-PIP) to buy toxic assets from banks' balance sheets. The major stock market indexes in the United States rallied {{on the day}} of the announcement rising by over six percent with the shares of bank stocks leading the way. P-PIP has two primary programs. The Legacy Loans Program will attempt to buy residential loans from bank's balance sheets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will provide non-recourse loan guarantees for up to 85 percent of the purchase price of legacy loans. Private sector asset managers and the U.S. Treasury will provide the remaining assets. The second program is called the legacy securities program, which will buy residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) that were originally rated AAA and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS) which are rated AAA. The funds will come in many instances in equal parts from the U.S. Treasury's TARP monies, private investors, and from loans from the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). The initial size of the Public Private Investment Partnership is projected to be $500 billion. Economist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman has been very critical of this program arguing the non-recourse loans lead to a hidden subsidy that will be split by asset managers, banks' shareholders and creditors. Banking analyst Meredith Whitney argues that banks will not sell bad assets at fair market values because they are reluctant to take asset write downs. Economist Linus Wilson, a frequent commenter on TARP related issues, also points to excessive misinformation and erroneous analysis surrounding the U.S. <b>toxic</b> <b>asset</b> auction plan. Removing toxic assets would also reduce the volatility of banks' stock prices. This lost volatility will hurt the stock price of distressed banks. Therefore, such banks will only sell toxic assets at above market prices.|$|E
40|$|Charles Zheng (2009) {{purports to}} model the U. S. <b>toxic</b> <b>asset</b> auction plan. In the model, “moderately poor bidders outbid rich bidders in such auctions,” because poor bidders have less to lose by {{defaulting}} on taxpayer loans. Thus, says Zheng: “After defeating their rich rivals and acquiring the toxic assets, such bidders will default on government-provided loans whenever the toxic assets {{turn out to be}} unsalvageable. ” The chief trouble with the paper is that the assumptions do not fit reality. In reality, the government-provided loans used to buy toxic assets are nonrecourse, allowing the borrower {{to walk away from the}} loan with no penalties besides ceding the asset that the loan purchased. Thus, there is nothing to make rich bidders less ready to win the auction. Zheng’s conclusions that less well endowed borrowers will win <b>toxic</b> <b>asset</b> auctions are erroneous. Further Zheng’s use of auctions {{to model the}}se plans is largely inappropriate since only one of the three government <b>toxic</b> <b>asset</b> plans has government backed investors bid for the same <b>toxic</b> <b>asset</b> in an auction format. auctions,bailout,banking,CMBS,CDOs,EESA,Emergency Economic Stabilization Act,lending,Legacy Loans Program,Legacy Securities Program,mortgages,nonrecourse loans,Public-Private Investment Partnership,PPIP,TALF,Term Asset Lending Facility,Troubled Asset...|$|E

40|$|With banking sectors {{worldwide}} still {{suffering from}} the effects of the financial crisis, public discussion of plans to place <b>toxic</b> <b>assets</b> in one or more bad banks has gained steam in recent weeks. The following paper presents a plan how governments can efficiently relieve ailing banks from <b>toxic</b> <b>assets</b> by transferring these assets into a publicly sponsored work-out unit, a so-called bad bank. The key element of the plan is the valuation of troubled assets at their current market value - assets with no market would thus be valued at zero. The current shareholders will cover the losses arising from the depreciation reserve in the amount of the difference of the toxic assets' current book value and their market value. Under the plan, the government would bear responsibility for the management and future resale of <b>toxic</b> <b>assets</b> at its own cost and recapitalize the good bank by taking an equity stake in it. In extreme cases, this would mean a takeover of the bank by the government. The risk to taxpayers from this investment would be acceptable, however, once the banks are freed from <b>toxic</b> <b>assets.</b> A clear emphasis that the government stake is temporary would also be necessary. The government would cover the bad bank's losses, while profits would be distributed to the distressed bank's current shareholders. The plan is viable independent of whether the government decides to have one centralized bad bank or to establish a separate bad bank for each systemically relevant banking institute. Under the terms of the plan, bad banks and nationalization are not alternatives but rather {{two sides of the same}} coin. This plan effectively addresses three key challenges. It provides for the transparent removal of <b>toxic</b> <b>assets</b> and gives the banks a fresh start. At the same time, it offers the chance to keep the cost to taxpayers low. In addition, the risk of moral hazard is curtailed. The comparison of the proposed design with the bad bank plan of the German government reveals some shortcomings of the latter plan that may threaten the achievement of these key issues.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how US companies used the Level 3 provisions of fair value accounting to value their financial assets during the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) when relevant accounting rules regarding fair value measurements were relaxed.

Substantially large amounts of potentially manipulable toxic assets, classified as Level 3 by US companies, are of significant importance to the US and global economy. Results of the study indicate that financially distressed companies were holding significantly larger amounts of Level 3 financial assets, which are those based on management’s own modeling of inputs. Level 3 assets are thought to be more subjectively manipulable than Level 1 or 2 inputs that are based on quoted market prices.

40|$|It is said among historians, {{that there}} are two {{remarkable}} innovations in modern finance: deposit banking in southern Europe and negotiable bills in northern Europe, especially Antwerp. Although negotiable bills are as important as deposit banking (because they became a foundation of modern commercial banking and stock markets), they are not often studied. Part I of the thesis studies indirect loan contracts which do not rely on either bank-specific technologies or legal protection. It focuses on the concept of negotiability and explains its characteristics, including the substitutability of deposit banking and negotiable bills. Negotiable bills, or resaleable bills, can be interpreted as an indirect loan contract. The buyer of the bill, i. e. the initial lender, can re-sell the bill to a third party to satisfy his liquidity needs. So the initial issuer of the bill borrows from a third party, through the initial lender (acting as an intermediary). Previous studies have focused on direct loan contracts: between banks and borrowers, depositors and banks, or suppliers and buyers. There are few papers studying the incentive problems faced by all three players. To fill this gap, in Chapter Two, we study indirect loan contracts that a lender and a borrower can make only through an intermediary agent, where the borrower and the lender cannot observe any transaction between the other two. Under this severe information asymmetry, the existence of loan contracts as a sequential equilibrium is proved, although they are less efficient compared with direct loan contracts. In Chapter Three, we consider role of collateral in improving efficiency. Chapter Four concludes, summarising the characteristics of these contracts: only less risky borrowers can issue negotiable bills and riskier borrowers need to seek a direct relationship with lenders (or, they are rationed). In the 1990 s, the Japanese economy experienced a prolonged recession, the so-called ’lost decade’. It is discussed that a cause of the problem was the ”zombie lending” problem: chronic loss-making firms (zombies) still obtained finance from their banks. Part II of the thesis aims to address the following issues with a microeconomic model. Firstly, why did banks not liquidate bankrupt borrowers? Secondly, how did it affect macroeconomic productivity? And thirdly, how did it affect the procyclicality of land prices as in Kiyotaki and Moore(1997) ’s credit cycle? A bank, in this model, has an incentive not to liquidate insolvent borrowers: the liquidation of collateral asset (land) will invite the collapse of land market and the bank has to bear a large loss. The loss may make the bank under-capitalised and force it to close its business. The bank, to avoid the forced closure, does not liquidate insolvent borrowers. This ”zombie borrowers” occupy their land unused, and the bank can squeeze land supply to push up land price: the bank’s own capital is then kept higher than it should be. In the final chapter, based on this model, optimal post-crisis policies are discussed by comparing two options; public capital injection and <b>toxic</b> <b>asset</b> purchasing scheme.
