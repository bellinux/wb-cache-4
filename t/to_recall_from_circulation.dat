25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War precious metal coins were <b>recalled</b> <b>from</b> <b>circulation,</b> and in the early 1920s all coins disappeared because of the heavy inflation of the Hungarian korona. The name pengő was probably chosen to suggest stability. However, there was some controversy when choosing the name of the new currency, though the majority agreed that a Hungarian name should be chosen. Proposals included turul (a bird from Hungarian mythology), turán (from the geographical name and ideological term Turan), libertás (the colloquial name of the poltura coins issued by Francis II Rákóczi), and máriás (the colloquial name of coins depicting Mary, patroness of Hungary).|$|R

Both attempts were unsuccessful.|$|R

50|$|In {{preparation}} for resuming convertibility, the Bank of England raised interest rates, amassed a stock of gold, and <b>recalled</b> notes <b>from</b> <b>circulation.</b> This caused deflation but allowed the Bank to resume full convertibility in 1821. And while economists and historians generally provide non-conflicting {{accounts of the}} events which lead up to the crash, {{a number of different}} arguments have been made over what the most important factors were, with varying weight assigned by different experts.|$|R

30|$|In the {{previous}} section we established the revealed preference conditions for exact linear aggregation. Importantly, our characterisation can be linearised in unknowns, which makes it easily testable. We will next illustrate our revealed preference based aggregation results {{by means of an}} empirical application. Here, it is worth <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>from</b> our discussion in the Introduction that revealed preference methods are intrinsically “nonparametric”: in contrast to the more standard functional-derivative based methods, they do not need auxiliary parametric or statistical assumptions. As such, this empirical revealed preference analysis should thus lead to robust conclusions.|$|R
5000|$|Tulving's {{procedure}} first {{tested the}} recognition memory of participants {{for a list}} of paired associates using an item recognition procedure, to which participants responded [...] "yes" [...] if the pair of items was valid and [...] "no" [...] if the pair was invalid. Next, the participants were given a recall test, in which they were shown one item in each pair and attempted <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>from</b> memory the matching item. Tulving discovered that some items which participants had failed to recognize during the item recognition trials were recalled successfully during the subsequent recall test.|$|R

Though sufficient signatures were obtained <b>to</b> have the <b>recall</b> election, the judge disqualified many of the names, and Bowen completed his third and final term in office. Bowen had been a Republican in the 1960s and had worked with the deGravelleses. He cast his 1964 GOP convention vote, along with Virginia deGravelles, for Goldwater.|$|R

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his rule, Basiliscus showed his support for the Miaphysites. Zacharias Scholasticus reports how a group of Egyptian Miaphysite monks, having heard of Emperor Leo's death, had moved from Alexandria to Constantinople to petition Zeno in favour of Timothy, but at their arrival in the capital, they found the newly elected Basiliscus instead. The Magister Officiorum Theoctistus, the former physician of Basiliscus, was the brother of one of the monks, so the delegation obtained an audience with Basiliscus, and, with the support of Theoctistus and of the Empress, they convinced Basiliscus <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>from</b> exile the banished Miaphysite Patriarchs.|$|R

Dartnell, however, decided to form another junta, the January Junta, which ended with Alessandri's return on March 20, 1925. Alessandri had a new Constitution drafted, and {{approved}} by plebiscite by 134,421 voters on August 30. The Constitution, which was promulgated on September 18, 1925, reinforced presidential powers over the legislative. Furthermore, Alessandri created a Central Bank, initiating the first rupture with classical liberalism's laissez faire policies.|$|R
5000|$|He {{later wrote}} that the {{biography}} {{was one of the}} books he had most enjoyed writing: [...] "I knew all the historical background already. Now I found Bismarck's personality fascinating as well and {{he became one of the}} few I should like <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>from</b> the dead. It is a very good exercise for an historian to stray into biography - a field seemingly so similar and yet fundamentally different. Perhaps no historian can really handle individual psychology or make an individual the centre of his book. All the same I think my Bismarck is the best on him ever written".|$|R
