40|$|The {{effect of}} resting tension and {{external}} force on <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> crossbridge angle {{was investigated in}} insect flight muscle (Honeybee, Apis mellifera). In the presence of resting tension, bridges were either perpendicular to the filament axis or tilted towards the M-line. In shortened, slack muscle, bridges remained perpendicular or were tilted towards the Z-line. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> bridge angle appears {{to depend on the}} state of the thick filament. With the thick filament under stress, the angle may be quite different than when it is slack. On the other hand, external force applied directly to <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> bridges did not change their configuration. Bridge angle remained unchanged, irrespective of the amount of tension applied to the bridge. This implies that a very tight bond exists between <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> bridge and thin filament, allowing essentially no rotation even with a large applied force. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{stiffness}} of glycerinated rabbit psoas fibers in <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> state was measured at various sarcomere lengths {{in order to}} determine the distribution of the sarcomere compliance between the cross-bridge and other structures. The stiffness was determined by measuring the tension increment at one end of a fiber segment while stretching the other end of the fiber. The contribution of the end compliance to <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> segments was checked both by laser diffractometry of the sarcomere length change and by measuring the length dependence of the Young's modulus; the contribution was found to be small. The stiffness in <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> state was constant at sarcomere lengths of 2. 4 microns or less; at greater sarcomere lengths the stiffness, when corrected for the contribution of resting stiffness, scaled with the amount of overlap between the thick and thin filaments. These results suggest that the source of the sarcomere compliance of <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> fiber at <b>the</b> full overlapping of filaments is mostly the cross-bridge compliance...|$|R

5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive <b>the</b> <b>rigors</b> of the oncoming winter.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experimental}} work was to understand <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> bonds’ effect together with protein denaturation on water-holding capacity by breaking the actomyosin bonds that were formed during rigor process and examining the dissociation of actomyosin bonds’ influence on rheological features of myofibrils in suspension. In this study <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> bonds’ influences on water-holding capacity were compared; firstly, by dissociating <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> bonds in one group {{with the addition of}} 10 mM PPi and 2 mM MgCl 2; secondly, applying heat treatment at 21 ºC and 44 ºC; thirdly, denaturing sarcoplasmic proteins together with the myofibrils and denaturing the myofibrils without the presence of sarcoplasmic proteins. The influence of actomyosin bonds’ dissociation on rheological features of myofibrils was investigated as well by stress sweep and frequency sweep tests. The samples that were denatured without the presence of sarcoplasmic protein showed the poorest water-holding capacity which is indicating high drip loss in PSE like conditions mainly due to myofibrillar protein denaturation. Sarcoplasmic protein precipitation with the myofibrils improved the gelling properties. The PPi addition did not affect water-holding of myofibrils (P> 0. 05), suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> bonds don’t {{have a significant effect on}} water-holding of myofibrils after temperature-induced protein denaturation...|$|R
40|$|Calcium salts hasten and {{magnesium}} salts retard <b>the</b> development of <b>rigor</b> mortis, that is, when these salts are administered subcutaneously or intravenously. When injected intra-arterially, concentrated solutions of {{both kinds of}} salts cause nearly an immediate onset of a strong stiffness of the muscles which is apparently a contraction, brought on by a stimulation caused by these salts and due to osmosis. This contraction, if strong, passes over without a relaxation into a real rigor. This form of rigor may be classed as work-rigor (Arbeitsstarre). In animals, at least in frogs, with intact cords, the early contraction and <b>the</b> following <b>rigor</b> are stronger than in animals with destroyed cord. If M/ 8 solutions—nearly equimolecular to "physiological" solutions of sodium chloride—are used, even when injected intra-arterially, calcium salts hasten {{and magnesium}} salts retard <b>the</b> onset of <b>rigor.</b> <b>The</b> hastening and retardation in this case {{as well as in}} the cases of subcutaneous and intravenous injections, are ion effects and essentially due to the cations, calcium and magnesium. In <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> hastened by calcium the effects of the extensor muscles mostly prevail; in <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> following magnesium injection, on the other hand, either the flexor muscles prevail or the muscles become stiff in the original position of the animal at death. There seems to be no difference in the degree of stiffness in <b>the</b> final <b>rigor,</b> only <b>the</b> onset and development of <b>the</b> <b>rigor</b> is hastened in the case of the one salt and retarded in the other. Calcium hastens also the development of heat rigor. No positive facts were obtained with regard to the effect of magnesium upon heat vigor.
