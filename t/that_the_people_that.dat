500|$|Peter Facinelli was not {{originally}} cast as Carlisle Cullen. [...] " [...] liked me, {{but there}} was another actor that the studio was pushing for", Facinelli said. For unknown reasons, that actor was not able to play the part and Facinelli was selected in his place. The choice of Ashley Greene to portray Alice Cullen was the subject of fan criticism due to Greene being [...] taller than her character as described in the novel. Meyer had also stated that Rachael Leigh Cook resembled her vision of Alice. Nikki Reed had previously worked with Hardwicke on Thirteen, which they wrote together, and Lords of Dogtown. Reed commented, [...] "I don't want to say it's a coincidence, because we do work well together, and we have a great history. I think we make good work, but it's more <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> hire [...] to direct a film of theirs [...] most likely seen her other work." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, {{revenue from}} free-to-play games overtook revenue from premium {{games in the}} top 100 games in Apple's App Store. The {{number of people that}} spend money on in-game items in these games ranges from 0.5% to 6%, {{depending}} on a game's quality and mechanics. Even though this means {{that a large number of}} people will never spend money in a game, it also means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> do spend money could amount to a sizeable number due to the fact that the game was given away for free. Indeed a report from mobile advertising company firm SWRV stated that only 1.5 percent of players opted to pay for in-game items, and that 50 percent of the revenue for such games often came from just ten percent of players. [...] Nevertheless The Washington Post noted that the developers of two such games, Supercell (Clash of Clans) and Machine Zone (...) , were able to afford Super Bowl spots in 2015 featuring big-name celebrities (respectively Liam Neeson and Kate Upton). The latter, Game of War, was in fact, part of a roughly $40 million campaign starring Upton.|$|E

60|$|In {{this way}} the months slipped by, and Christmas came round again. The evening before, the youth {{went down to the}} rocks and into the copse, {{collecting}} all the drift wood the sea had washed up or the gale had blown down, and he piled it up in a great stack outside the door, so that he might not have to fetch any all the next day. As soon as his task was done, he paused and looked out towards the mainland, thinking of Christmas Eve last year, and the merry dance they had had. The night was still and cold, and by the help of the Northern Lights he could almost sea across to the opposite coast, when, suddenly, he noticed a boat, which seemed steering straight for the island. At first he could hardly stand for joy, the chance of speaking to another man was so delightful; but as the boat drew near there was something, he could not tell what, that was different from the boats which he had been used to all his life, and when it touched the shore he saw <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> filled it were beings of another world than ours. Then he hastily stepped behind the wood stack, and waited for what might happen next.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} it's anti-social or not. But I think it hard that I {{should be put}} out of decent society when fellows that do far worse than I are let in. Who did I see here last Friday, the most honored of your guests? Why, that Frenchman with the gold spectacles. What do you think I was told when I asked what HIS little game was? Baking dogs in ovens to see how long a dog could live red hot! I'd like to catch him doing it to a dog of mine. Ay; and {{sticking}} a rat full of nails {{to see how much}} pain a rat could stand. Why, it's just sickening. Do you think I'd have shaken hands with that chap? If he hadn't been a guest of yours I'd have given him a notion of how much pain a Frenchman can stand without any nails in him. And HE'S to be received and made much of, while I am kicked out! Look at your relation, the general. What is he but a fighting man, I should like to know? Isn't it his pride and boast that as long as he is paid so much a day he'll ask no questions whether a war is fair or unfair, but just walk out and put thousands of men in the best way to kill and be killed?--keeping well behind them himself all the time, mind you. Last year he was up to his chin in the blood of a lot of poor blacks that were no more a match for his armed men than a feather-weight would be for me. Bad as I am, I wouldn't attack a feather-weight, or stand by and see another heavy man do it. Plenty of your friends go pigeon-shooting to Hurlingham. THERE'S a humane and manly way of spending a Saturday afternoon! Lord Worthington, that comes to see you when he likes, though he's too much of a man or too little of a shot to kill pigeons, thinks nothing of fox-hunting. Do you think foxes like to be hunted, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> hunt them have such fine feelings that they can afford to call prize-fighters names? Look at the men that get killed or lamed every year at steeple-chasing, fox-hunting, cricket, and foot-ball! Dozens of them! Look at the thousands killed in battle! Did you ever hear of any one being killed in the ring? Why, from first to last, during the whole century that prize-fighting has been going on, there's not been six fatal accidents at really respectable fights. It's safer than dancing; many a woman has danced her skirt into the fire and been burned. I once fought a man who had spoiled his constitution with bad living; and he exhausted himself so by going on and on long after he was beaten that he died of it, and nearly finished me, too. If you'd heard the fuss that even the oldest fighting men made over it you'd have thought that a baby had died from falling out of its cradle. A good milling does a man more good than harm. And if all these--dog-bakers, and soldiers, and pigeon-shooters, and fox-hunters, and the rest of them--are made welcome here, why am I shut out like a brute beast?" ...|$|E
