5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the Children of Israel.

This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.|$|E

McFarlane's last contribution was Volume 24, The Short-Wave Mystery (1945); his wife, Amy, authored Volume 26, The Phantom Freighter (1947). Over the next several decades, other volumes were written by Adams, Svenson, Lawrence, Buranelli, William Dougherty, and James Buechler. Beginning in 1959, the series was extensively revised and re-written. Many authors worked on the revised books, writing new manuscripts; some of <b>them</b> <b>also</b> wrote plot outlines and edited the books.

5|$|Einsatzgruppe B, C, and D did not {{immediately}} follow Einsatzgruppe A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The Einsatzgruppe commanders, {{with the exception of}} Einsatzgruppe A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 {{that it was impossible to}} kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop. An Einsatzgruppe report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting <b>them.</b> <b>Also,</b> in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west. Thus, an interval passed between the first round of Einsatzgruppen massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian Raul Hilberg called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942. During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.|$|E

Once there Montejo the Younger, commanding between three and four hundred Spanish soldiers, established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucatán Peninsula. Shortly afterwards, Montejo the Younger summoned the local Maya lords and commanded them {{to submit to the}} Spanish Crown. A number of lords submitted peacefully, including the ruler of the Xiu Maya. The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo the Younger sent his cousin against <b>them</b> (<b>also</b> called Francisco de Montejo); Montejo the Younger remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) rated Ninja Gaiden and Black, {{on their}} release, as 18+ games. At the time, CERO ratings acted as {{guidelines}} for consumers. However, on March 1, 2006, the Japanese rating system changed. A scale from A to D was introduced, {{with an additional}} Z rating for games with large amounts of gore and sexual content. The Z rating is legally enforced, it being illegal to sell such games to anyone {{under the age of}} 18. As a result, Tecmo removed the human beheadings in Sigma to obtain a D rating for the East Asian market. However, CERO reclassified the two previous games as D, despite <b>them</b> <b>also</b> depicting human decapitations.|$|E
5|$|Müllerian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Fritz Müller. When a distasteful animal comes {{to resemble a}} more common distasteful animal, natural selection favours individuals that even very slightly better resemble the target. For example, many species of stinging wasp and bee are similarly coloured black and yellow. Müller's explanation of the mechanism for {{this was one of}} the first uses of mathematics in biology. He argued that a predator, such as a young bird, must attack at least one insect, say a wasp, to learn that the black and yellow colours mean a stinging insect. If bees were differently coloured, the young bird would have to attack one of <b>them</b> <b>also.</b> But when bees and wasps resemble each other, the young bird need only attack one from the whole group to learn to avoid all of them. So, fewer bees are attacked if they mimic wasps; the same applies to wasps that mimic bees. The result is mutual resemblance for mutual protection.|$|E
