5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him at odds {{with some of his}} fellow Republicans and prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck. He said he opposed <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> because he believed that they would {{have a negative impact on}} low income families and children.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Perón's death, the {{government}} suspended all official activities {{for two days}} and ordered all flags flown at half-staff for ten days. It soon became apparent, however, that <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> fell short of reflecting popular grief. The crowd outside of the presidential residence, where Evita died, grew dense, congesting the streets for ten blocks in each direction.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{the generous}} donativum {{bestowed}} upon the soldiers following his accession {{was expected to}} swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change. The Praetorians considered <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> insufficient, however, and demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Continued dissatisfaction with {{this state of affairs}} would ultimately lead to the gravest crisis of Nerva's reign.|$|E

5|$|Advocacy of such {{a nation}} became illegal when separatist demands were banned by law in 1957. Regardless of <b>these</b> <b>measures,</b> a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was {{observed}} on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to abolish the rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was need to establish a Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization {{and that it was}} necessary to work towards it.|$|E
5|$|An ineffectual start {{led to the}} {{conclusion}} that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called perestroika, or restructuring. Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. <b>These</b> <b>measures</b> were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.|$|E
5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 onward, the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by <b>these</b> <b>measures.</b> Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists, as does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.|$|E

This paper assesses, using information criteria, the relative modeling success of <b>these</b> candidate <b>measures</b> in explaining risky choice behavior giving rise to violations. Although the candidate models exhibit some degree of substitutability, our results indicate support for a candidate model that uses relatively simple measures to instrument for decision costs...|$|R
5|$|Brownlee's {{work as an}} MLA {{extended}} beyond the legislature. He gave close attention to correspondence from his constituents, especially those alleging improper treatment at Ponoka's psychiatric hospital. He prepared thoroughly for speaking engagements in his riding, trying to anticipate all possible questions. <b>These</b> <b>measures</b> were reflected in his support in the largely rural riding, where the Calgary lawyer became a popular and well-respected MLA.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. <b>These</b> <b>measures</b> are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} years, Parliament adopted several more minor reforms. Acts of Parliament passed in 1835 and 1836 {{increased}} the number of polling places in each constituency, and reduced polling to a single day. Parliament also passed several laws aimed at combatting corruption, including the Corrupt Practices Act 1854, though <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> proved largely ineffectual. Neither party strove for further major reform; leading statesmen on both sides regarded the Reform Act as a final settlement.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, a {{combination}} of low recruitment and retention rates across the RAN resulted {{in the number of}} trained submariners falling below 40% of that required. As an attempt to retain submariners, the RAN offered a one-off A$35,000 bonus in 1999. Other measures introduced around the same time included priority transfer of volunteers for submarine training and rotating submariners between sea and shore assignments to relieve them from continual sea service and prevent burnout. A year later, <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> had increased submariner numbers to 55% of requirements.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. <b>These</b> <b>measures</b> allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the draft}} treaty of January 1916, apprehensions grew in Delhi of trouble from tribes in the North-West Frontier Province. That spring, Indian {{intelligence}} received rumours {{of letters from}} Habibullah to his tribal chiefs exhorting holy jihad. Alarmed, Hardinge called 3,000 tribal chiefs to a grand Jirga in Peshawar, where aerial bombing displays were held; Hardinge demonstrated the Empire's goodwill by increasing British subsidies to the chiefs. <b>These</b> <b>measures</b> helped convince the frontier tribes that Britain's wartime position remained strong and that Indian defences were impregnable.|$|E

5|$|In circa 1250 BC, {{the first}} wave of {{destruction}} has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. These incidents appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Nevertheless, none of <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> appear to have prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested {{power back}} in the state {{legislature}} from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes, followed by white primaries; <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> effectively disfranchised most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans. In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could vote. As a result, the Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy. It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens.|$|E

5|$|Slaughter's unpopularity led to {{the demise}} of many of his proposals, {{regardless}} of their merits. He suggested a comprehensive system of public schools and, though the idea had been proposed by previous governors, Slaughter devised a means of funding it. The hostile legislature refused the plan and overrode Slaughter's vetoes of bills that allowed individual schools to be supported by lotteries. Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including the creation of a state library. <b>These</b> <b>measures</b> were also rejected.|$|E
