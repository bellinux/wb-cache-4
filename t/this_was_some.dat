The Iron Dukes displaced 25,000long tons (25,400tonnes). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> 2,000tons (2,032tonnes) heavier than the preceding King George Vs, and was primarily due {{to the increase in}} calibre of the secondary battery.|$|E

25|$|In 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men's College in Blackfriars Road. The moving {{spirit was}} a {{portmanteau}} worker, Wm.

At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> bargain; and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire.|$|E

25|$|On April 18, 1879, the United States {{set aside}} the Columbia Reservation for Chief Moses and his tribe. The tribe agreed to cede their Columbia Basin territory, which was then opened for homesteading.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1966, with Indonesia's political hiatus beginning to stabilise (it had stopped a major RPKAD operation to capture a British prisoner), the RPKAD linked up with PGRS to establish guerrilla forces in Sabah and Sarawak. The Sabah effort never crossed the border; however, two groups entered Sarawak in February and May and obtained support from local sympathisers. The first group, despite losses in several contacts, lasted until June and exfiltrated on hearing {{about the end of}} Konfrontasi. Survivors of the second, after a contact with Australian troops, also made it back to Indonesia. However, the final Indonesian incursion was in May and June. Signs of a substantial force were found crossing into Central Brigade. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> 80 strong, mostly volunteers, led by Lt Sombi (or Sumbi) and a team from 600 Raider Company. They moved fast towards Brunei with 1/7 Gurkhas pursuing and ambushing them; almost all were accounted for. In response to this, a final Claret operation was launched, which was an artillery ambush by 38 Light Battery.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year she broke the 400m indoor record with 53.64seconds in Tianjin {{and won the}} 800 metres at the National Games. At the national championships she came second in the 200m to Sakie Nobuoka and she also improved her own 400m Japanese outdoor record. After coming close to her record in the heats, she became a two time 400m national champion with 51.93seconds, knocking a second off her previous best. This was sufficient for qualification in the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, but Tanno did not progress beyond the 400m preliminary rounds. She rebounded, however, at the Asian Championships, winning two bronze medals in the individual and relay 400m events. Her good form continued as she finished fourth at the 2005 Summer Universiade and set a new best at the Seiko Super Track & Field Meet (Super Rikujyo). At the meeting she finished with 51.80seconds and although <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> distance behind American Dee Dee Trotter (50.03) Tanno stated that she aspired to break 51seconds in her career too. She ended the year with a 400m {{gold medal at the}} 2005 East Asian Games.|$|E
500|$|The April 10 {{show was}} the second of four concerts Davis played at the Fillmore West that month {{and one of his}} first concerts in a rock venue, having {{performed}} at New York City's Fillmore East a month earlier. His change to rock venues, suggested by Columbia Records president Clive Davis, helped the label market Bitches Brew to the counterculture audience. According to Holland, Davis' music around this time became well received by the rock audiences they encountered. [...] "I heard quite recently from one of the [...] ex-members that they were very nervous that they had to play up next to Miles", he said. [...] "It was a time when people were not that worried about musical categories. And <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> pretty strong in-your-face music. People loved it." [...] Davis said the Fillmore West shows were an [...] "eye-opening experience" [...] for him. While he became friendly with Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia, who was a fan of Davis' music, there were several thousands of mostly young, white hippies who were generally unfamiliar with him, Davis recalled.|$|E

500|$|On 20 March, General Gotthard Heinrici was {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula replacing Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Heinrici {{was one of}} the best defensive tacticians in the German army, and he immediately started to lay defensive plans. Heinrici correctly assessed that the main Soviet thrust would be made over the Oder River and along the main east-west Autobahn. He decided not to try to defend the banks of the Oder with anything more than a light skirmishing screen. Instead, Heinrici arranged for engineers to fortify the Seelow Heights, which overlooked the Oder River at the point where the Autobahn crossed them. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> distance [...] west of the Oder and [...] east of Berlin. Heinrici thinned out the line in other areas to increase the manpower available to defend the heights. German engineers turned the Oder's flood plain, already saturated by the spring thaw, into a swamp by releasing the water from a reservoir upstream. Behind the plain on the plateau, the engineers built three belts of defensive emplacements reaching back towards the outskirts of Berlin (the lines nearer to Berlin were called the Wotan position). These lines consisted of anti-tank ditches, anti-tank gun emplacements, and an extensive network of trenches and bunkers.|$|E
500|$|... "The Roof" [...] was {{released}} on July 28, 1998 by Columbia Records. The song is a slow and sultry song, which blends hip-hop and contemporary R genres. It incorporates drum notes, including heavy beats and grooves. The song's second version features a rap version from Mobb Deep. The song samples the melody from [...] "Shook Ones Part II" [...] by Mobb Deep, incorporating it into chorus and bridge. As part of [...] "layering the song," [...] background vocals are featured throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. It {{is set in the}} signature common time, and is written in the key of E major. It features a basic chord progression of A-F1. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of F5; the piano and guitar pieces range from F3 to G5 as well. The song contains choral lyrics written by Carey, who produced the song's melody and chorus as well. Aside from assisting with its chord progression, Cory Rooney co-arranged and produced the track as well. Author Chris Nickson felt the song was extremely important for Carey's musical transition, writing [...] "Lyrically, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> of her best work ever, the melody slinky and overtly sexy, confirmation – as if any was needed at this point! – that this was the new Mariah." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryant and Scott {{turned in}} their script on March 1, 1977. It was {{rejected}} by Paramount and they departed the project in April 1977 because they found that Kaufman's and Roddenberry's ideas for the film repeatedly conflicted. They later said they were disappointed as they felt it had been [...] "absolutely a 'go' picture" [...] and that [...] "It {{was just one of}} those deals that happens at studios from time to time that fell down the middle." [...] Jeffrey Katzenberg informed the director on May 8 that the film was cancelled; it had an increased budget of $10 million at the time. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> three weeks prior to the release of Star Wars. Several explanations for the cancellation have been put forth. One claims the studio felt that the production had taken too long and another science fiction film would not be successful so soon after Star Wars because the fans would not pay to see two science fiction films. Kaufmann later claimed that Paramount had attributed the cancellation to the success of Star Wars at the box office, but as Titans was cancelled prior to Star Wars release the box office could not have played a factor. Diller stated that it was cancelled because both treatments felt forced and different from the episodes of The Original Series. He instead suggested that they returned to the series format and therefore moved forward with a project that would become the never-completed [...] TV series Kaufmann went on to direct films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and The Right Stuff (1983). Although the film was never made, it was later discussed by critics and writers. David Hughes included it in his 2008 book The Greatest Science Fiction Movies Never Made in the chapter about the planned Star Trek films of the 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|One popular {{interpretation}} of [...] "Des Moines" [...] ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that [...] "Des Moines" [...] {{refers to a}} group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the current city of St. Louis. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> [...] from the Des Moines River.|$|E
