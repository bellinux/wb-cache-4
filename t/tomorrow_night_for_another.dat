My boy Larry is going to take this across, and will call <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> an answer, if you are good enough to send one." ...|$|R
50|$|A teenage girl, Su-mi, {{is being}} treated for shock and {{psychosis}} in a mental institution. The doctor questions her about the day that led her to be institutionalised but she refuses to answer. Later, Su-mi returns home to her family's secluded estate in the countryside with her father and her younger sister Su-yeon. At a family dinner, their cold and distant stepmother, Eun-joo, who constantly requires medication after every meal, announces that their uncle and his wife will arrive <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> a dinner party. The sisters are disappointed with the announcement and leave the dinner table.|$|R

"I {{would rather}} face those villains of last <b>night</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> hour than {{go before the}} king," [...] Guy said, as he {{prepared}} to follow the attendant; [...] "but I trust that good may come of my interview, and that I can interest the king in the case of my mistress." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{darkness}} was intense. Through it I groped {{my way to}} the cart, which stood where it had been outspanned on the veld at a little distance from the house, wishing heartily, so miserable was I, that the Kaffirs might choose that black <b>night</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> attack and make an end of me.|$|R
60|$|<b>Tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> I appear <b>for</b> {{the first}} time before a Boston audience--4,000 critics--and {{on the success of}} this matter depends my future success in New England. But I am not distressed. Nasby is in the same boat. Tonight decides the fate of his brand-new lecture. He has just left my room--been reading his lecture to me--was greatly depressed. I have {{convinced}} him that he has little to fear.|$|R
60|$|Crestwick shrank {{from the}} painful choice. He {{did not think}} that he could walk; but to prolong the {{experience}} of the previous <b>night</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> twenty-four hours or more seemed even worse. He ate his breakfast; and then with a tense effort he got upon his feet and slipped the straps of the pack over his shoulders. Moving unevenly, he set off, lest he should yield to his weariness and sink down again.|$|R
50|$|At the park, a male {{associate}} {{disguised as}} a balut vendor collects money from different people {{and hands it to}} Peping, who passes it to Abyong. Peping is informed by Abyong that their boss Kap (or Vic) (Julio Diaz) requires him that <b>night</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> operation. Peping reluctantly agrees and both enter a van parked nearby. Peping asks Abyong where they are headed, but Abyong offers little details. They stop at a red-light district, with Sarge (John Regala) entering a night club.|$|R
40|$|While visiting {{our kids}} and {{grandson}} last year, I had a recurring thought: being a grandparent is not for 'sissies'. My wife and I thought about how grandparenting challenged our health; each day saw some insult to body homeostasis and we were grateful each <b>night</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> day survived. Don't get me wrong, we wouldn't trade days with our little man for all the gold in China or the USA, but I came to think that grandparents are special people, not for giving love or gifts, but for putting our bodies on the line. Occupational illness is a given - the Compensation Commissioner needs to take note. [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|Slydini became {{largely unknown}} to the public but a legend {{to those in the}} magic profession. He was {{constantly}} featured in the magic magazines and publications. The Linking Ring, a publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, highlighted him in their 1951 February issue. Talk show host Dick Cavett wrote about his first meeting with Slydini in a New York Times column, [...] "Doug Henning said to me, ‘Tony’s doing a special demonstration <b>for</b> some magicians <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> at Vesuvio restaurant. Come.’ <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> finally came. <b>For</b> the magicians, sitting for nearly two hours at that table, sudden gasps and intakes of breath abounded. It was like seeing a man walk up a wall. Nothing prepared you for it. Right at the start, a solid, heavy silver dollar, held before my eyes, vanished into thinnest air. And by no method I knew of. Certainly no sleeves. The two hours flew too quickly." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a young {{teacher in}} the {{segregated}} Todd County School system, Dunnigan taught courses in Kentucky history. She quickly learned that her students were almost completely ignorant of the historic contributions of African Americans {{to the state of}} Kentucky. She started preparing [...] "Kentucky Fact Sheets" [...] and handing them out to her students as supplements to the required text. These papers were collected for publication in 1939, but no publisher was willing to take them to press. Associated Publishers Inc. finally published the articles in 1982 as The Fascinating Story of Black Kentuckians: Their Heritage and Tradition. The meager pay she earned teaching forced her to work numerous menial jobs during the summer months, when school was not in session. She washed the tombstones in the white cemetery while working four hours a day in a dairy, cleaning house for a family, and doing washing at <b>night</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> family, earning a total of about seven dollars a week.|$|R
50|$|As The Edge of <b>Night,</b> it ran <b>for</b> <b>another</b> 30 {{years on}} television, but Gardner disliked the {{proposed}} daytime television version {{due to a}} lack of his own creative control. He ultimately withheld his endorsement of the daytime TV show, forcing the name change.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{begins the}} night, that Flav welcomes Season 1's Tiffany Pollard aka New York {{back to the}} house as a guest to help him decide about <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night's</b> {{eliminations}} <b>for</b> the seven remaining ladies. All the girls are pissed that New York returned to the house, because a lot of them don't like or get along with New York. Flav leaves the girls alone and New York asks the girls about each other and Bootz lets New York know that she doesn't like her and doesn't want her there and that she's just another bitch trying to steal her man. New York and Bootz get into an argument, where New York calls Bootz a [...] "dreamer" [...] meaning she's just dreaming of Flav being her man. The next day, the girls wake up and are told to go to a photoshoot for URB Magazine. New York is in charge of how the women look. New York is yelling at everybody because they were late and screams to them to come down stairs. New York gets into an argument with Bootz when Bootz is late coming downstairs for the evaluation. New York has rude things to say to all of them except Deelishis and Beautful.|$|R
5000|$|Wells and {{his wife}} Barbara became born-again Christians in the mid-70s, and for two years Wells managed a Parma, Ohio Christian radio station, WSUM (now WCCD). In August 1979, Wells left Cleveland and moved to Florida {{to pursue a career}} in Christian broadcasting. Schodowski {{replaced}} Wells with new co-host [...] "Lil' John" [...] Rinaldi and continued the Friday <b>night</b> show <b>for</b> <b>another</b> 28 years as The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show, finally ending in 2007 after a combined total run of 40 years.|$|R
25|$|This {{game was}} {{originally}} scheduled {{to kick off}} at 8:00 pm on Friday, October 5, and {{it was to have}} been the first night game played by Alabama in their history. After a mutual agreement was reached between both head coaches, the game was postponed to the following afternoon {{as a result of a}} major rain event that made the playing surface at the Cramton Bowl unplayable. The Crimson Tide would not compete in their first <b>night</b> game <b>for</b> <b>another</b> six seasons when they defeated Spring Hill to open the 1940 season.|$|R

50|$|Lorie cannot accept it's {{over and}} {{believes}} it's just a lovers' spat {{that will ultimately}} result in marriage. She calls at <b>night,</b> begging <b>for</b> <b>another</b> chance, but is refused. Though he denies any intention to see her, Ed checks up on Lorie and punches out {{a man who was}} harassing her. Feeling trapped, Ed entertains and eventually sleeps with Lorie again. He resolves to break it off the next day, but she calls throughout the night, phoning everyone she knows when he doesn't answer. Andie, Ed's daughter, convinces him to be harsh, and he informs Lorie that she needs to leave him alone or he'll change his number.|$|R
50|$|The {{victims of}} the final murders were the family of Harvey Wilkerson, a {{longtime}} friend of the brothers. On the morning of October 19, despite having promised a judge earlier that day that he would stay out of trouble while out on parole, James led his brothers on the prowl that <b>night</b> <b>for</b> yet <b>another</b> victim. Upon seeing the brothers down the street, Wilkerson, who lived with his 23-year-old wife Judy Barton (who was five months pregnant at the time) and her 5-year-old son Harvey, instinctively closed and locked his door. This action was noticed by the brothers, who then walked over to Wilkerson's front door. Terrified by their response if he refused them entry, Wilkerson allowed them in.|$|R
