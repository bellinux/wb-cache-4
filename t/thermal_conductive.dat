50|$|The {{process of}} {{compressing}} gas into a diving cylinder removes {{moisture from the}} gas. This is good for corrosion prevention in the cylinder but means that the diver inhales very dry gas. The dry gas extracts moisture from the diver's lungs while underwater contributing to dehydration, which is also {{thought to be a}} predisposing risk factor of decompression sickness. It is also uncomfortable, causing a dry mouth and throat and making the diver thirsty. This problem is reduced in rebreathers because the soda lime reaction, which removes carbon dioxide, also puts moisture back into the breathing gas. In hot climates, open circuit diving can accelerate heat exhaustion because of dehydration. Another concern with regard to moisture content is the tendency of moisture to condense as the gas is decompressed while passing through the regulator; this coupled with the extreme reduction in temperature, also due to the decompression can cause the moisture to solidify as ice. This icing up in a regulator can cause moving parts to seize and the regulator to fail or free flow.This {{is one of the reasons}} that scuba regulators are generally constructed from brass, and chrome plated (for protection).

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{anisotropy}} on the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of wood {{is a highly}} controversial topic. Some scientists claim that the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> values in the radial direction are {{higher than in the}} tangential direction [5, 17, 26], whereas others report the same <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties in both transverse directions [8, 9, 20]. However, most importantly, the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties are mainly dependent on the pattern of the growth ring itself at low temperatures. In the case of Douglas fir, the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties in the radial direction are higher than in the tangential direction. However, in contrast with Douglas fir, similar <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties in the tangential and radial directions were obtained for moderate-diameter wood, which comprises partly tangential and partly radial directions. Consequently, this combination of both transverse directions influences the anisotropic factor of the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties in this study. Furthermore, the orientation of the microfibrils strongly affects the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties. A number of other studies have reported that the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of wood increase with increasing ring angle which is influenced by the microfibril angle in the S 2 layers of the cell walls [5, 26, 27].|$|E

Utilization of mineral aggregate and conductive filler with higher thermal conductivity is an efficient method to prepare conductive asphalt concrete.

30|$|The {{aforementioned}} {{factors that}} significantly affect the thermal properties of wood were mostly determined {{by measuring the}} rate of heat flow at high temperatures (steady-state method); however, a literature review reveals limited information on the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of wood at low temperatures. To expand the existing knowledge of the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of wood at high temperatures, the present study investigates the relationship between the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of wood at low temperatures and important factors, namely, the microstructural properties (density and porosity) and the anisotropy of wood using two types of solid carbon dioxide as a chilling agent. During this study {{the rate of heat}} flow could not be calculated; therefore, the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of wood at low temperatures were defined as the cooling rate to the targeted critical thermal minimum (CTmin) of drywood termites (°C/min), the minimum core temperature (°C), and the duration of the temperature below CTmin (min).|$|E
30|$|The {{results have}} shown that the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> {{properties}} of wood at low temperatures are mainly dependent on the hierarchical organization of wood. Therefore, to establish a model that can predict the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties at low temperatures, the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of the cell wall material are required in future studies. In addition, the effect of knots, checks, and other defects on structural timber must be studied because these defects have a tendency to increase the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of wood. Finally, in addition to the three parameters above, the probe location strongly influenced the results, due to the localized temperature measurement and the influence of heterogeneities. Hence, the probe location must be carefully selected to eliminate the influence of heterogeneities and also {{to increase the number of}} probe locations to encompass the temperature measurement of the entire sample in future study. Overall, as remedial drywood termite treatments using solid carbon dioxide are developed to kill them inside timber, we are certain that the results obtained demonstrate the high capability of the application.|$|E
30|$|The results {{indicate}} that the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of wood at low temperature are mainly affected by the composition and morphological properties of wood (i.e., density/ratio of earlywood and latewood, proportion of heartwood and sapwood, pattern of growth ring). In Fig.  1 a, the cross-section photo reveals a clear frost variation where high energy is shown being transferred first through the latewood ring and then across into the earlywood ring. In the latewood of softwood, thick cell walls with a small lumen increase the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties because heat transfers mainly through cell walls [18]. By contrast, earlywood has thin walls with larger cell lumens. Below the FSP, these cell lumens are mostly filled with air, which consequently decreases the thermal properties of wood due to the low thermal properties of air [16]. A study of the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties below the FSP by Gu et al. [18] also revealed that the percentage of latewood substantially affects the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductive</b> properties of wood. For example, for spruce, the densities of early wood and late wood differ by three factors [5].|$|E

In this work, a series of bisimidazolium-containing, Michael addition donors were synthesized and used to produce a series of covalently crosslinked PIL polyester networks containing bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide as the counteranion. Within the series, the length of alkyl spacer between the two imidazolium cations and the diacrylate to acetoacetate monomer ratio were varied {{in an attempt to}} correlate structural variations with the <b>thermal,</b> mechanical, and <b>conductive</b> properties of the PILs. Keeping the diacrylate to acetoacetate ratio constant, increasing the alkyl spacer length showed unexpected results, with the moderate spacer length (hexyl) exhibiting the highest ionic conductivity, lowest glass transition temperature (Tg), and highest thermal stability (by measurement of 5 % thermal decomposition temperatures, Td 5 %). When the diacrylate to acetoacetate ratio was increased, the polymers displayed higher apparent crosslink densities (ρx), Tg values, and Td 5 % values; however, a lower ionic conductivity was observed. In addition to the bisimidazolium work, a series of polymers were generated that used commercially available poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) containing diacrylates as a method to incorporate PEG into the polyester backbone of imidazolium-containing Michael addition networks. These polymers used a monoimidazolium acetoacetate monomer in order to establish a baseline for PEG incorporation.
