5|$|The major {{difficulty}} in separation of actinium is <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> of its properties {{with those of}} lanthanum. Thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion-exchange procedures.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of MacIntyres in Scotland {{to those in}} Ireland is not entirely clear. Given {{the proximity of the}} two countries and <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> of their languages, some Scottish MacIntyres undoubtedly settled in Ireland, mainly in Ulster.|$|E

Ellis was asked about <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> in a 2005 BBC interview.

5|$|Though no coins {{denominated}} as thalers were officially issued {{within the}} Swiss Confederation, many coins measuring between 30 and 40millimeters {{have been given}} the name unofficially due to <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> in size to German and Austrian thalers.|$|E
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> {{of the basic}} metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that {{it has been argued that}} it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E

5|$|Early SEGRAs were {{synthetic}} steroids. An {{example is}} RU24858, {{one of the}} first compounds of this type to be published. Many newer SEGRAs have a different framework, although <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> to steroids can still be seen in molecules like the benzopyranoquinoline A276575 or in octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivatives.

At {{the end of the}} video, the mascot is shown to be a result of a joint venture between two large Japanese conglomerates, Matsumura Fishworks and Tamaribuchi Heavy Manufacturing Concern. Their mascots, a smiling anime fish and light bulb, merge to form Mr. Sparkle. Thus, Homer discovers <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> was a mere coincidence.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{poisoning}} {{incidents are}} unintentional and result from errors in identification. Recent cases highlight {{the issue of}} <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> of A.phalloides to the edible paddy straw mushroom, Volvariella volvacea, with East- and Southeast-Asian immigrants in Australia and {{the west coast of}} the United States falling victim. In an episode in Oregon, four members of a Korean family required liver transplants. Of the 9 people poisoned in the Canberra region between 1988 and 2011, three were from Laos and two were from China.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. <b>The</b> <b>similarity</b> was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E
2500|$|According to Tilak, the {{religions}} of India {{can be interpreted}} [...] "differentially" [...] or [...] "integrally", that is by either highlighting the differences or <b>the</b> <b>similarities.</b> According to Sherma and Sarma, western Indologists have tended to emphasise the differences, while Indian Indologists have tended to emphasise <b>the</b> <b>similarities.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates empirically whether cultural, racial, and {{linguistic}} similarities increase marriage migration. By using marriage migration data from South Korea, I find that <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> between an origin country and South Korea pull more marriage migration, but {{the positive effects}} of <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> are mainly driven by female marriage migrants from middle and low income countries. The pulling effects of <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> can be explained by female deficits in the marital age group in South Korea that motivate Korean men to seek foreign brides who share similar traits with locals...|$|R

Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|Lemaire noted <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> of his Schlumbergera epiphylloides to {{a species}} first {{described}} as Epiphyllum truncatum by Adrian Hardy Haworth in 1819, {{but did not}} accept that the two species {{should be included in}} the same genus. In 1890, Karl Moritz Schumann created the new genus Zygocactus, transferring Epiphyllum truncatum to Zygocactus truncatus. Although he later placed it back in Epiphyllum, abandoning Zygocactus, the generic name Zygocactus continued to be widely used.|$|E
5|$|Like the lanthanides, all {{actinides}} {{are highly}} reactive with halogens and chalcogens; however, the actinides react more easily. Actinides, {{especially those with}} {{a small number of}} 5f-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This is explained by <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> of the electron energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.|$|E
