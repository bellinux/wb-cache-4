With the Landlord arrested, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby for a short time, developing strong bonds with him. Reluctant to hand the baby over, the two are forced to protect him from the triads who hired <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Greece {{the only}} {{disturbance}} to Macedonian rule was the {{attempt by the}} Spartan king Agis III to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against the Macedonians. However, he was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Although the governor of Thrace, Memnon, had threatened to rebel, it appears that Antipater dissuaded him with diplomacy before campaigning against Agis III in the Peloponnese. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans {{on the condition that}} they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330 BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom restored (despite the possibility that the Macedonian king most likely had Antipater install <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place).</b>|$|E

5|$|The law courts' {{jurisdiction}} over the guardianship of children {{is said to have}} come from the King's prerogative of parens patriae. The Chancery had administered this area of law from an early period, since it primarily concerned the holding of land– a form of trust. Since these were mainly dealt with orally there are few early records; the first reference comes from 1582, when a curator was appointed to deal with the property of an infant. While the common law courts regularly appointed guardians, the Chancery had the right to remove them, replace them or create <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b> Similarly, while there were actions against guardians which the child could undertake in the common law courts, these were regularly undertaken in the Court of Chancery. This jurisdiction was first regularly recognised from 1696 onwards, and its main focus was the welfare of the child. As such, wards of the court had certain principles: their estates had to be administered {{under the supervision of the}} Court, they had to be educated under the same supervision, and any marriage had to be sanctioned by the Court.|$|E

Snow holds the heart that belongs to Prince Charming and uses it to command him with orders to behead Isaac, but Isaac schemes his way out of it by convincing them that he knows some of their secrets, since he wrote <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b> Isaac tells Snow that she can get her happy ending again (which was love with Prince James in this timeline), if she agrees to kill Henry along with Regina.|$|E
2500|$|Repatriation {{has been}} a major issue.

2500|$|The Bubis {{are known}} for a {{particular}} type of tattooing that extends from the times of slave-trading and persists, though not as commonly, to the current day.

2500|$|After Christianity {{spread to}} Ireland, the pagan {{sanctuary}} was {{converted into a}} Christian one, and Armagh became {{the site of an}} important church and monastery. According to tradition, Saint Patrick founded his main church there in the year 457, and it eventually became the [...] "ecclesiastical capital" [...] of Ireland. Saint Patrick was said to have decreed that only those educated in Armagh could spread the gospel. According to the Annals of the Four Masters: Ard Mhacha was founded by Saint Patrick, it having been granted to him by Daire, son of Finnchadh, son of Eoghan, son of Niallan. Twelve men were appointed by him for building the town. He ordered <b>them,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> to erect an archbishop's city there, and a church for monks, for nuns, and for the other orders in general, for he perceived that it would be the head and chief of the churches of Ireland in general.|$|E
