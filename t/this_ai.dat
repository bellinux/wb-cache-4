500|$|According to *Blue Sky's records, the American {{government}} {{created an}} AI {{at the same}} time it created ARPANET in the 1970s. <b>This</b> <b>AI,</b> *Mother, in turn created child AIs, but its first attempt spread out of control and had to be destroyed by a virus that spread after it—later officially explained by the government as the real-life Creeper and Reaper worms. *Mother's later attempts, which could only exist on one system at a time, were more successful, and these AIs left the ARPANET in favor of the Internet when it was developed. *Reaper, however, continued to spread and destroyed any AI it found, such as *Emilia. The player finds *Paris, another AI and *Emilia's brother, on an ARPANET node, who explains that compiling the binary code in *Emilia's message can recreate her. The player compiles *Emilia onto their system, and the two learn of a [...] "payload" [...] that the other AIs have developed, which exploits a vulnerability that can cause *Reaper to self-terminate; however, infecting *Reaper with it requires that an AI be recompiled with it as living bait, meaning permanent deletion. Realizing that they have no other choice, *Emilia becomes the payload carrier. After a final conversation, the player allows *Emilia to sacrifice herself, saving the AIs and ending the game.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} , Nick Bostrom {{provides}} {{an argument that}} artificial intelligence will {{pose a threat to}} mankind. He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If <b>this</b> <b>AI's</b> goals do not reflect humanity's - one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible - it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.|$|R
2500|$|Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point G. Christopher Williams {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read [...] "we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with <b>this</b> <b>AI</b> that changes and evolves over time, {{leading up to the}} point that you betray her and do the most intimate act you can do with someone—murdering them in cold blood", he at first noted that [...] "on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical", but also noted that [...] "a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules—is one that is an altogether familiar one". He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist Sigmund Freud which Williams said was about [...] "murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt to get out from under the wing of their parents". He wrote [...] "nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to “kill them” in order to escape that “game,” which makes this game feel like something more like a really familiar relationship". He called her [...] "just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design" [...] and that [...] "this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay". He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote [...] "I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing me. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me".|$|E
50|$|During {{combat the}} player can also give basic {{commands}} to lancemates which had very simple AI. One interesting feature of <b>this</b> <b>AI</b> was {{its ability to}} retreat if a certain damage level was reached.|$|E

50|$|SHRDLU was {{considered}} a tremendously successful demonstration of <b>AI.</b> <b>This</b> led other <b>AI</b> researchers to excessive optimism which was soon lost when later systems attempted to deal with situations with a more realistic level of ambiguity and complexity.

25|$|<b>This</b> {{shows that}} <b>ai</b> = 0, {{which means that}} the vectors v1 = (1, 1) and v2 = (−3, 2) are linearly independent.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2042, after an object [...] "fell from the sky and changed our world", and after the {{creation}} of the [...] "Anomaly AI". Descended from <b>this</b> <b>AI</b> are two characters, SynDI and George whose disembodied voices are heard by the player's character, Rider, throughout the game. Also in the events leading up to the game, the UN has designated some parts of the planet as [...] "United Nations Ungoverned Regions".|$|E
5000|$|... {{where the}} water {{deficiency}} [...] is calculated as {{the sum of the}} monthly differences between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for those months when the normal precipitation is less than the normal evapotranspiration; and where [...] stands for the sum of monthly values of potential evapotranspiration for the deficient months (after Huschke, 1959). <b>This</b> <b>AI</b> was later used by Meigs (1961) to delineate the arid zones of the world {{in the context of the}} UNESCO Arid Zone Research programme.|$|E

5000|$|<b>This</b> type of <b>A.I.</b> for {{security}} {{is known as}} [...] "rule-based" [...] because a human programmer must set rules {{for all of the}} things for which the user wishes to be alerted. This is the most prevalent form of A.I. {{for security}}. Many video surveillance camera systems today include <b>this</b> type of <b>A.I.</b> capability. The hard-drive that houses the program can either be located in the cameras themselves or can be in a separate device that receives the input from the cameras.|$|R
30|$|Also, the {{correlation}} between SEP and AFP, and SEP and AI {{were found to be}} positive (β[*]=[*] 0.053; 0.025) and significant (p[*]<[*] 0.01), and this confirms the results of previous study [73]. This indicates that the suitable amounts of SEP measures are necessary for AFP adoption and for the development of AI, which contribute to the improved fuel efficiency. Therefore, the hypothesis H 7 and H 8 are supported. Finally, AFP had no significant (β[*]=[*] 0.003, p[*]>[*] 0.1) effects on the <b>AI.</b> <b>This</b> is somewhat at odds with previous study [73] showing that AFP had a correlation with the <b>AI.</b> <b>This</b> difference occurs because the AFP in this study was dominantly produced from near term synthetic fuels. So, {{there is no need to}} change the existing <b>AI.</b> <b>This</b> confirms that hypotheses H 9 is not supported.|$|R

5000|$|Today's cars {{now have}} AI-based driver assist {{features}} such as self-parking and advanced cruise controls. AI {{has been used to}} optimize traffic management applications, which in turn reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as much as 25 percent. [...] In the future, fully autonomous cars will be developed. AI in transportation is expected to provide safe, efficient, and reliable transportation while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. The major challenge to developing <b>this</b> <b>AI</b> is the fact that transportation systems are inherently complex systems involving {{a very large number of}} components and different parties, each having different and often conflicting objectives.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the revelation}} that Stark experimented on himself {{at the end of}} Civil War II, Beast concludes that the only option is to let the {{experiments}} do their job in healing Tony and recover on his own. In Invincible Iron Man #1, an employee of Stark sends Riri Williams an artificial intelligence housing a copy of Tony Stark's consciousness to help her control and mentor in her own version of the Iron Man armor. <b>This</b> <b>A.I.</b> is directly copied from Tony's brain, granting sentience, with Williams commentating Stark existing as a [...] "techno-ghost."

50|$|MIDI {{to string}} {{instrument}} (guitar, violin, dombra, etc.) tablature conversion is a nontrivial task, {{as the same}} note can reside on different strings of the instrument. And the creation of good fingering is sometimes a challenge even for real musicians, especially when translating a two handed piano composition on a string instrument.So in TabEditor (the tiny plugin for REAPER DAW), an AI was used that solves this puzzle {{the same way as}} a musician would: trying to keep all the notes close to each other (to be possible to play) while trying to fit all the piano notes into a range that can be played simultaneously on the instrument. When direct translation is impossible (piano part has more notes than are possible on the guitar) the AI tries to find an acceptable solution, removing as few notes as possible from the original composition.The Prolog programming language was used to create <b>this</b> <b>AI.</b>|$|E
