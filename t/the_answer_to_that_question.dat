500|$|Ryan {{is skeptical}} of the {{scientific}} consensus on climate change. On July 30, 2014, at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor in Washington, D. C., he said [...] "Climate change occurs no matter what. The question is, can and should the federal government do something about it.(sic) And I would argue the federal government, with all its tax and regulatory schemes, can't." [...] On October 13, 2014, during a debate against Democratic challenger Rob Zerban in Kenosha, Wisconsin both candidates were asked if human activity was to blame for climate change, and Ryan answered: [...] "I don't know <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> I don't think science does, either." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Are Santa's Reindeer Used for Propulsion or Navigation?" [...] (2013), {{written by}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology student Phillip M. Cunio, deconstructs the poem to {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Kirk adamantly opposed libertarian ideas, {{which he}} saw {{as a threat to}} true conservatism. In Libertarians: the Chirping Sectaries Kirk wrote that the only thing libertarians and conservatives have in common is a detestation of collectivism. [...] "What else do conservatives and libertarians profess in common? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> is simple: nothing. Nor will they ever have.".|$|E

"First," [...] said Stephen, [...] "was <b>the</b> Declaration. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> was <b>the</b> Plea. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> was <b>the</b> Replication. Then {{came the}} Rejoinder, then the Surrejoinder, then the Rebutter, then the Surrebutter. But they rarely got that far," [...] he added unwisely.|$|R

2500|$|... "I know of {{only one}} person who came close to getting it right: Raymond Aron, the French philosopher and liberal anti-Communist. In a talk on the Soviet threat that I heard him give in the 1980s at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, he {{reminded}} the audience of Machiavelli's observation in The Prince that 'all armed prophets have conquered and all unarmed ones failed.' But what happens, Aron asked, if the prophet, having conquered and then ruled by force of arms, loses faith in his own prophecy? In <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> Aron suggested, lay {{the key to understanding}} the future of the Soviet Union." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anderson is [...] With her English {{accent and}} background, she was mocked and felt {{out of place}} as a {{teenager}} in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwestern accent. To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents. In May 2013, during an interview with BlogTalkRadio, Anderson addressed the matter of her national identity: [...] "I've been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don't know what <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> is. I know that I feel that London is home and I'm very happy with that as my home. I love London as a city and I feel very comfortable there. In terms of identity, I'm still a bit baffled." ...|$|E
2500|$|The metaphysical {{question}} is sometimes asked: [...] "Could quantum mechanics be extended by adding so-called [...] "hidden variables" [...] to the mathematical formalism, {{to convert it}} from an epistemic to an ontic theory?" [...] The Copenhagen interpretation answers this with a strong 'No'. It is sometimes alleged, for example by J.S. Bell, that Einstein opposed the Copenhagen interpretation because he believed that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> of [...] "hidden variables" [...] was [...] "yes". That allegation has achieved mythical potency, but is mistaken. Countering that myth, Max Jammer writes [...] "Einstein never proposed a hidden variable theory." [...] Einstein explored {{the possibility of a}} hidden variable theory, and wrote a paper describing his exploration, but withdrew it from publication because he felt it was faulty.|$|E

2500|$|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: [...] "The Goldstone Report {{is a field}} court-martial, and its {{findings}} were prewritten. This is a prize for terror. The report {{makes it difficult for}} democracies to fight terror." [...] On another occasion, Netanyahu said that the report ignored Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza and the Palestinian rocket attacks that preceded the war. He also warned world leaders that they and their anti-terror forces could be targets for charges similar to those in the report. At the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu called the report biased and unjust, asking: [...] "Will you stand with Israel or will you stand with the terrorists? We must know <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> now. Only if we have the confidence that we can defend ourselves can we take further risks for peace." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} for Baldassarre to discover <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> Meanwhile, he wanted to learn all he could about Florence. But he found, to his acute distress, that of the new details he learned he could only retain a few, and those only by continual repetition; and he began to be afraid of listening to any new discourse, lest it should obliterate what he was already striving to remember.|$|E
6000|$|But what Lord, {{and what}} God? Ah, my friends, {{all depends on}} <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> [...] "There be," [...] says St Paul, [...] "lords many, and gods many:" [...] and since his time, men have made fresh lords and gods for themselves, and {{believed}} in them, and worshipped them, while they fancied that they were believing in the one true God, in the same God in whom the man believed who wrote the 104th Psalm.|$|E
6000|$|... "My boy," [...] said he, [...] "you {{would require}} a more fully educated mind to {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> The subtleties of electrical science cannot be explained in a brief conversation. You'll have to study and apply to books for full light on that subject. Nevertheless, although I cannot carry you into the subject just now, I can {{tell you something about}} it. You remember the testing-room which I showed you yesterday--the darkened room between the captain's state-room and the entrance to the grand saloon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{depends upon}} ourselves. Have we pride enough to attempt still to lead mankind, {{and if we}} have, have we the wisdom and the quality? Or are we just the {{children}} of Good Luck, who are being found out? ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{should like}} to know <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> Japan of my limited view is {{inhabited}} almost entirely by little children whose duty is to prevent their elders from becoming too frivolous. The babies do a little work occasionally, but their parents interfere by petting them. At Yami's hotel the attendance {{is in the hands}} of ten-year-olds because everybody else has gone out picnicing among the cherry trees. The little imps find time to do a man's work and to scuffle on the staircase between whiles. My special servitor, called [...] "The Bishop" [...] on account of the gravity of his appearance, his blue apron, and gaiters, is the liveliest of the lot, but even his energy cannot account for the Professor's statistics of population....|$|E
60|$|Who was the stranger? To those that, from ties of {{relationship}} or otherwise, felt {{an interest in}} him, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> was not pleasant to dwell upon. His name was Langton--parentless--a dissipated young man--a brawler--one whose too frequent companions were rowdies, blacklegs, and swindlers. The New York police offices were not strangers to his countenance. He had been bred to the profession of medicine; besides, {{he had a very}} respectable income, and his house was in a pleasant street {{on the west side of}} the city. Little of his time, however, did Mr. John Langton spend at his domestic hearth; and the elderly lady who officiated as his housekeeper was by no means surprised to have him gone for a week or a month at a time, and she knowing nothing of his whereabouts.|$|E
60|$|Only the {{traveller}} who {{stops at}} that point is totally wrong; and the traveller only too often does stop {{at that point}}. He has found something to make him laugh, and he will not suffer it to make him think. And the remedy is not to unsay what he has said, not even, so to speak, to unlaugh what he has laughed, not to deny {{that there is something}} unique and curious about this American inquisition into our abstract opinions, but rather to continue the train of thought, and follow the admirable advice of Mr. H. G. Wells, who said, 'It is not much good thinking of a thing unless you think it out.' It is not to deny that American officialism is rather peculiar on this point, but to inquire what it really is which makes America peculiar, or which is peculiar to America. In short, it is to get some ultimate idea of what America is; and <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> will reveal something much deeper and grander and more worthy of our intelligent interest.|$|E
6000|$|Well, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> of course, was [...] "perfectly foul". But we Woosters are men of tact {{and have}} a nice sense of the {{obligations}} of a host.

2500|$|The Simon & Schuster Crossword Puzzle Series has {{published}} many unusual themed crosswords.

"Seek <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> in {{the hour}} of the battle when the white men, your brothers, fall beneath assegai as weeds fall before the hoe--or perhaps before it. But have done with Mameena, since she who never grows more old can well afford to wait. It is not of Mameena that you came to speak to me; it is of a fair white woman named Heddana you would speak, and of the man she loves, you, who will ever be mixing {{yourself}} up in affairs of others, and therefore must bear their burdens with no pay save that of honour. Hearken, for the time is short. When the storm bursts upon them bring hither the fair maiden, Heddana, and the white lord, Mauriti, and I will shelter them for your sake. Take them nowhere else. Bring them hither if they would escape trouble. I shall be glad to see you, Macumazahn, for at last I am about to smite the Zulu House of Senzangacona, my foes, with a bladder full of blood, and oh! it stains their doorposts red." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{sat down}} at the table, the {{accountant}} in the centre, Farintosh on the right, and Frank on the left. There was no talk save an occasional abrupt question and answer. For two hours the swish and rustle of the great blue pages of the ledgers were the chief sound, with the scratching of Mr. Wingfield's pen as he totalled up long columns of figures. Frank's heart turned to water as he saw the huge sums which had passed through this man's hands. How much had remained there? His whole future depended upon <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> How prosaic and undramatic are the moments in which a modern career is made or marred! In this obscure battlefield, the squire no longer receives his accolade in public for his work well done, nor do we see the butcher's cleaver as it hacks off the knightly spurs, but failure and success come strangely and stealthily, determined by trifles, and devoid of dignity. Here was the crisis of Frank's young life, in this mean front room, amongst the almanacs and the account-books.|$|E
6000|$|The words, I say, are {{to direct}} {{us not only}} to talk of, or to wish for, but to {{understand}} how we shall, and to seek that we may be, effectually saved, and therefore of the greatest importance. To be saved! what is like being saved? To be saved from sin, from hell, from the wrath of God, from eternal damnation, what is like it? To be made an heir of God, of his grace, of his kingdom, and eternal glory, what is like it? and yet all this is included in this word saved, and in <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "Are there few that be saved?" [...] Indeed this word SAVED is but of little use in the world, save to them that are heartily afraid of damning. This word lies in the Bible as excellent salves lie in some men's houses, thrust into a hole, and not thought on for many months, because the household people have no wounds nor sores.
