5|$|OTUs, {{employing}} as {{they did}} warplanes that were more advanced and more powerful than trainers, and teaching combat techniques that often carried high risk, generally suffered higher accident rates than other flying training schools. On 3March 1943, a Wirraway of No.4 OTU crashed near Williamtown, killing both crewmen. Two others died when their Vengeance crashed and burned near Goulburn during a cross-country exercise on 4August. On 16August, a Vengeance flew into trees after apparently pulling out late from a dive, resulting in two fatalities. A Vengeance blew up in flight during dive-bombing practice at Williamtown on 14September, killing both crewmen. On 5October, a Vengeance on a dive-bombing exercise crashed into the sea near Newcastle; both crewmen were reported as missing, believed killed. No.4 OTU suffered two more fatalities when a Vengeance struck a hill near Braidwood during a cross-country flight on 26November 1943. Another Vengeance hit the water and exploded in Nelson Bay on 7April 1944 after failing to recover from a dive, killing the <b>two-man</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E
25|$|On October 21, 1998, a Capital Táxi Aéreo EMB 120RT Brasilia {{registration}} PT-WKH crashed due {{to pilot}} error during final approach to Pinto Martins International Airport. The <b>two-man</b> <b>crew</b> and one passenger on board were killed, {{along with one}} person on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The Digital Flight Control (Fly-by-wire) cockpit is {{fitted with}} modern {{navigation}} {{systems such as}} satellite navigation (GPS), FMS, autopilot and weather radar. The ARIA 200-M all-weather integrated avionics system developed by Honeywell with the Moscow Research Institute of Aircraft Equipment, uses six 152 x 203mm (6 x 8in) LCDs to display information to the <b>two-man</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E

50|$|Single-seat torpedo bomber with divided {{undercarriage}} {{to allow}} a torpedo or 250-500 kg bomb to be carried under fuselage. Flown in 1934, a series of 50 built by 1935. <b>Two-men</b> <b>crew</b> for reconnaissance tasks.|$|R
25|$|The OH-1 Light Observation Helicopter is a tandem-seat, {{twin-engine}} scout helicopter. It has {{a narrow}} fuselage fitted with small stub wings and a non-retractable tail wheel undercarriage. The OH-1 is suited to armed scout, light escort, and observation duties. It {{is equipped with}} an automatic pilot system with flight holding functionality, while the cockpit features a multi-display system to lower workloads on its <b>two-man</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>two-man</b> <b>crew</b> sat {{in tandem}} in open cockpits. The rear observer's cockpit could be {{fitted with a}} ring machine gun {{mounting}} in case of serial production. The plane had a fixed, split axle conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage, {{in front of the}} cab. It had a maximum capacity of 210 L, but the normal capacity was 190 L.|$|E
25|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{glass bottle}} blowing machine was an automatic model introduced in 1905. The machine, {{operated by a}} <b>two-man</b> <b>crew</b> working 12-hour shifts, could produce 17,280 bottles in 24 hours, compared to 2,880 bottles made by a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day. The cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to $1.80 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers.|$|E
50|$|In Argentina {{there were}} {{developed}} manned torpedoes and special mini-submarines in the 1950s, the latter with a torpedo attached under the <b>two-men</b> <b>crew.</b> Their crews were trained by , {{a former member}} of the Italian Decima MAS.|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} {{use of the}} {{civilian}} Titan II was in the NASA Gemini program of manned space capsules in the mid-1960s. Twelve Titan II GLVs were used to launch two U.S. unmanned Gemini test launches and ten manned capsules with <b>two-man</b> <b>crews.</b> All of the launches were successes.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifting power}} and {{reliability}} of Titan missiles led to its selection and use in the NASA Gemini program of manned space capsules in the mid-1960s.

25|$|The {{second wave}} missed the Sunderland's {{assistance}} when the flying boat {{failed to take}} off from Gibraltar to escort them. They also missed the Galite Islands and a bomber sent from Malta to replace the Sunderland. One by one, the Hurricanes ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea, with the loss in all cases of both pilots and aircraft. One Skua managed to crash-land near Syracuse, Sicily, just before its fuel tanks became empty, and after being fired upon by an anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Italian army. The <b>two-man</b> <b>crew</b> was taken prisoner.|$|E
25|$|The <b>two-man</b> <b>crew,</b> {{pilot and}} navigator, were seated in tandem cockpits, each housed under {{separate}} clamshell canopies. A bombing/navigation radar is housed within an oblique-facing radome underneath the fuselage between the intakes and aft of the cockpit; {{much of the}} Mirage IV's onboard avionics systems, such as the radar communications, navigational instrumentation, and bombing equipment, were produced by Thomson-CSF. Other avionics elements were provided by Dassault itself and SFENA; {{one of the only}} major subsystems not of French origin onboard was the Marconi-built AD.2300 doppler radar. Free-falling munitions could also be aimed using a ventral blister-mounted periscope from the navigator's position.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to air brake systems, all locomotives and rail cars {{are equipped with}} at least one hand brake. This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Which if {{there would have been a}} <b>two-man</b> <b>crew</b> the crew would have been able to perform a stabilization test, which is all air brakes released and ensuring just the hand brakes will hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.|$|E
40|$|The system {{complexity}} and high workload {{of the next}} generation of light scout/attack helicopters is being evaluated in the Crew Station Research and Development Program. This program has been established to study the issues of battle captain performance for one-man versus <b>two-man</b> <b>crews</b> when confronted by a hostile environment. The crew station experiments are described along with the facility elements and simulation...|$|R
50|$|During the inter-war years, the French Army adopted three light {{tanks in}} the {{infantry}} tank role. These were the Hotchkiss H35, the Renault R35 and the FCM 36. All three had <b>two-man</b> <b>crews</b> and {{were similar to}} the Matilda I in terms of size, weight and armour. However, they were better armed, having 37mm guns as well as co-axial machine guns.|$|R
5000|$|The Seehund (German: [...] "seal"), {{also known}} as Type XXVII, was a {{successful}} series of German midget submarines created during World War II. Designed in 1944, and operated by <b>two-man</b> <b>crews,</b> the submarines were used by the Kriegsmarine during the closing months of the war, sinking nine merchant vessels and damaging an additional three, with 35 losses mostly attributed to bad weather.|$|R
25|$|The English Electric Canberra is a {{twin-engine}} bomber aircraft, {{capable of}} conducting high-altitude flights and {{making use of}} jet propulsion. The overall design {{has been described as}} being of a simple nature, somewhat resembling a scaled-up Gloster Meteor fighter, except for its use of a mid-wing. The Canberra principally differed from its preceding piston-powered wartime bombers via its twin Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. The fuselage was circular in cross section, tapered at both ends and, cockpit aside, entirely without protrusions; the line of the large, low-aspect ratio wings was broken only by the tubular engine nacelles. The Canberra had a <b>two-man</b> <b>crew</b> under a fighter-style cabin which was furnished with a large blown canopy, but delays {{in the development of the}} intended automatic radar bombsight resulted in the addition of a bomb aimer's position housed within the nose. The pilot and navigator were positioned in a tandem arrangement on Martin-Baker ejection seats.|$|E
25|$|The RMS Titanic was an Olympic class {{passenger}} liner {{owned by the}} White Star Line and was built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, {{in what is now}} Northern Ireland. At the time of her construction, she was the largest passenger steamship in the world. Shortly before midnight on April 14, 1912, four days into the ship's maiden voyage, Titanic struck an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later, early on April 15, 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 of the 2,223 people on board, {{making it one of the}} deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. After nearly 74 years of being lost at sea on the bottom of the ocean floor, a joint Franco-American expedition led by American oceanographer Dr. Robert D. Ballard, discovered the wreckage of the RMS Titanic two miles (3km) beneath the waves of the North Atlantic on September 1, 1985. Ballard was then forced to wait a year for weather conditions favorable to a manned mission to view the wreck at close range. In 1986, Ballard and his <b>two-man</b> <b>crew,</b> in the ALVIN submersible, made the first two and-a-half hour descent to the ocean floor to view the wreck first-hand. Over the next few days, they descended again and again and, using the Jason Jr. remote camera, recorded the first scenes of the ruined interior of the luxury liner.|$|E
500|$|The Boeing AH-64 Apache is an American four-blade, twin-turboshaft attack {{helicopter}} with a tailwheel-type landing gear arrangement and a tandem cockpit for a <b>two-man</b> <b>crew.</b> It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and night vision systems. It is {{armed with a}} [...] M230 chain gun carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four hardpoints mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. The AH-64 has {{a large amount of}} systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.|$|E
25|$|September 21, 1940: The Italian {{submarine}} Gondar departed La Spezia for Alexandria, carrying three Maiale {{and four}} <b>two-man</b> <b>crews.</b> The Gondar reached Alexandria {{on the evening}} of September 30, but was spotted by British and Australian destroyers, which attacked. Severely damaged, it was forced to the surface and scuttled by the crew. They were captured, along with the Decima MAS crewmen (including Elios Toschi).|$|R

500|$|On 16 March 1943, Newton led a sortie on the Salamaua Isthmus {{in which}} his Boston was hit {{repeatedly}} by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, damaging fuselage, wings, fuel tanks and undercarriage. In spite of this he continued his attack and dropped his bombs at low level on buildings, ammunition dumps and fuel stores, returning for a second pass at the target in order to strafe it with machine-gun fire. Newton managed to get his crippled machine back to base, where it {{was found to be}} marked with ninety-eight bullet holes. Two days later, he and his <b>two-man</b> <b>crew</b> made a further attack on Salamaua with five other Bostons. As he bombed his designated target, Newton's plane was seen to burst into flames, raked by cannon fire from the ground. Attempting to keep his aircraft aloft as long as possible to get his crew away from enemy lines, he was able to ditch in the sea approximately [...] offshore.|$|E
500|$|In {{coastal areas}} of Texas, damage {{was limited to}} the sinking of several shrimp boats and the {{beaching}} of sail boats. One ship [...] the Mermaid of the Sea [...] was {{caught in the middle of}} the storm. Although it sunk, its crew was rescued. A pleasure boat with three occupants and the <b>two-man</b> <b>crew</b> of a beached catamaran were all reported missing, but were later found. Three other people on board a fishing vessel were treated for exposure. Rescue ships were hampered by anchored Mexican boats and surfers in a channel near the Coast Guard station. According to the Coast Guard, all nine ships that had been reported missing in the storm were later accounted for. Along with the ships, an oil drilling rig in the Gulf was ripped from its location and ran aground near Matagorda Island by the storm. The 19crew members of the rig were rescued by helicopter. As the rig had not yet begun drilling, there was no threat from an oil spill.|$|E
50|$|Poland {{imported}} the British Vickers Six-Ton {{tank and}} began production of improved models. The pinnacle of this improvement program was the 7TP, which featured a diesel engine and 37 mm gun. Poland also produced the TKS series of tankettes, similar in concept to the Vickers-Carden-Loyd machinegun carriers of Britain and the UE of France. These vehicles had <b>two-man</b> <b>crews,</b> thin armor, {{and a single}} ball-mounted light machinegun.|$|R

50|$|The 1,000 Ethiopians behind Criniti {{joined the}} battle {{at this time}} and Criniti's command came under fire from all directions. The Ethiopians surged forward, {{slaughtered}} the Eritrean infantry, and engulfed the Italian tanks. Some Ethiopians were able to approach the tanks from the rear and were then able to disable the tracks and machine guns. Their tanks rendered useless, the <b>two-man</b> <b>crews</b> were killed.|$|R
500|$|The Japanese {{attempted}} {{to cut off}} the stream of Allied transports by bombing the Wau airstrip, but it was the rainy season and they were confronted by the same weather conditions which hampered the Allies. Aircraft which did set off from Rabaul were not able to sight the Wau airstrip and returned without accomplishing anything. Not until 6 February was there an aerial engagement. Eight P-39s of the 40th Fighter Squadron were patrolling at [...] over Wau, having provided escort for a flight of five Dakotas, when they sighted 24 Japanese planes. Captain Thomas H. Winburn led his P-39s in an attack, claiming 11 Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes and Mitsubishi Ki-21 [...] "Sallys" [...] shot down. Meanwhile, eight P-40s of the 7th Fighter Squadron also on an escort mission sighted 12 aircraft bombing the airstrip at Wau. The transports they were escorting turned back while the fighters engaged the Japanese, claiming seven aircraft shot down. At this time, there were four Dakotas on the ground at Wau and another five were circling, waiting to land. One Dakota, commanded by Second Lieutenant Robert M. Schwensen, was shot down. All five crewmen on board were killed. A Dakota on the ground was damaged, and a CAC Wirraway was destroyed by a bomb blast. Its <b>two-man</b> <b>crew</b> had hurriedly left the aircraft seconds before and thrown themselves flat on the ground. The pilot, Flight Sergeant A.
