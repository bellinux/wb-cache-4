The composition {{was influenced by the}} electropop of underground bands in Los Angeles, whose sound The Veronicas were keen to incorporate into their own music. Jessica explained the lyrical content and central theme behind [...] "Hook Me Up": [...] "It's about being tired with where you're at in life and wanting to get away and out for {{just a little bit of}} time-whether it's in a relationship or in life.

500|$|Soul Food Taqueria {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. Exclaim! editor Noel Dix observed {{an improvement in}} production and complexity of instrumentation by Guerrero from his earlier work, and stated, [...] "This record pours so much heart and emotion into it that you’re bound to feel its warmth and splendor while it’s bumping in your walkman as you trek the city streets." [...] Noting <b>that</b> <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> of Somethin was criticized as a [...] "lifeless piece of pop-trip-hop", Brian Ho of Dusted praised Guerrero's artistic growth and found [...] "everything" [...] to be [...] "an improvement over its predecssor", writing that the album [...] "is filled {{to the brim with}} body and life in a way that few albums can claim". XLR8R critic Liz Cordingley called the album a [...] "nice case of dubby, electric guitar-driven downtempo", and called its music [...] "dusty lo-fi soul that is seductively languid". Joe Warminsky of the Washington City Paper praised Guerrero's minimalist approach to the album's chill-out sound, as the chill-out music genre mostly features implementation of a slicker production. He also compared the lo-fi grooves of Soul Food Taqueria to [...] "Shuggie Otis with Baja roots". Carmen Johnson of Prefix Mag called it a [...] "stellar follow-up to 2000's A Little Bit of Somethin", and commended Guerrero for producing [...] "his own organic, subterranean blend of bohemian blues, hip-hop and salsa that's creative and adventurous". Johnson called it [...] "the perfect soundtrack for the lazy days that hearken back to the end of summer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another type of {{stripped}} down and raw {{music with a}} variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma. It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly Texas, together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as [...] "a little bit of this, {{and a little bit of}} <b>that,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of black and a little bit of white... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey." [...] East Texan Al Dexter had a hit with [...] "Honky Tonk Blues", and seven years later [...] "Pistol Packin' Mama". These [...] "honky tonk" [...] songs associated barrooms, were performed by the likes of Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells (the first major female country solo singer), Ted Daffan, Floyd Tillman, and the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams, would later be called [...] "traditional" [...] country. Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll, such as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, as well as Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones. Webb Pierce was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four.|$|E

6000|$|Finally, {{it is an}} {{extraordinary}} fact <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of soft thread, 1/50 of an inch in length and weighing 1/8197 of a grain, or of a human hair, 8/1000 of an inch in length and weighing only 1/78740 of a grain (.000822 milligramme), or particles of precipitated chalk, after resting {{for a short time}} on a gland, should induce some change in its cells, exciting them [page 33] to transmit a motor impulse throughout the whole length of the pedicel, consisting of about twenty cells, to near its base, causing this part to bend, and the tentacle to sweep through an angle of above 180o. That the contents of the cells of the glands, and afterwards those of the pedicels, are affected in a plainly visible manner by the pressure of minute particles, we shall have abundant evidence when we treat of the aggregation of protoplasm. But the case is much more remarkable than as yet stated; for the particles are supported by the viscid and dense secretion; nevertheless, even smaller ones than those of which the measurements have been given, when brought by an insensibly slow movement, through the means above specified, into contact with the surface of a gland, act on it, and the tentacle bends. The pressure exerted by the particle of hair, weighing only 1/78740 of a grain and supported by a dense fluid, must have been inconceivably slight. We may conjecture that it could hardly have equalled the millionth of a grain; and we shall hereafter see that far less than the millionth of a grain of phosphate of ammonia in solution, when absorbed by a gland, acts on it and induces movement. A bit of hair, 1/50 of an inch in length, and therefore much larger than those used in the above experiments, was not perceived when placed on my tongue; and it is extremely doubtful whether any nerve in the human body, even if in an inflamed condition, would be in any way affected by such a particle supported in a dense fluid, and slowly brought into contact with the nerve. Yet the cells of the glands of Drosera are thus excited to transmit a motor impulse to a distant point, inducing movement. It appears to me that hardly any more remarkable fact than this has been observed in the vegetable kingdom. [page 34] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 60. When {{you have}} once {{got the feeling}} {{of the way in which}} {{gradation}} expresses roundness and projection, you may try your strength on anything natural or artificial that happens to take your fancy, provided it be not too complicated in form. I have asked you to draw a stone first, because any irregularities and failures in your shading will be less offensive to you, as being partly characteristic of the rough stone surface, than they would be in a more delicate subject; and you may as well go on drawing rounded stones of different shapes for a little while, till you find you can really shade delicately. You may then take up folds of thick white drapery, a napkin or towel thrown carelessly on the table is as good as anything, and try to express them in the same way; only now you will find that your shades must be wrought with perfect unity and tenderness, or you will lose the flow of the folds. Always remember <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> perfected is worth more than many scrawls; whenever you feel yourself inclined to scrawl, give up work resolutely, and do not go back to it till next day. Of course your towel or napkin must be put on something that may be locked up, so that its folds shall not be disturbed till you have finished. If you find that the folds will not look right, get a photograph of a piece of drapery (there are plenty now to be bought, taken from the sculpture of the cathedrals of Rheims, Amiens, and Chartres, which will at once educate your hand and your taste), and copy some piece of that; you will then ascertain what it is that is wanting in your studies from Nature, whether more gradation, or greater watchfulness of the disposition of the folds. Probably for some time you will find yourself failing painfully in both, for drapery is very difficult to follow in its sweeps; but do not lose courage, for the greater the difficulty, the greater the gain in the effort. If your eye is more just in measurement of form than delicate in perception of tint, a pattern on the folded surface will help you. Try whether it does or not: and if the patterned drapery confuses you, keep for a time to the simple white one; but if it helps you, continue to choose patterned stuffs (tartans and simple checkered designs are better at first than flowered ones), and even though it should confuse you, begin pretty soon to use a pattern occasionally, copying all the distortions and perspective modifications of it among the folds with scrupulous care.|$|E
