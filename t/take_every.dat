Schuck was one of five children of Jakob Schuck, a coal miner and veteran of World War I, and his wife. After graduation from the Volksschule (primary school), he unsuccessfully applied for an apprenticeship at the coal mine in Falkenhorst. Money was tight in the family and higher education was out of reach. He then jobbed at a local brickyard. After a plebiscite on 13 January 1935, Saar was restored to Germany on 1 March 1935. The introduction of the compulsory military service on 16 March 1935 was seen by Schuck as a career opportunity and a chance to fulfil his dream of flying. His father, who had experienced the trench warfare during World War I, advised him to <b>take</b> <b>every</b> opportunity to avoid service in the infantry. Schuck volunteered for service in the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht at the age of 16, before he could be conscripted into the infantry.|$|E

The team felt that dividing focus and resources across both a single-player and an online multiplayer mode {{would be less}} efficient. When questioned {{about the lack of}} an online multiplayer mode, Öjerfors explained that the decision was simple. [...] "If we could <b>take</b> <b>every</b> bit of energy and sweat the studio has and pour all that into the single-player campaign, it gives us the resources to make something very, very cool, compared to if we would also have to divert some of our resources to making multiplayer."

According to Martin, [...] "a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. [...] But there's another dimension to Shae as well. She's not as practiced and hardened at this as a more seasoned pro. There's still a girl next door quality to her, a sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. [...] All of our Shaes were hot as hell. But only a handful of them captured that other quality, maybe three out of twenty, and Sibel was the standout. [...] Watching those auditions, any red-blooded male would want to <b>take</b> <b>every</b> one of our Shae candidates to bed. But Sibel made you fall in love with her as well." ...|$|E

Lady Leicester's social life was much curtailed. Even her movements could pose a political problem, as Francis Walsingham explained: [...] "I see not her Majesty disposed to use the services of my Lord of Leicester.

Pat Harney, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "We are dealing with a worldwide threat ... This is not a light matter." [...] In preparation for the February 10, 2008 protests outside Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, the Church of Scientology spent $4,500 to hire ten off-duty police officers for security.
