5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E

5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|Before marriage, women {{used to wear}} a Kirgi (sari) and Baju (blouse). The Kirgi is a {{piece of}} cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was wrapped around the body from <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> down. A jacket with long sleeves called a Baju, was used to cover {{the upper part of the}} body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the Ros ceremony. The Kirgi was wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder. To wear the sari with its end thrown over the shoulder, known as Worl, is the {{exclusive}} right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The Salwar kameez is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari is known as a Sado. It is usually a red-coloured Banarasi sari which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings. In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the bride went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the bride wears (in place of the Kirgi) a red sari, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder; it is wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>waist.</b> The bride wears a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the Dantoni (golden combs). Other ornaments worn by the bride in the olden days included Kanti, Chakrasar, Kap, Karap, Mugud, Kanto, and Dantoni.|$|E

40|$|The {{calculation}} formula for {{the shape of}} tapered fibers in movable large-zone furnace fiber-tapering system is derived by the discrete deducing method. We analyze the influences of some setting parameters of the movable large-zone furnace fiber-tapering system, such as moving distance, moving speed of the furnace and moving speed of the holders, on the shape of tapered fibers. The impact {{to the shape of}} <b>the</b> fiber <b>waist</b> is discussed primarily. It is found that the furnace moving distance affects <b>the</b> fiber <b>waist</b> length and radius greatly, while the moving speed of the furnace and the holders can effect <b>the</b> fiber <b>waist</b> radius visibly. However, both the speed of the furnace and the holders cannot affect <b>the</b> fiber <b>waist</b> length obviously. All these results are important for the large-zone furnace fiber-tapering technology...|$|R

Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found {{to be very difficult to}} start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E
