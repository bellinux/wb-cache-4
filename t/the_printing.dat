5|$|He is {{credited}} with popularising a technical innovation in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> of illustrations using wood. He adopted metal-engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain, producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type, but were much more durable than traditional woodcuts.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>print</b> had {{a clearly}} marked “W” on the recto, {{along with other}} writing that {{appeared}} to be the initials “H.B.”.

The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> and artistic quality.|$|E

5|$|Antoine Gardano {{became the}} primary Italian {{publisher}} for Arcadelt, although the competing Venetian publishing house of Scotto brought {{out one of}} his madrigal books as well. Arcadelt's Il bianco e dolce cigno opened one of Gardano's books; as the piece had already achieved immense fame, it was the main selling point. In Paris, some of Arcadelt's chansons appeared as early as 1540 in the publications of Pierre Attaingnant and Jacques Moderne, so must have been written in Italy. After Arcadelt returned to France, his chansons, masses, and motets appeared in the editions of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> firm of Le Roy and Ballard throughout the 1550s and 1560s, while his music was still being printed in distant Venice.|$|E
