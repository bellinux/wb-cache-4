Free glycerol was extracted off-line from biodiesel samples with water, and <b>total</b> <b>glycerol</b> was converted to free glycerol by saponification with sodium ethylate under sonication. For free glycerol, a linear response was observed from 5 to 70 mg L(- 1) with a detection limit of 0. 5 mg L(- 1), which corresponds to 2 mg kg(- 1) in biodiesel. The coefficient of variation was 0. 9 % (20 mg L(- 1), n = 10). For <b>total</b> <b>glycerol,</b> samples were diluted on-line, and the linear response range was 25 to 300 mg L(- 1).

30|$|Since acetate, an {{extracellular}} {{byproduct of}} aerobic fermentation, inhibits cell growth and recombinant protein formation (Shiloach and Fass 2005), glycerol was fed with an increasingly exponential feeding rate before IPTG induction (Cheng et al. 2011; Fang et al. 2011) and the <b>total</b> amount of <b>glycerol</b> {{used during the}} fermentation was about 180  g. When OD 600 reached 15, 7.5  g/L glycine and 5.0  g/L NaCl was supplied (Cheng et al. 2011). When OD 600 reached 50, 0.7  mM IPTG was added and glycerol feeding rate switched to 12  mL/h. The air flow rate was set at 1.8  L/min, temperature was set at 37  °C, pH was kept at 7.0 by automatic addition of ammonia solution (25  %, v/v) and antifoam was added manually when necessary. The DO level was maintained around 30  % of air saturation by varying the agitation speed from 300 to 900  rpm. Residual glycerol in the broth was measured using HPLC (Agilent Technologies 1200 series, USA) according to the published method (Tamura et al. 2010).

Conversion rate of MSG to GABA is defined as the mole ratio of the produced GABA to the added MSG.|$|R
40|$|A {{biosensor}} is {{an analytical}} device that uses biomaterials as {{elements of the}} sensing system and converts a biological response into an electrical signal. Biodiesel is a bio-based alternative, biodegradable, renewable, nontoxic diesel fuel made from a chemical reaction between alcohol (usually methanol or ethanol) and plant oil or animal fat. A need to provide accurate, real-time information for the quality sensing of biodiesel properties such as free and <b>total</b> <b>glycerol</b> {{has led to an}} ever-increasing demand for biosensor development. Being able to monitor specific physical and chemical properties is the prerequisite for developing a biosensor for quality sensing of the biodiesel. This article proposes a method for detection of the blend level of degraded biodiesel and lipase as a bioelement of biosensor systems. A design of an electrochemical potentiometric biosensor for quality sensing of biodiesel properties is proposed and discussed in detail. However, experimental trials, actual implementation and evaluations are necessary to understand the feasibility of the proposed biodiesel biosensor...|$|E

This study was done to optimize the manufacture of biodiesel from used cooking oil. This study uses a completely randomized design with four treatments, T 1 (Reaction tansesterifikasi 2 hours), T 2 (transesterification reaction 3 hours), T 3 (transesterification reaction 4 hours) and T 4 (transesterification reaction 5 hours) with three replications. The {{data were analyzed using}} ANOVA, continued by DNMRT at 5 % level. The results showed that the transesterification reaction time was significantly (P 0. 05) on the water content.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to explore a new transesterification process from waste cooking oil to biodiesel using ultrasonic technique. The conversion of waste cooking oil with sodium hydroxide as catalyst used ultrasonic type of clamp on tubular reactor at 20 kHz. The reaction time, molar ratio, and biodiesel quality of this process were compared with conventional transesterification. Method analyzed a <b>total</b> <b>glycerol</b> and free glycerol was determined with Gas Chromatography referred to EN 14105 and functional group of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) used Attenuated Total Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-IR) instruments. At the results, with presence of cavitation on the ultrasonic, chemical activity was increased so that the rate of ester formation is significantly enhanced. The ultrasonic technique could reduce the transesterification reaction time to 5 minute compared to 2 hours for mechanical stirring processing.

40|$|Glycerol is a {{naturally}} occurring 3 -carbon {{alcohol in the}} human body. It is the structural backbone of triacylglycerol molecules, and can also be converted to a glycolytic substrate for subsequent metabolism. Serum glycerol concentrations approximate 0. 05 mmol/L at rest, and can increase to 0. 30 mmol/L during increased lipolysis associated with prolonged exercise or caloric restriction. When glycerol is ingested or infused at doses greater than 1. 0 g/kg bodyweight, serum concentrations can increase to approximately 20 mmol/L, resulting {{in more than a}} 10 mOsmol/kg increase in serum osmolality. Glycerol infusion and ingestion have been used in research settings for almost 60 years, with widespread clinical use between 1961 and 1980 in the treatment of cerebral oedema resulting from acute ischaemic stroke, intraocular hypertension (glaucoma), intracranial hypertension, postural syncope and improved rehydration during acute gastrointestinal disease. Since 1987, glycerol ingestion with added fluid has been used to increase <b>total</b> body water (<b>glycerol</b> hyperhydration) by up to 700 ml, thereby providing benefits of improved thermoregulation and endurance during exercise or exposure to hot environments. Despite the small number of studies on glycerol hyperhydration and exercise, it appears to be an effective method of improving tolerance to exercise and other heat-related stressors...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intravenous}} infusion of 10 % glycerol on regional {{cerebral blood flow}} (using hydrogen bolus and Xenon- 133 [' 33 Xe] clearance methods) and metabolism was investigated in 57 patients with recent cerebral infarction. Hemispheric blood flow (HBF) increased, together with increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebral blood volume (rCBV), in foci of brain ischemia. Hemispheric oxygen con-sumption (HMIO 2) decreased together with hemispheric respiratory quotient. Systemic blood levels of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and triglycerides also increased after glycerol while free fatty acids (FFA) and in-organic phosphate (Pi) decreased. Hemispheric glucose consumption was unaltered after glycerol so that hemispheric glucose to oxygen ratio tended to rise. Pyruvate and lactate production by brain was un-changed. Glycerol moved across the blood brain barrier into brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Release of FFA and Pi from infarcted brain was reversed by <b>glycerol.</b> <b>Total</b> phosphate balance was maintained across brain {{both before and after}} glycerol infusion. Triglycerides increased in CSF after glycerol, originating either from cerebral blood or as a result of lipogenesis in cerebral tissue. The EEG recording and neurological status of the patients improved despite decreased brain oxygen consumption.

40|$|MR {{spectroscopy}} {{represents one}} of themost suitable in vivo tool to assess neurochemical dysfunction in several brain disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This is themost common neuropsychiatric disorder in childhood and adolescence, which persists into adulthood (in approximately 30 %– 50 % of cases). In past years, many studies have applied different MR spectroscopy techniques to investigate the pathogenesis and effect of conventional treatments. In this article, we review the most recent clinical and preclinical MR spectroscopy results on subjects with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and animal models, from childhood to adulthood. We found that the most investigated brain regions were the (pre) frontal lobes and striatum, both involved in the frontostriatal circuits and networks that {{are known to be}} impaired in this pathology. Neurometabolite alterationswere detected in several regions: theNAA, choline, and glutamatergic compounds. The creatine pool was also altered when an absolute quantitative protocol was adopted. In particular, glutamatewas increased in childrenwith attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and this can apparently be reversed bymethylphenidate treatment. The main difficulties in reviewing MR spectroscopy studies were in the nonhomogeneity of the analyzed subjects, the variety of the investigated brain regions, and also the use of different MR spectroscopy techniques. As for possible improvements in future studies, we recommend the use of standardized protocols and the analysis of other brain regions of particular interest for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, like the hippocampus, limbic structures, thalamus, and cerebellum.
