5|$|The A1 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed <b>toll</b> system integrated with the A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming a unified <b>toll</b> system. Since the two motorways are operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the <b>toll</b> collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. The <b>toll</b> is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and debit cards and using a number of prepaid <b>toll</b> collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC – an electronic <b>toll</b> collection (ETC) which is shared at all motorways in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at <b>toll</b> plazas and a discounted <b>toll</b> rates.|$|E
5|$|The A3 is a {{partially}} tolled motorway {{based on the}} vehicle classification in Croatia. The westernmost section of the motorway, spanning the Bobovica interchange and the Bregana border crossing, is tolled at Bregana <b>toll</b> plaza using an open <b>toll</b> collection system; the motorway sections east of Ivanja Reka interchange are tolled using a closed <b>toll</b> collection system, integrated with the A5 motorway as the two connect at the Sredanci interchange, forming a unified <b>toll</b> collection system. As of October 2010, Bregana <b>toll</b> plaza charges 5.00kuna (0.68euro) to passenger cars and 20.00kuna (2.74euro) to semi-trailer trucks. The <b>toll</b> charged along the A3 route between Ivanja Reka and Lipovac varies depending on the distance travelled and ranges from 3.00kuna (0.41euro) to 105.00kuna (14.38euro) for passenger cars and 10.00kuna (1.37euro) to 350.00kuna (47.95euro) for semi-trailer trucks.

5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system of tolling between the Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls <b>toll</b> plazas, {{as well as}} on the Northeast Extension to Wyoming Valley. When {{entering}} the turnpike, motorists receive a ticket listing the <b>toll</b> for each exit; the ticket is surrendered when exiting, and the applicable <b>toll</b> is paid. If the ticket is lost, motorists are charged the maximum <b>toll</b> for that exit. Cash, credit cards, and E-ZPass are accepted at traditional <b>toll</b> plazas. An eastbound mainline <b>toll</b> plaza is located at Gateway near the Ohio border, charging a flat <b>toll</b> using cash or E-ZPass, and an all-electronic westbound mainline <b>toll</b> gantry is located at the Delaware River Bridge near the New Jersey border, charging a flat <b>toll</b> using <b>TOLL</b> BY PLATE (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass at highway speeds. There is no <b>toll</b> between Gateway and Warrendale and between Neshaminy Falls and the Delaware River Bridge.

40|$|System optimal (SO) {{or first}} best pricing is {{examined}} in networks with multiple user classes and elastic demand, where different user classes {{have a different}} average value of value of time (VOT). Different flows (and first best <b>tolls)</b> are obtained {{depending on whether the}} SO characterisation is in units of generalised time or money.

The standard first best <b>tolls</b> for the money unit system optimum may seem to be practicable, but the objective function of the money unit system optimum is nonconvex, leading to possible multiple optima (and non-unique first best <b>tolls).</b> Since these standard first best <b>tolls</b> are unsatisfactory, we look to finding common money <b>tolls</b> which drive user equilibrium flows to time unit SO flows.

5|$|<b>Toll</b> plazas {{are located}} along the South Bay Expressway at all {{northbound}} onramps and southbound offramps; {{there is also}} a mainline Otay Mesa <b>Toll</b> Plaza {{at the southern end of}} the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road.

Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which <b>toll</b> booth they pass through, using a barrier <b>toll</b> system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa <b>Toll</b> Plaza ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent <b>toll</b> increase on the Dulles <b>Toll</b> Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These <b>toll</b> surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these <b>toll</b> increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs projected by 2020.

At the same time the annual meeting demanded that the company withdraw from its various tasks related to establishing <b>toll</b> projects on Bølmo and Halsnøy as well as administrative work of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association. In a 2007 report from the Public Roads Administration, SBT was one of seven <b>toll</b> companies which was criticized for too high administration costs. The <b>toll</b> changed the operator of the <b>toll</b> plaza from Bru- og Tunnelselskapet to Vegamot in 2010. The same year the <b>toll</b> plaza had 1,910,280 passing vehicles and a revenue of NOK142 million. This made it the ninth-largest <b>toll</b> road in Norway by revenue.

A contract was awarded to build this interchange in November 1995. In 1997, transportation officials agreed upon a design for the interchange. The project also included the movement {{the western end of}} the ticket system to a new <b>toll</b> plaza in Warrendale. The interchange project was delayed by a dispute with Marshall and Pine townships in Allegheny County, who wanted to prevent construction of the <b>toll</b> plaza as they thought it would cause noise, air and light pollution. Marshall Township eventually agreed to allow the <b>toll</b> plaza be built. Groundbreaking for the new interchange took place on February 22, 2002.

5|$|Seeing {{that the}} {{artillery}} would not break the Polish, General von <b>Toll</b> devised {{a new plan}} of attack. He decided to disregard Paskevich's order not to assault Warsaw. Although dusk was nearing, von <b>Toll</b> ordered an all-out assault on both the western and southern fronts. As {{there was no time}} for proper artillery preparation, von <b>Toll</b> wanted to overwhelm the defenders by sheer numerical superiority, even if it meant increased casualties from Polish artillery. To distract the Polish artillery at Czyste and prevent it from firing at the Russian columns attacking Forts 21 and 22, Muraviev's forces were to lead the attack directly towards the Jerozolimskie Gate. Before 15:00, von <b>Toll</b> dispatched General Neidhardt to Paskevich to receive his blessing for the new plan, but Paskevich categorically refused, and ordered his subordinate to continue shelling the Polish forts with artillery at least until 16:00.

5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at Lučko {{mainline}} <b>toll</b> plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In 2009, {{in an effort}} to address the problem, the Lučko mainline <b>toll</b> plaza was expanded to 15lanes, and a single additional 10-lane <b>toll</b> plaza was built for fast cashless <b>toll</b> collection in Demerje. The Demerje <b>toll</b> plaza is available via a motorway fork accessible to the A1 northbound traffic only. Vehicles using the Demerje <b>toll</b> plaza default to the original motorway route immediately past the Lučko mainline <b>toll</b> plaza, between the plaza and the Lučko interchange. The faster cashless system has raised the nominal capacity of the road from 2,325 to 11,150 vehicles per hour. As of September 2010 northbound traffic leaving the A1 must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to be integrated into the tolled motorway network, as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Lučko <b>toll</b> plaza.
