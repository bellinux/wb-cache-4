25|$|In modern {{clinical}} practice, physicians personally assess {{patients in}} order to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins an interaction with {{an examination of the}} patient's medical history and medical record, followed by a medical interview and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g. stethoscope, <b>tongue</b> <b>depressor)</b> are typically used. After examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the doctor may order medical tests (e.g. blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies. Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts {{is an important part of}} the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions. Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue.|$|E
2500|$|The second, {{more famous}} {{instance}} involved Winnicott placing a spatula (<b>tongue</b> <b>depressor)</b> within the child's reach {{for him to}} play with. Winnicott considered that [...] "if he is just an ordinary baby he will notice the attractive object...and he will reach for it.... {{in the course of}} a little while he will discover what he wants to do with it". From the child's initial hesitation in making use of the spatula, Winnicott derived his idea of the necessary 'period of hesitation' in childhood (or analysis), which makes possible a true connection to the toy, interpretation or object presented for transference.|$|E

40|$|Buccal {{cells are}} {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} source of quality DNA to improve participation rates in molecular studies. Here, three buccal cell collection protocols were compared to determine factors a � ecting the yield of cells, total DNA per sample, and DNA yield per cell. In addition, kinetic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (TaqMan TM) was used to quantify human DNA available for PCR. The method of collection used in¯uenced the overall DNA yield per sample. The collection bu � er used in¯uenced the number of cells but not the overall DNA yield per sample. Repeated freezing and thawing did not a � ect overall DNA yield per sample, DNA yield per cell, or the total number of cells collected. Mouthwashes had the highest DNA yield per sample (20. 8 mg) compared with cytobrush samples (1. 9 mg from three cytobrushes) and <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors</b> (0. 8 mg from three <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors).</b> However, mouthwash samples may contain signi®cant non-human DNA and other contaminants that could interfere with some molecular studies.

50|$|Value-added wood {{products}} in Ontario {{are the result}} of combining commodity level products and innovation. Essentially, producing value-added {{wood products}} means taking raw materials and turning it into something useful. For example: engineered wood, millwork, cabinets, furniture, <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors</b> or popsicle sticks, just to name a few. Additional processing of a commodity wood product by manufacturers creates a specialty product whose value is more than the original product. These value-added products become part of the secondary sector of our economy.|$|R
50|$|To {{assess the}} gums, a <b>tongue</b> <b>depressor</b> gently retracts the cheek to allow {{inspection}} of {{the upper and lower}} gums.

50|$|A <b>tongue</b> <b>depressor</b> {{is a tool}} used {{in medical}} {{practice}} to depress the tongue to allow for examination of the mouth and throat. The most common modern tongue depressors are flat, thin, wooden blades, smoothed and rounded at both ends, but, historically, tongue depressors have been made {{of a variety of}} materials. Since they are inexpensive and difficult to clean, wooden tongue depressors are labeled for disposal after a single use.|$|E

50|$|A {{medical device}} is an instrument, apparatus, implant, in vitro reagent, or similar or related article {{that is used}} to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease or other conditions, and does not achieve its {{purposes}} through chemical action within or on the body (which would make it a drug). Whereas medicinal products (also called pharmaceuticals) achieve their principal action by pharmacological, metabolic or immunological means, medical devices act by physical, mechanical, or thermal means. Medical devices vary greatly in complexity and application. Examples range from simple devices such as <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors,</b> medical thermometers, and disposable gloves to advanced devices such as medical robots, cardiac pacemakers, and neuroprosthetics.|$|R
50|$|The sticks are woven {{together}} to form a reticulated grid with each stick held in place by a bending moment created by the elasticity of wood or other material. If constructed properly, the removal of a single stick causes the other sticks to fly apart with surprising force. The speed of the shock wave depends on the materials used. If craft sticks are used, the propagation speed is approximately 30-40 meters per second (67-90 miles per hour); for <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors,</b> the speed is under 10 meters per second (22 miles per hour). Stick bombs, especially those made from craft sticks, can spontaneously explode from a weak stick or from warping.|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis is {{confirmed}} by direct inspection using laryngoscopy, although this may provoke airway spasm. If epiglottitis is suspected, attempts to visualise the epiglottis using a <b>tongue</b> <b>depressor</b> are strongly discouraged for this reason; therefore, diagnosis is made on basis of direct fibreoptic laryngoscopy carried out in controlled environment like an operating room. Imaging is rarely useful, and treatment should not be delayed for this test to be carried out.|$|E
50|$|The person {{receiving}} the throat culture {{is asked to}} tilt his or {{her head back and}} open his or her mouth. The health professional (usually a physician) will press the tongue down with a <b>tongue</b> <b>depressor</b> and examine the mouth and throat. A clean swab will be rubbed {{over the back of the}} throat, around the tonsils, and over any red areas or sores to collect a sample.|$|E
50|$|Stick bombs can be {{constructed}} out of most flat sticks of the appropriate dimensions. The usual material for construction is wood, but plastic can also be used. Ice pop sticks (craft sticks) and tongue depressors are popular because of availability, low cost, {{and because they are}} easily coloured. <b>Tongue</b> <b>depressor</b> sticks are strongly recommended for construction as they have lower tension than craft sticks and thus are easier to work with.|$|E
50|$|Therapy often {{occurs in}} small groups {{of three or four}} {{students}} with similar needs. Meeting either {{in the office of the}} speech-language pathologist or in the classroom, sessions may take from 30 minutes to one hour. They may occur several times per week. After introductory conversations, the session is focused on a particular therapeutic activity, such as coordination and strengthening exercises of speech muscles or improving fluency through breathing techniques. These activities may take the form of games, songs, skits, and other activities that deliver the needed therapy. Aids, such as mirrors, tape recorders, and <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors</b> may be utilized to help the children to become aware of their speech sounds and to work toward more natural speech production.|$|R
5000|$|Simple stick bombs {{made out}} of four, five, or six sticks {{have been known to}} {{schoolchildren}} for ages. They were often known as [...] "Chinese stick puzzles", which indicates a possible origin for the devices. Tarnai (1989) describes several designs, including those with indefinite size which he credits to Ruina. Ruina claims to have invented the [...] "infinite popsicle-stick bomb" [...] in 1971. In the early 1980s, Tim Fort, known professionally as the Kinetic King, independently invented the multi-celled stick bomb. He also invented all of the stick-bomb weaves currently used including the ortho weave, the diamond weave, and the slant weave; using <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors</b> instead of Popsicle sticks is also credited as one of his innovations. In early 2011 he debuted the cobra weave, the most popular weave, during the Minneapolis audition episode [...] "America's Got Talent". Recently, Tim Fort has developed methods for making three-dimensional stick bombs as well.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{resource}} guide composed of five educational interactive bulletin boards. Each bulletin board had several criteria {{in which to}} follow. The most important requirement was the ability for the bulletin board to be interactive. An interactive bulletin board {{is one in which}} students are given the opportunity to manipulate and move parts of the bulletin board in order to use it and ultimately to learn from it. Each bulletin board had to be original, flexible in grade range and subject, composed with everyday items, and motivational to the students. Through use of Velcro, milky pens, <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors,</b> baggies, plastic table clothes, and many other items, each bulletin board can become a learning tool, which students can manipulate. This guide does not contain the actual pieces and parts of the bulletin boards; rather computer-generated examples which future teachers can use to create bulletin boards to fit their classroom environments.

5000|$|A spatula is [...] "a broad, flat, {{flexible}} blade used to mix, spread and lift material" [...] including foods, drugs, plaster and paints. It {{derives from the}} Latin word for a flat piece of wood or splint (a diminutive form of the Latin spatha, meaning broadsword), and hence can also refer to a <b>tongue</b> <b>depressor.</b> The words spade (digging tool) and spathe are similarly derived.

50|$|According to Horton et al., {{diagnosis}} of ankyloglossia may be difficult; {{it is not}} always apparent by looking at the underside of the tongue, but is often dependent on the range of movement permitted by the genioglossus muscles. For infants, passively elevating the tongue tip with a <b>tongue</b> <b>depressor</b> may reveal the problem. For older children, making the tongue move to its maximum range will demonstrate the tongue tip restriction. In addition, palpation of genioglossus {{on the underside of the}} tongue will aid in confirming the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Epoxy resins and hardeners are universally used in boat {{building}} due {{to their}} superior holding power and ease of use. In its thickened state it {{is used as a}} strong filler and for a range of joints that do away with more traditional fastenings. A large supply of cheap wooden <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors</b> is useful for mixing and applying epoxy resin. The curved ends are useful for shaping coved joints with epoxy. Silicon bronze ring nails are excellent for permanent fastening of wood and ply as they are strong and easily driven. Many small boats are almost entirely fastened by epoxy resin. In stitch and glue construction the hull panels are temporarily held together with either copper wire, nylon fishing line or plastic cable ties, until the epoxy cures, after which the stitching material is removed. Polyester filler is a quick setting (20mts), softer filler, suited to very small holes and scratches and is far more easily sanded to a fair shape than harder, stronger epoxy filler which takes 24 hours to set hard.|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{globalization}} has multiple definitions: Medical tourism, telemedicine, worldwide clinical trials, brain drain, and regulatory harmonization. Each of these {{plays a role}} in the goal of consistent country-by-country access to the latest pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical care. Medical devices, from <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors</b> to MRI machines, are used to aid in making therapeutic decisions, diagnosis, treatment and drug monitoring for various medical conditions. Regulatory oversight of the initial approval through to post-marketing surveillance is unique to different regions of the world resulting in redundancy of costs, clinical investment, and long delays. For approximately 25 years, global efforts via the global harmonization task force been developed to synchronize medical device regulatory frameworks unique to each country. Through literature reviews as well as industry interviews, this paper presents present the components and challenges of global medical device harmonization, looking at progress, challenges, and future opportunities, specifically using the Japanese market as a case study.

40|$|Abstract- In this study, methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), a hydrolyzable, multi-functional alkoxysilane polymer, and Q 9 - 1315, a MTMS alkoxysilane polymer diluted with methanol, {{were used}} in {{conjunction}} with acetone dehydration to conserve waterlogged wood. Three groups of wood were used for study. Waterlogged <b>tongue</b> <b>depressors</b> (Group 1 samples) were treated using acetone dehydration followed by immersion in MTMS. After preservation using the acetone / MTMS displacement method, images obtained using Environmental Scanning Electron. Magnified images of the treated wood were compared to similar images of non-waterlogged samples of the same wood samples, providing data on the ability of the polymer to preserve the micro-structure of the wood. A waterlogged plank from a 17 th-century architectural feature was divided into four sections to form Group 2 samples. Two sections of this plank were preserved using MTMS and Q 9 - 1315. The remaining pieces of wood were used to calculate the water content of the wood. Group 3 samples consisted of 18 waterlogged treenails extracted from the frames of La Salle's vessel, La Belle, which sank off the coast of Texas in 1686. Eight of the Group 3 wood was preserved using MTMS immersion after dehydration i...|$|R
