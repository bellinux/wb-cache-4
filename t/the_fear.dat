5|$|The team {{decides to}} try a {{different}} location on the planet, {{in the hope of}} moving away from the sentience they believe to be in the forest. They find that <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> emanations can be felt at their new camp as well, which is in a grassland, which makes them realize that the sentience extends over all of the vegetation on the planet. Osden also realizes that this sentience has never been in contact with anything alien before; thus it experienced fear when the explorers landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land {{in the middle of a}} forest, where a surge in <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> completely makes the planet understand that they mean it no harm; and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> emanations cease. The group tries to locate Osden, but is unable to find him; Tomiko suspects that he does not want to be found. They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey.|$|E

5|$|During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges {{were trained}} in the Roman army, officially as an honor, but in reality serving as a hostage, because the kings held {{absolute}} power over the Iazyges.

5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Rooster Teeth Productions created P.A.N.I.C.S. or PANICS, {{an acronym}} for People Acting Normal In Crazy-Ass Situations, is a comic science fiction series based on F.E.A.R.

The series was produced {{at the request of}} Monolith Productions {{as a part of a}} tie-in with the Director's Edition of <b>the</b> <b>F.E.A.R.,</b> which the Rooster Teeth team used to produce the series. The mini-series consists of five episodes.

40|$|We {{predicted}} that an expectancy of acquiring a feared fat self and an expectancy of acquiring a hoped-for thin self both mediate {{the impact of}} body size on women's body esteem. We also {{predicted that}} the mediating pathway through <b>the</b> <b>feared</b> fat self would be stronger than that through the hoped-for thin self. A community sample of 251 women reported their age, height, weight, and completed measures of body esteem and expectancy perceptions of acquiring <b>the</b> <b>feared</b> fat and hoped-for thin selves. Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) demonstrated that expectancies about <b>the</b> <b>feared</b> fat self and about the hoped-for thin self mediated the relationship between body size and body esteem. Bayesian SEM also revealed that the pathway through <b>the</b> <b>feared</b> fat self was stronger than that through the hoped-for thin self.
