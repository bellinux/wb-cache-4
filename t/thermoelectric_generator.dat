5|$|NASA {{has made}} use of {{technologies}} such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope <b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>Generator</b> (MMRTG), which {{is a type of}} Radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> used on space missions. Shortages of this material have curtailed deep space missions {{since the turn of the}} millennia. An example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was New Horizons 2.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> {{could be}} used in power plants in order to convert waste heat into {{additional}} electrical power and in automobiles as automotive <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> (ATGs) to increase fuel efficiency. Another application is radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> which are used in space probes, which has the same mechanism but use radioisotopes to generate the required heat difference.|$|R

25|$|NASA is {{developing}} a Multi-Mission Radioisotope <b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>Generator</b> in which the thermocouples would be made of skutterudite, which can function with a smaller temperature difference than the current tellurium designs.

NASA hopes to use the design on the next New Frontiers mission.|$|E
5000|$|The Seebeck {{effect is}} used in <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generators,</b> which {{function}} like heat engines, but are less bulky, have no moving parts, and are typically more expensive and less efficient. They have a use in power plants for converting waste heat into additional electrical power (a form of energy recycling) and in automobiles as automotive <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> (ATGs) for increasing fuel efficiency.

Waste heat represents a radical obstruction countering efficiency improvements of almost all types of energy conversion systems. The employment of <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> in waste heat recovery applications was motivated by the advances in thermoelectric materials and manufacturing. This paper sheds the light {{on the state of the}} art of <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> for different waste heat recovery applications.

As a point of departure, the team took inspiration from the Ulysses spacecraft, which also carried a radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> (RTG) and dish on a box-in-box structure through the outer Solar System. Many subsystems and components have flight heritage from APL's CONTOUR spacecraft, which in turn had heritage from APL's TIMED spacecraft.|$|E

Intended to power the mission's ALSEP, the RTG survived re-entry (as designed) and landed in the Tonga Trench. While it will remain radioactive for several thousand years, {{it does not appear}} to be releasing any of its 3.9kg of radioactive plutonium-238.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of atomic batteries: thermal and non-thermal. The non-thermal atomic batteries, which have many different designs, exploit charged alpha and beta particles. These designs include the direct charging generators, betavoltaics, the optoelectric nuclear battery, and the radioisotope piezoelectric generator. The thermal atomic batteries on the other hand, convert {{the heat from the}} radioactive decay to electricity. These designs include thermionic converter, thermophotovoltaic cells, alkali-metal thermal to electric converter, and the most common design, the radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> have {{a variety}} of {{applications}}. Frequently, <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> are used for low power remote applications or where bulkier but more efficient heat engines such as Stirling engines would not be possible. Unlike heat engines, the solid state electrical components typically used to perform thermal to electric energy conversion have no moving parts. The thermal to electric energy conversion can be performed using components that require no maintenance, have inherently high reliability, and can be used to construct generators with long service-free lifetimes. This makes <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> well suited for equipment with low to modest power needs in remote uninhabited or inaccessible locations such as mountaintops, the vacuum of space, or the deep ocean.|$|R
25|$|Thermocouples can be {{connected}} in series {{to form a}} thermopile, where all the hot junctions are exposed to a higher temperature and all the cold junctions to a lower temperature.

25|$|To {{study the}} Sun at all latitudes the probe {{needed to change}} its orbital {{inclination}} and leave {{the plane of the}} Solar System – to change the orbital inclination of a spacecraft a large change in heliocentric velocity is needed. However the necessary amount of velocity change to achieve a high inclination orbit of about 80° far exceeded the capabilities of any launch vehicle. Therefore, to reach the desired orbit around the Sun a gravity assist manoeuvre around Jupiter was chosen, but this Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells – the probe instead was powered by a radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> (RTG).|$|E

25|$|The {{alternative}} to solar panels was a Multi-Mission Radioisotope <b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>Generator,</b> fueled with plutonium-238.

On October 3, 2014, {{it was announced that}} solar panels were chosen to power Europa Clipper. The mission's designers determined that, despite the fact that solar power is only 4% as intense at Jupiter as it is in Earth's orbit, solar was both cheaper than plutonium and practical to use on the spacecraft. Despite the increased weight of solar panels compared to plutonium-powered generators, the vehicle's mass had been projected to still be within acceptable launch limits.|$|E
500|$|The process {{used by the}} {{character}} Watney to produce water was accurate and is being used by NASA for a planned Martian rover.
