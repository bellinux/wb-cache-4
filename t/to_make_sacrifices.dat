5|$|During the Song Dynasty, Beiyue Temple {{was used}} as an {{alternate}} site <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> to the Northern Peak, Mount Heng, one of the sacred mountains of Daoism. During this time, Mount Heng was controlled by the Liao Dynasty (916-1125). In order to maintain political legitimacy and receive Daoist support, Beiyue Temple was chosen by the Song Emperor as the location <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> to Hengshan. Even though the mountain was not controlled by the Song, they believed that a 'geomantic vein' that would direct their sacrifices could be cut through enemy-controlled territory and reach it.|$|E

During the various events, a temple becomes covered in flames and idols to the pagan gods appear once again. This {{is followed by}} the Aztecs telling the Welsh to leave before attacking them. A battle takes place in the water surrounding the Aztec city on boats, and the superior Welsh ships are able to win. The Aztecs, unwilling to stop, turn to superstitious rituals and priests travel to a sacred mountain <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices.</b> However, a sudden lava eruption kills the priests. This causes the Aztecs to believe {{that they do not have}} the support of their gods and they cease their fighting. Admitting defeat, the Aztecs leave the area and head south for Mexico.|$|E
25|$|In short, {{identity}} fusion theory {{posits that}} fused people project feelings of relational ties {{they have with}} known group members onto unknown group members. The projection of relational ties explains why fused individuals are sometimes willing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> for members of large heterogeneous groups {{that most people would}} make only for small, tight-knit groups. Through the process of projection, they psychologically transform genetically unrelated individuals into kin.|$|E

25|$|Living {{within an}} {{autonomous}} shelter may also require that party <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> with lifestyle choices, personal behavior, and social expectations {{to name a}} few. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require some alterations upon the residents psychological behavior(s); while others may adjust easily, others may not. Others describe their experience as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually {{at the expense of}} reduced autonomy.|$|E
25|$|I {{would say}} that this problem of AIDS cannot be {{overcome}} merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, {{that is to say}} a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.|$|E

25|$|In 709, Zheng {{was made}} the {{minister}} of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, Libu Shangshu), and given the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto. He, along with Cui, {{was in charge of}} selecting officials, and both of them were said to be corrupt. Later in 709, after indictment by the censors Jin Heng (靳恆) and Li Shangyin and investigation by the censor Pei Cui (裴漼), Cui and Zheng were removed from their offices. Cui was initially supposed to demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Jiang Prefecture (江州, roughly modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi), while Zheng was to be exiled to Ji Prefecture (吉州, roughly modern Ji'an, Jiangxi). After intercession by Emperor Zhongzong's concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er, as well as Li Guo'er and Li Guo'er's new husband Wu Yanxiu (武延秀), Cui was instead made the prefect of Xiang Prefecture (襄州, roughly modern Xiangfan, Hubei), and Zheng was made the military advisor to the prefect of Jiang Prefecture. However, later in the year, when Emperor Zhongzong was set <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> to heaven and earth south of Chang'an, he recalled both Cui and Zheng to attend to him during the ceremony and apparently made deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, Libu Shilang).|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Atlas Society, Ross related that her approach to Eve was inspired by Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy. She said that Eve was [...] "always willing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices,</b> and there's always somebody willing, as Ayn Rand said, to take any sacrifices you {{might be willing to}} make." [...] She compared Eve to Catherine Halsey in Rand's 1943 novel, The Fountainhead, particularly around the middle of the novel, before Catherine [...] "was completely destroyed". Ross described Eve as [...] "a self-sacrificing animal", and emphasized that her character was distinct from her own self-identification as an individualist. Ross said that her portrayal of Eve was also influenced by Eve White, a character with dissociative identity disorder played by Joanne Woodward in the 1957 film The Three Faces of Eve. The actress researched books on sociopaths and psychopaths to help her approach Eve's desire to hide her past at any cost. During the filming process, she kept a diary to help her better understand how to approach future scenes. Ross also used the 2001 novel [...] to inform her interpretation of Eve's past. She expressed surprise that Eve's relationship with Julian was [...] "a real short courtship" [...] that turned the character from [...] "the innocent girl to the woman on the Studio 54 dance floor having sex". After adjusting her perception of Eve's past, Ross chose to play the character's descent into drugs and prostitution as [...] "more immediate, wild and impulsive" [...] and [...] "very untamed and unrestrained".|$|E
2500|$|In 645, after Emperor Taizong {{carried out}} a failed attempt to conquer Goguryeo, he regretted the {{campaign}} and stated, [...] "If Wei Zheng were still alive, {{he would not have}} allowed me to go on this campaign."

They later said they were visited three times by an {{apparition}} of an angel. They said the angel, who identified himself as the [...] "Angel of Peace" [...] and [...] "Angel of Portugal", taught them prayers, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices,</b> and to spend time in adoration of the Lord.|$|E

The exact reason for Atwan's sudden departure isn't publicly known, {{but according to}} himself, [...] "We had on-going and never-ending financial problems whose resolution, ultimately, required political compromises that I was not able <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> <b>Sacrificing</b> professional integrity, our independent editorial line and the space we allowed for free comment were red lines I could not cross." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry {{scowled at}} him from under the {{penthouse}} lid of his hat, and passed on in his walk, without answering a word. The thing {{had gone too far}} with him for affectation. He did not care <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifice</b> now <b>to</b> any of the world's graces. His inner mind was hostile to that attorney of Bucklersbury, and he could dare to show that it was so. After that, Mr. Stickatit made no further remark to him.|$|R
2500|$|Religious and non-religious {{traditions and}} {{ideologies}} (such as nationalism and patriotism) {{are in full}} view when a society is in crisis and public goods such as defense are most needed. Wartime leaders invoke their God's protection and claim that their society's most hallowed traditions are at stake. For example, according to President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address during the American Civil War, the Union was fighting so [...] "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". [...] Such voluntary, if exaggerated, exhortations complement forcible measures—taxation and conscription—to motivate people <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> for their cause.|$|E
2500|$|Beckett {{also wanted}} to explore themes about making hard choices. To {{think outside the box}} {{sometimes}} requires not only [...] "transgressive" [...] but extremely [...] "cruel" [...] behavior, he told Kirkus Reviews. The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number of unintended ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a reactionary response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of patriarchy) but in ways no one can anticipate. Beckett said much of {{the latter part of the}} novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and force people <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> they do not wish to make.|$|E
2500|$|As Japan {{embarked}} on full-scale war in China in 1937, it expanded Taiwan's industrial capacity to manufacture war material. By 1939, industrial production had exceeded agricultural production in Taiwan. At the same time, the [...] "kominka" [...] imperialization project was put {{under way to}} instill the [...] "Japanese Spirit" [...] in Taiwanese residents, and ensure the Taiwanese would remain loyal subjects of the Japanese Emperor ready <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> during [...] wartime. Measures including Japanese-language education, the option of adopting Japanese names, and the worship of Japanese religion were instituted. In 1943, 94% of the children received 6-year compulsory education. From 1937 to 1945, 126,750 Taiwanese joined and {{served in the military}} of the Japanese Empire, while a further 80,433 were conscripted between 1942 and 1945. Of the sum total, 30,304, or 15%, died in Japan's war in Asia.|$|E

2500|$|Geary {{soon began}} to fear for his {{personal}} safety after his private secretary, Dr. John Gihon, was assaulted by proslavery ruffians. Geary submitted his resignation to incoming President James Buchanan, expecting {{that he would be}} reappointed. Instead, Buchanan fired Geary on March 12, 1857, with an effective date of March 20. In his farewell message to the territory, Geary stated that he had not sought the office and [...] " [...] was by no means desirable." [...] He added, [...] "most of the troubles which lately agitated the territory, were occasioned by men who had no especial interest in its welfare...

2500|$|Act utilitarianism {{not only}} {{requires}} everyone {{to do what}} they can to maximize utility, but to do so without any favouritism. Mill said, [...] "As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator." [...] Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. [...] "What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sacrifices</b> to help them." [...] As Shelly Kagan says, [...] "Given the parameters of the actual world, {{there is no question that}} …(maximally)… promoting the good would require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity…a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed." ...|$|E

Wu summoned senior members of Tang's Li imperial clan to Luoyang. The imperial princes worried that she planned to slaughter them and secure the throne for herself: thus, they plotted to resist her. Before a rebellion could be comprehensively planned out, however, Li Zhen and his son Li Chong, the Prince of Langye rose first, at their respective posts as prefects of Yu Prefecture (豫州, roughly modern Zhumadian, Henan) and Bo Prefecture (博州, roughly modern Liaocheng, Shandong). The other princes were not yet ready, however, and did not rise, and forces sent by Empress Dowager Wu and the local forces crushed Li Chong and Li Zhen's forces quickly. Empress Dowager Wu took this opportunity to arrest Emperor Gaozong's granduncles Li Yuanjia (李元嘉) the Prince of Han, Li Lingkui (李靈夔) the Prince of Lu, and Princess Changle, {{as well as many}} other members of the Li clan and she forced them to commit suicide. Even Princess Taiping's husband Xue Shao was implicated and starved to death. In the subsequent years, there continued to be many politically motivated massacres of officials and Li clan members.|$|E
