40|$|Abstract: To {{improve the}} deep {{coloring}} effect of PET fabrics, the alkali <b>treated</b> and black dyed PET fabrics were <b>treated</b> with 2 kinds of low refractive compounds such as acrylic resin and silicone resin. The color depth effect of <b>treated</b> PET fabrics was evaluated as lightness(L) change by UV-visible spectrophotometer. As the weight loss of PET fiber <b>treated</b> with alkali increased, the color depth of PET fabrics increased.

The optimum concentration of <b>treated</b> PET with deep coloring agent was 4 % o. w. s.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} early and late outcome of medical and {{surgical}} treatment in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis within a single unit. Design: All patients with proven prosthetic valve endocarditis <b>treated</b> in one institution between 1989 and 1999 were studied. Results: There were 66 patients (24 female, 42 male), mean (SD) age 57 (14) years. Of these, 28 were <b>treated</b> with antibiotics alone and 38 {{with a combination of}} antibiotics and surgery. The in-hospital mortality for the antibiotic group was 46 % and for the surgical group, 24 %. However, seven patients in the antibiotic group were considered too sick for curative treatment. The mortality in the remaining 21 medically <b>treated</b> patients (6 / 21; 29 %) was not significantly different from that in the surgically <b>treated</b> patients (p = 0. 15). Six patients in the medically <b>treated</b> group and one in the surgi-cally <b>treated</b> group required late reoperation. Endocarditis recurred in three patients in the medically <b>treated</b> group, two of whom were <b>treated</b> surgically, and in one patient in the surgically <b>treated</b> group. Kaplan–Meier survival at 10 years was 28 % in the medically <b>treated</b> group v 58 % in the surgically <b>treated</b> group (p = 0. 04).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate cellular apoptosis in prenatal glucocorticoid overexposure and a postnatal high fat diet in rats. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at gestational days 14 to 21 were administered saline (vehicle) or dexamethasone and weaned onto either a normal fat diet or a high fat diet for 180 days; in total four experimental groups were designated, i. e., vehicle <b>treated</b> group (VEH), dexamethasone <b>treated</b> group (DEX), vehicle <b>treated</b> plus high-fat diet (VHF), and dexamethasone <b>treated</b> plus high-fat diet (DHF). Chronic effects of prenatal liver programming were assessed at postnatal day 180. The apoptotic pathways involved proteins were analyzed by Western blotting for their expressions. Apoptosis and liver steatosis were also examined by histology. We found that liver steatosis and apoptosis were increased in the DHF, DEX, and VHF <b>treated</b> groups, and that the DHF <b>treated</b> group was increased at higher levels than the DEX and VHF <b>treated</b> groups. The expression of leptin was decreased more in the DHF <b>treated</b> group than in the DEX and VHF <b>treated</b> groups. Decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 α, phosphoinositide- 3 -kinase, manganese superoxide dismutase and increased malondialdehyde expression levels were seen in DHF <b>treated</b> group relative to the DEX <b>treated</b> group. The DHF <b>treated</b> group exhibited higher levels of oxidative stress, apoptosis and liver steatosis than the DEX <b>treated</b> group. These results indicate that the environment of high-fat diet plays an important role in the development of liver injury after prenatal stress...|$|R
