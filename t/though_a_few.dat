5|$|Some {{species of}} pterosaurs {{featured}} elaborate crests. The first and {{perhaps best known}} {{of these is the}} distinctive backward-pointing crest of some Pteranodon species, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pterosaurs, such as the tapejarids and Nyctosaurus, sported extremely large crests that often incorporated keratinous or other soft tissue extensions of the bony crest base.|$|E
5|$|The bulb lies dormant {{after the}} leaves and flower stem die back and has {{contractile}} roots that pull it down further into the soil. The flower stem and leaves form in the bulb, to emerge the following season. Most species are dormant from summer to late winter, flowering in the spring, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> species are autumn flowering.|$|E
5|$|The frescoes {{inside the}} church are {{commonly}} dated to the 14th–15th century, though they follow a standard compositional model which had been established in Bulgarian church decoration since the 13th century. Unusually, most of the captions which accompany the images are in Byzantine Greek, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> are in Old Church Slavonic. In terms of style, the murals {{have much in common}} with churches from the southwestern Bulgarian lands.|$|E

5|$|A {{bumblebee}} (also written bumble bee) is {{a member}} of the genus Bombus, part of Apidae, one of the bee families. This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> extinct related genera (e.g., Calyptapis) are known from fossils. Over 250 species of bumblebee are known. They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America where a few lowland tropical species have been identified. European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania. The brood parasitic or cuckoo bumblebees have sometimes been classified as a subgenus or genus, Psithyrus, but are now usually treated as members of Bombus.|$|E
5|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} solitary when not mating, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{are known to}} occur in high densities and with {{frequent}} interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into sand or mud. Octopuses are not territorial but generally remain in a home range; they may leave the area in search of food. They can use navigation skills {{to return to a}} den without having to retrace their outward route. They are not known to be migratory.|$|E

5|$|Space Race was {{the first}} arcade racing video game, {{as well as the}} first game with a goal of {{crossing}} the screen while avoiding obstacles, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> racing games had been released in 1972 for the Magnavox Odyssey home video game console. Later games in that genre are the arcade game Frogger and the Atari 2600 Freeway, both from 1981. A similarly-titled, expanded version of Space Race was published by ANALOG Software in 1981 for the Atari 8-bit family of computers as Race in Space.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} regrouped at Pyongtaek itself, {{mostly a}} mass of disorganized soldiers without leadership. Engineers with the battalion demolished a bridge north of the town before moving south. The remains of A Company then headed for Cheonan, regrouping there {{with the rest of}} the 1st and 3rd Battalions which had also withdrawn. <b>Though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> jeeps and trucks were found and commandeered, most of the retreat was carried out on foot. A few scattered artillery shells landed around the retreating force, but North Korean soldiers did not aggressively pursue them. By noon the disorganized remains of the 34th Infantry had outrun all enemy fire and were out of immediate danger.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Unleashed was mixed, with Metacritic aggregate {{scores of}} 60 and 54 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions respectively, and 66 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions. The added element of motion controls for the Werehog sections, {{as well as}} text-based hub worlds and better Werehog level design and camera system, were reasons cited for the higher review scores for the Wii version of the game, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> review websites, such as 1UP, gave the Wii version a lower score than its Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts. Nevertheless, the game was a commercial success and sold 2.45 million units combined making it Sega's third best selling game during their last fiscal year period of 2008.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, Miller {{died and}} was succeeded by Steve Rickard {{who ran the}} Dominion Wrestling Union for two years until {{starting}} All Star Pro-Wrestling in 1962. Fellow wrestler John da Silva also began a rival promotion, Central Wrestling Association, around this time but it eventually closed in the early 1970s. After Miller's death, regular appearances by American wrestlers declined considerably, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> still managed to arrive each year. In that time, a number of local stars were developed in New Zealand including Tony Garea, Peter Maivia, Al Hobman, and The Sheepherders. From {{other parts of the}} world came Australian wrestlers Ron Miller and Larry O'Day of World Championship Wrestling, Robert Bruce from Scotland, Canadians Gordon Nelson and George Gordienko, and André the Giant. South Pacific Wrestling, another small promotion started by referee Ernie Pinches, produced Johnny Garcia and Onno Boelee during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Orélie-Antoine {{felt that}} the {{indigenous}} peoples {{would be better served}} in negotiations with the surrounding powers by a European leader, and was accordingly elected by a group of Mapuche loncos (chieftains) to be their king. He made efforts to gain international recognition, and attempted to involve the French government in his project, but these efforts proved unsuccessful: the French consul concluded that Tounens was insane, and Araucania and Patagonia was never recognized by any country. The Chileans primarily ignored Orélie-Antoine and his kingdom, at least initially, and simply went on with the occupation of the Araucanía, a historical process which concluded in 1883 with Chile establishing control over the region. In the process, Orélie-Antoine was captured in 1862, and imprisoned in an insane asylum in Chile. After several fruitless attempts to return to his kingdom (thwarted by Chilean and Argentine authorities), Tounens died penniless in 1878 in Tourtoirac, France. The current pretender, Prince Antoine IV, lives in France. The previous pretender renounced his claims to the Patagonian throne, even <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Mapuches continue to recognise the Araucanian monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The M19 MGMC {{served in}} Europe in World War II with the U.S. Army. By {{the time the}} M19 arrived, the Luftwaffe had been driven from the skies by Allied air power, so the M19 found use as an assault gun, which was a role it {{performed}} very well. It was never delivered to other countries for Lend-Lease or the Military Aid Program (<b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> examples were transferred to the newly established JGSDF in 1954). It also served in the Korean War, for the same purpose as it was used in World War II. It {{was used in the}} defense against the North Korean forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting and later fighting in Korea. The 40mm guns were especially effective against Chinese mass infantry charges in North Korea.|$|E

5|$|The Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a {{new company}} of actors, though they were less {{experienced}} and talented than the old crew. The majority of old actors moved to the Little Theatre, Haymarket, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> remained loyal. Henry Fielding sided with the managers and produced several plays to aid the Theatre Royal, though this caused a backlash when the rebelling actors finally won the dispute. By the end of 1733, the rebellious actors managed to seize legal control of the theatre's property and Highmore, the sole manager of the Theatre Royal at the time, lost all legal abilities to stop them. By February 1734, he sold his shares to Charles Fleetwood who then made {{an agreement with the}} actors that secured their return.|$|E
5|$|The storm then {{crossed the}} Tennessee state line at 8:28p.m. EDT (0028 UTC), {{and moved into}} Hamilton County, Tennessee, {{striking}} {{the small town of}} Apison at high-end EF4 strength, where multiple large homes were leveled or swept away, 150 others were damaged, and thousands of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado then crossed into Bradley County at low-end EF4 strength, moving across the southern and eastern fringes of Cleveland and affecting mainly residential areas, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> businesses were damaged or destroyed as well. Subdivisions {{in the southern part of}} the city sustained major damage, with numerous houses destroyed and a few that were leveled. Four people were killed in Cleveland, and many others were injured. Several trees were felled in Polk County (as the tornado had weakened to EF1-strength), before the tornado crossed into McMinn County. The tornado re-strengthened to an EF2 and destroyed two houses and a mobile home before lifting south of Athens.|$|E
5|$|The {{strong winds}} left {{considerable}} tree and powerline damage. At {{the worst of}} the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000power subscribers were without electricity. Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001USD, $468,700 2008USD). The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships weathered the storm at Saint George Harbour, where the powerful winds ripped out a post and snapped a mooring line, leaving a ship drifting in the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking. In all, 87boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001USD, $809,600 2008USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001USD, $517,400 2008USD). Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4million (2001USD, $1.7million 2008USD). No fatalities were reported, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> storm-related injuries occurred.|$|E

5|$|<b>Though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> small factions {{broke with}} Smith's {{organization}} during his lifetime, he retained the allegiance {{of the vast}} majority of Latter Day Saints until his death in June 1844. Following Smith's death, the movement experienced a leadership crisis which led to a schism within the church. The largest group, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young, settling in what would become the Utah Territory. The second-largest faction, the RLDS Church, coalesced around Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith. Other would-be leaders included the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, Sidney Rigdon; the newly baptized James Strang from Wisconsin; and Alpheus Cutler, one of the Council of Fifty. Each of these men still retains a following as of 2014—however tiny it may be in some cases—and all of their organizations have experienced further schisms. Other claimants, such as Granville Hedrick, William Bickerton and Charles B. Thompson, later emerged to start still other factions, some of which have further subdivided.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{nearly two}} to three months, {{following}} which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, <b>though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was {{embedded within a}} large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures {{of no more than}} 77°F (25°C), the organization of the system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. <b>Though</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18hours about 80miles (125km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|E
