40|$|We present {{maps of the}} {{topographic}} roughness of {{the northern}} circumpolar area of Mercury at kilometer scales. The maps are derived from range profiles obtained by the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) instrument onboard the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission. As measures of roughness, we used the interquartile range of profile curvature at three baselines: 0. 7 kilometers, 2. 8 kilometers, and 11 kilometers. The maps provide a synoptic overview of variations of typical topographic textures. They show a dichotomy between the smooth northern plains and rougher, more heavily cratered <b>terrains.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the scale dependence of roughness indicates that the regolith on Mercury is thicker than on the Moon by approximately a factor of three. Roughness contrasts within northern volcanic plains of Mercury indicate a younger unit inside Goethe basin and inside another unnamed stealth basin.

The {{proposal}} {{to build the}} Gautrain rapid-rail link between Pretoria, Johannesburg and Johannesburg International Airport was approved in June 2000 by the Gauteng Provincial Government. It was noted that this particular development could have serious environmental implications for the area involved. The aim {{of this research is}} therefore to identify the most suitable terrain in order to optimise the rail route alignment with minimal environmental impact. This will be accomplished by undertaking a <b>terrain</b> suitability <b>analysis.</b> The different high-speed railway types are discussed and their impact on the environment is considered, culminating in an evaluation of the background and status of the proposed Gautrain rapid-rail link. The different approaches to terrain evaluation are discussed in order to draw conclusions relative to the methodology used in this research. Subsequently the activity approach as described by Mitchell (1991) and Hugo et al (1997) was chosen as the methodology to use for this research and the terrain within the study area was classified according to its suitability {{for the development of the}} Gautrain rapid-rail link. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was utilised to aid in the <b>terrain</b> suitability <b>analysis.</b> As a result of the analysis an optimised route is proposed and compared to the rail routes already proposed for the Gautrain rapid-rail link. It is imperative that a <b>terrain</b> suitability <b>analysis</b> should form part of the preliminary phase of any environmental management cycle as portrayed in Fuggle & Rabie (1998), in order to identify suitable terrain for the development in question; the rapid-rail link route should be no exception...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. - Lake Teletsk, {{situated}} at {{the northern end of}} the Central-Asian fold belt, in Altai, South Siberia, is a long, narrow and deep basin, surrounded by steep slopes which extend the basin up to 2800 meters. The lake is {{situated at}} the contact zone between two different geodynamic <b>terrains.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the brittle structures, using remote sensirig techniques together with field investigations, paleostress reconstructions and joint set analysis, revealed new indications on the tectonic nature of the Lake Teletsk graben. The collapse of the basin seems to be a very young process (less than 1 Ma). It appears that many of the recent structures evolved along pre-existing weakness zones, comprising a mylonitic shear zone and a suture zone. 40 Ar / 39 Ar step-wise heating results on two biotite and one amphibole separate from mylonitized gneisses belonging to the shear zone, yield concordant apparent plateau cooling ages of 380 ± 5 Ma, suggesting rapid cooling. This timing corresponds to the emplacement of the granite-gneiss domes. Another sample of a mylonitized gneiss belonging to the same unit, however distinctly enriched in amphibole blasts, yields a discordant amphibole age spectrum with an average apparent plateau age of 260 ± 7 Ma. This age is thought to reflect a ductile shear event associated to the Permian thrust and strike-slip faulting, formerly described for the Teletsk region. Brittle reactivation appears to be limited to narrow zones and remains so far undated. Paleostress reconstructions allowed to differentiate three different stress states in the Teletsk Lake area.
