5|$|The Confederate Navy {{originally}} had devised a plan where the James River Squadron would swarm Monitor {{with a party}} of men {{with the intention of}} capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilot house with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke holes. At one point Jones made such an attempt to board the vessel but she managed <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> around the stern of Virginia in time.|$|E
5|$|To his surprise, Wellesley {{found the}} entire {{combined}} army before him. Nevertheless, he resolved to attack at once, believing {{that if he}} waited for Stevenson, the Marathas would have the chance <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> and force the pursuit to drag on. Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself, and despite his numerical disadvantage, he was confident that the Maratha’s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops, and only Scindia’s regular infantry {{could be expected to}} stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|With {{the weather}} worsening, Lütjens {{attempted}} to detach Prinz Eugen at 16:40. The squall was not heavy {{enough to cover}} her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. Prinz Eugen was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. Bismarck turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing Suffolk to turn away at high speed. Prince of Wales fired twelve salvos at Bismarck, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted Prinz Eugen <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Madge and {{her family}} turns to {{celebrate}} Christmas, the Doctor attempts <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away,</b> but Madge catches him, and as she sees the TARDIS realises {{that he is the}} man in the space suit from three years before. She insists on his staying for Christmas dinner, but the Doctor reveals he has other friends who believe he is dead. Madge convinces him to go to see them. The Doctor offers Madge his help if she ever needs it again. Later, the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), two years since he left them there ("The God Complex"). They invite him to have Christmas dinner, as they had always set him a place at the dinner table. Unseen by them, the Doctor wipes away a tear of joy.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were {{positioned}} to block Hipper's chosen withdrawal route, while other forces were {{en route to}} complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group began {{to pass through the}} British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships; however, those were some 50km (31mi) ahead. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and escaped.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{political}} will needed to establish such a scheme seemed <b>to</b> be <b>slipping</b> <b>away,</b> and commitment atrophied in the UK as the minister requested more feasibility reports, until, in 1970, the government changed and the scheme effectively died.|$|R
60|$|More {{movement}} to and fro, more discussion; and the afternoon seemed <b>to</b> be <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> all the faster because the clouds had gathered, {{and changed the}} light on everything, and sent a chill through the spectators, hungry in mind and body.|$|R
5|$|Two gaps {{opened up}} in the Union line: the {{commander}} of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle; south of the copse of trees, the men of the 59th New York (Hall's brigade) inexplicably bolted for the rear. In the latter case, this left Captain Andrew Cowan and his 1st New York Independent Artillery Battery to face the oncoming infantry. Assisted personally by artillery chief Henry Hunt, Cowan ordered five guns to fire double canister simultaneously. The entire Confederate line to his front disappeared. The gap vacated by most of the 71st Pennsylvania, however, was more serious, leaving only a handful of the 71st, 268 men of the 69th Pennsylvania, and Cushing's two 3-inch rifled guns to receive the 2,500 to 3,000 men of Garnett's and Armistead's brigades as they began to cross the stone fence. The Irishmen of the 69th Pennsylvania resisted fiercely in a melee of rifle fire, bayonets, and fists. Webb, mortified that the 71st had retreated, attempted to bring the 72nd Pennsylvania (a Zouave regiment) forward, but for some reason they did not obey the order, so he had to bring other regiments in to help fill the gap. During the fight, Lt. Cushing was killed as he shouted to his men, three bullets striking him, the third in his mouth. The Confederates seized his two guns and turned them to face the Union troops, but they had no ammunition to fire. As more Union reinforcements arrived and charged into the breach, the defensive line became impregnable and the Confederates began <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> individually, with no senior officers remaining to call a formal retreat.|$|E

25|$|On the whole, the {{government}} adopted a gentle approach {{and attempted to}} 'win hearts and minds' by allowing {{the bulk of the}} defeated rebels <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> back to their homes and committing the first £20,000 of revenue from forfeited estates to the establishment of Presbyterian-run, Scots-speaking schools in the Highlands (the {{latest in a series of}} measures intended to promote Scots at the expense of Scottish Gaelic) and Presbyterianism at the expense of Episcopalianism and Roman Catholicism.|$|E

25|$|Both armies {{remained}} in their positions before Fredericksburg. Hooker planned {{to send his}} cavalry, under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman, deep into the Confederate rear to disrupt supply lines. While one corps remained to fix Lee's attention at Fredericksburg, the others were <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> and make a stealthy flanking march that would put the bulk of Hooker's army behind Lee, catching him in a vise. Lee, who had dispatched a corps of his army under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet to forage in southern Virginia, was outnumbered 57,000 to 97,000.|$|E

25|$|The FLN force {{took the}} low-lying Oued Boulbane, but was {{dominated}} from higher ground by the French paratroopers: 3rd, 4th and Support Companies {{from the north}} of it and 1st and 2nd Companies plus the Headquarters from the south. In a series of running battles over an area of some 30 square kilometres that lasted 48 hours, Commando 41 {{and at least two}} other katibas made several vigorous counterattacks which came to hand-to-hand fighting. Despite support from tactical aircraft, the paratroopers were too thinly stretched to maintain a tight cordon; around 200 FLN fighters managed <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> through the cracks.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{could have}} {{wiped out the}} 17th Division, but they did not. They wanted to take Rangoon fast, and the delays {{involved}} in a mopping up operation were unacceptable; so they disengaged and headed north in search of another crossing-point. Later on 22 February, survivors of the 17th Division swam and ferried themselves over the Sittang in broad daylight. After smaller actions at the Battle of Pegu and Taukkyan Roadblock, the Japanese went on to take Rangoon unopposed, on 9 March. Fortunately for the survivors of 17th Division, they had dismantled their roadblocks, so those Indians who had escaped Sittang Bridge were able <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> to the north.|$|E
25|$|During the Maryland Campaign of September 1862, Archer was {{suffering}} from an illness that forced him to direct his brigade from an ambulance, being too sick to ride his horse. His men made a forced march from Harpers Ferry and arrived in Sharpsburg on the left flank of the Union IX Corps. In a fierce assault, Archer drove back the enemy and recaptured a Confederate artillery battery. Three days later at the Battle of Shepherdstown, Archer and Brig. Gen. William Dorsey Pender led an attack that drove a Union pursuit force back across the Potomac River, enabling Lee's army <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> into Virginia. Despite his continued ill health, Archer's leadership contributed to victories at the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.|$|E

VIII) for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape) and Michel Zanche (a corrupt Vicar of Logodoro under King Enzo of Sardinia). He offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers {{into the hands of}} the demons, and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch. Alichino and Calcabrina start a brawl in mid-air and fall into the pitch themselves, and Barbariccia organizes a rescue party.

25|$|In 1513, Ferdinand II of Aragon {{issued a}} decree {{establishing}} the encomienda land settlement {{system that was}} to be incorporated throughout the Spanish Americas. Velázquez, who had become Governor of Cuba relocating from Baracoa to Santiago de Cuba, was given the task of apportioning both the land and the indigenous peoples to groups throughout the new colony. The scheme was not a success, however, as the natives either succumbed to diseases brought from Spain such as measles and smallpox, or simply refused to work, preferring <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> into the mountains. Desperate for labor to toil the new agricultural settlements, the Conquistadors sought slaves from surrounding islands and the continental mainland. However, these new arrivals followed the indigenous peoples by also dispersing into the wilderness or dying of disease.|$|E

Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Pea's story. Despite Sweet Pea's protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>away</b> unnoticed.|$|E

On 2 April the squadron captured the Guillaume Tell, with the vessels of the squadron sharing in the prize money. Similarly Bonne Citoyenne shared in the capture on 6 April of the French polacca Vengeance, which was going into La Valletta. Next, on 27 June, vessels of the squadron captured the French privateers Redoubtable and Entreprenant. Bonne Citoyenne was also among the vessels sharing in the proceeds from the capture of the French frigate Dianne on 25 August off Malta as she and Justice attempted to escape.
