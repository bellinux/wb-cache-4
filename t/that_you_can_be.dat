He also called on his Party to [...] "recognize in its platform <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> pro-choice and still be a good Republican." [...] Brown's campaign had been endorsed by many Massachusetts Democrats, many of whom were prominently featured in his campaign ads.|$|E
500|$|Duff {{explained}} of the album's title, [...] "I'm {{older and}} more mature now than I was when I made my last record, but I don't think I know it all. Having dignity is something you work on your whole life, in how you treat people and how you treat yourself. I hope I always strive to have it." [...] She continued, [...] "It's not something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> given or that you can just get or that you're born with. It's something {{that you have to}} work on." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Between {{the first}} of August and the fifteenth," [...] he answered, [...] "you cannot think. All <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do <b>is</b> to say, Yes, No; Yes, No." [...] And he left me to imagine his responsibilities.|$|R
500|$|... an Academy Award for his {{performance}} in Amadeus. Abraham was given the role without an audition. Abraham said of the franchise, [...] "I was around when the series was first introduced to television {{and it was a}} hoot", He praised his make-up and prosthetics, saying [...] "The idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> somebody else behind the mask is an extraordinary feelingit's very primitive and mysterious. A gap opens somewhere in the brain and it encourages wildness. It had me chewing at the scenery". He was particularly pleased to be working with Patrick Stewart.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E
2500|$|In a Newsnight {{debate with}} Staines, Michael White said: “You see a naive conspiratorial {{view of the}} {{political}} process and of politicians which says in effect they’re all crooks, and they all ought to be in jail, and we will fearlessly expose them on the blogsphere. And it isn’t like <b>that...</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> pretty cavalier with the facts sometimes. Much of the blog, for people who don’t know it, this week is devoted to whether or not Gordon Brown picked his nose in, was it the budget or some other recent event? That’s been your top item.” ...|$|E

[...] "I always {{wanted to live in}} New York City, so that was a dream come true!" [...] She added that [...] "New York has so much culture" [...] and she had been able to grow as a person and actor. [...] "It's good <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> given a script and learn 40 pages and feel comfortable with that. You get to know so much about the character that you don't question things, you just do it instantaneously," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardians Mikki Kendall wrote, [...] "In 'Flawless' (a {{track that}} leaked as 'Bow Down' over the summer), Beyonce quotes from author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TedX talk 'We {{should all be}} feminists', adroitly {{addressing}} {{the idea that she}} is somehow anti-feminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her. It's clear that like a lot of black American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of her {{as much as anything else}} in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world to know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|To the British {{newspaper}} The Guardian, Arena {{describes herself}} as somebody with [...] "certain points on the board" [...] - {{someone who has been}} [...] "tenacious, resilient, hung around for a long time" [...] and [...] "done everything in their power to hone their craft". It is from the place – as one of Australia's great musical dames – that she makes abrasive critiques of what constitutes a career in music today. [...] "I've struggled with the phantasmal aspect that {{has been a part of}} what we do" [...] she says. [...] "The fact that it has been really glamourised, glorified, also dumbed down as well. Thus, she argues that the music industry has been peddling shoddy wares, saying [...] "It's a business template they’ve used. They've told people <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a star and sold that dream to everybody. I think it's been a huge irresponsibility".|$|E

2500|$|While an {{undergraduate}} in {{college at the}} age of 22, the unmarried Ireland became pregnant with a daughter. After discussing the situation with her parents, she went to a special home for single mothers in Colorado where she gave birth. Ireland put the baby up for adoption, in what she called [...] "...one of the worst things that ever happened in my life" [...] and [...] "the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life." [...] She later joined an adoption registry and re-united with her then adult daughter in 1997. Ireland chose to speak out about the adoption as a Justice, saying [...] "I wanted to help reduce some of the shame around issues of adoption and let young people know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a birth parent and still go on and have a successful career and a successful life." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Payton {{became much}} less {{volatile}} {{in his later}} years, and many players, including Shaquille O'Neal and Antoine Walker, have greatly enjoyed playing with Payton. In Los Angeles, Boston, and Miami, he was recognized as a psychological leader and mentor {{for many of the}} younger players. Of his trash talking, Payton has stated [...] "I never take it too far...I just try to talk and get their mind off the game, and turn their attention on me", adding that [...] "sometimes I get accused of trash talking even though I'm not... immediately figure you're trash talking. But I could be talking to a guy about what's going on or asking about his family." [...] One of Payton's major beliefs is that [...] "mental toughness" [...] {{is as much a part}} of the game as on-court play. In addition, All-Star point guard Jason Kidd has referred to Payton as a [...] "mentor" [...] for the way he treated Kidd growing up in the same neighborhood of Oakland. [...] Payton has said that his own mental toughness was developed in his days learning to play basketball in Oakland: [...] "You learned <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> friends before the game and after the game. But once the game starts, it's all about business. No jive." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E

2500|$|Military law {{requires}} commanding officers {{and those in}} authority to demonstrate virtue, honor, patriotism, and subordination in all that they do. In the 1990s, the army officially adopted what {{have come to be}} known as [...] "The 7 Army Values", which are summarized with the acronym [...] "LDRSHIP". LDRSHIP stands for Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. While this acronym is relatively new, the ideas it represents have been at the heart of military service for generations. Similarly, the motto [...] "Duty, honor, country" [...] is the standard of the U.S. military. Military brats are raised in a culture that stresses LDRSHIP, Duty, Honor, and Country. Their strict (outward) adherence to military values is what separates most from their civilian peers. Children of military personnel often mirror the values, ideals, and attitudes of their parents more than children of civilians. Marine General Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a 2006 interview, [...] "There's no way, in my mind, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> successful in the military and have a family unless that family does, in fact, appreciate your service to the country." [...] Pace also wrote in an April 2006 letter honoring the Month of the Military Child: [...] "You [...] are American patriots and role models for us all." ...|$|E

That same year, Tom's Games listed Nina among the 50 {{greatest}} female characters in video game history, commenting that she proves <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{hot and cold}} {{at the same time}} and [...] "she has without a doubt one of the best bodies in the business, and she doesn't take crap from anyone," [...] while ScrewAttack ranked her seventh on the list of top ten [...] "boobies" [...] in games. In 2010, PLAY ranked her as second top [...] "hottest" [...] blonde in games, adding that she [...] "was sexy even back when her hair was made out of about eight polygons," [...] while Gadżetomania.pl ranked her as number one top [...] "sexiest and fierce" [...] blonde in games. In addition, she was included in GameDaily's top list of hottest blondes in video games, for having both [...] "a killer body" [...] and a killer instinct, also placing as the 30th [...] "hottest" [...] among all [...] "video game babes". In 2009, Maxim listed Nina among the top nine [...] "video game vixens", complimenting her costumes and her running around with a katana with very high heels in Death by Degrees as [...] "frightening and erotic at the same time—sort of like what we imagine having sex with Amy Winehouse might be like;" [...] she was also showcased on a similar list by Fakt. UGO.com ranked her number 17th on their 2011 list of top [...] "videogame hotties".
