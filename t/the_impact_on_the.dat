5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's decision to use Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> local flora and fauna, Churchill joked that the survey team had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the flora and fauna on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, who collected marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species of plants and animals. This included 20 new species of insects, six of plants, and a new species of legless lizard.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, a {{significant}} part of the world's production of cobalt blue (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. With the discovery of cobalt ore in New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again. When the Shaba conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production. <b>The</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, the pigment is highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials. In some cases, industry was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano basin {{supports}} a large range of plant life, including over 1,100 species of plant which grow {{on the river}} bank, in the river bed or more broadly. The basin also {{supports a}} large range of animal life both {{in and around the}} river. However, the development of the river has threatened the continuing existence of a number of different species. Across the country, thirty to fifty (or higher) percent of endangered species are from freshwater river systems and <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Shinano river system is also clear. Primarily this affects fish and amphibians due to their reliance on the river. The construction of weirs and dams to support agriculture and industry as well as the introduction of invasive species and pollution have been the main causes of ecosystem degradation. The Shinano basin provides a habitat for around twenty-five percent of Japan's fish species (around fifty-five of the 200 fish species living in Japan) including both endemic freshwater fish as well as diadromous fish.|$|E

There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E

As off-highway vehicle (OHV) use increases, so does <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environments where recreation takes place. By implementing Travel Management Plans (TMPs), federal land managers look to accommodate increased OHV recreation while reducing <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> landscape and wildlife. However, the effectiveness of these plans is largely reliant on public compliance and self-policing by recreationists - human decision-making then becomes a crucial factor in the success of TMPs. In order to create successful TMPs, more must be known about the elements that determine how OHV users recreate. This project seeks to assist in understanding how environmental attitudes and recreation histories differ between OHV users. By exploring how people become OHV users and how their use history influences their perception of the environment, I hope to assist public land managers in creating more effective TMPs. This will allow for continued use of ecosystem services while also reducing <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment and sensitive wildlife.

There are four stages of life cycle assessment: goal definition, inventory, impact assessment and improvement assessment.

Classification involves the classification and aggregation of the environmental loadings of the inventory stage into categories. These categories are then characterised by aggregation of <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of equivalency factors.
