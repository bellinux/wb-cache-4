He sought {{treatment from}} a local doctor instead of army medical staff because {{he was afraid that}} the illness would give his detractors a further excuse to undermine him. <b>This</b> <b>doctor</b> gave him a large supply of the drug Atabrine, which can produce depression as a side-effect if taken in high dosages. Already depressed by the official response to his Abyssinian command, and sick with malaria, Wingate attempted suicide by stabbing himself in the neck.

25|$|A {{representative}} from the Philippines consulate in Brisbane visited Solon on 18 July. In the meeting Solon {{said that she had}} been married to an Australian man, a Mr Young, but this information was not passed on to DIMIA. The consulate refused to issue Solon with travel documents, because they did not consider her fit enough to travel (she was in a wheelchair at the time), and so DIMIA arranged for a different doctor to visit her. <b>This</b> <b>doctor</b> declared her fit to fly, and signed the medical certificate allowing Solon to be deported. On 20 July Solon was escorted onto a plane by Queensland Police, and flown to Manila. Handed over to Qantas ground staff at the airport, she was eventually taken to a hospice run by the Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|On Vysotsky's death his {{associates}} and relatives put in much {{effort to prevent}} a post mortem being carried out. This despite the fairly unusual circumstances: he died aged 42 under heavy sedation with an improvised cocktail of sedatives and stimulants, including the toxic chloral hydrate, provided by his personal doctor who had been supplying him with narcotics the previous three years. <b>This</b> <b>doctor,</b> being the only one present at his side when death occurred, had {{a few days earlier}} been seen to display elementary negligence in treating the sedated Vysotsky. On the night of his death, Arkadii Vysotsky (his son) who tried to visit his father in his apartment, was rudely refused entry by Yanklovich, even though {{there was a lack of}} people able to care for him. Subsequently the Soviet police commenced a manslaughter investigation which was dropped due to absence of evidence taken at the time of death.|$|E

25|$|A {{further and}} most {{important}} appliance is the doctor, a thin sharp blade of steel that rests on the engraved roller and serves to scrape off every vestige of superfluous colour from its surface, leaving only that which rests in the engraving. On the perfect action of <b>this</b> <b>doctor</b> depends the entire success of printing, and as its sharpness and angle of inclination to the copper roller varies with the styles of work in hand it requires an expert to get it up (sharpen it) properly and considerable practical experience {{to know exactly what}} qualities it should possess in any given case.

The steel or cleaning doctor is pressed against the roller by means of weighted levers, but the lint doctor is usually just allowed to rest upon it by its own weight as its function is merely to intercept the nap which becomes detached from the cloth and would, if not cleaned from the roller, mix with the colour and give rise to defective work.|$|E

2500|$|Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times said, [...] "By {{trying so}} hard for authenticity, <b>this</b> <b>Doctor</b> Zhivago drains the story of much of its lyricism.... Mr. Lean's grander, glossier version was a closer match to the romantic spirit of the novel's hero.... The Davies version is engrossing but more for the {{harrowing}} scenes set {{in the civil war}} after the revolution than for the novel's legendary love triangle. Black-and-white archival photographs - Moscow slums, newspaper shots of soldiers marching off to World War I - are interspersed throughout the film and slowly bleed into a scene of the television show. The visual trick gives the series a quasi-documentary feel and is quite effective. Yet Mr. Davies takes the same liberties with Pasternak's text as the original film did, focusing on the love story and discarding a lot of the politics, secondary plots and literary sidetracks.... <b>This</b> <b>Doctor</b> Zhivago can be watched as a useful history lesson and as a cautionary show business tale: it is a lot easier to adapt a Jane Austen novel than it is to remake a film by David Lean." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 12, William Kunkle {{continued}} to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as [...] "a sham", arguing that {{the facts of the}} case hearkened to Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968; <b>this</b> <b>doctor</b> had diagnosed Gacy as an antisocial personality, capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of <b>this</b> <b>doctor</b> been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed. At the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to [...] "show justice". Kunkle then asked the jury to [...] "show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them there!" [...] before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom. After Kunkle had finished his testimony, the jury retired to consider their verdict.|$|E

2500|$|For Series 10, Capaldi {{described}} his character as more 'closed off' and 'suspicious' {{than the previous}} season, he elaborated 'If you’ve been following <b>this</b> <b>Doctor,</b> you’ve seen him go through all those different colours and all those different places, and as for where he goes now, I don’t know, but he’s been put through the mill.” Capaldi {{expressed in terms of}} his character 'Because in some ways he’s much more amenable, but in other ways he’s even darker. So I think that makes for a very interesting character.' Upon discussing the interaction between The Doctor and his latest companion Bill Potts, Capaldi elaborated “It’s a kind of teacher-pupil relationship, but it becomes more complex than that and I think ultimately the Doctor has to undergo some dramas by himself. So I think he becomes slightly worried that he’s swept someone else up into his adventures without quite preparing them.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{significant}} {{feature of}} this episode {{is the creation of}} another Doctor. Unlike the multiple Doctors of stories such as The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors and The Two Doctors, where his previous incarnations were played by actors or depicted in old footage, <b>this</b> <b>Doctor</b> is identical in appearance to the Tenth Doctor. In the accompanying Doctor Who Confidential for this episode, Davies explains [...] "This is so busy and so mental and so epic and universal in scale that of course you need two Doctors to solve it." [...] Phil Collinson, Graeme Harper, and David Tennant discuss the use of the double, a musician named Colum Regan who is a very good physical match for Tennant. Collinson explains that while with an unlimited budget they would use Tennant in every shot, [...] "we only have a certain number of effects shots where you can see the two Doctors together, so we have to pick those carefully." ...|$|E

In 1771 he changed masters and moved to Woodbridge, where he remained until 1775. While at Woodbridge he joined a small club of young men who met at an inn for evening discussions. Through his contacts at Woodbridge he met his future wife, Sarah Elmy. Crabbe called her [...] "Mira", later referring to her by this name {{in some of his}} poems. During this time he began [...] writing poetry. In 1772, a lady's magazine offered a prize for the best poem on the subject of hope, which Crabbe won. The same magazine printed other short pieces of Crabbe's throughout 1772. They were signed [...] "G. C., Woodbridge," [...] and included some of his lyrics addressed to Mira. Other known verses written while he was at Woodbridge show that he made experiments in stanza form modeled on the works of earlier English poets, but only showed some slight imitative skill.|$|E

2500|$|The Twelfth Doctor is, {{according}} to Capaldi, [...] "more alien than he's {{been in a}} while." [...] Whilst still defining himself as someone who [...] "saves people," [...] the Twelfth Doctor cares little about being seen as a hero or even being liked {{by the people who}} he is trying to save. Unlike his previous two incarnations who cared about humans and tried to understand them, Capaldi has confirmed that, this incarnation [...] "doesn't quite understand human beings or really care very much about their approval." [...] Clara is put on the back-foot by him post-regeneration initially not seeing through his 'Tough Exterior'. Playing Clara, Jenna Coleman says of <b>this</b> <b>Doctor,</b> [...] "He's more removed, you can't quite access him in the same way", in comparison to his more friendly and accessible predecessor. Initially it was reported that Capaldi specifically requested that the Doctor will not flirt with his companion the way his previous incarnation did, but the actor stated that he said no such thing and that it was inflated by the media. Steven Moffat has teased that Capaldi's Doctor may perhaps be more in love with Clara than he'd like to believe. He has also been described as a [...] "total adrenaline junkie" [...] and, {{according to}} Moffat, [...] "much fiercer, madder [...] less reliable".
