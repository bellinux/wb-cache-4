5|$|The Choiseul pigeon was not {{searched for}} again until briefly in 1927 {{and again in}} October 1929, when five veteran {{collectors}} belonging to the Whitney South Seas Expedition dedicated three months to searching for <b>the</b> <b>pigeon</b> in multiple locations across Choiseul without success. The indigenous people interviewed by this expedition largely believed that <b>the</b> <b>pigeon</b> was extinct in 1929. The last reported indigenous sighting was sometime in the early 1940s near Sasamungga by the Kolombangara River, although this sighting was never confirmed. Searches of the small, cat-free islands of Rob Roy Island and Wagina off Choiseul's southeast coast and Choiseul's forested coastal swampland in the 1960s by British ornithologist Shane A. Parker did not discover any signs of <b>the</b> <b>pigeon.</b> American scientist Jared Diamond searched for the bird in 1974 without success.|$|E

5000|$|Pigeons were {{considered}} {{an essential element}} of naval aviation communication when the first United States aircraft carrier [...] was commissioned on 20 March 1922; so the ship included a <b>pigeon</b> house on <b>the</b> stern. <b>The</b> <b>pigeons</b> were trained at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard while Langley was undergoing conversion. As long as <b>the</b> <b>pigeons</b> were released a few at a time for exercise, they returned to the ship; but when the whole flock was released while Langley was anchored off Tangier Island, <b>the</b> <b>pigeons</b> flew south and roosted in the cranes of the Norfolk shipyard. <b>The</b> <b>pigeons</b> never went to sea again.|$|R
5|$|Highway61 {{begins at}} the {{international}} border between Ontario and Minnesota at <b>the</b> <b>Pigeon</b> River; the road continues south to Duluth as State Highway61 on the American side. It passes the customs station and curves to the north. Passing its former routing along Highway593, the highway curves eastward to avoid mountains.|$|E
5|$|M-142 begins just a {{few miles}} south of Bay Port at an {{intersection}} with M-25 near the Bay Port Cemetery, about two-thirds of a mile (1.1km) inland from Saginaw Bay. From there, the road travels eastward through farm country on Pigeon Road. The highway follows a direct course over <b>the</b> <b>Pigeon</b> River to the village of Pigeon, when M-142 turns south on Main Street to exit town. South of town, <b>the</b> <b>Pigeon</b> Road name resumes, and after about , M-142 turns back eastward near the Grand Lawn Cemetery. The road then continues eastward through more farms to Elkton, diverting off a direct course to cross a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway {{on the east side of}} town.|$|E
5|$|Most birds scoop {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water run down the throat. Some species, {{especially}} of arid zones, belonging to <b>the</b> <b>pigeon,</b> finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. <b>The</b> <b>pigeon</b> family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Alectroenas blue <b>pigeons</b> {{are closely}} interrelated and occur widely {{throughout}} {{islands in the}} western Indian Ocean. They are allopatric and can therefore {{be regarded as a}} superspecies. There are three extant species; <b>the</b> Madagascar blue <b>pigeon,</b> <b>the</b> Comoros blue <b>pigeon,</b> and <b>the</b> Seychelles blue <b>pigeon.</b> <b>The</b> three Mascarene islands were home to a species each, which are all extinct; <b>the</b> Mauritius blue <b>pigeon,</b> <b>the</b> Rodrigues blue <b>pigeon,</b> and <b>the</b> Réunion blue <b>pigeon.</b> Compared to other <b>pigeons,</b> <b>the</b> blue <b>pigeons</b> are medium to large, stocky, have comparatively long wings and tails. They all have distinct mobile hackles on thehead and neck. The tibiotarsus is comparatively long and the tarsometatarsus short.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Trocaz <b>pigeon</b> was {{recognised}} as {{a different}} species {{from the other}} local form, the now-extinct Madeiran wood <b>pigeon,</b> <b>the</b> two local <b>pigeons</b> never interbred or habitually associated together. <b>The</b> Trocaz <b>pigeon</b> is a monotypic species, although in <b>the</b> past Bolle's <b>pigeon</b> was sometimes regarded as a subspecies of <b>the</b> Trocaz <b>pigeon.</b>|$|R
50|$|At Muur van Geraardsbergen, teams {{released}} {{one hundred}} homing pigeons {{and then were}} given an address where <b>the</b> <b>pigeons</b> were flying. Once there, teams were able to retrieve their next clue from one of <b>the</b> <b>pigeons.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{indigenous}} population believed that <b>the</b> <b>pigeon</b> became extinct due to predation by feral cats and, {{to a lesser}} extent, feral dogs. As Choiseul has no indigenous carnivorous mammals, the ground-dwelling pigeon was particularly susceptible to the introduced cats. If <b>the</b> <b>pigeon</b> existed on islands that feral cats had never reached, {{it is believed that}} the clearance of its forest habitat would have led to its local extinction. As there have been no substantiated reports since 1904 despite multiple searches, the IUCN has declared it extinct. As several ornithologists had visited Choiseul and the nearby islands prior to Meek without noting any sign of the bird's existence, {{it is likely that the}} Choiseul pigeon was already close to extinction in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Highway61 {{was added}} to the highway system on October6, 1937 {{following}} the amalgamation of the Department of Northern Development into the Department of Highways. Prior to that it was known as the Scott Highway.

5|$|In Islam, doves and <b>the</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{family in}} general are {{respected}} and favoured because they {{are believed to have}} assisted the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the cave of Thaw'r, in the great Hijra. A pair of pigeons had built a nest and laid eggs at once, and a spider had woven cobwebs, which {{in the darkness of the}} night made the fugitives believe that Muhammad could not be in that cave.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasitic}} louse Columbicola extinctus, {{believed to}} have become extinct with the extinction of <b>the</b> passenger <b>pigeon,</b> was recently rediscovered on <b>the</b> band-tailed <b>pigeon.</b> <b>The</b> band-tailed <b>pigeon</b> is <b>the</b> closest genetic relative of <b>the</b> passenger <b>pigeon</b> and has been investigated for being used in efforts to bring back that extinct species.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> crested <b>pigeon</b> (Ocyphaps lophotes) is a bird found widely {{throughout}} mainland Australia {{except for}} the far northern tropical areas. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Ocyphaps. There are only two Australian pigeon species that possess an erect crest, being <b>the</b> crested <b>pigeon</b> and <b>the</b> spinifex <b>pigeon.</b> <b>The</b> crested <b>pigeon</b> is <b>the</b> larger of the two species. <b>The</b> crested <b>pigeon</b> is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a topknot <b>pigeon,</b> however <b>the</b> topknot <b>pigeon,</b> or Lopholaimus antarcticus is a different species altogether, and has a red-brown crest that does not stand erect.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} Langley was {{provision}} for a carrier <b>pigeon</b> house on <b>the</b> stern between the 5 in/51 caliber guns. Pigeons {{had been carried}} aboard seaplanes for message transport since World War I, and were to be carried on aircraft operated from Langley. <b>The</b> <b>pigeons</b> were trained at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard while Langley was undergoing conversion. As long as <b>the</b> <b>pigeons</b> were released a few at a time for exercise, {{they returned to the}} ship; but when the whole flock was released while Langley was anchored off Tangier Island, <b>the</b> <b>pigeons</b> flew south and roosted in the cranes of the Norfolk shipyard. <b>The</b> <b>pigeons</b> never went to sea again and <b>the</b> former <b>pigeon</b> house became <b>the</b> executive officer's quarters; but the early plans for conversion of Lexington and Saratoga included a compartment for pigeons.|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{remaining}} listed structures are in the listed historic landscape of Lever Park, created for William Lever by Thomas Mawson in the early 20thcentury or the country park. They include an unfinished replica of Liverpool Castle, overlooking the Lower Rivington Reservoir, and Rivington Gardens, the remains of Lever's private gardens, which include <b>the</b> <b>Pigeon</b> Tower, a large folly and former dovecote.

5|$|Numerous other {{battles that}} {{occurred}} in the modern state of Indiana include the Siege of Fort Wayne, <b>the</b> <b>Pigeon</b> Roost Massacre and the Battle of the Mississinewa. Most of the Native Americans remained passive throughout the war, but there were many incidents between settlers and the tribes, leading to the deaths of hundreds in the territory. The Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1814, ended the War and relieved American settlers from their fears of the nearby British and their Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|The Choiseul pigeon (Microgoura meeki) is an {{extinct species}} of bird in <b>the</b> <b>pigeon</b> and dove family, Columbidae. It was endemic {{to the island}} of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands, {{although}} there are unsubstantiated reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands. The last confirmed sighting was in 1904. Other common names were Solomons crested pigeon, Solomon Islands crowned-pigeon and Kuvojo.|$|E

5|$|A {{topographic}} map {{shows that the}} majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Canada–US border. This border is composed of <b>the</b> <b>Pigeon</b> River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern border between the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake of the Woods and Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified {{the border between the}} United States and Canada using the old trading route running along <b>the</b> <b>Pigeon</b> River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border).|$|E
5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play every few minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing <b>the</b> <b>pigeon</b> population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E

5|$|In January 1904 six {{specimens}} and an egg {{were collected}} by Albert Stewart Meek, a bird collector for Lord Walter Rothschild, near Choiseul Bay on Choiseul. Several local boys told Meek that <b>the</b> <b>pigeon</b> was also present on the nearby islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita. Though Meek did not travel to these islands, he did search for the Choiseul pigeon on the adjacent Bougainville Island, but {{did not find any}} evidence of its presence. No other specimens were ever collected or seen by Western scientists.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{research}} conducted by the Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey, much more is known about <b>the</b> <b>pigeon</b> cameras developed {{at about the same}} time by the Swiss clockmaker Christian Adrian Michel (1912–1980) in Walde. He was assigned to the Swiss Army's carrier pigeons service in 1931, and in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's panoramic camera to 16mm film, and improving it with a mechanism to control the delay before the first exposure and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera, patented in 1937, weighed only , and may have been one of the first to have a timer operated by clockwork.|$|E

Before she can escape, though, Tigerstar comes and attacks the duo of animals, telling her to run. Scrambling up a tree, Sasha sees that the foxes have an advantage over him, and she jumps down to assist him. After defeating both foxes, Tigerstar stays in her den for the night and lets his wounds heal, and tells Sasha that he came to thank her for <b>the</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and that she is unlike any housecat he has ever known.|$|E
