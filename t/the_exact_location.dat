5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E

5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Étretat, Monet {{completed}} three paintings of fishing boats, one of a rural road, and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, The Magpie (W 133). Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, The Magpie is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes, the largest in its class. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of the snow scene depicted in The Magpie is unknown.

5|$|English Heritage, a {{government}} body {{in charge of}} conservation of historic sites, roughly locates the battlefield in an area 800 to 1600metres (0.5 to 1.0 mile) north {{of the town of}} Barnet. Over the centuries, much of the terrain has changed, and records of the town's boundaries and geography are not detailed enough for English Heritage or historians to conclude <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of the battle. Geographical features corresponding to contemporary descriptions allow approximations of where the fighting took place.|$|E

5|$|Henry's burial at Reading Abbey {{is marked}} by a local cross, but Reading Abbey was slowly {{demolished}} during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> is uncertain, but the most likely location of the tomb itself is now in a built-up area of central Reading, {{on the site of the}} former abbey choir. A plan to locate his remains was announced in March 2015, with support from English Heritage and Philippa Langley, who aided with the successful exhumation of Richard III.|$|E
5|$|Michael Francis Egan {{was born}} in Ireland on September 29, 1761. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of his birth is disputed. Early biographers {{believed}} Egan was possibly born in Galway; more recent scholarship suggests it was Limerick. He joined the Order of Friars Minor (commonly known as the Franciscans) and studied at the Old University of Leuven and Charles University in Prague. Egan received minor orders, subdiaconate, and diaconate at Mechelen, in modern-day Belgium. He was ordained a priest, probably in Prague, in 1785 or 1786. While studying on the continent, Egan became fluent in German.|$|E

He {{was the son of}} William Hargreaves Phillipps, originally of Northumberland, England, and his wife Cecil. After his father died, Phillipps' mother took him to live in Perth, Western Australia. Educated at Hale School, he studied to be an accountant and was practising on a pastoral property in the Kimberley when war broke out in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family deeply in debt, {{and his wife}} and daughters were unable to {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, and their children at the Common Burying Ground in Newport.|$|E
5|$|The Allies possessed little {{intelligence}} on western New Britain's terrain and <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of Japanese forces, so they flew extensive air photography sorties over the region, and small ground patrols were landed from PT boats. A team from Special Service Unit No. 1 reconnoitered Arawe {{on the night}} of 9/10December and concluded that there were few Japanese troops in the area. The Japanese detected this party near the village of Umtingalu and strengthened their defenses there.|$|E
5|$|The St. Edmund {{memorial}} coins were minted {{in great}} quantities {{by a group}} of more than 70 moneyers, many of whom appear to have originated from continental Europe: over 1800 specimens were found when the great Cuerdale Hoard was discovered in Lancashire in 1840. The memorial coins were widely used within the Danelaw. Coins have mainly been found in the east of England, but <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of any of the mints they came from is not known with certainty, although scholars have assumed that they were made in East Anglia.|$|E

50|$|Identifying <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> to {{look for}} cubies (mainly the quadruple centre cubie sets) is a major issue for big cubes.

5|$|The battle {{ended in}} victory for Dutthagamani's forces and {{considerably}} weakened Elara's army, ultimately leading to his defeat and death. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of Vijithapura is unknown, though historians {{have made some}} speculations on this. The battle is still regarded by Sri Lankans as a legendary event in the country's history, and has even been compared with victories of the Sri Lanka Army during the country's civil war.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of Fort Prudhomme is unknown. Some historians {{claim that}} Fort Prudhomme {{was built on}} the first Chickasaw Bluff, in modern-day Lauderdale County. The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture {{suggests}} that the fort was constructed on the second Chickasaw Bluff near modern-day Randolph. Other research mentions the third Chickasaw Bluff as the location of the fort, at the border of modern Tipton and Shelby Counties. Again other sources assume that the fourth Chickasaw Bluff in modern Shelby County at Memphis was the location of Fort Prudhomme.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> of the Vijithapura {{fortress}} is uncertain.
