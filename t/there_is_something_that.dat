25|$|Mental {{events have}} a certain {{subjective}} quality to them, whereas physical seem not to. So, for example, one may ask what a burned finger feels like, or what the blueness of the sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like. Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events qualia. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> it's like to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events. And the claim is that qualia cannot be reduced to anything physical.|$|E

25|$|When Sir Gervase Chevenix-Gore {{writes to}} Hercule Poirot to unceremoniously summon {{him down to}} the Chevenix-Gore ancestral pile, Poirot is {{initially}} reluctant to go. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> intrigues him and so he catches the train that Sir Gervase wanted him to. On arrival, it is clear that no-one was expecting him, and, {{for the first time in}} memory, Sir Gervase himself, who is always punctual, is missing. Poirot and guests go to his study and find him there dead, having apparently shot himself. Poirot is not convinced, however, and soon starts to prove that Sir Gervase was murdered because of various improbable factors surrounding the death, including the position at which the bullet is believed to have struck a mirror and the many different moods that Chevenix-Gore exhibited during the day.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is very seldom {{found in the}} art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked with a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E
500|$|Philosophers of mind {{call the}} {{subjective}} aspects of mental events [...] "qualia" [...] or [...] "raw feels". <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{it is like}} to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something, such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red, but still not know something fundamental about the situation – what {{it is like to}} see the color red.|$|E

[...] Well, one can only assume, Jennifer Lopez keeps making music because Jennifer Lopez actually loves making music. And that's admirable".|$|E
500|$|Philosophers who {{consider}} subjective experience {{the essence of}} consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known.

2500|$|Although it {{does not}} {{actually}} mention the word [...] "qualia", Thomas Nagel's paper [...] "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?" [...] is often cited in debates over qualia. Nagel argues that consciousness has an essentially subjective character, a what-it-is-like aspect. He states that [...] "an organism has conscious mental states {{if and only if}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{it is like to be}} that organism—something it is like for the organism." [...] Nagel also suggests that the subjective aspect of the mind may not ever be sufficiently accounted for by the objective methods of reductionistic science. He claims that [...] "if we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue about how this could be done." [...] Furthermore, he states that [...] "it seems unlikely that any physical theory of mind can be contemplated until more thought has been given to the general problem of subjective and objective." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked by}} Han Shizhong on what crime Yue had {{committed}}, Qin Hui replied, [...] "Though it isn't sure whether <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{he did to}} betray the dynasty, maybe there is." [...] The phrase [...] "perhaps there is" [...] or [...] "could be true" [...] ( [...] , often mistranslated from Ancient to Contemporary Chinese as [...] "you committed no crime") has entered the Chinese dictionary as an expression to refer to fabricated charges. Decades later, his grandson, Yue Ke (岳珂), had retrieved documentary evidence of his grandfather's achievements, and published an adulatory biography of him. [...] Emperor Xiaozong eventually posthumously [...] pardoned and rehabilitated Yue. For their part in Yue's death, iron statues of Qin Hui, Lady Wang, and two of Qin's subordinates, Moqi Xie (万俟卨) and Zhang Jun (張俊), were made to kneel before Yue Fei's tomb (located by the West Lake, Hangzhou). For centuries, these statues have been cursed, spat and urinated upon by people. The original castings in bronze were damaged, but later were replaced by images cast in iron, but these were similarly damaged. However now, in modern times, these statues are protected as historical relics.|$|E

2500|$|According to Carnap, {{many words}} of metaphysics do not fulfill these {{requirements}} and thus they are meaningless. As an example, Carnap considers the word 'principle'. This word has a definite meaning, if the sentence [...] "x {{is the principle}} of y" [...] {{is supposed to be}} equivalent to the sentence [...] "y exists by virtue of x" [...] or [...] "y arises out of x". The latter sentence is perfectly clear: y arises out of x when x is invariably followed by y, and the invariable association between x and y is empirically verifiable. But—says Carnap—metaphysicians are not satisfied with this interpretation of the meaning of 'principle'. They assert that no empirical relation between x and y can completely explain the meaning of [...] "x is the principle of y", because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> cannot be grasped by means of the experience, something for which no empirical criterion can be specified. It is the lacking of any empirical criterion—says Carnap—that deprives of meaning the word 'principle' when it occurs in metaphysics. Therefore, metaphysical pseudo-statements such as [...] "water is the principle of the world" [...] or [...] "the spirit is the principle of the world" [...] are void of meaning because a meaningless word occurs in them.|$|E
2500|$|However, Istrati's {{connection}} with the Crusade was not his only contact with right-wing radicalism: he had also promised to have his political testament printed in Gringoire, a newspaper of the French far-right. Against Talex's disclaimers, several later exegetes have reanimated the debate about Istrati's possible fascist leanings. Historian Jean-Michel Palmier includes Istrati's name {{on a list of}} [...] "intellectuals [...] saw for a moment in fascism the possibility of arousing a crisis-struck Europe from its lethargy." [...] He is in the company of Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis. Philologist Tudorel Urian asks: [...] "Who really is Istrati: the frantic socialist he was before his visit to the USSR [...] or the nationalist of his very last months, the emblem of a Guardist periodical? <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> those who judge him rarely take into account: in the periods when he flirted with socialism [...] and Guardism, both movements where in their romantic, idealistic stages. Once he {{came face to face with}} the brutal realities of the Soviet regime, Istrati broke with socialism and perhaps his famous motto, je ne marche pas [...] would have come into play in relation with the Guardists, should he have lived to see their earliest crimes." ...|$|E
