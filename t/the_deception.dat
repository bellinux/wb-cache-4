5|$|Ironside {{began on}} 23 May 1944 {{with the aim}} of having the threat {{established}} by 29 May and continued until 28 June (22 days after the Normandy landings). It was implemented via double agents, in Britain and the United States, {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee. The operation did not receive any resources from the Allied navies or airforce, so <b>the</b> <b>deception</b> had no physical element. This meant that Ironside had none of the traditional accompaniments to an invasion, including reconnaissance flights, bombardment, and naval operations. As a result, the Twenty Committee was cautious about using important agents to pass over <b>the</b> <b>deception.</b>|$|E

Eventually, Ric decided the pressure of covering up their misdoing was too great to bear, and after making up with Abra, departed once more for Africa on sabbatical.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was rearmed with light weapons and was {{converted}} into a blockship and was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the actual formation, a phantom 76th Infantry Division was formed for deception. The phantom division {{was part of the}} notional British Fourth Army, to be used for the fictitious Operation Trolleycar. This operation aimed to deceive the Germans into believing that an Allied landing would occur along the northern German coast. While <b>the</b> <b>deception</b> effort was not a complete success, it managed to divert German attention to the northern flank {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though the aims of <b>the</b> <b>deception</b> were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command {{did not come to}} expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>deception</b> plan mounted by the Egyptians, which {{included}} their intelligence services, relied on producing {{a series of}} events and incidents, militarily and politically, internationally and nationally, aimed at convincing Israeli intelligence analysts that the Arab world was not preparing for war.

5|$|After {{the first}} {{casualties}} on 1 February 1741 in Pati, Chinese insurgents spread through central Java, joining {{forces with the}} Javanese while staging sham battles to convince the Dutch that the Javanese were supporting them. As <b>the</b> <b>deception</b> became increasingly obvious and the Chinese drew closer to Semarang, Visscher became mentally unstable. After capturing Rembang, Tanjung, and Jepara, the joint Chinese and Javanese army besieged Semarang in June 1741. In response, Visscher issued an order to eliminate all Chinese in Java. Prince Cakraningrat IV of Madura offered his alliance, and worked from Madura westward, killing any Chinese he and his troops could find and quashing the rebellion in eastern Java.|$|E

The curse is lifted, causing Barbossa to die from Jack's gunshot; the rest of Barbossa's crew, realizing that they are no longer immortal, surrender and are arrested.|$|E
5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. <b>The</b> <b>deception</b> planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E

5|$|Montagu {{continued}} <b>the</b> <b>deception</b> {{to reinforce}} the existence of Major Martin, and included his details in the published list of British casualties which appeared in The Times on 4 June. By coincidence, also published that day were the names of two other officers who had died when their plane was lost at sea, and opposite the casualty listings was a report that the film star Leslie Howard had been shot down by the Luftwaffe and died in the Bay of Biscay; both stories gave credence to the Major Martin story.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Ulysses (in Greek, Odysseus) has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (c. 800â€“700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer's narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's Ulysses recalls Dante's Ulisse in his Inferno (c. 1320). In Dante's re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for {{his pursuit of}} knowledge beyond human bounds and for creating <b>the</b> <b>deception</b> of the Trojan horse.|$|E
5|$|The first {{offensive}} {{to have its}} own deception operation was in Zhukov's part of the attack on the Rzhev-Vyazma salient to the west of Moscow in July and August, 1942. The offensive was conducted by Ivan Konev's Kalinin Front on the north, and Zhukov's Western Front with 31st Army and 20th Army on the south. Zhukov decided to simulate a concentration of forces some 200km to the south near Yukhnov, in the sector of his 43rd, 49th and 50th Armies. He created two deception operation staffs in that sector, and allocated 4 deception (maskirovka) companies, 3 rifle companies, 122 vehicles, 9 tanks and other equipment including radios for <b>the</b> <b>deception.</b> These forces built 833 dummy tanks, guns, vehicles, field kitchens and fuel tanks, and used their real and dummy equipment to simulate the unloading of armies from a railhead at Myatlevo, and the concentration of armour and motorized infantry as if preparing to attack Yukhnov. The radios communicated false traffic between the simulated armies and Front headquarters. The real tanks and other vehicles made tracks like those of troop columns. When the Luftwaffe attacked, <b>the</b> <b>deception</b> units returned fire and lit bottles of fuel to simulate fires. <b>The</b> <b>deception</b> had the immediate effect of increasing Luftwaffe air strikes against the railhead and false concentration area, while the two railheads actually in use were not attacked, and the Wehrmacht moved three Panzer divisions and one motorized infantry division of XL Panzer Corps to the Yukhnov area. Meanwhile, the real troop concentration to the north was conducted at night and in thick forests. Zhukov's attack began on 4 August, and the 20th and 31st Armies advanced 40km in two days. The Russians claimed that surprise had been achieved; this is confirmed by the fact that German intelligence failed to notice Zhukov's concentration of 20th and 31st Armies on Rzhev. Other small offensives on the same front had poorly planned and executed deception measures, but these were largely unsuccessful. The successful deception for the attack on Rzhev showed that military deception could be effective, but that only certain Red Army commanders applied it correctly.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Copperhead is unclear. The visit was {{reported}} up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received {{requests for information}} about Montgomery's movements. There {{is no indication that}} Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this to the fact that <b>the</b> <b>deception</b> was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing {{that there would be no}} reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion.|$|E
