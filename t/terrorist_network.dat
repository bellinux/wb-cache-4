5|$|To help {{drive his}} points, Curtis uses {{interviews}} with various political and intellectual figures. In {{the first two}} parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former American Spectator writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of , comments in The Shadows in the Cave on the failure to expose a massive <b>terrorist</b> <b>network</b> in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} evolution {{and significance of}} female involvement in <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks.</b> An historical context and evolution of female involvement in <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> was presented and reviewed for emerging trends in the transition in type of female participation. Current examples of female involvement in <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks,</b> specifically homicide bombings, are quantified over a four-year period from 2000 to 2003, and then compared to prior periods. Analysis showed an increasing trend to use females as homicide bombers within <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks.</b> The significance of this trend was considered {{in relation to the}} educational levels of female homicide bombers. This research concluded that homicide bombings, in general, are becoming an increasingly common tactic used by <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks,</b> and that using females as homicide bombers has emerged as a coinciding phenomenon. Overall, this investigation directs avenues for future research regarding the significance of female participation in <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks,</b> both domestically and abroad, and how that might relate to female’s educational level...|$|R
40|$|Hidden {{terrorist}} {{cells in}} high dimensional communications <b>networks</b> arise when <b>terrorists</b> camouflage connectivity to appear randomly {{connected to the}} background network. We investigate hidden network detectability when the background network does not support terrorist activities. Using two September 11 <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> as the test bed and a network measure called assortativity, we suggest hidden <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> can behave as Peer-to-Peer networks. We compare the September 11 hidden networks with Peer-to-Peer <b>networks</b> containing embedded <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks,</b> {{as well as with}} generic Peer-to-Peer networks. Using Peer-to-Peer characteristics and social network group-based centralities, we show that for certain Peer-to-Peer networks it is possible to detect hidden <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> in cyberspace, with potential future application to Instant Messaging and Skype networks...|$|R

2500|$|Several {{months before}} the Smiths dissolved, Morrissey had enlisted Stephen Street as his {{personal}} producer and new songwriting partner, with whom he could begin his solo career. By September 1987, he had begun work on his first solo album, Viva Hate, at Wool Hall Studios near Bath; it was recorded with the musicians Vini Reilly and Andrew Paresi. Rather than featuring pre-existing images of celebrities, as the Smiths' album and single covers had done, Viva Hate featured a photograph of Morrissey taken by Anton Corbijn on its cover sleeve. In February 1988, EMI released the first single from this album, [...] "Suedehead", which reached number 5 on the British singles chart, a higher position than any Smiths' single had achieved. The second single from the album, [...] "Everyday Is Like Sunday", was released in June and reached number 9. The album reached number 1 on the UK album charts.

2500|$|When Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, who worshiped {{and taught}} Islamic studies at Dar Al-Hijrah, {{for which he}} also was a camp counselor, was charged by U.S. {{prosecutors}} with plotting with members of al-Qaeda to assassinate President George W. Bush, Abdul-Malik said in February 2005: [...] "Our whole community is under siege. They don't see this as a case of criminality. They see it as a civil rights case. As a frontal attack on their community." [...] He added: [...] "The feeling I get here on a daily basis must be {{what it was like to}} be a member of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church following the case of Rosa Parks. People always ask, 'What is the latest from the courthouse?'" [...] Abdul-Malik accused the government of singling out Abu Ali to stir anti-Muslim sentiment. Abu Ali was convicted in 2005 of providing material support to the al-Qaeda <b>terrorist</b> <b>network,</b> and conspiracy to assassinate President Bush, and is serving a life sentence. [...] When in April 2005 Ali al-Timimi of Fairfax, Virginia, an American-born Muslim cleric, was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the US just days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and of recruiting for the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the paintball terrorist cell, Abdul-Malik said: [...] "There is a view many Muslims have when they come to America that you could not be arrested for something you say.

2500|$|Historians {{have said}} that militant Islamism first gained ground among Kurds before its appeal grew among ethnic Turks and that the two most {{important}} radical Islamist organizsations have been an outgrowth of Kurdish Islamism rather than Turkish Islamism. The Turkish or Kurdish Hizbullah is a primarily Kurdish group {{has its roots in the}} predominantly Kurdish southeast of Turkey and among Kurds who migrated to the cities in Western Turkey. The members of the IBDA-C were predominantely Kurds, most members if not all are ethnic Kurds like its founder, as in the Hizbullah. The IBDA-C stressed its Kurdish roots, and is fighting Turkish secularism, and is also anti-Christian. The Hizbula reestablished in 2003 in southeastern Turkey and [...] "today its ideology might be more widespread thean ever among Kurds there". The influence of these groups confirms [...] "the continuing Kurdish domination of Turkish islamism". Notable Kurdish Islamists include also(an Iraqi Kurd born in Sudan) co-founder of the Islamist <b>terrorist</b> <b>network</b> al-Qaeda. There is a strong Kurdish element in Turkish radical Islamism. Kurdish and Turkish Islamists have also co-operated together, one example being the 2003 Istanbul bombings, and this co-operation has also been observed in Germany, as in the case of the Sauerland terror cell. Political scientist Guido Steinberg stated that many top leaders of Islamist organizations in Turkey fled to Germany in the 2000s, and that the Turkish Hizbullah has also [...] "left an imprint on Turkish Kurds in Germany". Also many Kurds from Iraq (there are about 50,000 to 80,000 Iraqi Kurds in Germany) financially supported Kurdish-Islamist groups like Ansar al Islam. [...] Many Islamists in Germany are ethnic Kurds (Iraqi and Turkish Kurds) or Turks. Before 2006, the German Islamist scene was dominated by Iraqi Kurds and Palestinians, but since 2006 Kurds and Turks from Turkey are dominant.|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for converting <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> from undirected graphs to simplified directed graphs (or digraphs), and mapping {{the flow of}} influence in them, is described. It {{is based on an}} “influence assumption”—that important persons with more links influence less important persons with fewer links. This methodology, which was previously used to analyze the structure of influence relationships in Communist-bloc countries and the international system, is illustrated by its application to two <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> constructed after 9 / 11. In the second more complex network, the hierarchy sheds light on the leadership and likely terrorist cells embedded in the network.

40|$|Based on a {{critical}} reflection of relevant literature, the review shows that both organized crime and <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> {{become more and}} more complex and the diversity of the forms organisations is increasing. Organized crime groups {{are becoming more and more}} flexible and divers. Globalisation and the internet have produced international networks, which rely on a broad portfolio of criminal activities that created experts and professionals within the networks. However, despite the globalisation of organized crime activities, ethnicity and kinship still plays a role both at a larger and a smaller scale, as research on local distribution or protection <b>networks</b> has shown. <b>Terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> are very much based on ideology and identity, with social marginalisation and institutional change as main drivers of engagement. Regarding the structures, research has shown that the form of organisation is changing from centralized organisations towards networks of cells that act more or less autonomously. This development is facilitated by the digital communication technologies, with <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> having their own experts for encryption and secure communication. Other and especially recent approaches emphasize the similarities between organized crime and <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks.</b> Although connections between the phenomena are recognized, critical scholars point out that there are fundamental variations and hence it is crucial to separate them analytically. Organized crime for example is aiming at the accumulation of wealth, whereas <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> are mainly focussing on political or ideological goals and are using criminal activities primarily to finance their structures and attacks. Organized crime and <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> represent a serious threat for the European Union as well as on a global level. However, as research has shown, over 90 per cent of terrorist attacks are taking place in non-European countries. Nevertheless, as a conclusion several policy and institutional obstacles for tackling organized crime and <b>terrorist</b> <b>networks</b> are apparent. First, there is a significant Lack of Cooperation between the EU-member states regarding the implementation of supra-national policies. Second, there is a Lack of Skilled Technical Staff, Expertise and Tools. Only few countries have the technologies and the experts for tackling cybercrime. Third, as recent terrorist attacks in Europe showed there is a Lack of Communication between national authorities, which interferes with the aim of tracking criminals or preventing attacks...|$|R
