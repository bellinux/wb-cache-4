25|$|In the {{alternative}} timeline of the Flashpoint event, Kal-El's rocket crashed directly into Metropolis, {{resulting in the}} deaths of over thirty-five thousand people, and the infant was subsequently taken into government captivity. Years later, young Kal-El is found to have been placed in a government facility of aliens to control his powers for uses to make supersoldiers. Sam Lane takes a liking to him, as he becomes the son Lane never had. Kal-El later makes friends with Krypto, who was also being held in the facility, but they are separated after Kal fails to appease the government workers. Kal-El is helped by Neil Sinclair to free himself, and attacks Sam. Kal-El makes his way to Lane's office, where he finds Lois Lane, Sam's young daughter. Sinclair attempts to kill Lois, but Kal, seeing her innocence, protects her. Sam uses a Phantom Zone gun to send himself and Sinclair into the Phantom Zone. Afterward, Kal-El is deemed Subject 1 and placed in a government underground bunker life sentence by General Nathaniel Adam. Sometime later, attempting to rally support in his attempt to restore the timeline to normal, the Flash, aided by Batman and Cyborg break into the facility where Kal-El is being kept, only to find a very thin man incapable of speech who seems terrified just at the sight of others. Once they break out into the daylight, Kal-El rises into the air. He uses his heat vision on the attacking guards and flies away. Kal-El arrives in Western Europe and rescues Lois from the Amazons who attempt to kill her. Just as the two reunite, Sinclair attacks them. While Sinclair fights some Amazons, Lois tells Kal-El that he must leave. He refuses and says that he learned from Sam that they must protect people from villains like Sinclair. Kal-El manages to overload Sinclair's body with energy, and punches him through the chest, killing him in a huge explosion; Lois is unfortunately caught in the blast. Kal-El holds the dying Lois in his arms, and Lois tells him to save the people. Kal-El arrives {{at the scene of the}} Atlantean/Amazon war and intends to attack both leaders Aquaman and Wonder Woman at the last battle. It is possible that Superman's <b>thin</b> <b>form</b> was caused by isolation from the sun, the source of his powers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{the effect}} of {{temperature}} of distilled water on the morphology of ZnO nanoporous <b>thin</b> films <b>formed</b> by anodizing was studied. ZnO nanoporous <b>thin</b> films were <b>formed</b> by anodizing of Zn plates at voltage 30 V in 500 ml distilled water of temperature ranged from 5 °C to 25 °C. As anodized zinc plates were characterized by using SEM and XRD. Characterization of as anodized Zn plates using SEM showed that the morphologies of the as anodized Zn plates were significantly influenced by the temperature of distilled water. Nanoporous ZnO <b>thin</b> films were <b>formed</b> when 15 °C to 25 °C were used while ZnO thin films without nanoporous structures were formed when 5 °C and 10 °C were used. XRD analysis indicated the ZnO <b>thin</b> films <b>formed</b> in distilled water of 5 °C to 25 °C were of hexagonal wurtzite structures...|$|R

I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, <b>thin</b> <b>form</b> curled up in the recesses of his armchair.

60|$|Suddenly she withdrew {{her eyes}} with a faint, {{conscious}} blush, and {{as she did so}} she saw {{for the first time the}} Sicilian. Her whole aspect swiftly changed. A terrified shudder swept across her features, and her lips parted with fear. She looked into a face but a moment before, at her first appearance, all aglow with passionate love, now black with suppressed anger and fierce jealousy. His eyes fascinated her, but it was the fascination of dread; and, indeed, his appearance was not pleasant to look upon. His <b>thin</b> <b>form</b> seemed dilated with nervous passion, and his eyes were on fire. Suddenly he conquered himself, and, with the swiftness of lightning across the water, the fierceness died out of his face, leaving it pale almost to ghastliness in the moonlight. He half rose from his seat, and, lifting his hat, bowed low.|$|E

Everything in the apartment indicated a man of opulence and of expense. Henbane Dwining, the apothecary, who seemed to have the care of the patient, stole with a crafty and catlike step from one corner of the room to another, busying himself with mixing medicines and preparing dressings. The sick man groaned once or twice, on which the leech, advancing to his bedside, asked whether these sounds were a token of the pain of his body or of the distress of his mind.|$|E
60|$|Jude was at {{that moment}} in a railway train that was drawing near to Alfredston, oddly swathed, pale as a monumental figure in alabaster, and much stared at by other passengers. An hour later his <b>thin</b> <b>form,</b> in the long great-coat and blanket he had come with, but without an umbrella, could have been seen walking along the five-mile road to Marygreen. On his face showed the {{determined}} purpose that alone sustained him, but to which has weakness afforded a sorry foundation. By the up-hill walk he was quite blown, but he pressed on; and at half-past three o'clock stood by the familiar well at Marygreen. The rain was keeping everybody indoors; Jude crossed the green to the church without observation, and found the building open. Here he stood, looking forth at the school, whence he could hear the usual sing-song tones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation's groan.|$|E

40|$|The {{territorial}} gardening limpet Scutellastra cochlear occurs {{along the}} south and southern west coasts of South Africa, while one of its primary food items, the encrusting coralline alga Spongites yendoi, extends much further north along the west coast. A combined analysis of geographic variation in limpet grazing frequency and a limpet-manipulation experiment was used to study {{the interaction between the}} limpet and its coralline food. The coralline comprised most (c. 85 %) of the limpet’s diet while fleshy algae from the limpet’s garden comprised c. 7 %. Grazing caused the thallus of the coralline to be thin and smooth; in the absence of herbivory, or under low grazing frequencies, the crust became thick and highly protuberant. Grazing weakened the coralline’s interference (overgrowth) competitive ability and also reduced its fecundity. In spite of these two apparently negative impacts, the intimate herbivore-coralline association between S. cochlear and S. yendoi showed characteristics of a facultative mutualism. Grazing by S. cochlear reduces the coralline’s thallus thickness and consequently increased its lateral margin extension rate. <b>Thinner</b> <b>forms</b> of the coralline grew 5 X faster than thicker forms. An increased lateral growth results in the <b>thinner</b> <b>form</b> of the coralline being very abundant on south and southern west coasts, occupying as much as 79 % of the substratum in the lower eulittoral zone. <b>Thinner</b> <b>forms</b> of S. yendoi were also less burrowed by boring organisms and more strongly attached than thicker forms of the coralline. Grazing by S. cochlear has thus conferred the advantages of faster lateral growth (i. e. success at exploitation competition) and stronger attachment. The coralline and fleshy algae from the limpet’s garden were equally high in organic content on a volume basis. This suggests that the crude food value per bite in the coralline and fleshy algae is comparable. This study has shown that incompletely overlapping distributions between strongly interacting species along a broad geographical gradient is not just a significant feature of the ecology of terrestrial, but also of marine ecosystems.
