This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.|$|E

5|$|No Depression is {{the first}} studio album by {{alternative}} country band Uncle Tupelo, released in June 1990. After its formation in the late 1980s, Uncle Tupelo recorded <b>the</b> <b>Not</b> Forever, Just for Now demo tape, which received a positive review by the College Media Journal in 1989. The review led to the band's signing with what would become Rockville Records later that year. The album was recorded with producers Sean Slade and Paul Q.

5|$|As the band's main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor was {{considered}} the only constant member and creative force within the group through much of its history. However, this changed in 2016 when Atticus Ross was introduced as a permanent member of Nine Inch Nails, alongside the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>Not</b> the Actual Events EP. Furthermore, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him onstage. These touring bands comprise a revolving lineup, and often rearrange songs to fit a live setting. Nine Inch Nails often employs thematic visual elements to accompany on stage performances as well, which frequently include elaborate light shows.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records {{began to}} pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been {{interested}} in them since hearing <b>the</b> <b>Not</b> Forever, Just for Now demo tape. At the urging of Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums, and specified a budget of $150,000 for their first.|$|E
5|$|In the new {{commercial}} climate glam metal bands like Europe, Ratt, White Lion and Cinderella broke up, Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991, and {{while many of}} these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s, they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s. Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands' commercial viability during the decade. In 1995 Van Halen released Balance, a multi-platinum seller {{that would be the}} band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Guns N' Roses' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade. Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band. Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident? Guitarist Slash left in 1996, followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997. Axl Rose, the only original member, worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete. Slash and McKagan eventually rejoined the band in 2016 and went on <b>the</b> <b>Not</b> in this Lifetime... Tour with them.|$|E

5|$|McDougal was {{released}} {{at the end}} of the trial and returned home. The following day she went to buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at <b>the</b> <b>not</b> proven verdict. She was taken to a police building in nearby Fountainbridge for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it, she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh's High Street. She tried to see Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life. On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much of the blame for the murders on Hare.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Slash reunited for <b>the</b> <b>Not</b> in This Lifetime... Tour, {{one of the}} most-anticipated reunion {{tours in}} rock history. Alongside Dizzy Reed and {{returning}} member Duff McKagan, who had previously made guest appearances with the band, they comprised two-thirds of the band's Use Your Illusion-era line-up, with Chinese Democracy-era members Richard Fortus and Frank Ferrer joining new member Melissa Reese {{to fill out the}} rest of the lineup. Rose shared a stage with Slash for the first time in nearly 23 years during the group's surprise performance at The Troubadour in April 2016, ahead of its headlining shows at Coachella. He additionally joined Australian hard rock band AC/DC to perform as lead singer for the remainder of the band's Rock or Bust World Tour, after long-time lead vocalist Brian Johnson had to stop touring due to hearing problems. Subsequent reports indicated that guitarist Angus Young will continue the band with Rose as its official lead singer.|$|E
5|$|The {{most troubling}} aspect of colonizing the patroonships was enlisting the {{required}} number of colonists, {{so that the}} failure {{of many of the}} other proposed patroonships may in part be attributed to this fact. The patroons still dealt with the issues of a cautious people not caring to venture to an undeveloped world. As an owner of extensive lands in the sandy Gooi and of family estates in <b>the</b> <b>not</b> much more fruitful Veluwe, where several relatives were landowners and struggled to subsist on meager means, Van Rensselaer had an advantage — his agents needed to employ little persuasion to induce some Gooiers and Veluwers to migrate to more fruitful regions where the farming would be less difficult. In addition, he could depend on the indirect support of his nephew Wouter van Twiller, who had been appointed Director of New Netherland in 1632, and with whom he engaged in friendly correspondence at a time when Dutch directors opposed the patroons in every way. In 1634 he collaborated with Michael Reyniersz Pauw, the patroon of Pavonia on shipping cattle.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{patterns}} of social relationships involving <b>the</b> <b>Notting</b> Hill Carnival. Two theoretical approaches are employed elementary relations theory and structural ritualization theory - {{to explain how}} the carnival has been strategically used in very different ways by various groups to accomplish their objectives. We suggest <b>the</b> <b>Notting</b> Hill Carnival is a special collective ritual event that has {{played a crucial role in}} three quite different structured arrangements involving coercion, conflict, and exchange since its beginning in Trinidad and subsequently in London. Four time periods where distinct changes in the nature of these relationships have occurred are examined: (1) 1800 s Trinidad; (2) <b>the</b> <b>Notting</b> Hill Carnival from 1965 - 1970; (3) <b>the</b> <b>Notting</b> Hill Carnival from 1971 - 1989; and (4) <b>the</b> <b>Notting</b> Hill Carnival from 1990 -present. This study contributes to the existing literature by focusing on how ritual and these types of relationships are intertwined in the production of the carnival. Implications of this research and possible directions for future research are also discussed...|$|R
5|$|There was {{speculation}} during September {{and early}} October 2007 about whether Brown {{would call a}} snap general election.

This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either.|$|E
