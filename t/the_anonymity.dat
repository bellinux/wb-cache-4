5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> {{adds to the}} erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|Song scholar-officials {{were granted}} ranks, honors, and career {{appointments}} {{on the basis}} of merit, the standards of which were codified and more objective than those in the Tang dynasty. <b>The</b> <b>anonymity</b> of exam candidates guarded against fraud and favoritism by those who could judge papers based upon handwriting and/or signature calligraphy; a bureau of copyists was tasked with the job of recopying all the candidates' papers before grading. After passing the prefectural, provincial, and then palace exam (the most prestigious), scholarly degrees did not immediately ensure an appointment to office, but the more prestigious the degree, the more certain one's career in higher administrative posts would be. The central government held the exclusive right to appoint or remove officials. The case for removal was always carefully examined, since the central government kept a recorded dossier of reports on each official, stored in the capital for later review.|$|E

5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Anonymity {{technologies}} have gained {{more and more}} attention for communication privacy. In general, users obtain anonymity at a certain cost in an anonymous communication system, which uses rerouting to increase the system’s robustness. However, a long rerouting path incurs large overhead and decreases the quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we propose <b>the</b> Scalar <b>Anonymity</b> System (SAS) {{in order to provide}} a tradeoff between anonymity and cost for different users with different requirements. In SAS, by selecting <b>the</b> level of <b>anonymity,</b> a user obtains <b>the</b> corresponding <b>anonymity</b> and QoS and also sustains the corresponding load of traffic rerouting for other users. Our theoretical analysis and simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of SAS. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Publishing {{social network}} data for {{research}} pur-poses has raised serious concerns for individual privacy. There exist many privacy-preserving works that {{can deal with}} different attack models. In this paper, we introduce a novel privacy attack model and refer it as a mutual friend attack. In this model, the adversary can re-identify a pair of friends by using their number of mutual friends. To address this issue, we propose a new anonymity concept, called k-NMF anonymity, i. e., k-anonymity {{on the number of}} mutual friends, which ensures that there exist at least k- 1 other friend pairs in the graph that share the same number of mutual friends. We devise algorithms to achieve <b>the</b> k-NMF <b>anonymity</b> while preserving <b>the</b> original vertex set {{in the sense that we}} allow the occasional addition but no deletion of vertices. Further we give an algorithm to ensure <b>the</b> k-degree <b>anonymity</b> in addition to <b>the</b> k-NMF <b>anonymity.</b> <b>The</b> experimental results on real-word datasets demonstrate that our approach can preserve the privacy and utility of social networks effectively against mutual friend attacks.

These techniques greatly reduce <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user. Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.|$|E
25|$|Lowy {{has been}} {{publicly}} defending cellphone photography since 2009, viewing {{it as an}} artistic choice, much like photographers who choose black and white film over color.

25|$|Tor {{can also}} provide {{anonymity}} to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called hidden services. Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), a hidden service is accessed through its onion address, usually via the Tor Browser. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding public keys and introduction points from a distributed hash table within the network. It can route data to and from hidden services, even those hosted behind firewalls or network address translators (NAT), while preserving <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> of both parties. Tor is necessary to access hidden services.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect that}} this concept had on church music was threefold: first, it bred a highly {{conservative}} attitude to musical composition; secondly, it stabilized the melodic tradition of certain hymns; and thirdly, it continued, for a time, <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> of the composer. For if a chant is of heavenly origin, then the acknowledgment received by man in transmitting it to posterity {{ought to be}} minimal. This is especially true when he deals with hymns that were {{known to have been}} first sung by angelic choirs—such as the Amen, Alleluia, Trisagion, Sanctus and Doxology. Consequently, until Palaeologan times, it was inconceivable for a composer to place his name beside a notated text in the manuscripts.|$|E
