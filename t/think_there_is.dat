25|$|The {{similarities}} {{have led}} people to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one species of white-tailed spider. It {{is possible that}} not all white-tailed species have been identified. The descriptor, white tail, is applied {{to a variety of}} species of spiders for which a distal white mark on their abdomen is a distinctive feature; other markings disappear with moultings but the white tail remains to adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Between {{historians and}} novelists, Joan has {{appeared}} in various texts as either an independent and spirited woman or a spoiled brat. In Lives of the Princesses of England by Mary Anne Everett Green, Joan is portrayed as a “giddy princess” and neglectful mother. Many have agreed to this characterization; however, some authors <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little {{evidence to support the}} assumption that Joan of Acre was a neglectful or uncaring mother.|$|E
25|$|I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any {{evidence}} {{that there have been}} any renditions carried out in the country of Syria. There is no evidence of that. And I think we have to take what the secretary Condoleezza Rice says at face value. It is something very important, it is done very carefully and she has said we do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E

As Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton explained in 1990, [...] "If {{you look back on}} the Sixties and <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more good than bad, you're probably a Democrat. If you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more harm than good, you're probably a Republican." ...|$|R

25|$|The story {{focuses on}} Private Brody and Sergeant Lucas. The {{regiment}} is {{approached by a}} group of Filipino men that claim to have heard gunfire nearby and <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an American or resistance fighter involved. Brody starts to wonder if anyone will cry for him if he dies. The regiment finds a dead resistance fighter and returns his body to the village to be buried. The story ends with Brody crying for the dead resistance fighter.|$|E
25|$|I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a growing}} distaste {{for the family}} duties among women … that should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Roman conquest in AD43, there was an oppidum in the {{southern}} part of their territory, probably in the Selsey region. A number of archaeologists now <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a strong possibility that the Roman invasion of Britain in AD43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of Richborough in Kent. According to this theory, the Romans were called to restore the refugee Verica, king of the Atrebates, who had been driven out by the Catuvellauni, a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire.|$|E

50|$|In an {{isolated}} kingdom, {{people do not}} travel abroad because the kingdom is surrounded by high mountains and because they <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> ferocious dragons beyond the mountains.

25|$|Berkeley's biographer, J. D. Davies, wrote after {{examining}} his letters that Berkeley {{appears as a}} 'lively, friendly young man, fully aware of his dependence on the patronage of others, supportive of and loving towards his family, and genuinely enthusiastic to make a success of his chosen career', quoting a letter from William to Charles Berkeley in June 1663: I must assure you I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no so beggarly a trade as this if people serve truly and honestly, as I am resolved I will do, although I am never worth six pence.

25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E

[...] Hunt also announced that the BOA would conduct a strategic review of funding and may support the channeling of more funds towards realistic medal hopes.|$|E

Tibbitt said [...] "it was a great idea I was just expecting maybe a 3D version of the painting but we got something totally different and it's very cool." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season, Hasselbaink's 18 {{goals in}} 36 appearances made him joint-winner (with Michael Owen and Dwight Yorke) of the Premier League Golden Boot as Leeds finished {{fourth in the}} league under the stewardship of new manager David O'Leary, thus winning the [...] "Whites" [...] {{a place in the}} UEFA Cup. However, he and his agent were dissatisfied with the contract offered by the club, and though he still had two years to run on his existing deal he was sold on. O'Leary claimed that [...] "What he is looking for I don't think any club in the country could afford and I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> anyone on that kind of money over here (in England)".|$|E

500|$|Questions {{about the}} {{accuracy}} of his work existed prior to his death, and Chatwin had admitted to [...] "counting up the lies" [...] in In Patagonia, though he stated there were not many. While researching Chatwin's life, Nicholas Shakespeare stated he found [...] "few cases of mere invention" [...] in In Patagonia. Mostly, these tended to be instances of embellishment, such as when Chatwin wrote of a nurse who loved the work of Osip Mandelstam - {{one of his favorite}} authors - when in fact she was a fan of Agatha Christie. When Michael Ignatieff asked Chatwin his opinion of what divided fact from fiction, he replied, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Van Hamel {{graduated}} from the school and was promoted straight into the National Ballet of Canada as a soloist in 1963. She has credited Celia Franca, the Artistic Director, as being an important influence and coach during her development as a ballet dancer. She was promoted {{to the rank of}} principal dancer in 1965. Early in her career, she struggled with her weight. In an interview with Rose Eichenbaum, Van Hamel said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a small window in your career when you have some control." [...] She explained she was [...] "about three pounds too heavy" [...] and used weight as [...] "a way of rebelling against all the forces that controlled my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles van Commenee's {{appointment}} {{as head coach}} of UK Athletics brought a change of approach towards Chambers as both the new coach and Niels De Vos welcomed him back to compete internationally. The pair judged that he had served his sentence – van Commenee was especially complimentary, stating: [...] "He is a likeable guy and a damned fine athlete". That month Chambers appeared at a [...] "Tackling Doping in Sport" [...] conference and told of the damage drugs had caused to his career, health, and finances. The Olympic ban remained in place, however, and London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe said: [...] "I am clear cut on the Chambers case – I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> room for drugs cheats in sport".|$|E

500|$|Seven men met {{to draft}} the {{invitation}} to the Protestant Dutch Stadtholder, William, Prince of Orange, to invade England and assume the throne. The signatories to the letter included Whigs, Tories, and the Bishop of London, Henry Compton, who assured the Prince that, [...] "Nineteen parts of twenty of the people... are desirous of change". William needed no further encouragement. Although the invitation was not signed by Churchill (he was not, as yet, of sufficient political rank to be a signatory), he declared his intention through William's principal English contact in The Hague – [...] "If you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> anything else that I ought to doe, you have but to command me". Churchill, like many others, was looking for an opportune time to desert James.|$|E
500|$|It is {{sometimes}} assumed that Usama was Shi'ite, because he often writes about 'Ali, his family {{cooperated with the}} Fatimids and other Shi'ite dynasties, and he himself served the Fatimids in Egypt. Philip K. Hitti {{thought he had a}} [...] "secret sympathy" [...] with the Shi'ites. Paul M. Cobb does not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> enough evidence one way or the other, but believes he was probably Sunni with [...] "acceptable Shi'ite tendencies." [...] Robert Irwin thinks the Banu Munqidh were Twelver Shi'ites (unlike the Fatimids who were Seveners), and that another clue to Usama's Shi'ism is his dislike of jihad, which was not a Shi'ite doctrine. Usama also admired Christian monks and holy men, and was disturbed that Muslims were not as pious as Christians. He was very fond of Sufis when he first learned about them late in his life in Damascus.|$|E
500|$|It was {{followed}} the same year by House of Sand and Fog, a drama {{based on the novel}} by Andre Dubus III. She portrayed Kathy Nicolo, an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir Behrani (Ben Kingsley). After reading the script, Connelly said: [...] "(the story is) moving and beautifully written. I liked {{the fact that there is}} no good guy and bad guy. I found it really compelling that both sides do things that are morally questionable, because life is often like that." [...] Producer Michael London said about Connelly's portrayal: [...] "I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace." ...|$|E
