25|$|On {{the night}} of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō opened the war with a {{surprise}} <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> <b>destroyer</b> attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the Tsesarevich and Retvizan, the heaviest battleships in Russia's far Eastern theater, and the 6,600ton cruiser Pallada. These attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral Tōgō was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially {{after the death of}} Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.|$|E
25|$|Cowan was {{an amateur}} {{right-handed}} middle-order or opening batsman whose appearances in regular cricket were restricted by {{his career in}} the Royal Navy. He was educated at the Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, Devon, passing out in 1899. As a naval cadet, he was posted to HMS Crescent and then in 1902 as an acting sub-lieutenant to HMS Revenge, a pre-Dreadnought battleship. The following year he was deployed as a full sub-lieutenant to the depot ship HMS Orion, based in Malta, for operation on the <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> <b>destroyer</b> HMS Seal and he was still there when promoted to full lieutenant in 1905. At the start of 1907, still lieutenant, he was sent to the newly commissioned HMS Hibernia, flagship of the North Atlantic Fleet, and then in 1911 he was posted to the refitted HMS Cumberland. By the end of the First World War, Cowan had reached the rank of Commander and was in charge of HMS Nairana, a converted ferry used to launch seaplanes which was deployed off the northern coast of Russia during the North Russia Campaign of UK involvement in the Russian Civil War. In retirement in 1928, he was promoted from the rank of Commander to Captain.|$|E

500|$|HMS Spiteful was one {{of about}} 60torpedo boat destroyers built {{for use by the}} Royal Navy between 1893 and 1900 to the {{specifications}} of the Admiralty; she was also the 50thship built for the Admiralty by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, and the 12th <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> <b>destroyer</b> built by them. By the time of her construction, Palmers had come to be {{regarded as one of the}} [...] "more successful builders [...] ".

2500|$|Another type of boiler {{similar to}} and {{later than the}} du Temple boiler was the Yarrow boiler, which usually {{dispensed}} with external down-comer tubes after its designer, Alfred Yarrow, demonstrated in 1896 {{that they were not}} essential to the circulation of water inside a boiler of this type. However, while the Yarrow boiler employed entirely straight tubes through which water and steam circulated more freely, it was considered by some contemporary writers on the subject such as LeslieS. Robertson as [...] "behind" [...] in its circulation because of the absence of down-comers. Whereas the Yarrow boilers fitted to the armoured cruiser [...] of 1905 evaporated 11.664pounds (5.291kg) of water per pound (454g) of coal at 100degrees centigrade (212degrees Fahrenheit) with natural draught, by the same measure a Reed boiler as fitted to the <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> <b>destroyer</b> [...] of 1896 evaporated 12pounds (5.44kg). An advantage of the Yarrow boiler was in weight: whereas the Reed boilers in the cruiser [...] of 1897 produced 38.5indicated horsepower(IHP) per ton (1016kg) of boiler at full power, by the same measure the Yarrow boilers in a slightly earlier [...] <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> <b>destroyer</b> produced 73IHP. But, whereas for example a [...] <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> <b>destroyer</b> of 1896 required four Reed boilers to achieve its specified top speed of 30knots, a similar Swordfish-class vessel required eight Yarrow boilers to achieve its specified top speed of 27knots. As fitted to <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> <b>destroyer</b> [...] in 1895, a dry Reed boiler weighed 13.25tons (12.44tonnes).|$|E
