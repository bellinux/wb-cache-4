25|$|<b>The</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> {{grade is}} {{assessed}} by comparison of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cells to normal breast cells. The closer to normal the cancer cells are, the slower their {{growth and the}} better the prognosis. If cells are not well differentiated, they will appear immature, will divide more rapidly, and will tend to spread. Well differentiated is given a grade of 1, moderate is grade 2, while poor or undifferentiated is given a higher grade of 3 or 4 (depending upon the scale used). The most widely used grading system is the Nottingham scheme; details are provided {{in the discussion of}} breast cancer grade.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critics say}} that breast cancer {{awareness}} has transformed the disease into a market-driven industry of survivorship and corporate sales pitches. Corporate marketing machines promote early detection of breast cancer, while also opposing public health efforts, such as stricter environmental legislation, that might decrease the incidence rate of breast cancer. These critics believe that some of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> organizations, particularly the highly visible Susan G. Komen for the Cure, have become captive companies that support and provide social capital to <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> industry, including pharmaceutical companies, mammography equipment manufacturers, and pollution-causing industries, as well as large corporations, creating or exacerbating other problems.|$|E
30|$|Our {{study has}} other limitations. First, {{we did not}} assess the {{correlation}} between detection of breast finding and clinical characteristic and technical parameters. In addition, we did not evaluate the histological size of <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> because <b>the</b> evaluation of <b>the</b> incidence of <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> during body MRI and its correlation with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> characteristics was not the purpose of our study. Finally, the study design could have underestimated the number of total breast findings due to inclusion of patients with percentage of breast tissue visible and not <b>the</b> whole <b>breast.</b>|$|R

25|$|Breast {{cancer has}} been known to educated women and {{caregivers}} throughout history, but modesty and horror at the consequences of a largely untreatable disease made it a taboo subject. <b>The</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> movement, which developed in the 1980s and 1990s out of 20th century feminist movements and the women's health movement, has mostly removed those taboos through its modern advocacy and awareness campaigns.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the primary}} {{sponsors}} {{are part of}} <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> industry, particularly cancer drug makers like AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Novartis. Because the national breast cancer organizations are dependent on corporate sponsorships for survival, this situation may represent {{a conflict of interest}} that prevents these organizations from representing the needs of current and future people with breast cancer when those needs conflict with the profit-making motives of the corporate sponsors.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> {{culture is}} ill-equipped {{to deal with}} women who are dying or who have died and their {{experiences}} may not be memorialized, validated or represented {{as part of the}} movement, instead being ignored or shunned as failures and as hope-destroying examples of reality. Similarly, the culture is also ill-equipped to deal with the news that a previously hyped treatment or screening procedure has been determined to be ineffective, with women advocating for the acceptance and promotion of inexpedient activities and inefficient or even sometimes harmful drugs.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{association}} between use of hormonal birth control {{and the development of}} premenopausal breast cancer, but whether oral contraceptives use may actually cause premenopausal breast cancer is a matter of debate.

In those with mutations in <b>the</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, or who {{have a family history of}} breast cancer, use of modern oral contraceptives does not appear to affect the risk of breast cancer.|$|E

We had planned NAC targeting to <b>the</b> left <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> which seemed more progressive disease, thus we administered FEC followed by wPac[*]+[*]T and as expected, those mass showed different mass reduction responses. Importantly, it is recently {{reported that the}} HR and HER 2 status, <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> subtype, are involved with the mass reduction effect of NAC and pathological response. Furthermore, in term of patient’s prognosis, there is different significance of pCR depending on <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> subtype (Toi et al. 2008).|$|R
