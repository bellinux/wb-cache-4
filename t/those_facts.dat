25|$|Recent {{scholarship}} {{states that}} Shankara's arguments on revelation are about apta vacana (Sanskrit: आप्तवचन, sayings of the wise, relying on word, testimony of {{past or present}} reliable experts). It {{is part of his}} and Advaita Vedanta's epistemological foundation. Advaita Vedanta school considers such testimony epistemically valid asserting that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of <b>those</b> <b>facts</b> and truths directly. Shankara considered the teachings in the Vedas and Upanishads as apta vacana and a valid source of knowledge. He suggests the importance of teacher-disciple relationship on combining logic and revelation to attain moksha in his text Upadeshasahasri. Rambachan and others state Shankara methodology did not rely exclusively on Vedic statements, but included a range of logical methods, reasoning methodology and pramanas.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that you know of your own personal knowledge and relay <b>those</b> <b>facts</b> as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E

500|$|In Re Fong Thin Choo (1991), the High Court {{accepted}} {{that if an}} authority's discretion depends {{on the existence of}} certain facts, the court must ensure that <b>those</b> <b>facts</b> exist and have been taken into account by the authority, that the authority has exercised its discretion on a proper self-direction as to <b>those</b> <b>facts,</b> and that the authority has not taken into account matters it ought not to have considered. Law professor Thio Li-ann has expressed the view that this decision indicates a court is primarily concerned with whether an error that has been committed is serious – if so, the court will exercise judicial review, regardless of whether the error is jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional in nature. [...] "Since the law/fact boundary becomes indistinct, this fudges the conceptual moorings of judicial review as confined to scrutinising legal error.

500|$|In certain situations, law {{enforcement}} may {{perform a search}} {{when they have a}} reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest. Under Terry v. Ohio (1968), {{law enforcement}} officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances. In Terry, the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses [...] "unusual conduct" [...] that leads that officer to reasonably believe [...] "that criminal activity may be afoot", that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a [...] "pat-down search" [...] (or [...] "frisk") to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon. This detention and search is known as a Terry stop. To conduct a frisk, officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from <b>those</b> <b>facts,</b> reasonably warrant their actions. As established in Florida v. Royer (1983), such a search must be temporary, and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop (e.g., officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car, cannot, after confirming that it is not stolen, compel the person to answer questions about anything else, such as the possession of contraband).|$|E

2500|$|Alexander Campbell {{was also}} deeply {{influenced}} by Enlightenment thinking, {{in particular the}} Scottish School of Common Sense of Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart. This group saw the Bible as providing concrete facts rather than abstract truths, and advocated a scientific or Baconian approach to interpreting the Bible that would begin with <b>those</b> <b>facts,</b> arrange the ones applicable to a given topic, and then use them to draw conclusions. Alexander Campbell reflected this approach, when arguing that [...] "the Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions." [...] He believed that if Christians would limit themselves to the facts found in the Bible, they would necessarily come to agreement. He saw <b>those</b> <b>facts</b> as providing a blueprint or constitution for the church.|$|E
2500|$|The case of Tameside {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{as being the}} first case which suggests a novel approach to factual error. There, the court asserted that administrative decisions may be reviewed {{if there has been}} a [...] "misunderstanding or ignorance of an established and relevant fact", and/or the decision-maker has acted [...] "outside his power, or unfairly, or upon an incorrect basis of fact". That is to say, even if it is for the decision-maker to evaluate the facts, the court can inquire into whether <b>those</b> <b>facts</b> exist and have been taken into account, whether the decision was made on a proper self-direction as to <b>those</b> <b>facts,</b> and whether irrelevant facts have been taken into account. Thus, the court's power in judicial review was broadened to allow for a limited factual inquiry. This ground of judicial review has been termed as an error of material fact.|$|E
