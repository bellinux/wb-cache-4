5|$|The {{division}} {{within the}} ministry {{came to a}} head on 8 February 1708, when Godolphin and the Marlboroughs insisted that the Queen had to either dismiss Harley or do without their services. When the Queen seemed <b>to</b> <b>hesitate,</b> Marlborough and Godolphin refused to attend a cabinet meeting. Harley attempted to lead business without his former colleagues, and several of those present including the Duke of Somerset refused to participate until they returned. Her hand forced, the Queen dismissed Harley.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that <b>to</b> <b>hesitate</b> even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E

25|$|When college {{students}} were surveyed, {{it was found}} that 35% do not tell anyone about a sexual harassment occurrence, 49% tell a friend, and only 7% go to a school faculty member to report the incident.

However, since then, Masʻūd had allied himself with the powerful governor of Azerbaijan and Jibal, who in 1185 began moving his troops across the Zagros Mountains, causing Saladin <b>to</b> <b>hesitate</b> in his attacks. The defenders of Mosul, when they became aware that help was on the way, increased their efforts, and Saladin subsequently fell ill, so in March 1186 a peace treaty was signed.|$|E
500|$|William {{landed at}} Torbay on 5 November 1688 (O.S.); from there, {{he moved his}} army to Exeter. James's forces – once again {{commanded}} by Lord Feversham – moved to Salisbury, but few of its senior officers were eager to fight – even Princess Anne wrote to William to wish him [...] "good success in this so just an undertaking". Promoted to Lieutenant-General on 7 November (O.S.) Churchill was still at the King's side, but his displaying [...] "the greatest transports of joy imaginable" [...] at the desertion of Lord Cornbury led Feversham to call for his arrest.

500|$|As part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch, The New 52, Barbara Gordon's {{paralysis}} {{is described}} as lasting only three years time. In Batgirl (volume 4), the character's age is reduced, and she is depicted as a recent college graduate, having {{earned a degree in}} forensic psychology. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, causing her <b>to</b> <b>hesitate</b> in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage. The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not. In a September 2011 interview, Gail Simone stated, [...] "I'm enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life. She's younger, she doesn't know everything, she's been immersed in school and her life-plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she's nervous about that. I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions, but this really is a key time for her." ...|$|E

500|$|Criticism of Mills' {{design and}} its {{estimated}} {{price tag of}} more than $1 million (in 1848, [...] ) caused the society <b>to</b> <b>hesitate.</b> On April 11, 1848 the society decided, {{due to a lack}} of funds, to build only the obelisk. Mills' 1848 obelisk was to be 500 feet tall, [...] square at the base and [...] square at the top. It had two massive doorways, each [...] high and [...] wide, on the east and west sides of its base. Surrounding each doorway were raised jambs, a heavy pediment, and entablature within which was carved an Egyptian-style winged sun and asps. This original design conformed to a massive temple which was to have surrounded the base of the obelisk, but because it was never built, the architect of the second phase of construction Thomas Lincoln Casey smoothed down the projecting jambs, pediment and entablature in 1885, walled up the west entrance with marble forming an alcove, and reduced the east entrance to [...] high. The western alcove has contained a [...] since 1992–93. Also during 1992–93 a [...] was installed at the east elevator entrance decorated with a winged sun and asps to mimic Mills' 1848 design.|$|E
500|$|In the new, revised continuity, {{the events}} of The Killing Joke took place three years before the current storyline, {{and while it is}} {{established}} she was paraplegic during that time, Barbara Gordon is written as having regained her mobility after undergoing experimental surgery at a South African clinic. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after her recovery, she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, causing her <b>to</b> <b>hesitate</b> in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage. The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not. Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is [...] "one of the smartest and toughest women in comics... One thing the book is truly about, is that the after-effects of something like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or other trauma-related syndromes, can strike even very smart, very intellectually tough people, even soldiers and cops", a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books. She also explained the method of the character's recovery is based upon real life experiences in that [...] "some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from South Africa. People have been talking about this as if it's some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead, but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases. Barbara's spine was not severed. That makes her a candidate." ...|$|E
500|$|When Mirkin {{took over}} as show runner, he listed actor James Woods {{as one of the}} people he would most like to guest star on the show. Michael Caine was {{originally}} supposed to be the actor in the episode who takes over Apu's job at the Kwik-E-Mart, but he rejected the role. The story was therefore rewritten so that Woods received Apu's job instead. Woods was one of animation director David Silverman's favorite guest stars. Mirkin said he provided one of the [...] "most fantastic" [...] performances ever on the show, and commented that he [...] "nailed" [...] all of his lines and was [...] "so funny, right {{at the top of his}} head". Mirkin said that when most guest stars come in to record their lines for the show, they are a little nervous because they have never done voice-over before. Mirkin noted, however, that Woods was a [...] "fearless guy" [...] and he was [...] "so excited to do it because he was a huge fan of the show". Silverman noted that in addition to his humorous ad-libbing, Woods's tendency <b>to</b> <b>hesitate</b> while speaking was [...] "great for animation", explaining that it made the character feel more realistic. [...] "Homer and Apu" [...] features the popular Simpsons song [...] "Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart?", sung by Apu and the Simpson family. The song was written by all of the show's writers in the writer's room, and it was composed by Alf Clausen. The song later appeared on the soundtrack album Songs in the Key of Springfield, which was released on March 18, 1997, and compiled many musical numbers from the show.|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} new addition is Aragorn's self-doubt, which causes him <b>to</b> <b>hesitate</b> {{to claim the}} kingship of Gondor.

In the book Narsil is reforged immediately when he joins the Fellowship, but this event is held over until [...] in film to symbolically coincide with his acceptance of his title. These elements were added because Peter Jackson believed that each character {{should be forced to}} grow or change {{over the course of the}} story.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "In the military, it's like we're trained <b>to</b> <b>hesitate</b> now. If somebody had seen something wrong and shot, {{he probably would have}} been court-martialed".

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, several U.S. {{government}} officials have criticised WikiLeaks for exposing classified information and claimed that the leaks harm national security and compromise international diplomacy.

Some journalists have likewise criticised a perceived lack of editorial discretion when releasing thousands of documents at once and without sufficient analysis. In 2016, Harvard law professor and Electronic Frontier Foundation board member Jonathan Zittrain argued that a culture in which one constantly risks being [...] "outed" [...] as a result of virtual Watergate-like break-ins (or 4th amendment violations) could lead people <b>to</b> <b>hesitate</b> to speak their minds.|$|E
