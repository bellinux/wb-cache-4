5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> to keep the partial pressure of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout the dive.

5|$|Cucurbitin is an {{amino acid}} and a carboxypyrrolidine that {{is found in}} raw Cucurbita seeds.

5|$|The birthday-number {{effect is}} the {{unconscious}} tendency {{of people to}} prefer the numbers in the date of their birthday over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese psychologists Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number effect has been replicated in various countries. It holds across age and gender. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> most prominent for numbers over 12.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> first {{observed}} experimentally in 2000, 38 {{years after}} its theoretical prediction. So far <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> has <b>been</b> observed in silica sand, rock salt, ice, and Earth's atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|The first {{acknowledged}} use of <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> in <b>the</b> 1991 {{science fiction}} film Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.

50|$|The {{next set}} of {{substituent}}s are the halogens, for which <b>the</b> substituent <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still positive but much more modest. The {{reason for this is}} that while <b>the</b> inductive <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still negative, <b>the</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive, causing partial cancellation. The data also show that for these substituents, <b>the</b> meta <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> much larger than <b>the</b> para <b>effect,</b> due to <b>the</b> fact that <b>the</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> greatly reduced in a meta substituent. With meta substituents a carbon atom bearing the negative charge is further away from the carboxylic acid group (structure 2b).|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{very small}} but {{measurable}} on Earth using the Mössbauer effect and was first {{observed in the}} Pound–Rebka experiment. However, it is significant near a black hole, and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (see Sachs-Wolfe effect).|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of a combination of}} several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident.|$|E

40|$|Spores of the {{hyperparasite}} Acremonium alternatum reduced {{powdery mildew}} infection by Leveillula taurica on greenhouse tomato. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> slightly increased when spores were applied killed, {{and therefore not}} due to direct parasitism. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> systemic, protecting untreated leaves above the treated ones. Spores killed by heat had more effect than when killed by UV, so <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> presumably due to induction of host resistance by substances released when cells were heat killed. The size of <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> depended upon leaf age and level of infection. Effects on primary infection and expansion of successful infections appear to be under independent control...|$|R

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin {{began work}} {{related to her}} {{controversial}} thesis regarding galaxy clusters with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube spectrograph. This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight seen through the telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too dim to see. The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in {{the expansion of the}} Universe on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth. First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> now known as large scale streaming. The pair also briefly studied quasars, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the physics}} behind <b>the</b> photorefractive <b>effect</b> <b>were</b> known {{for quite a}} while, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> first {{observed}} in 1967 in LiNbO3. For more than thirty years, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> observed and studied exclusively in inorganic materials, until 1990, when a nonlinear organic crystal 2-(cyclooctylamino)-5-nitropyridine (COANP) doped with 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) exhibited <b>the</b> photorefractive <b>effect.</b> Even though inorganic material-based electronics dominate the current market, organic PR materials have been improved greatly since then and are currently {{considered to be an}} equal alternative to inorganic crystals.|$|R
5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter {{effect has}} been replicated {{in dozens of}} studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> most prominent for initials, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is not a}} human invention, and may be {{observed}} in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} serious {{poisoning}} the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of {{central nervous system}} depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days. In {{the majority of cases}} recovery is complete within 12 to 24hours. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.|$|E

5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were most consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} preference is due to an attachment to the self. These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers. The researchers suggested that <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{sitting in}} an {{underground}} chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> to increase the concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases {{to come out of}} solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E
5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the equator, {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the equator, and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south. Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the equator, where <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
