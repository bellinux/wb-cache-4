5|$|On April17, 1866, <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> road {{company was}} bought {{out by the}} Skaneateles Railroad Company. The state {{chartered}} the bill, the railroad was constructed and tolls were to be collected by the railroad company rather than <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> road company.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was once}} part of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road, a plank road {{established}} by a New York State Legislature charter in the 1850s. It spanned {{a short distance from}} Jordan to the village of Skaneateles and was a successor to the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad, which ceased operations in 1834. However, <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> road lasted less than two decades. In 1866, the Legislature granted another charter, this time creating the Skaneateles Railroad and its corporation, which bought out most of <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> road company.|$|E
5|$|George Tillson, his sons, and his {{brother-in-law}} Benjamin Van Norman were the principal stockholders of the Ingersoll and Port Burwell Road Company, which they formed along with approximately 200 shareholders in September1849. Proceeding quickly, the company established eight toll booths along the new route, which {{became known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Plank</b> and Gravel Road due to the materials with which it was constructed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>planks</b> were {{alleged to}} be 38 cm wide, 22 cm tall and about 0.5 cm thick. The edges and {{surfaces}} of <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> are uneven and near the top there are two holes for joining <b>the</b> <b>planks.</b> <b>The</b> text is carved into <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> and later covered with some coloring. Text alignment lines (roughly straight and parallel) are drawn across <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> and <b>the</b> tops of letters are aligned with these lines. The text is written below the lines, rather than above. The {{size and shape of}} the letters are different, suggesting that more than one person wrote <b>the</b> text. Some <b>planks</b> were partially or mostly rotten.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>planks</b> were hard, no doubt, but our castaways were hardy; besides, a few {{folds of}} the {{superfluous}} portions of the large sail helped to soften <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> here and there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it is to cover <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> thickly, before they lay down the faggots; {{otherwise}} <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> would burn, and perhaps fall bodily in the water, before the fire had done its work on the doors." ...|$|R
5|$|Hemlock logs {{were used}} to build <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> road. At that time, the tree's bark was {{a major source of}} tannin used to tan leather. The wood was not used much for lumber, so {{hundreds}} of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were normally left to rot. There were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available from the local timber industry.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} during construction of the 23rd Street subway station that caused the tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after a blast of dynamite in the subway tunnel destroyed <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour {{to pack up and}} leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E
60|$|The party {{returned}} {{to the other end}} of the hold, removed <b>the</b> <b>planks,</b> and joined their friends. The next watch had arranged to lie down close to <b>the</b> <b>planks,</b> so that they could be aroused without waking the others.|$|R
60|$|As soon, then, as {{it became}} dark, and the hatch over the middle hold was closed; <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> were removed, and Francis and his party set to work {{shifting}} the sacks, in the corner where the sailors had cut <b>the</b> <b>planks.</b> Each sack was taken up, and placed against the pile further on, without the slightest noise, until at last all were removed that {{stood in the way}} of <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> being taken down. These were carried out into the hold.|$|R
5000|$|KAPLA {{requires}} no glue, no screws and no clips to fix <b>the</b> <b>planks.</b> Each plank is simply placed {{one on top}} of <b>the</b> other. <b>The</b> <b>planks</b> are held in place by gravity and balance alone. You can use Kapla planks in 3 different ways: ...|$|R
5|$|By 3:30p.m. the {{massacre}} was well under way. A {{group of women}} in Rock Springs had gathered at <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} third repulse of the Confederates on the western wing, the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee regiments arrived from the Mauckport Road and joined the battle, giving the attackers a {{numerical}} superiority. At about 12:40p.m., Capt. Byrnes arrived with the Confederate artillery and used his two ten-pound Parrott rifle cannons to pin down the defenders in the works. In the meantime, Morgan was leading his main body of troops far around {{the eastern edge of}} the defenses and up <b>the</b> <b>Plank</b> Road, threatening the town directly and bypassing the defenses entirely. As they moved onto the Corydon Pike, they shot and robbed a toll gate keeper who refused to throw down his gun.|$|E
5|$|The modern routing of NY317 was {{originally}} {{the northern part}} of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road. Chartered in 1855, the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road Company was set to provide a plank road from Jordan southward to Skaneateles. This plank road was constructed in the 1850s in place of the Syracuse and Auburn Railroad and a small railroad from Skaneateles to Skaneateles Junction, two crude railroads that were in the area which had ended service in 1836 and 1850 respectively. On March25, 1853, the New York State Assembly proposed an additional toll gate to be constructed in Elbridge along <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> road. On June15, 1853, the bill was passed by the Legislature and went into effect.|$|E
5000|$|Illustrations on [...] {{show that}} there are two sets of jaws affixed to <b>the</b> <b>planks.</b> <b>The</b> lower set are level with the top of <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> and are {{circular}} when closed to firmly grip the head of the broom. Metal plates rising from <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> carry <b>the</b> upper set which are flat and force the broom corn flat. The jaws are closed by a toggle mechanism operating on horizontal links from the fixed jaw and vertical hanger links from the floor. The toggle is provided with a long wooden handle which the operator can pull down to secure the broom in the vise.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the order}} of votes {{received}} from Democratic delegates seven issues were chosen {{based on the number}} of votes received. <b>The</b> first <b>plank</b> is <b>the</b> opposition to corporate personhood. <b>The</b> second <b>plank</b> is <b>the</b> support of a single-payer health care for the United States. <b>The</b> third <b>plank</b> is opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act. <b>The</b> fourth <b>plank</b> states that <b>the</b> Party supports the separation of church and state. <b>The</b> fifth <b>plank</b> supports energy independence by using renewable and eco-sustainable resources from Iowa. <b>The</b> sixth <b>plank</b> supports removing <b>the</b> cap on Social Security contributions and <b>the</b> seventh <b>plank</b> supports repealing [...] "right to work" [...] laws.|$|R
50|$|By 1837, the Michigan Road {{had reached}} Logansport. The roadway {{consisted}} of leveled dirt and log bridges, which decayed with every rain and snow fall. By 1850 the state approved funding to have <b>the</b> road <b>planked.</b> <b>The</b> roadbed was leveled and then {{covered with a}} wooden structure. Planking consisted of log sills or sleepers, laid lengthwise along the outer edges. Crosswise, planks were nailed to <b>the</b> sleepers. <b>The</b> <b>planks</b> were 2 or 3 in thick. Each sleeper run could be up to 10 ft in length. When necessary, multiple sleeper sections were linked end to end. Together, these planks provided a road free of dust and mud. With age, mud holes formed under <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> and sprayed outwards and up between <b>the</b> <b>planks,</b> making some sections of roadway impassible during the muddy season.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plank</b> {{road was}} {{operational}} for about 38 years when a major flood on June 1, 1889 washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the Johnstown Flood, which killed over 2200 people. The Cogan House Covered Bridge {{was the only}} one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood, as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just upstream. The 90foot (27m) long Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1877, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, rehabilitated in 1998, and is today one of just three left in the county.|$|E
5|$|The {{tax system}} was {{partially}} reformed in 1881, allowing for direct payment of road taxes instead of relying totally on the statute-labor system. The first road district {{larger than the}} township level was created in Bay County in 1883 under Public Act278. This road district encompassed eight townships and provided for better coordination and planning of road construction. Other county systems were created in 1893 with passage of legislation which allowed other counties to {{follow the lead of}} Bay County. By 1900, <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> roads were generally abandoned. While a few were still in good repair, most consisted of rotting logs with intermittent patches of gravel. Toll houses were empty shacks, and the ditches were clogged with duck ponds. Only 23 of the original 202plank roads chartered by the state were still in operation.|$|E
5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River {{to the mouth of}} the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E
5|$|Route 12 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was {{constructed}} through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new plank road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with the planks bound together by steel, as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} and personalities {{featured in the}} game directly correspond to real life venues and people—for example, blogger Brian Pigeon is mentioned {{as one of the}} Hatoful world's most influential writers, and the aforementioned Torimi Café, featured in-game as a location where the protagonist can work during summer vacation, is an actual bird-themed café located in Kobe. Likewise, some aspects of Hatofuls narrative reference real world events, media, or people: the deadly H5N1 pandemic forming the basis of the game's post-apocalyptic setting was inspired by historical outbreaks of disease, most prominently the 1918 flu pandemic; depictions of Hitchcock's Winter, the in-universe war between humans and birds, bear several similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds; and Operation Carneades—the codename given to the human countermeasure against H5N1 that instead granted intelligence to birds in the Hatoful universe—was named after Greek philosopher Carneades and one of his thought experiments, <b>the</b> <b>Plank</b> of Carneades.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys and}} the farmer set to work, and {{presently}} they had several rough <b>planks</b> taken from <b>the</b> sides of the hut.

50|$|The balangay was {{basically}} a plank boat put together by joining <b>the</b> carved out <b>planks</b> edge to edge, using pins or dowels. <b>The</b> <b>planks,</b> which were made from a hardwood called doongon in the Philippines (Heritiera littoralis), were fastened together every 12 centimetres, also by hardwood pin measuring some 19 centimetres long, which were driven into holes {{on the edge of}} each <b>plank.</b> On <b>the</b> inner side of <b>the</b> boat <b>the</b> <b>planks</b> were provided, at regular intervals, with raised rectangular lugs, carved from <b>the</b> same <b>plank,</b> through which holes were bored diagonally from the sides to the surface.|$|R
25|$|Before Schumacher's appeal {{from his}} {{disqualification}} at the British Grand Prix, he was disqualified from the Belgian Grand Prix as his Benetton had excessive wear of <b>the</b> <b>plank.</b> The FIA allowed <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> to be ten millimetres deep, with an allowance of one millimetre meaning that <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> {{must be a}} minimum of nine millimetres to be deemed legal. A majority of <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> on Schumacher's car measured 7.4 millimetres, 1.6 under the legal tolerance. Benetton, along with Schumacher, claimed that <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> had excessive wear due to a spin by Schumacher during the race. Benetton launched an immediate appeal, with a World Motor Sport Council meeting set for September 5. The allegations of Benetton cheating throughout the summer of 1994 led to rumours of Schumacher quitting the team. The team released a statement denying the rumours, stating that Schumacher would complete the season.|$|E
25|$|Across {{the top of}} the {{trapping}} pit was a thick stick or pole, and on {{this was}} fastened a plank, which covered {{the top of the}} trap. On one end of this plank was a piece of venison, and on the other a stone. The way the trap was meant to work was this: The wolf would come to the venison, and just as it got on <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> to eat it, <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> would turn, causing the wolf to fall into the pit. The weight of the stone at the other end would bring <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> up again, ready baited for another wolf.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hours after}} the race, Jarno Trulli had his fourth-place result taken away for having too much wear on <b>the</b> <b>plank</b> under his Jordan, but the team's appeal of the {{decision}} was accepted four weeks later {{and the result was}} reinstated.|$|E
