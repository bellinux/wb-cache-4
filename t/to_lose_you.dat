The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> <b>you</b> would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E

500|$|Two years later, Catherine faced a new {{crisis with}} the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were [...] "oh, my mother...". The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before. However, three months after his {{coronation}} at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: [...] "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>you,</b> I would have myself buried alive with you." ...|$|E

The band took a break from recording to reprise a one-off [...] "Raise" [...] show at The Garage in Highbury, London on 4 April 2014. On 19 September 2014, the band stated via Twitter that they were mixing the album, which had a tentative release date of early 2015. On 7 January 2015, the band announced that their new album, titled I Wasn't Born <b>to</b> <b>Lose</b> <b>You,</b> would be released on 3 March 2015 through the Cobraside record label.

2500|$|The censor, the Lord Chamberlain, {{hastened to}} see the show, and demanded changes. After an {{uncertain}} start, the revue was a huge success; the song [...] "We don't want <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>you,</b> but we {{think you ought to}} go", encouraging young men to join the army, was a particular hit for Delysia. Within weeks the other items in the triple bill were dropped, and Odds and Ends was expanded to a full evening, with only a brief curtain raiser. Within two months of the opening, Delysia was an established star, invited to take part with Muriel Foster, Charles Hawtrey, Oscar Asche and Isidore de Lara in a charity matinée attended by Queen Alexandra. It was the first of many charity appearances that Delysia made during the war. Her biographer Anne Pimlott Baker writes that Delysia entertained wounded troops, and took many French refugees and orphans into her home. In 1916, she made her film début, and took a leading role in SHE, an adaptation of the Rider Haggard story, about a woman's passion for a young traveller.|$|E
