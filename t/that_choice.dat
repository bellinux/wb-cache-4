40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} Choices & Changes, an economics education program designed to teach "at-risk" children in elementary and junior high school that they can control their future by making wise choices and investing in themselves. Using program-specific instruments and a national sample of approximately 1600 students, a controlled experiment was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of Choices & Changes on student learning and attitudes. The experimental data were analyzed using a simultaneous model estimated by 2 SLS with correction for self-selection due to sample attrition between pre- and post-test observations. The results indicate <b>that</b> <b>Choices</b> & Changes had a positive effect on economic understanding for each grade level examined, ceteris paribus. Significant positive effects on attitudes were found in only one of the four student groups. These findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>Choices</b> & Changes is meeting its short-run objective of producing cognitive understanding of economic concepts and that the attitudes of at-risk students can be altered but may require additional intervention. ...|$|R

The Sportimes used <b>that</b> <b>choice</b> to select Robert Kendrick. Christina Fusano was taken with the Sportimes' final choice.
