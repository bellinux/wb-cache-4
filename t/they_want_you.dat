It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy.

How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1975 {{federal and}} state elections, Australia, and South Australia in particular, {{had been hit by}} a series of {{economic}} problems. The 1973 oil crisis had massively increased the cost of living, domestic industry began to erode {{due to a lack of}} cost-competitiveness, and government funds were waning. In response, the Dunstan Government sold loss-making railways to the Commonwealth and brought in new taxes to allow wage rises. The changes had unexpected consequences: inflation, already high, increased markedly, and workers were still displeased with wages. The LCL, now known as the Liberal Party, had rebuilt after internal schism and had modernised to make themselves more appealing to the public. Having called an early election, Dunstan appealed to the electorate and pushed blame onto the Whitlam Government for South Australia's problems. In a television address just days before the election, he said: [...] "My Government is being smeared and it hurts. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to think we are to blame for Canberra's mistakes. The vote on Saturday is not for Canberra, not for Australia, but for South Australia." ...|$|E

I would love to have their input anytime, because they're obviously doing something right." [...] The band also contributed backing vocals and played the guitar to the song. It was produced by the Jonas Brothers and John Fields, with the latter also playing the bass, guitars and keyboards. The song also features Devin Bronson, who provided a guitar solo, and Dorian Crozier, who played the drums. In an interview, Lovato explained that the song is about being yourself when you are surrounded by [...] "the pressures of fame". She said, [...] "You get to Hollywood {{and a lot of times}} people can try to shape you and mould you into what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to be.

2500|$|After {{two years}} of calling {{baseball}} telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week, All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck's ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with lead analyst Tim McCarver. Buck was soon replaced by Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Buck later noted that [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let McCarver run the show ...

Because they done fed the followers and they done fed [...] to the customers. The customers will drink anything that you give them if it's promoted right…But when you take away the skill and you take away the slick, and you take away the boxing ability and say that's not entertaining, or that's not entertainment, then, to me, it's like trying to erase a culture that you know has dominated the sport way back then where you were slick.

2500|$|The name [...] "Ori" [...] {{comes from}} the word [...] "Origin", as in {{the origin of the}} Ancients. When {{executive}} producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of [...] "origin", he retcon-invented the word [...] "Origin" [...] as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as [...] "how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?" [...] Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, {{it would be hard to}} present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the [...] "magic powers" [...] of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that [...] "it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do." [...] Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should [...] "first and foremost [...] entertain people", he considered it representative of television and the media, [...] "mak people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box [...] whatever <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to believe they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people." [...] For Cooper, [...] "the followers of the Ori were the interesting part", and he [...] "wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that." [...] Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting [...] "mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes." [...] The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.|$|E
