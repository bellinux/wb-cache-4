5000|$|Distronic Plus with Steering Assist: This radar-based {{function}} has {{now been}} enhanced {{by the addition of}} Steering Assist, which helps drivers to stay centred in their lane by generating the appropriate steering torque when travelling on a straight road and even in gentle bends. The stereo camera recognises lane markings as well as vehicles driving ahead together with their three-dimensional positioning, and relays this information to the electric steering assistance system. When driving at slow speeds, e.g. in congested <b>traffic,</b> <b>Steering</b> Assist can use the vehicle ahead as a means of orientation, enabling semi-autonomous following even when there are no clear lane markings visible. As a result, the system is able to further enhance driving comfort and substantially ease the driver's workload in many traffic situations. DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist can be activated as before with a lever on the steering column in a speed range from 0 - 200 km/h. Any speed between 30 km/h and 200 km/h can be selected as the desired cruising speed. Drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times even when Steering Assist is activated, as the function only works in bends above a certain, speed-dependent radius.|$|E

By matching network resources and dynamic mobile traffic demand, <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> helps to reduce on-grid power consumption with on-demand services provided. This book reviews existing solutions from {{the perspectives of}} energy consumption reduction and renewable energy harvesting. Specifically, it explains how <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> can improve energy efficiency through intelligent traffic-resource matching. Several promising <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> approaches for dynamic network planning and renewable energy demand-supply balancing are discussed. This book presents an energy-aware <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> method for networks with energy harvesting, which optimizes the traffic allocated to each cell based on the renewable energy status. Renewable energy demand-supply balancing is a key factor in energy dynamics, aimed at enhancing renewable energy sustainability to reduce on-grid energy consumption. Dynamic network planning adjusts cell density with traffic variations to provide on-demand service, which reduces network power consumption with quality of service provisioning during off-peak hours. With intra- or inter-tier <b>traffic</b> <b>steering,</b> cell density is dynamically optimized with regards to the instant traffic load for conventional homogeneous and multi-tier heterogeneous cellular networks, respectively.

In idle mode, no dedicated resources have been established for the user equipment (UE), and the procedure for changing of camping cell is called cell reselection. A <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> policy can be used in this case to determine the preferred layer for camping[3, 12]. In connected mode, an HO is typically carried out when the UE moves between two cells to preserve the user connection. However, this is not necessarily the only reason for triggering an HO. Since the coverage area of the layers is overlapped, a UE could trigger an HO due to <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> reasons[1, 13]. An important issue that arises from using both cell reselection and HO procedures for <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> is the need of aligning these two mechanism to avoid ping-pong effects.|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : Middleboxes and AddressingInternational audienceThe {{migration}} of network functions (NFs) to datacenters, as promoted by Network Function Virtualization (NFV), raises {{the need for}} service chaining (i. e., <b>steering</b> <b>traffic</b> through a sequence of NFs). Service chaining is typically performed by installing forwarding entries in switches within datacenters (DCs). However, {{as the number of}} service chains in DCs grows, switches will be required to maintain a large amount of forwarding state. This will raise a dataplane scalability issue, due to the relatively small flow table size of switches. To mitigate this problem, we present a software-defined network (SDN) based source routing architecture for scalable service chaining, at which the NF-path is encoded into the packet header obviating the need for any forwarding state and lookup in the switches. We assess the feasibility and efficiency of our architecture using a prototype implementation...|$|R

30|$|This paper investigates <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> {{techniques}} by static {{adjustment of}} mobility parameters in HetNets. To find the optimal user distribution across the network layers, a cell reselection algorithm considering different layer priorities and inter-RAT HOs {{is used for}} <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> purposes. More specifically, first, the problem of allocating absolute priorities (APs) to network layers for cell reselection is analyzed. Second, a procedure to select the optimal thresholds of the 3 GPP events that trigger the inter-RAT HOs is proposed. In this case, the problem arising {{from the use of}} HO triggering events based on the signal level is addressed. When the events are based on the signal level instead of the signal quality, the thresholds involved in these events require a more precise adjustment, especially in multi-layer scenarios, where the location of low-power nodes within the macro-cell may determine the adjustment of the thresholds. The proposed techniques are assessed in a realistic scenario thoroughly deployed to cover hotspots with LTE pico-cells so that the <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> policy is to offload traffic to the pico-layers in order to use more efficiently the radio resources and improve service performance. The main contribution of this work is the design of an algorithm to simplify the task of adjusting these thresholds for <b>traffic</b> <b>steering.</b> The impact of the LTE penetration in the mobile terminals is also studied in the LTE/HSPA scenario, where the LTE pico-cells are deployed in areas without LTE macro-coverage.|$|E

We propose a simple and feasible alternative, in which traffic lights self-organize to improve traffic flow. We use a multi-agent simulation to study two self-organizing methods, which are able to outperform two traditional rigid methods. Using simple rules, traffic lights are able to self-organize and adapt to changing traffic conditions, reducing waiting times, stopped cars, and increasing average speeds. Even when the scenario simplifies real traffic, results are very promising, and encourage further research in more realistic environments. ...|$|R

Geographic location data gathered with a yield monitor during harvest and a data logger during planting were used to provide time−motion studies of equipment and operator productivity. This study used these spatial and temporal data to quantify field performance of a combine and a planter. Seven Nebraska fields were used to compare results from soybean and corn production systems. Fields that were relatively flat with straight rows were contrasted with contoured fields with slopes of 3 % to 5 %. Two unique traffic patterns in fields with a center pivot were compared. Four traffic pattern indices were developed and averaged across each field to indicate the steering behavior (or adjustments) made during field operations. Geo−referenced data were used to predict field efficiency for various traffic patterns. Of the four indices compared, the average steering angle (θ) and its standard deviation had the strongest association with field efficiency with Pearson correlation coefficients of − 0. 654 and − 0. 664, respectively.

High speed users can be connected to a so-called umbrella layer to avoid a frequent number of handovers[8]. Other factors contributing to the preferred choice of the access technology are addressed in[9], where aspects such as coverage, securing QoS for the requested service, minimizing the cost of delivering the service to the end user and maximizing the spectrum utilization by traffic packaging are considered to select the access technology. Potentials of dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> algorithms are also addressed in[10].|$|E
30|$|The {{modification}} of cell service areas {{also has an}} impact on network connection quality. As a result of <b>traffic</b> <b>steering,</b> a user might not be served by the closest base station, providing the minimum pathloss, which might impair connection quality. Although adaptive modulation and coding in LTE partly alleviates this problem, the link adaptation capability is limited. Therefore, <b>traffic</b> <b>steering</b> must be performed carefully to keep Quality-of-Service in a satisfactory level. This is important in indoor scenarios, where coverage holes and severe fading may exist due to wall obstructions and multi-path reflections. For this reason, operators often prefer to keep femtocell power settings on the default (i.e., maximum) values in the absence of precise method to predict propagation losses in indoor environment.|$|E

The tremendous growth in ICT adds more users and also traffic adds another dimension. NGN {{is expected to be}} the emerging IP network to transport converged services and MPLS and MPLS- TE plays an important role in this context. These new applications have increased demand for guaranteed bandwidth in the limited backbone capacity in the provider's network and the challenge is to provide differentiated class of services with required QoS and also to produce SLA performance reports to the end users when requested. Due to numerous benefits such as guaranteed end to end QoS, link protection and efficient use of core bandwidth MPLS- TE is being recognized and becoming popular among service providers. TE enables service providers to route network traffic in such a way that they can offer the best service to their users in terms of throughput and delay. In this research MPLS- TE approach is used to implement end to end QoS for prioritized services and a SLA program is developed using SNMP to produce end to end reports on critical performance metrics like delay, round trip time, jitter and application aware services to customers. The study also investigates the process of <b>steering</b> <b>traffic</b> across the MPLS/IP core backbone to facilitate efficient use of available bandwidth between a pair of backbone routers to ensure the required service levels. Hence in a multilink environment where many links are available for routing we can avoid the shortest paths being congested. Since network can have different types of packets; packets were generated and marked based on DSCP for QoS which were routed in different TE tunnels in a lab environment. The lab results showed that, using, TE tunriels constrained routing can provide explicit paths to required destinations regardless of the paths calculated by the routing protocols thus bandwidth efficiency can be achieved in the core while ensuring end to end QoS for critical applications for a given IP SLA. Also, results obtained by the SLA program from a live operational network were acceptable in providing SLA performance reports...|$|R
