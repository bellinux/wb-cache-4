25|$|Adjuvant therapy, {{which refers}} to therapy given after a primary surgery, has not {{been found to be}} {{beneficial}} in renal cell cancer. Conversely, neoadjuvant therapy is administered before the intended primary or main treatment. In some cases neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to decrease the size and stage of the RCC to then allow it to be surgically removed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> form of treatment and the effectiveness of this approach is still being assessed in clinical trials.|$|E

The University also has a large sports complex on the Garscube Estate, beside their Wolfson Halls and Vet School. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> facility, replacing the previous Westerlands sports ground in the Anniesland area of the city, which was sold for housing. The University also has use of half of the East Boathouse situated at Glasgow Green on the River Clyde where Glasgow University Boat Club train.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} {{of a new}} life means changing and adapting. Beginning freshmen enter a new phase that affects the way they eat. They are unaware of their nutrition and they only want something from what they see. High school {{is very different from}} what college is. Students transition from being in small classroom into big lecture rooms. The same goes for food, they transition from being served in cafeterias to buffet styles in college. Dining centers excite new students because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> experience, therefore they grab more than what they should. It’s something new and it’s what they’re paying for.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{also conducted}} other works tasks which included an upgrade of the Rundu air base (construction {{of a movement}} facility and helipads), construction of a school building {{for one of the}} local schools, and the upgrade and maintenance of roads and hard-stands in the area. The second rotation returned to Australia in February 1990. The squadron for their efforts in Namibia received many letters of commendation and appreciation including in 2012 the award of the first Honour Distinction. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> (2012) award that provides recognition for outstanding service in operations in other than declared theatres of war.|$|E

25|$|His old {{opinions}} about parliamentary reform seem still {{to cling to}} him—the only decided observation he ever made when the Bill was first explained {{to him and he}} said, ‘Well <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> constitution’ and though he is of course very anxious for the success of your administration I am not at all clear that he is equally anxious for the measure upon which that success depends. The truth is that he never yielded at all upon the question till my own opinions had become very strong and perfectly unchangeable, and, even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that he could be reconciled to my supporting the question.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{production}} restart, the U.S. Navy is expected to fall short of its requirement for 94 destroyer or cruiser platforms capable of missile defense starting in FY 2025 and continuing past {{the end of the}} 30-year planning window. While <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> requirement as of 2011, and the U.S. Navy has never had so many large missile-armed surface combatants, the relative success of the Aegis ballistic missile defense system has shifted this national security requirement onto the U.S. Navy. The shortfall will arise as older platforms that have been refitted to be missile-defense-capable (particularly the cruisers) are retired in bulk before new destroyers are planned to be built.|$|E
25|$|The total uptake and {{delivery}} amount in COF-102 and COF-103 outperform other 2D and 3D-COFs at high pressure, even the benchmark MOF-177. In October 2011, new COFs with better delivery amount {{have been shown}} to be stable and overcome the DOE target in delivery basis. COF-103-Eth-trans and COF-102-Ant, are found to exceed the DOE target of 180 v(STP)/v at 35 bar for methane storage. Thus at 35 bar (in v(STP)/v delivery units) the best performers is COF-103-Eth-trans which stores 5.6 times as much as bulk CH4 at the same pressure (bulk CH4 reaches 34). All the designed COFs have superior performance to previously reported COFs and MOFs, such as COF-102 (137), MOF-177 (112), and MOF-200 (81 v(STP)/v delivery units). The new materials were designed for best performance at 35 bar. They reported that using thin vinyl bridging groups aid performance by minimizing the interaction methane-COF at low pressure. This can be extended to MOFs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> feature that can be used to enhance loading in addition to the common practice of adding extra fused benzene rings.|$|E

500|$|The Cleveland premiere on {{the evening}} of April 20, 1953 saw a {{distinguished}} crowd turn out. When the stage backdrop failed to come down on time, Hammerstein was heard to mutter, [...] "Damn and damn and damn! <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> way: they saved it for the performance!" [...] Nevertheless, the crowd gave the show a rousing welcome. The Cleveland critics thought well of the show, but were concerned about the weak story. After the Cleveland reactions and problems, according to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, [...] "what had seemed to be a show needing minor adjustments became a musical in serious trouble". Bigley remembered that she had just come from a hit and [...] "there just wasn't the same energy". Hammerstein had intended to omit the overture, with the audience to watch, after the curtain rose, a blank stage on which the play-within-the-play performers and crew drifted in and began their preparations. Expecting the orchestra to begin the evening, the audience talked throughout the initial scenes before being quieted by the internal show's overture; in response, the duo abandoned Hammerstein's concept and opened with an overture.|$|E
