5|$|Ants of this genus are eurychoric; {{they have}} a {{widespread}} geographic distribution in many different climates, but they are usually found in dry and mesic habitats. They {{are referred to as}} a tropical genus, but the type specimen was collected from temperate Sydney. They are found in sclerophyll woodland and forests, eucalypt woodland, Casuarina forests, mallee, hillsides, beaches and urban areas. These ants are arboreal ants and nests are located in bark, logs, rotten wood, sand, soil, under rocks and stones, tree stumps and twigs or branches. In urban areas, colonies are found under cracked paths, inside house walls or in patio areas. Some species are considered pests, and they forage into pastures and houses where they show a preference for fluids and sweets. Ochetellus flavipes nesting habits are unique among Australian ants, and they construct small runways across the ground. These nests are structurally similar to nests built by some Polyrhachis ants, which construct platforms woven from plants that house the Hemiptera insects <b>they</b> <b>attend</b> to.|$|E

The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.|$|E
