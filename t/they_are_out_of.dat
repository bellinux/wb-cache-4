5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing the best time) for the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles begin at the centre of the scree, and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes off the screen, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a set number of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version retains the console sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|E

25|$|In September 1953 the General Headquarters orders Unit 101 {{to drive}} Bedouins {{out from the}} Negev and push them southward to Sinai. Unit 101 {{soldiers}} act aggressively: they raid the Bedouin camp, shooting aimlessly, confiscating arms and burning tents. The Bedouins run away, leaving many wounded behind. For a few days Unit 101 pursuits the Bedouins until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Negev.|$|E
25|$|Law 30: Batsman out {{of his/her}} ground. The batsmen can be run out or stumped if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their ground. A batsman {{is in his}} ground if any part of him or his bat {{is on the ground}} behind the popping crease. If both batsman {{are in the middle of}} the pitch when a wicket is put down, the batsman closer to that end is out.|$|E
25|$|Holiday Housecheck {{is a free}} student-run service run by the Alma Mater Society that {{operates}} during the Winter and Summer breaks. Participants have their mail collected and regular exterior inspections conducted on their homes while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Kingston. Staff ensure doors are closed and locked, windows are closed and intact, snow is stomped down, and examine the premise for signs of break-in. The program typically reaches its capacity of 200 homes each year.|$|E

50|$|He {{was found}} guilty of violating the fish and game laws by taking {{partridge}} and quail when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> season. In January 1908, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division upheld the verdict, and Banks had to pay $648.76 in damages and costs.|$|R
25|$|Porous bass trap {{absorbers}} {{need to be}} {{very thick}} to be effective at lower frequencies so they tend to be allocated either as diagonal wedges in the corners or as thick rectangular bulk behind false walls where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way and less likely to disrupt higher frequencies or room function. Air gap behind a porous panel absorber e.g. straddling a corner also helps to ensure it protrudes more into the room where there is more air velocity, improving its velocity-based absorption and extending its bandwidth while inducing some ripple in its absorption spectrum. Resonant bass trap absorbers need to be at a pressure maximum and tend to be thinner, so they are more conveniently and effectively positioned flat against a wall in a corner where the pressure is maximum, rather than straddling a corner where there is more velocity.|$|E
500|$|Aided by Gilmer's findings, Stan Love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on May 17, 1990. A {{press conference}} with Stan at the lectern {{featured}} an unexpected appearance from Brian. While {{reading from a}} piece of paper, Brian was given a microphone and said: [...] "I {{have heard of the}} charges made by Stan Love, and I think they are outrageous, which means <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ballpark... I feel great." [...] Audree, Carl, Carnie, and Wendy Wilson then contested Landy's control of Brian, pursuing legal action on May 7, 1991. The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet. In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday.|$|E
500|$|The poem centres on {{humanity}} and human nature. When the poet sees the figures, {{he wants to}} know their names and laments his ignorance. Eventually, he realizes that they are representative of Love, Ambition, and Poetry. While he longs, he fears <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach and therefore tries to reject them. He argues that love is what he needs least and dismisses it by questioning what [...] "love" [...] actually means ("What is Love? and where is it?"). He rejects ambition, but it requires more work ("And for that poor Ambition—it springs / From a man's little heart's short fever-fit;"). Unlike the personas of Love and Ambition, the narrator is unable to find a reason to banish Poesy (Poetry), which reflects the poets' inner conflict: should he abandon poetry to focus on a career in which he can earn a decent living? Keats's sought to write great poetry but feared his pursuit of literary prominence was based on a delusional view of his own merit as a poet. Further, he was incapable of completing his epic, [...] "Hyperion". As Walter Jackson Bate explains, to Keats [...] "Neither a finished 'grand Poem' nor even the semblance of a modest financial return seemed nearer." ...|$|E
50|$|In his {{original}} appearance, Paragon would lose someone's power {{as soon as}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his range. In his recent appearances, {{he was able to}} prolong the time he retains an ability {{through the use of a}} special high-tech suit of his own design.|$|R
50|$|On 24 February 1905, the {{two halves}} of the tunnel came together. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{alignment}} by only 202 mm horizontally and 87 mm vertically. Construction time was 7½ years, rather than 5½ years, due to problems such as water inflows and strikes.|$|R
50|$|Not {{long after}} issuing the CDs, Link Records went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business. There <b>was</b> {{a demand for}} APB's music in CD format but no supply. Fans searched in vain for {{downloads}} or CDs of the band's music, {{but to no avail}} as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print.|$|R
2500|$|... the two {{waves are}} in phase and they {{interfere}} constructively. When it is zero, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> phase and interfere destructively. Beats occur also in more complex sounds, or in sounds of different volumes, though calculating them mathematically {{is not so}} easy.|$|E
2500|$|Winds also drive {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the bay. In the winter, winds come from the northwest, helping move water towards the bay's mouth; in the summer, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the southwest and move water towards {{the head of the}} bay. [...] Wind-driven waves of over [...] also help mix surface waters.|$|E
2500|$|Since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the plane}} of the atoms, these orbitals can {{interact}} with each other freely, and become delocalized. This means that, instead of being tied to one atom of carbon, each electron is shared by all six in the ring. Thus, there are not enough electrons to form double bonds on all the carbon atoms, but the [...] "extra" [...] electrons strengthen all of the bonds on the ring equally. The resulting molecular orbital is considered to have π symmetry.|$|E
25|$|After Hull surrendered, the 1,600 Ohio militia {{from his}} army were paroled and were escorted south until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> danger of {{attack from the}} natives. Most of the Michigan militia had already deserted. The 582 American regulars were sent as prisoners to Quebec City.|$|R
50|$|The Highland {{managed to}} sell all six {{locomotives}} to the Caledonian Railway, and {{legend has it}} that they made a profit of £500 per engine in the process. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> gauge to the 'Caley' as well, but the modifications required were slight and quickly made.|$|R

2500|$|Agoraphobia {{patients}} can experience sudden panic attacks when traveling {{to places where}} they fear <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control, help {{would be difficult to}} obtain, or they could be embarrassed. During a panic attack, epinephrine is released in large amounts, triggering the body's natural fight-or-flight response. A panic attack typically has an abrupt onset, building to maximum intensity within 10 to 15 minutes, and rarely lasts longer than 30 minutes. [...] Symptoms of a panic attack include palpitations, rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tightness in the throat, and shortness of breath. Many patients report a fear of dying or of losing control of emotions and/or behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|Today, athletes {{compete in}} the pole vault {{as one of the}} four jumping events in track and field. Because the high jump and pole vault are both {{vertical}} jumps, the competitions are conducted similarly. Each athlete can choose what height they would like to enter the competition. Once they enter, they have three attempts to clear the height. If a height is cleared, the vaulter advances to the next height, where they will have three more attempts. Once the vaulter has three consecutive misses, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the competition and the highest height they cleared is their result. A [...] "no height", often denoted [...] "NH", refers to the failure of a vaulter to clear any bar during the competition.|$|E
2500|$|Equipment {{failures}} and periodic maintenance on the agency's Colorado Railcar DMUs resulted in TriMet substituting buses for some runs {{on several occasions}} since the service began. To provide backup equipment for the line, TriMet purchased two Budd Company Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) from the Alaska Railroad in 2009. The cars were originally built in 1953, and had {{been taken out of}} service in 2008. TriMet refurbished the cars, and planned to operate them as a backup for the Colorado Railcar units when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service. They entered service on January 24, 2011. [...] Trimet bought two more Budd RDCs of the same model they got from the Alaska Railroad in 2017 from Allearth, LLC [...] [...] As of early September 2017 they have not entered service yet.|$|E
25|$|The Fighting Irish snapped their {{losing streak}} {{with a win}} at UCLA but then lost to Boston College and USC to fall to 1–7.

50|$|After night fell, two squads {{of guards}} entered the prison {{to locate and}} rescue the captive officers. There was a long-standing rule at Alcatraz that no guns were allowed in the cellhouse, and the prison {{officials}} did not want more guards injured or killed. The convicts' position {{on the top of}} a cell block provided a nearly impregnable firing position as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range of the guards in the gun cages.|$|R

2500|$|Bert, {{a man of}} many professions, {{introduces}} the audience to Cherry Tree Lane ("Chim Chim Cher-ee/Cherry Tree Lane- Part 1") in Edwardian London. Number 17 is where the Banks family lives: George and Winifred Banks, their two naughty children Jane and Michael, their cook, Mrs. Brill and their odd-job man, Robertson Ay. Things are not going well for Jane and Michael. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control and, as the show starts, their latest nanny, Katie Nanna, storms out. After that, Mrs. Brill and Robertson Ay complain about living in a [...] "madhouse." [...] The children decide to write the advertisement for a new nanny ("The Perfect Nanny"), but George, having a very different idea of what constitutes the perfect nanny, tears up {{the piece of paper}} and throws it in the fireplace. Within moments, Mary Poppins arrives, restored advertisement in hand, and takes charge of the Banks children, having every confidence in her own qualifications and merits ("Practically Perfect").|$|E
2500|$|I {{reviewed}} {{my whole}} work in collecting indemnity and they [...] fully approved and {{are prepared to}} defend the course taken. The correspondents who have written {{were all in the}} dark, and had made no proper inquiries. I have invited correspondents to come and see what was being done, but they did not come. I have been very unjustly treated by these writers, and my friends are coming to the front in defense, as all the missions have done the same things, and all believe they are right. So also does Mr. Conger, who is our good friend. Do not be disturbed by anything you see in the papers. The correspondents jump on to the missionaries when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> matter, and news has been very scarce this winter. Dr. Sheffield thinks it better for the work that I return home now than wait a little longer and make my class reunion in 1902.|$|E
2500|$|The primary law {{enforcement}} agency in the town is the Oro Valley Police Department, headed by Chief of Police Daniel G. Sharp. [...] As of 2014, the OVPD employed 100 sworn police officers, or 2.43 officers per 1,000 citizens. [...] In 2006, Oro Valley ranked #1 in the State of Arizona for the lowest levels of both violent crime and property crime, among cities with populations of 5,000+. [...] It was also ranked #1 every year from 2001 through 2006 in either category or both. [...] The OVPD has received national recognition for being {{one of only a}} few communities in the country where police officers are present at every public school and some private schools. [...] The OVPD holds many community events on a monthly basis, such as the Dispose-A-Med program where citizens can dispose of unused or expired prescription medications, the Shred-A-Thon where citizens can securely dispose of sensitive documents and records, Digital Child Identification which provides parents with a [...] "biographical docket" [...] of their child's information, the Citizen's Police Academy to increase the public knowledge of the Oro Valley Police Department, and the Darkhouse program where homeowners can request that police members check their vacant residences while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> town.|$|E
