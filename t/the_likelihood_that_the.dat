Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the predator that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group.

5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E

25|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing.

Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> illness is pertussis.

40|$|Psychological {{research}} on behavior has waned in recent decades. One underappreciated {{reason for this}} trend is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> field lacks a general-purpose framework targeted {{to the study of}} behavior. This chapter presents one such framework, a metatheory called the I 3 Model (pronounced “I-cubed model”), which suggests that all behavior emerges from a combination of three orthogonal processes. Instigation encompasses the effects of exposure to a particular target object in a particular context that normatively affords a certain behavior. Impellance encompasses the effects of situational or stable factors <b>that</b> increase <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> (or <b>the</b> intensity with which) the individual enacts the behavior when encountering that target object in that context. Inhibition encompasses the effects of situational or stable factors <b>that</b> increase <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> (or <b>the</b> extent to which) people will override the effects of instigation and impellance on behavior, thereby reducing its enactment. According to “Perfect Storm Theory, ” which is derived from the I 3 Model, <b>the</b> highest <b>likelihood</b> or intensity of behavior emerges when instigation and impellance are strong and inhibition is weak. The generativity and integrative potential of the I 3 Model and Perfect Storm Theory are illustrated with novel reviews of the aggression and eating behavior literatures...|$|R

25|$|GABA {{produces}} {{its normal}} inhibitory effects on cell activity by reducing a neuron’s firing rate.

This hyperpolarization decreases <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> membrane will send an action potential to neighboring neurons; the difference of charge across the membrane has increased, while it would need to decrease {{in order to reach}} the threshold charge necessary to propagate an action potential.|$|E

A promising approach for ricin is to use the non-toxic B subunit (a lectin) as a vehicle for delivering antigens into cells, thus greatly increasing their immunogenicity. Use of ricin as an adjuvant has potential implications for developing mucosal vaccines.|$|E

50|$|The {{selection}} of team members follows {{one of two}} settings: First Five Picks, which allows each player to select their team members freely, or Full Draft, which forces each player to select their team members {{one at a time}} in an alternating fashion. Each potential team member, including younger versions of Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie, is ranked according to five statistics operating on a 1 to 10 scale. These include Inside Shooting (the relative accuracy of the character’s shot from inside the three-point line), Outside Shooting (the relative accuracy of the character’s shot from beyond the three-point line), Ballhandling (<b>the</b> relative <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character will not have the ball stolen or blocked on offense), Defense (<b>the</b> relative <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character will be able to steal or block the ball on defense), and Quickness (the relative speed at which the character moves along the court). Players also have the option to customize rookie characters with either manually chosen or randomly allocated statistics, as well as heights, skin tones, shooting hands, birthdays, and names. Although rookie characters generally have lower overall statistics compared to pre-rendered players, they have the additional ability to increase all of their statistics by three levels should the player’s team make the playoffs in Season Play.|$|R
