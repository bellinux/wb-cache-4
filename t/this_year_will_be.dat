2500|$|In 1916 {{the young}} {{engineer}} Louis Waldman was approached {{at a meeting}} of his Socialist Party branch and was drafted into becoming a candidate of the party for the New York State Assembly. Although he protested that between his engineering job and his evening studies of law he had no time for campaigning, the party official approaching him smiled and replied, [...] "Campaigning? Who said anything about campaigning? We just want someone to run for office. If you get more than seven hundred votes we'll be lucky. The real campaigns <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> for Meyer London and Morris Hillquit." [...] And thus was born a Socialist Party politician. Waldman did actually campaign, however, mounting the platform to give public speeches, at which he gradually improved. Waldman performed well in the 1916 election, tripling the Socialist tally while losing to his Democratic opponent by a few hundred votes.|$|E
2500|$|Rosenqvist {{said that}} despite taking {{a year away}} from Formula Three, he had one {{objective}} heading into the race but {{was aware of the}} danger of the track. He felt the Pirelli tyres would change the event's aspect drastically but aimed to win the race: [...] "The competition in Macau is always super strong, and <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> no exception. I think really the only one missing is [...] Lance Stroll, but other than that it's as competitive as it could get." [...] Félix da Costa stated he was returning to Macau because of its iconic status and still had knowledge of the track despite having not driven on the circuit in the last four years. When asked if he felt he could achieve the victory, he replied [...] "yes and no" [...] because of not having had experience in Formula Three cars for the previous three years, but said he would give it an attempt and would be pleased to secure a top-five finishing position. The track's fastest lap record holder Sérgio Sette Câmara said it was [...] "amazing" [...] to compete in the event, revealing that he would carry the experience he had from the previous year and was confident in his car's set-up.|$|E

6000|$|... "When I {{moved in}} here three years ago," [...] {{continued}} Jake, [...] "they met {{me and told}} me to get out. I told 'em I weren't takin' a back track that year. One night they rode down a-whoopin' and a-shoutin', and I natcherly poked my gun out'n the winder and handed out a few to 'em--an' they rode off. Next year quite a little squad o' truck farmers moved into the bend just below, an' we got together and talked it over and agreed to stand by. We planted two more o' them, and they got one on us. They control the courts, and so we have got to fight. They've got a judge that suits 'em now, and <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> hot--it will, sure." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes; in our '62 diaries, I fear we may {{all of us}} {{make some}} of the '61 entries. There is my friend Freehand, for instance. (Aha! Master Freehand, how you will laugh to find {{yourself}} here!) F. is {{in the habit of}} spending a little, ever so little, more than his income. He shows you how Mrs. Freehand works, and works (and indeed Jack Freehand, if you say she is an angel, you don't say too much of her); how they toil, and how they mend, and patch, and pinch; and how they CAN'T live on their means. And I very much fear--nay, I will bet him half a bottle of Gladstone 14s. per dozen claret--that the account which is a little on the wrong side <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a little on the wrong side in the next ensuing year of grace.|$|E
6000|$|So, {{the freight}} on these bars {{probably}} averaged {{something more than}} $25 each. Small shippers paid two per cent. There were three stages a day, each way, and I have seen the out-going stages carry away {{a third of a}} ton of bullion each, and more than once I saw them divide a two-ton lot and take it off. However, these were extraordinary events. [Mr. Valentine, Wells Fargo's agent, has handled all the bullion shipped through the Virginia office for many a month. To his memory--which is excellent--we are indebted for the following exhibit of the company's business in the Virginia office since the first of January, 1862: From January 1st to April 1st, about $270,000 worth of bullion passed through that office, during the next quarter, $570,000; next quarter, $800,000; next quarter, $956,000; next quarter, $1,275,000; and for the quarter ending on the 30th of last June, about $1,600,000. Thus {{in a year and a}} half, the Virginia office only shipped $5,330,000 in bullion. During the year 1862 they shipped $2,615,000, so we perceive the average shipments have more than doubled in the last six months. This gives us room to promise for the Virginia office $500,000 a month for the year 1863 (though perhaps, judging by the steady increase in the business, we are under estimating, somewhat). This gives us $6,000,000 for the year. Gold Hill and Silver City together can beat us--we will give them $10,000,000. To Dayton, Empire City, Ophir and Carson City, we will allow an aggregate of $8,000,000, which is not over the mark, perhaps, and may possibly be a little under it. To Esmeralda we give $4,000,000. To Reese River and Humboldt $2,000,000, which is liberal now, but may not be before the year is out. So we prognosticate that the yield of bullion <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> about $30,000,000. Placing the number of mills in the Territory at one hundred, this gives to each the labor of producing $300,000 in bullion during the twelve months. Allowing them to run three hundred days in the year (which none of them more than do), this makes their work average $1,000 a day. Say the mills average twenty tons of rock a day and this rock worth $50 as a general thing, and you have the actual work of our one hundred mills figured down [...] "to a spot"--$1,000 a day each, and $30,000,000 a year in the aggregate.--Enterprise. [A considerable over estimate--M. T.]] ...|$|E
