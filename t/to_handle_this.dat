5|$|In early 2009, McCann {{received}} a brief {{to create a}} new campaign for the latest entrant into the Halo series, a first-person shooter called Halo 3: ODST. It would be the first game in the franchise not to feature the series' protagonist, the Master Chief. McCann returned with a pitch for a campaign in the same vein as Believe, aiming to humanize the soldiers featured in the Halo universe. The project was greenlit, and McCann brought back several collaborators from Believe <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> new campaign, now given the working title of The Life.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E

5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E

In this paper, we compare two approaches <b>to</b> <b>handling</b> <b>this</b> problem. The first approach involves using different time steps for different particles {{in relation to}} their dynamical time scales, leading to an algorithm that is challenging to parallelize effectively. An alternative approach, using a single, uniformly small time step for all particles, leads to more computation, but is simpler to parallelize.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Whenever the {{characteristics}} of a service grid environment are addressed, issues related to openness and dynamism pop out first. Such issues do affect the definition and handling of application exceptions, and traditional approaches <b>to</b> exception <b>handling</b> lack in proper mechanisms for capturing exception semantics and <b>handling</b> exceptions. In <b>this</b> paper, after analyzing the newly arisen problems of exception handling in a service grid environment, we focus on exceptions caused by runtime mismatches between user’s requests and underlying services, and propose a semantics-based approach <b>to</b> <b>handling</b> <b>this</b> kind of exceptions. The approach was first developed within the FLAME 2008 project and some promising results have been achieved. ...|$|R

He also contacted Wang Jingwei and asked him back to China to take charge of the KMT, and sent two armies marching to Xi'an to fight against Zhang's army. Soong went to Xi'an in person for peace talks and succeeded in rescuing Chiang. When Chiang came back, he distrusted He again.
