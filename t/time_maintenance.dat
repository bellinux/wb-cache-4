5|$|NY132A was a suffixed {{route of}} NY132 {{in the town}} of Yorktown. When it was {{initially}} assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY132A was an alternate route of NY132 along Mohansic Avenue and Baldwin Road, providing access from NY132 to Mohansic State Park. Part of Mohansic Avenue was demolished in the early 1930s {{to make way for the}} Taconic State Parkway, splitting the route into two pieces. The western segment was removed from the state highway system while the eastern stub remained designated as NY132A. NY132 was truncated to Yorktown in the early 1940s, separating it from NY132A; however, NY132A was not renumbered or otherwise altered. The route remained in existence until the mid-1970s, at which <b>time</b> <b>maintenance</b> of Mohansic Avenue and Baldwin Road was transferred to the town of Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|The second boom in Death Valley was tourism, {{started in}} the 1920s by Herman Eichbaum. After several {{failures}} in getting a toll road approved from Lida, Nevada or over Towne Pass, he scaled back plans to include only {{the part of the}} latter route between southeast of Darwin and his resort at Stovepipe Wells. The new Eichbaum Toll Road was certified complete on May 4, 1926, and toll rates were set: $2 per motor vehicle and 50¢ per person. In 1933, the state legislature added many roads to the state highway system, including a new (unsigned) Route 127, connecting Tipton with Baker via Lone Pine and Death Valley Junction. The Death Valley National Monument was created on February 11, 1933, and in December 1934 the Division of Highways paid $25,000 for the 30.35-mile (48.84km) road, giving the 17 miles (27km) east of the park boundary at the pass to the National Park Service. The state Division of Highways and National Park Service soon paved the route from Lone Pine (on US 395) through Towne Pass and Death Valley to Baker (on US 91). The work was completed in October 1937, including the 17.5-mile (18km) Darwin cutoff that bypassed Darwin and the old toll road west of Panamint Springs. The National Park Service, using Civilian Conservation Corps labor, maintained the road through the park until August 1942, when an 11-mile (18km) stretch east of the valley was washed out by a storm. At that <b>time,</b> <b>maintenance</b> was given back to the state, which rebuilt the destroyed segment.|$|E

500|$|The [...] highway {{opened in}} 1833 as a toll road named the Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike. The turnpike {{had only one}} toll gate, located {{near the center of}} the route. Two years later, the turnpike commissioners petitioned to the state of New York, asking for {{permission}} to replace the single gate with two gates at opposite ends of the turnpike that would collect half of the toll amount. The commissioners believed that the change in the toll gate locations would result in higher revenue, allowing them to continue maintaining the highway. The change was approved; however, the toll road was dissolved anyway three years later on March30, 1838. At that <b>time,</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the Port Kent–Hopkinton highway was transferred to the towns it ran through.|$|E

500|$|The road {{connecting}} the ferry landing at Chimney Point {{to the town}} center of Addison was designated as VTF-7 ca. 1927. The ferry crossed Lake Champlain into Port Henry. VTF-7 was extended eastward to US7 in New Haven by 1929. In 1929, the Champlain Bridge opened, connecting Chimney Point to Crown Point. By the following year, the segment of VTF-7 west of VT30A (now VT22A) in Addison was renumbered to VT17, which now began on the Champlain Bridge at the New York state line. In 1933, all of VT17 and the portion of VTF-7's former routing between Addison and New Haven {{were added to the}} state highway system. Prior to this <b>time,</b> <b>maintenance</b> of both roads was performed by the towns through which they passed. VT17 was subsequently extended eastward to New Haven along VTF-7's former routing. As part of the 1935 state highway expansion, additional mileage was added to VT17, which was extended [...] to VT116 in Bristol.|$|E
30|$|An {{efficient}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>time</b> measurement methodology {{plays an}} important role in early stage of the maintainability design.

500|$|As well as training, {{over the}} course of No.1OCU's {{existence}} its aircrews flew operational sorties involving naval cooperation, aerial photography, target towing and radar targeting, and participated in exercises in Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand. [...] During runway upgrades at Amberley in mid-1962, the unit was based for a month at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. Later that year, it briefly maintained a detachment at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland. On 11September 1964, one of its Canberras was intercepted by a Sabre fighter of No.76 Squadron based at RAAF Base Darwin, Northern Territory, as part of Operation Handover, a little-known contingency plan put into effect during Konfrontasi to guard against possible attack by Indonesian forces following the recent establishment of the Federation of Malaysia. No.1OCU suffered a fatal accident on 16February 1965, when a Canberra Mk.21 ran off the runway and crashed at Amberley, killing both crew members. The unit was made independent of No.82 Wing in April 1968. Its role from then on was to provide trained crews solely for No.2 Squadron, which was on active duty in the Vietnam War. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>maintenance</b> responsibilities for the Canberras transferred from No.482 Squadron to No.1 OCU, along with relevant staff and equipment. Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons effectively ceased operations while their crews underwent conversion to the General Dynamics F-111C, expected to enter service soon afterwards. Delivery of the F-111s was delayed, so Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons began operating leased F-4E Phantoms as an interim strike force in 1970.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to World War I, the Imperial Japanese Army {{was largely}} {{equipped}} with Krupp cannons from Germany. After the Versailles Treaty, the Japanese Army {{switched to the}} French Schneider company, and developed the Type 90 75 mm field gun loosely based on the Schneider et Cie Canon de 85 mle 1927. However, the Schneider design was very complex and expensive to build, requiring very tight dimensional tolerances which were {{beyond the limits of}} Japanese industry to sustain at the <b>time.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> was also difficult to sustain in front line combat service. The Army Technical Bureau, following combat experience gained in the invasion of Manchuria and the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars reverted to a simpler and more rugged design for the Type 95 field gun, which entered production in 1935. The Type 95 75mm gun has an appearance similar to the Model 90 75mm gun. It is derived from the Model 1933 Schneider 75, which it closely resembles. [...] However, only a total of 261 units were produced, and the Type 38 75 mm field gun and the Type 41 75 mm cavalry gun continued to be used by front line combat units until the surrender of Japan.|$|E

40|$|Elaborate {{secondary}} sexual traits, {{such as the}} ornamental plumage of birds, may be {{favored by}} female choice because they serve as honest indicators of male quality. Elaborate traits {{are thought to be}} honest signals because they are expensive to produce and increase predation risk. Here we investigate another potential cost of elaborate traits, i. e., the time and energy required to maintain them in good condition. We tested the hypothesis that species of birds with ornamental plumage invest more <b>time</b> in <b>maintenance</b> behavior than do related species without such plumage. To test the hypothesis we quantified the maintenance behavior of nine ornamental and nine non-ornamental species in aviaries and zoos. To test the validity of using captive birds, we first collected data on 12 captive species for which data from wild individuals were also available. The <b>maintenance</b> <b>times</b> of captive and wild individuals were highly correlated across species. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>time</b> was also correlated with plumage length, independent of body size. Ornamental species had longer plumage than non-ornamental species, and they devoted significantly more <b>time</b> to <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Time</b> spent on <b>maintenance</b> cannot be devoted to other activities. This temporal trade-off reinforces the honesty of ornamental plumage. We suggest that high maintenance handicaps are present in a variety of animals.
