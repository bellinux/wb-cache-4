5|$|In April 2008, Arafiles {{arrived at}} WCMH. He {{had earned a}} medical degree in the Philippines {{before coming to the}} United States; he {{continued}} his training in Baltimore and Buffalo. Texas issued a medical license to him in 1998. The year before Arafiles came to Winkler County, the TMB restricted his ability to supervise nurse practitioners and physician assistants for three years and fined him $1,000. In that case, the TMB expressed concerns about the manner in which he oversaw a physician assistant at a weight loss clinic and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> applied the clinic's patient care protocols.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The end result of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E
5|$|Starr and {{his wife}} left on 1 March, after a ten-day stay; McCartney left after one month due to other commitments; Lennon and Harrison stayed about six weeks, then left {{abruptly}} following financial disagreements and rumours of inappropriate behaviour by the Maharishi. Harrison later apologised for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Lennon had treated the Maharishi, and he gave a benefit concert in 1992 for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party. In 2009, McCartney and Starr performed at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation, which raises funds for the teaching of Transcendental Meditation to at-risk students.|$|E

25|$|Catiline {{spoke with}} an eloquence that demanded loyalty from his {{followers}} and strengthened the resolve of his friends. Without doubt Catiline possessed {{a degree of}} courage that few have, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died is considered a particularly honorable death in Roman society. Unlike most Roman generals of the late republic, Catiline offered himself to his followers both as a general and as a soldier on the front lines.|$|E
25|$|Whether Tobias had {{an affair}} with Claire is not certain; however, his {{infidelity}} is. Claire knows about an affair that Tobias had with a young woman, but she has never told Agnes about it. Claire only uses the information to taunt Tobias. Some critics have suggested that the young anonymous woman with whom Tobias had the affair was actually Claire. Despite all this, Tobias appears secure in his marriage with Agnes, even though they have not shared the same bed for many years. Their marriage seems to have become something of a habit. Tobias shows very little affection to his wife except in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> reinforces her thoughts, giving her assurances, for instance, that she, of all people, should not worry about going mad.|$|E
25|$|Joan {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} at Dourdan in the {{aftermath}} of the Parlement acquittal amidst suggestions that she might also have been having an adulterous affair herself, but enjoyed the continuing support of her husband, Philip. Philip campaigned for her release, which was forthcoming the next year and Joan returned to court. It is unclear why Philip stood by her in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did. One theory has been that he was concerned that if he was to abandon Joan, he might also lose Burgundy, which he had gained through their marriage; another theory suggests that he was in truth very deeply in love with her. With the death after a few days of the baby King John I of France, Joan served as Philip's queen consort for several years; after Philip's death, she inherited the County of Artois from her mother and finally died in 1330.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{publication}} of Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, Sheldrake invited Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as {{an explanation for the}} dog's behaviour, and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from experimental design, and post hoc analysis of unpublished data. The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window. Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did for shorter absences.|$|E

500|$|Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, co-authors of the book, The Pocket Essential Tintin, {{described}} Hergé's {{depiction of}} Castafiore {{in the story}} as [...] "a force of nature", praising <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> depicted her many outfit changes. They described Mr Bolt as being both a [...] "Godot-like character" [...] and as being akin to Basil Fawlty from the British sitcom Fawlty Towers, while adding that the broken step acts [...] "like a Greek God's curse" [...] in the story that affects everyone except Castafiore.|$|E
500|$|The Temple of Set is {{far more}} rooted in esoteric ideas than the Church of Satan had been. It has thus been termed [...] "Esoteric Satanism", a term used to {{contrast}} it with the [...] "Rational Satanism" [...] found in LaVeyan Satanism. [...] Accordingly, it has been labelled the [...] "intellectual wing of esoteric Satanism", with the Temple presenting itself as an intellectual religion. Aquino possessed a PhD in political science and this formal education was reflected in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> presented his arguments, in which he draws broadly upon Western philosophy and science.|$|E
500|$|For the {{recording}} session, Dylan invited Mike Bloomfield from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band to play lead guitar. Invited to Dylan's Woodstock {{home for the}} weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield recalled, [...] "The first thing I heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'. I figured he wanted blues, string bending, because that's what I do. He said, 'Hey, man, I don't want any of that B.B. King stuff'. So, OK, I really fell apart. What the heck does he want?

50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{of all the}} American Dadaists, Man Ray was a highly capable and innovative artist {{in a number of}} different mediums. Born in Philadelphia, he is the {{most prominent}} native artist amongst the New York Dadaists. Man Ray's style can be said to be something of a merger of mediums; his paintings, sculptures, photographs, and various constructions appear to be intertwined manifestations of all of these mediums in one. One of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> managed to achieve this effect was with a purposefully careless looking <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> constructed his art.|$|R

40|$|As {{the author}} {{states at the}} outset, 2 ̆ 2 this book is about the {{impression}} Francis made [...] intentionally {{and in spite of}} himself [...] on contemporaries and on the early generations after his death, and <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and they expressed it. 2 ̆ 2 It makes perfect sense that such a study should focus on Francis given not only the wealth of images, textual and visual, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> inspired after his death, but <b>the</b> wonderfully creative <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> presented himself to his audiences as a preacher and an urban ascetic. Indeed, as the author observes, it was precisely Francis 2 ̆ 7 s image that 2 ̆ 2 bewitched successive generations, as it bewitched contemporaries, into thinking <b>that</b> <b>he</b> brought a new revelation with him 2 ̆ 2 when in fact his spiritual program was highly derivative...|$|R
500|$|The Puritan {{movement}} hinged {{largely on}} the notion that [...] "a holy commonwealth could be established on earth." [...] This had an important effect on what Cotton taught and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> taught it. [...] He believed that the Bible could not save souls only by being read. [...] To him, the first step in conversion was the [...] "pricking of the hardened heart" [...] of the individual by hearing the word of God. [...] In this regard, Puritanism [...] "emphasized the importance of preaching" [...] with the focus on the pulpit, [...] while Catholicism emphasized sacraments where the focus was on the altar. [...] In Puritanism, therefore, salvation required hearing sermons.|$|E
500|$|... "Phyllis' Wedding" [...] {{was written}} by staff writer Caroline Williams and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham, his fifth such credit for the series. Recurring guest stars Creed Bratton, Rashida Jones, and Bobby Ray Shafer appeared in the episode. The episode {{is the first of}} the series to revolve around a wedding. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Baumgartner described the episode, [...] "Michael plays a very important role in that wedding. He is to walk Phyllis' dad down the aisle by pushing him in a wheelchair, which in his mind is him walking Phyllis down the aisle, a very important position of authority. Of course, Phyllis has asked him to do this only so she can get six weeks of vacation time. But for him it's a place of honor, and from there, things don't go quite <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hopes." ...|$|E
500|$|Curtis asked Moffat to criticise [...] "anything and everything" [...] {{and later}} {{said he was}} very honest. Executive {{producer}} Piers Wenger and director Jonny Campbell also critiqued the script. Moffat told Curtis that it needed to [...] "start quicker" [...] and that the meeting with the Doctor and Vincent was [...] "dull" [...] {{and needed to be}} something [...] "cute" [...] like Curtis had done in his films. He also noted that the Doctor did not talk as much as Curtis had written and recommended Curtis watch some episodes to see he was [...] "rather efficient in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> talked". Curtis enjoyed the experience, commenting that it was [...] "fun" [...] to work within boundaries rather than doing it all himself. After seeing a read-through performed by leads Matt Smith and Karen Gillan, Curtis made more changes. He commented that it was easy to write for them as they were [...] "so delightful and modern and relaxed". Curtis's original title for the episode was [...] "Eyes that See the Darkness", but he said this was vetoed.|$|E

500|$|Williamson's first {{professional}} work {{may have been}} helping Hogarth pencil some Tarzan Sunday pages in 1948, although Williamson, who had initially believed so, reconsidered in a 1983 interview and recalled that his Tarzan work had come after his first two pieces of comic-book art: providing spot illustrations for the story [...] "The World's Ugliest Horse" [...] in Eastern Color's seminal series Famous Funnies #166 (May 1948), and a two-page Boy Scouts story, his first comics narrative, in New Heroic Comics #51 (Nov. 1948). (Williamson is also identified as co-penciler, with Frank Frazetta, of a three-page crime story, [...] "The Last Three Dimes", in Standard Comics' Wonder Comics #20 [...] ) Williamson explained that while Hogarth had offered him Tarzan work, Williamson [...] "just couldn't do it. ... I couldn't get it into my little brain that {{he wanted me to}} do it exactly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did it," [...] and instead successfully recommended Celardo, artist of the Tarzan-like feature [...] "Ka'a'nga" [...] in Fiction House's Jungle Comics.

500|$|Divine's mother, Frances Milstead, {{remarked that}} while Divine [...] "was blessed with many talents and abilities, {{he could be}} very moody and demanding." [...] She noted {{that while he was}} [...] "incredibly kind and generous", he always wanted to get things done <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted, and would [...] "tune you out if you displeased him." [...] She noted that in most interviews, he came across as [...] "a very shy and private person". Divine's Dutch friends gave him two bulldogs in the early 1980s, on which he doted, naming them Beatrix and Claus after Queen Beatrix and her husband Prince Claus of the Netherlands. On {{numerous}} occasions he would have his photograph taken with them and sometimes use these images for record covers and posters. Divine suffered from problems with obesity from childhood, caused by his love of food, and in later life his hunger was increased by his daily use of marijuana, an addiction that he publicly admitted to. According to Bernard Jay, in Divine's final years, when his disco career {{was coming to an end}} and he was struggling to find acting jobs, he felt suicidal and threatened to kill himself on several occasions.|$|E
500|$|Bégin's {{father taught}} his son that his {{best chance of}} making a career in hockey was as a {{defensive}} specialist and impressed on him {{the need for a}} strong work ethic. [...] He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. [...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, I really believe that there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL.
