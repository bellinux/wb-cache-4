25|$|ABC took {{an episode}} of The Morning Exchange and {{used it as a}} pilot episode. After very {{positive}} reviews for the pilot, the format replaced AM America in November 1975 as Good Morning America. The first host of the new program was David Hartman, featuring Nancy Dussault as his co-host. Dussault was replaced in 1977 by Sandy Hill. For the first seven years, weather forecasts were presented by John Coleman, former chief meteorologist for ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV in Chicago, who would leave GMA in 1982 to start The Weather Channel with Landmark Communications CEO Frank Batten. Dave Murray (now chief meteorologist at KTVI in St. Louis) provided the forecasts for both Good Morning America and ABC's early morning news program ABC News <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>from</b> 1983 to 1986. In August 1986, he was replaced by Spencer Christian, who worked at WABC-TV in New York City and served as fill-in meteorologist for both Coleman and Murray whenever they were away on vacation or assignment.|$|E

6000|$|... 'He cannot tell you, sir,' {{the widow}} interposed. 'It's {{of no use}} to ask him. We are but <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> come <b>from</b> a long {{distance}} in the country, and know nothing of these matters.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, mademoiselle," [...] {{he said in}} a tone of courtly deference. [...] "If I {{could be}} certain that you did not come here <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> only <b>from</b> a sense of duty to your mother!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Cuthbert, [...] "but {{this will}} be no common raid. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> bands <b>from</b> all the holds within miles round are riding in, and at least 500 men-at-arms are likely to do chase today." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted to}} tell you, I had a letter <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> my {{solicitor}} to say that he's just bought Crowley Castle on my behalf.|$|E
6000|$|... "Spoke {{with her}} but the once, I should have said," [...] I interrupted. [...] "I {{saw her again}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> a window at Prestongrange's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should know}} better than I," [...] Duncan answered. [...] "You {{received}} a visit <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> {{one of the two}} ladies who are staying there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... {Chalmers} (Reflecting.) Ah, it is {{more than}} that. There is a fifth side. There are the stolen letters which Madge has just <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> restolen <b>from</b> her father. Whatever {{settlement}} takes place, they must enter into it.|$|R
6000|$|The colonel {{stopped before}} one of these, and bowing deeply said, [...] "Duchess, I have the honour to present to you my compatriot, Colonel Campbell, who arrived here <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with despatches <b>from</b> the Duc d'Enghien." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{received}} {{your letter}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> (on returning <b>from</b> {{an expedition to}} a market thirteen miles away, which involved the necessity of getting up at five), and am delighted to have such good accounts of all at home.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} been {{speaking}} to Hartley," [...] said the senior partner, watching him keenly. [...] "I had a letter <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> the Trimblett family." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{could hardly}} conceal her impatience. [...] "I wish you'd {{go over it}} <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>From</b> the title it's one of those middle-age Italian things that costume well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> that American I met in Pompeii" [...] he began. [...] "He is coming northward, and I am {{going down to}} meet him in Rome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have, sir, but <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> escaped <b>from</b> {{the hands}} of the freebooters at Wolfsburg, and I come to warn you that last night I heard them agree to attack and sack your village tomorrow; therefore, before {{pursuing}} my own way, which is to the camp of the Swedish king, in whose service I am, I came hither to warn you of their intention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I fancy {{we are all}} {{feeling about}} the same except the Professor, and even {{he wants to get}} some powder for his beetle. I had a moment's talk with Craig <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>from</b> what he says I fancy they mean to make a move a little further in before long. It'll be all the more {{difficult}} to escape then." ...|$|R
60|$|The wind, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> is <b>from</b> the northwestward, rather brisk, but {{not very}} strong. There is a {{scattering}} of clouds about the sky; but the atmosphere is singularly clear, {{and we can see}} several hills of the interior, the cloud-like White Mountains, and, along the shore, the long white beaches and the dotted dwellings, with great distinctness. Many small vessels spread their wings, and go seaward.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, uncle," [...] she said. [...] "I am {{suffering}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> the malady of {{having nothing to}} do. Are you going to write to Anne? Don't. Let me write instead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know why}} I stayed," [...] he said, and paused again--rather awkwardly for Mr. Spence. But Honora was silent. [...] "I had a letter <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> my partner, Sidney Dallam, calling me back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} say that I got a formal notice <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> the duke's lawyer, saying that he meant to foreclose at once;--not from Fothergill, but from those people in South Audley Street." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir,--Your {{letter was}} not {{received}} till <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I presume <b>from</b> [...] being addressed {{to me in}} Notts., where I have not resided since last [...] June; and as the date is the 6th, you will excuse the delay of my [...] answer.|$|R
40|$|Recounts {{his recent}} {{movements}} between Bath, Haford, and London, {{where he was}} called to prevent the destruction of all the timber at Croft, which Smith may have seen advertised, but failed. Saw Sir Joseph Banks <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Received <b>from</b> Dr [James] Anderson "a lock of the golden fleece" which he supposes Smith has accounts of in the papers; it is "very curious & just the colour of raw silk, a high gold colour"...|$|R
5000|$|I {{received}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{a letter}} <b>from</b> {{the secretary of}} a Burton rowing club.Last Thursday, its senior eight were out rowing {{when members of the}} crew were seized with pains in the chest.This was caused by fumes rising from the river.

6000|$|... "I am sure I cannot {{give you}} news of your brother," [...] he said, [...] "but I {{have had a}} letter <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> Endymion. He seems to take great {{interest}} in his debating club." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I have {{a message}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> the lieutenant, {{that he will be}} here by eleven o’clock. If you will write a line to your friend I will send it over by one of the men.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I know {{one who is}} more beautiful," [...] the King said, in an undertone. [...] "I heard <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> our friends, the Van Dechts, Brand. They are {{travelling}} in Italy, and may come on here." ...|$|E
50|$|A.J. Bryant, ex-Mayor of San Francisco, {{committed}} suicide <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> by jumping <b>from</b> the ferry steamer Encinal {{just after the}} boat had started on the 9:15 trip to Oakland. Mr. Bryant was very nervous and trembling when he bought his ticket, and the gate-keeper {{appears to be the}} last man who talked with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "They do, {{and they}} can," [...] said the Stranger. [...] "The proof {{of it is}} that they are doing it. Listen. Here is an answer to my {{circular}} No. 6, Efficiency and Recompense, that came in <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It is <b>from</b> a steel firm. Listen." [...] The Stranger picked out a letter and read it.|$|R
6000|$|Forgery {{of my name}} is {{becoming}} popular. You sent me, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> a letter <b>from</b> Russell Sturgis, answering a supposed letter of mine (presented by [...] "Miss Jefferies"), and assuring me of his readiness to give not only the ten pounds I asked for, but any contribution I wanted, towards sending that lady and her family back to Boston.|$|R
6000|$|... "Naida is a {{wonderful}} woman," [...] Nigel declared enthusiastically. [...] "We lunched at Ciro's. She wore {{a black and white}} muslin gown which arrived <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> Paris. Afterwards we went down to Ranelagh and sat under the trees." ...|$|E

60|$|General Piffle's force was, I learn, {{attacked}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> {{across the}} river by the whole weight of the enemy's centre. Supports were being hurried forward. Ammunition was scarce. A feeling of anxiety, not unmixed with hope, is the rule.|$|E
5000|$|Reckless was {{reviewed}} by Andre Sennwald for The New York Times. He considered the casting as [...] "happy casting" [...] in that Harlow and Powell {{could have been}} an exciting duo. His review, however, noted [...] "It would be pleasant to report that 'Reckless' is the whirlwind comedy which such a merger would lead us to expect. But reporters are chained to facts, and <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> bulletin <b>from</b> the Capitol is mournful. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has taken the screen's liveliest comedienne and chased her through a stale and profitless meringue of backstage routines and high society amour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “A gentleman {{asked me}} <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> ‘What news <b>from</b> Lisbon?’ and I [...] answered, ‘She is exquisitely handsome.’ Another desired to know [...] ‘when I had last been at Hampton Court?’ I replied, ‘It {{will be on}} [...] Tuesday come se’nnight.’ Pr’ythee allow me at least to kiss your [...] hand before that day, that my mind may be in some composure. O Love! ...|$|R
6000|$|No! The surgeon's {{attention}} was absorbed {{in his own}} subject. There {{he was in the}} same position, with his mind still hard at work on something in Geoffrey which at once interested and puzzled it! [...] "That man," [...] he was thinking to himself, [...] "has come here <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> after traveling <b>from</b> London all night. Does any ordinary fatigue explain what I see in his face? No!" ...|$|R
