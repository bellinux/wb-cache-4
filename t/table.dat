Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a <b>table</b> called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the <b>table</b> at the same time. To complete the <b>table,</b> twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the <b>table</b> ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another <b>table</b> and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final <b>table,</b> Impact Crater.

50|$|There {{are many}} sizes and styles of pool and billiard <b>tables.</b> Generally, <b>tables</b> are {{rectangles}} {{twice as long}} as they are wide.

Full-size snooker and English billiard <b>tables</b> are 12 ft long on the longest side. Pool halls tend to have 9 ft <b>tables</b> and cater to the serious pool player.
