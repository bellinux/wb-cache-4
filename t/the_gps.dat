40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) envelope glycoproteins function as a membrane-anchored trimer of three gp 120 exterior glycoproteins and three gp 41 transmembrane glycoproteins.

Here, we applied similar approaches to stabilize soluble gp 140 trimers including <b>the</b> complete <b>gp</b> 120 and gp 41 ectodomains.
