40|$|<b>Two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flows</b> arise {{commonly}} in {{a variety}} of physical, engineering and industrial applications such as filtration, lubrication, spray process, natural gas networks and nuclear reactor cooling etc. The hydrodynamic behaviour of the <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flows</b> such as pressure drop, void fraction or velocity distribution varies in a systematic way with the observed flow patterns just as in case of a single <b>phase</b> <b>flow,</b> whose behaviour depends upon whether the flow is in the laminar or turbulent regime. Understanding the non linear complex dynamics underlying gas – liquid flows is a significant but challenging problem. The primary task is to characterize and quantify the various flow patterns that often appear complex. The identification of a flow regime automatically provides a picture of the phase boundaries. The location of phase boundaries in turn allows one to make various order of magnitude calculations using integrated forms of the momentum and continuity equations. Such calculations suggest what variables might be worth while investigating and what kind of behaviour is to be expected.

40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flow</b> systems such as high head gated conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flow</b> systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flow</b> systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flow</b> systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water.

The local saturation pressure and temperature vary substantially over {{the length of the}} channel. In order to correctly predict the local saturation temperature and subsequently the heat transfer characteristics, numerical techniques have been used in conjunction with the conventional two phase pressure drop models. The Lockhart-Martinelli (liquid-laminar, vapour-laminar) model is found to predict the two phase pressure drop data within 20 %. The instability in <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flow</b> is quantified; it is found that microchannels of smaller hydraulic diameter have lesser instabilities as compared to their larger counterparts.

Use of non-boiling <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flows</b> {{in the form of}} segmented flows {{has become one of the}} interesting methods for achieving higher cooling (or mass transfer) capacities. Segmented flows (also known as slug flows, plug flows, or Taylor flows) is a series of moving liquid segments which are separated by gas bubbles or another liquid slugs. These flows are known as gas-liquid or liquid-liquid <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flows,</b> respectively. The effective phenomenon in {{heat transfer}} enhancement is internal circulations inside the liquid slugs, which helps to mix the liquid. The main focus of the present thesis is on heat transfer of gas-liquid segmented ows, using numerical simulations based on the concepts of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). As shown in the literature review, large gaps exist in research which need further studies. The target of this research is providing details on hydrodynamics and heat transfer in gas-liquid <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> <b>flows,</b> which can be helpful in understanding the whole process better. Based on the literature reviewed, the numerical modeling can be conducted using single <b>phase</b> or <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> simulations.

Furthermore, it has been shown that liquid film around bubbles reduces the intensity of circulations in liquid slugs and hence reduces the cooling capacity. Therefore, using hydrophobic wall materials has been suggested. The key finding of the present research is how the liquid film around bubbles affects heat transfer, and it has been suggested to include this parameter in the correlations in the future. The comparison of the results with experimental data and/or exact analytical solutions throughout the thesis show good agreements...|$|R
