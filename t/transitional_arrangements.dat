25|$|Prior to 31 December 2010, {{deposits}} {{with building}} societies {{of up to}} £50,000 per individual, per institution, were normally protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), but Nationwide and Yorkshire Building Societies negotiated a temporary change {{to the terms of}} the FSCS to protect members of the societies they acquired in late 2008/early 2009. The amended terms allowed former members of multiple societies which merge into one to maintain multiple entitlements to FSCS protection until 30 September 2009 (later extended to 30 December 2010), so (for example) a member with £50,000 in each of Nationwide, Cheshire and Derbyshire {{at the time of the}} respective mergers would retain £150,000 of FSCS protection for their funds in the merged Nationwide. On 31 December 2010 the general FSCS limit for retail deposits was increased to £85,000 for banks and building societies and the <b>transitional</b> <b>arrangements</b> in respect of building society mergers came to an end.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the way {{in which}} labor is divided in the home is {{reflective}} of the work-family ideologies to which the husband and wife individually subscribe. Mary Blair-Loy identifies three of these ideologies: traditional, egalitarian, and transitional. The traditional family arrangement is the breadwinner-homemaker model of the 1950s in which women are expected to fully devote themselves to household management and childcare, while their husband’s earn the family income. The egalitarian arrangement entails that the husband and wife be equally active at home and in the workforce. The <b>transitional</b> <b>arrangement</b> allows for both husband and wife to be engaged in the workforce, with the wife taking on the bulk of the homemaking responsibilities. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild calls the additional time spent on housework “the second shift” for women. Families that adopt the <b>transitional</b> <b>arrangement</b> often utilize full-time, paid childcare because the work of both parents demands long hours, even if the wife works only part-time.|$|R
