5|$|After {{the medieval}} period, the word elf tended to become less common {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French {{into all the}} Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued {{to be associated with}} causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by <b>this</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLeonhard Euler’s <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> {{function}} as an „analytical expression“ occasionally denoted by fx is well-known. But it has gone unnoticed that Euler used a second well-defined <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> function for which he even coined a particular denotation: f:, used as f:x. In fact, <b>this</b> second <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> function is the earlier one, defined as „the ordinate which depends on the abscissa“, given by the curve. Euler argues that <b>this</b> „geometric“ <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> function is more general than the „algebraic“ one.

25|$|Some of the {{functions}} of the angakkuit can be understood in the light of <b>this</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> secrecy versus publicity. The cause of illness was usually believed to be soul theft or a breach of some taboo (such as miscarriage). Public confession (led by the shaman during a public seance) could bring relief to the patient. Similar public rituals were used in the cases of taboo breaches that endangered the whole community (bringing the wrath of mythical beings causing calamities).|$|E

25|$|Various other {{mathematical}} domains use {{the concept}} of continuity in different, but related meanings. For example, in order theory, an order-preserving function f: X → Y between particular types of partially ordered sets X and Y is continuous if for each directed subset A of X, we have sup(f(A)) = f(sup(A)). Here sup is the supremum {{with respect to the}} orderings in X and Y, respectively. <b>This</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> continuity is the same as topological continuity when the partially ordered sets are given the Scott topology.|$|E

25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that <b>this</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a study of a distinctively {{chemical}} <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> possibility. <b>This</b> is the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> possibility that occurs in chemical discourses when chemists speak of the possibility or impossibility of achieving a given result through chemical means. <b>This</b> <b>notion</b> pertains {{to the possibility of}} processes, not of compounds, so it differs from the kind of chemical possibility mentioned in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations or the kinds discussed in the literature on Putnam's Twin Earth argument. I argue that <b>this</b> process-oriented <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> possibility cannot be reduced in a simple way to physical possibility, and that standard possible worlds semantics does not allow a natural analysis <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>notion.</b> I suggest an extension of possible worlds semantics that may overcome this limitation.

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> {{parallel}} {{transport of}} tangent vectors, by affine transformations, along a curve has a characteristic feature: {{the point of}} contact of the tangent plane with the surface always moves with the curve under parallel translation (i.e., as the tangent plane is rolled along the surface, the point of contact moves). This generic condition is characteristic of Cartan connections. In more modern approaches, the point of contact is viewed as the origin in the tangent plane (which is then a vector space), {{and the movement of}} the origin is corrected by a translation, so that parallel transport is linear, rather than affine.|$|E
25|$|Another {{property}} of Git {{is that it}} snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, Source Code Control System (SCCS) and Revision Control System (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings {{to be gained from}} interleaved deltas (SCCS) or delta encoding (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained <b>this</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept. Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.|$|E
25|$|The term connotes that {{evidence}} establishes a particular {{point to a}} moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives.

Further to <b>this</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, i.e., when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of prisons}} {{can be traced}} back to the rise of the state as a form of social organization. Corresponding with the advent of the state was the {{development}} of written language, which enabled the creation of formalized legal codes as official guidelines for society. The best known of these early legal codes is the Code of Hammurabi, written in Babylon around 1750 BC. The penalties for violations of the laws in Hammurabi's Code were almost exclusively centered on the concept of lex talionis ("the law of retaliation"), whereby people were punished as a form of vengeance, often by the victims themselves. <b>This</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> punishment as vengeance or retaliation can also be found in many other legal codes from early civilizations, including the ancient Sumerian codes, the Indian Manama Dharma Astra, the Hermes Trismegistus of Egypt, and the Israelite Mosaic Law.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> {{slow cooling}} {{implemented}} in the Simulated Annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, the Simulated Annealing algorithms work as follows. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and then decides to move to it or {{to stay with the}} current solution based on either one of two probabilities between which it chooses {{on the basis of the}} fact that the new solution is better or worse than the current one. During the search, the temperature is progressively decreased from an initial positive value to zero and affects the two probabilities: at each step, the probability of moving to a better new solution is either kept to 1 or is changed towards a positive value; instead, the probability of moving to a worse new solution is progressively changed towards zero.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} {{for this new}} interpretation of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection {{are found in the}} epistles of Paul and in the Book of Acts. Most Jews view Paul as the founder of Christianity, who is responsible for the break with Judaism. Recently, Talmud scholar Daniel Boyarin has argued that Paul's theology of the spirit is more deeply rooted in Hellenistic Judaism than generally believed. In A Radical Jew Boyarin argues that Paul the Apostle combined the life of Jesus with Greek philosophy to reinterpret the Hebrew Bible in terms of the Platonic opposition between the ideal (which is real) and the material (which is false); see also Paul the Apostle and Judaism. Judaism is a corporeal religion, in which membership is based not on belief but rather descent from Abraham, physically marked by circumcision, and focusing on how to live this life properly. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal messiah. He used <b>this</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> messiah to argue for a religion through which all people — not just descendants of Abraham — could worship the God of Abraham. Unlike Judaism, which holds that it is the proper religion only of the Jews, Pauline Christianity claimed to be the proper religion for all people.|$|E
