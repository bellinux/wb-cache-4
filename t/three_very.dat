5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} {{visible to the naked}} eye, such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that {{has been found to be}} somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not visible to the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of <b>three</b> <b>very</b> hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the final}} year in a consecutive string of <b>three</b> <b>very</b> active seasons, {{although many of the}} storms were weak. It is tied with 1887, 1995, 2010, and 2011 for having the third-most named storms on record. It was also the third-costliest season, behind 2005 and 2017. The season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period during each year in which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. However, Alberto, the first system of the year, developed on May19 – the earliest date of formation since Tropical Storm Ana in 2003. A second tropical cyclone, Beryl, developed later that month. This was the first occurrence of two pre-season named storms in the Atlantic basin since 1951. It moved ashore in North Florida on May29 with winds of 65mph (100km/h), making it the strongest pre-season storm to make landfall in the Atlantic basin. This season marked the first time since 2009 where no tropical cyclones formed in July. Another record was set by Hurricane Nadine later in the season; the system became the fourth-longest-lived tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic, with a total duration of 22.25days. The final storm to form, Tony, dissipated on October25 – however, Hurricane Sandy, which formed before Tony, became extratropical on October 29.|$|E

25|$|Apparently {{adapting}} an {{idea from}} In Those Days, a 1947 German drama by Helmut Käutner that had its US premiere in March 1951, The Yellow Rolls-Royce uses a yellow 1930 Rolls-Royce Phantom II {{to frame the}} story of <b>three</b> <b>very</b> different owners: an English aristocrat, a Miami gangster and a wealthy American widow.

25|$|Between 1936 and 1938, <b>three</b> <b>very</b> large Moscow Trials {{of former}} senior Communist Party leaders were held, {{in which they}} were accused of conspiring with fascist and {{capitalist}} powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.|$|E
25|$|The noted {{director}} and producer Cheryl Crawford produced professional stock theater in Maplewood, New Jersey, for <b>three</b> <b>very</b> successful seasons. The last of these closed with Porgy and Bess, which she co-produced with John Wildberg. In re-fashioning {{it in the}} style of musical theatre which Americans were used to hearing from Gershwin, Crawford produced a drastically cut version of the opera compared with the first Broadway staging. The orchestra was reduced, the cast was halved, and many recitatives were reduced to spoken dialog.|$|E

He moved from Venice to Germany in 1500, thus becoming the first Italian Renaissance artist of stature to work in Northern Europe. His few surviving paintings (about twelve) include the first known example of trompe l'oeil since antiquity. His twenty-nine engravings and <b>three</b> <b>very</b> large woodcuts were also highly influential.|$|E
25|$|For a short period, Dravid’s {{decision}} {{looked to}} be potentially dangerous as England captured <b>three</b> <b>very</b> early wickets to leave India on 11/3, with an overall lead of 330. Dravid himself then batted in a very defensive manner, in an innings where he scored 12 from 96 deliveries. At one point, he had only scored 2 from 52 balls. However, Sourav Ganguly batted aggressively at the other end, and Laxman and Dhoni also contributed to boost India’s score, and allow Dravid to declare leaving England exactly 500 to win in 110 overs.|$|E

25|$|East of Cazenovia, US20 resumes its southward drift as it {{climbs into}} the high ground again and expands to four lanes, passing the small village of Morrisville in the process. It descends from there to its next state highway, NY46, where it reverts to two lanes for a brief concurrency, after which NY46 leaves for {{isolated}} Hamilton. The southern trend reverses itself after this junction, with first NY26 and later NY12B joining US20 to create another three-route overlap. This persists for <b>three</b> <b>very</b> straight miles until both leave to the north {{in the town of}} Madison. After another , the highway crosses into Oneida County.|$|E
25|$|<b>Three</b> <b>very</b> special {{conditions}} {{are required for}} a star to evolve {{all the way to}} a gamma-ray burst under this theory: the star must be very massive (probably at least 40 Solar masses on the main sequence) to form a central black hole in the first place, the star must be rapidly rotating to develop an accretion torus capable of launching jets, and the star must have low metallicity in order to strip off its hydrogen envelope so the jets can reach the surface. As a result, gamma-ray bursts are far rarer than ordinary core-collapse supernovae, which only require that the star be massive enough to fuse all the way to iron.|$|E
25|$|As the {{defending}} champion at the Athens Olympics, Williams lost {{in the third round}} to Mary Pierce. She then won <b>three</b> <b>very</b> close matches against Petra Mandula, Shikha Uberoi and Chanda Rubin to make the fourth round of the US Open where she lost to Davenport, {{the first time she had}} ever lost at the US Open prior to the semifinals. Williams completed the year by losing in the quarterfinals of three indoor tournaments in the fall, a period that included defeat in her first meeting with 17-year-old Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova at the Zurich Open. Williams finished the year as world no. 9 and did not qualify for the year-ending WTA Tour Championships.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 23 {{he became}} a {{professor}} at the Belgrade's Grande École, the highest educational institution in Serbia of that age. He taught political economy and wrote <b>three</b> <b>very</b> influential textbooks, two of which were based on Lorenz von Stein. In these works he demonstrated his affinity for liberal economy and influenced many later Serbian economists to take similar positions. As a professor he started campaigning in favour of building a railway through Serbia. He gained many supporters among merchants and educated men for this idea, but many opposed him in Serbia during this campaign. He was also the earliest critique of communist and socialist utopian ideas in Serbia. His translation of Henry Thomas Buckle's book History of Civilisation in England, was published in Serbian in 1871 and influenced several generations of pro-Western Serbs.|$|E
25|$|Recent cinema {{has seen}} Chinese cinematographers direct some {{acclaimed}} films. Other than Zhang Yimou, Lü Yue made Mr. Zhao (1998), a black comedy film well received abroad. Gu Changwei's minimalist epic Peacock (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with <b>three</b> <b>very</b> different siblings in the post-Cultural Revolution era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 Berlin International Film Festival. Hou Yong is another cinematographer who made films (Jasmine Women, 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing. Xu Jinglei, a popular Chinese actress, has made six movies to date. Her second film Letter from an Unknown Woman (2004) landed her the San Sebastián International Film Festival Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is Zhao Wei, whose directorial debut So Young (2013) {{was a huge}} box office and critical success.|$|E
25|$|Joan Kerr {{indicates}} that St. Saviour's Cathedral, Goulburn {{was one of}} Blacket's favourite buildings, as, unlike his cathedrals in Sydney and Perth, he was not hampered either by distance, or a previous architect's foundations. It was here that Blacket was able to really indulge a love of Flowing Decorated ornamentation. There are <b>three</b> <b>very</b> large windows, of seven and six lights in the chancel and transept ends, each with highly elaborate and distinct tracery, inspired by, but not identical to, famous Medieval windows. That in the North transept has a wheel based on the Visconti emblem of a window in Milan Cathedral, but by the judicious placement of two small tracery lights, Blacket has {{turned it into a}} sunflower, an emblem frequently used by one of the stained glass firms he employed, Lyon and Cottier. Other decorative features include the foliate carving of the capitals, much of it in the stiff-leaf style of Wells Cathedral; pierced cinquefoil openings in panels above the hammerbeams; and a screen of white New Zealand stone. The stained glass includes windows by two of England's major firms: John Hardman & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and Sydney's two leading firms: Lyon and Cottier and Ashwin and Falconer.|$|E
