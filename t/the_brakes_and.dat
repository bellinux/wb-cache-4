5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the chasm. Ruth, who had not noticed the chasm, slams on <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly {{over the edge of}} the cliff only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends with a description of the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E
5|$|After a few {{setbacks}} Max and Steph finally tie {{the knot}} {{in a ceremony}} initiated by Kieron Hobbs (Jake Hendriks). After the ceremony Max and O.B. leave everyone to enjoy the party while they slip away with Tom. When they are alone Max gives O.B. an engraved watch to say thanks for being his best man and his best mate, but when Niall drives away at speed he doesn't see Tom {{in the way of}} the car and Max jumps out in front of him to grab Tom, Niall did not put <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> carried on and crashed in to a wall after running over Max. O.B. rushed to Max's side and held him, soon after he died in O.B.'s arms and Steph arrived too late to say goodbye. Steph was overwhelmed with grief, and refused to leave her flat she shared with Max or wouldn't take off her wedding dress, until a visit from the priest helps her to face up to her responsibilities for Tom. Later at Max's will reading, Steph and Tom were left Max's entire estate.|$|E

5000|$|A related {{downshifting}} {{technique is}} called heel-and-toe, in which <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>and</b> accelerator pedals are pressed simultaneously. Classically, <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> is pressed {{with the ball}} of the right foot and the accelerator pedal {{is controlled by the}} right heel, while the clutch pedal is pressed by the left foot. However, variants are possible, with <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>and</b> accelerator pressed by sides of the right foot.|$|R

25|$|The A-class trams {{were built}} between 1984 and 1986 by Comeng.

They were similar - the major differences being <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> that the A1-class were built with trolley poles, while A2-class were built with pantographs. All but one that were built remain in service at present.|$|E
25|$|Known as the Toronto Zoo Domain Ride, {{the system}} opened in 1976. In March 1991 nine {{people were injured}} when two trains collided. In spite of a warning that major {{maintenance}} was needed to fix problems in <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> motors, in 1994 another accident occurred that injured thirty. The zoo was fined $43,000, and instead of fixing the system {{the board of directors}} decided to close the system, and operations ended that year.|$|E

25|$|Wagon brakes {{provide a}} very fast means of locking and {{unlocking}} wagons, but <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> stage can be damaged if the running crew attempts to move a wagon while its brakes are engaged. Damage to the stage can be mitigated by using extension spindles with compliant (e.g., polyurethane) tips. Toggle clamps, which are functionally similar to wagon brakes, are sometimes used in lieu of theatrical wagon brakes due to their higher load ratings and more durable construction.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{safeguards}} that are usually taken to prevent this sort of accident happening. Railroads have strict government-approved procedures for testing the air brake systems when making up trains in a yard or picking up cars en route. These generally involve connecting the air brake hoses, charging up the brake system, setting <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied, and then releasing <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released. Particular attention is usually paid to the rearmost car of the train, either by manual inspection or via an automated end-of-train device, to ensure that brake pipe continuity exists throughout the entire train. When brake pipe continuity exists throughout the train, failure of the brakes to apply or release on one or more cars is an indication that the cars' triple valves are malfunctioning. Depending on the location of the air test, the repair facilities available, and regulations governing the number of inoperative brakes permitted in a train, the car may be set out for repair or taken to the next terminal where it can be repaired.|$|E
25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve, the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder. When the engine operator releases the brake, the locomotive brake valve portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge {{the contents of the}} brake cylinder to the atmosphere, releasing <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> recharging the reservoirs.|$|E

25|$|In 1931 Erich Gaichen invented {{and drove}} from Altenburg to Berlin a 1/2 {{horsepower}} electric car containing features later incorporated into hybrid cars. Its maximum speed was , {{but it was}} licensed by the Motor Transport Office, taxed by the German Revenue Department and patented by the German Reichs-Patent Amt. The car battery was re-charged by the motor when the car went downhill. Additional power {{to charge the battery}} was provided by a cylinder of compressed air which was re-charged by small air pumps activated by vibrations of the chassis and <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> by igniting oxyhydrogen gas. No production beyond the prototype was reported.|$|E
25|$|The engineer, Tom Harding, {{parked the}} train {{on the main}} line by setting <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> {{followed}} standard procedure by shutting down {{four of the five}} locomotives. Harding, who was the lone crew member under the MMA's work rules, which had been discussed with Transport Canada, could not park the train on the adjacent siding because MMA used it routinely to store empty boxcars for Tafisa, a particleboard factory in Lac-Mégantic's industrial park. The Nantes siding has a derail that could have stopped the train from accidentally departing. According to Transport Canada, it is unusual to leave an unattended train parked on a main line, but there were no regulations against it.|$|E
25|$|Cars are {{equipped}} with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated {{by a combination of}} the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 2000s-era cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.|$|E

25|$|Tony Rolt and Duncan Hamilton debuted the {{prototype}} at Le Mans in 1950. It was the first-ever Le Mans entry {{to have an}} overdrive transmission. Not only was the car one of the 29 finishers {{from the field of}} 66, but also finished in fourth place. This outstanding achievement sealed Healey’s contract with Nash for a limited production run of the road cars. Roger Menadue, head of Healey’s experimental department, {{played a significant role in}} the success: He filed slots in the backplates of <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>and</b> extended the adjusting mechanism to a small exterior lever. Thus in a matter of seconds he could adjust the brakes during pit stops without jacking the car up—an innovation that was said to save as much as half an hour at each stop.|$|E
25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>and</b> releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{spent four}} months {{designing}} and seven months building another home-built dragster called the Double Dragon. The machine had two engines, with each engine having its own ring gear and pinion, clutch, and driveshaft. He used four rear racing slick tires in open competitions for faster passes, and two rear slicks in match competitions to produce smokier passes. The machine ripped up {{the starting line}} at the 1961 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis. In 1962, Hill ran [...] two years after Chris Karamesines had the first [...] pass and two years before Don Garlits had the first official [...] rpass. A speed or e.t. record is first certified official after it is backed up by a different pass within one percent. Hill built his first Top Fuel dragster in 1963 using a Pontiac engine. He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. [...] "It {{was one of those}} fireballs that you couldn't see through," [...] Hill said. [...] "I locked up <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>and</b> it felt like I needed to turn the wheel to the left, but for some reason, I didn't. I had to do something that was counterintuitive, and it spooked me." [...] Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire tapped his finances and his resolve to drag race.|$|E

Moreover, since the AMXs were [...] "rather crude" [...] compared with the smaller, lighter cars they were racing against, they lost time in the turns. Nevertheless, Witzenburg said the cars [...] "ran great," [...] especially on the straights where they reached about [...]|$|E

2500|$|When {{originally}} designed, the homologation rulebook mandated 16-inch wheels, so that's {{what the}} GT-R got. This limited {{the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>and</b> the four-piston calipers used by Nissan were not competitive. After the rules [...] changed to allow 17-inch wheels, the GT-R V-spec (for Victory) emerged in February 1993 wearing 17" [...] BBS mesh wheels (225/50/17) covering larger Brembo calipers. The clutch actuation changed from a push to a pull system and the car had a standard mechanical rear differential (the electronic rear differential {{did not show up}} until the R33 V-Spec). A year later, the V-Spec II appeared with a new sticker and wider tires (245/4517).|$|E

40|$|The study {{concerning}} the contact between a tyre {{and the road}} surface was conducted in three phases. In the first phase the first and second-order factors were separated. The factors: type of road surface, tyre type, tread depth, water depth, tyre pressure and tyre load were included in an experimental multifactor investigation. Each of them appeared to affect <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>and</b> sideway forces. Only {{the influence of the}} tyre pressure and load was found to be insignificant or very small. The second phase served to determine the numerical influence of the road surface characteristics and the speed on the size of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>and</b> sideway forces. It was found possible to compile a mathematical relation incorporating the contribution of the macro-roughness and micro-roughness of the road surface and also of the speed to <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>and</b> sideway forces. In the third phase a similar mathematical relation was drawn up for truck tyres. Finally, recommendations are made for official measures, with emphasis on standards to be met by the macro-roughness and micro-roughness of road surfaces...|$|R
