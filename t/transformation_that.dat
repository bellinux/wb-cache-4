5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar solutions that shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity <b>transformation</b> <b>that</b> they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics {{focus on}} human {{struggle}} and self-determination, A Beautiful Lies lyrics are more personal {{and the music}} introduces screaming vocals. The <b>transformation</b> <b>that</b> resonates throughout the album reflects the personal and artistic changes experienced by the band members {{before and during the}} creation of the record. The album widened the band's sound by combining elements from progressive rock, hard rock and emo. Such alternative rock style has been compared to bands like The Cure, U2 and The Smashing Pumpkins.|$|E
5|$|By {{taking this}} new role, Rainilaiarivony {{became the first}} Hova to {{concurrently}} serve as both Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The sociopolitical <b>transformation</b> <b>that</b> had been triggered by the strangling of RadamaII reached its zenith with Rainilaiarivony's consolidation of administrative power. Rasoherina and her successors remained the figureheads of traditional authority, participated in political councils and provided official approval for policies. The Prime Minister issued new policies and laws in the Queen's name. However, the day-to-day governance, security and diplomatic activities of the kingdom principally originated with, and were managed by, Rainilaiarivony and his counselors. This new level of authority enabled the Prime Minister to amass a vast personal fortune, whether through inheritance, gifts or purchase, including 57 houses, large plantations and rice paddies, numerous cattle and thousands of slaves. The most prominent of Rainilaiarivony's properties was the Andafiavaratra Palace, constructed {{for him on the}} slope just below the royal Rova compound by English architect William Pool in 1873.|$|E

5|$|The Lingbao School {{borrowed}} many concepts from Buddhism, {{including the}} concept of reincarnation, and also some cosmological elements. Although reincarnation was an important concept in the Lingbao School, the earlier Daoist belief in attaining immortality remained. The school's pantheon is similar to Shangqing and Celestial Master Daoism, with {{one of its most}} important gods being the deified form of Laozi. Other gods also existed, some of whom were in charge of preparing spirits for reincarnation. Lingbao ritual was initially in individual practice, but later went through a <b>transformation</b> <b>that</b> put more emphasis on collective rites. The most important scripture in the Lingbao School is known as the Five Talismans (Wufujing), which was compiled by Ge Chaofu and based on Ge Hong's earlier alchemical works.|$|E
5|$|The {{region was}} among the {{earliest}} {{in the world to}} see human habitation, agricultural communities and civilization. During the Bronze Age, independent Canaanite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Minoan Crete, and Syria. Between 1550–1400 BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian New Kingdom who held power until the 1178 BCE Battle of Djahy (Canaan) during the wider Bronze Age collapse. The Israelites emerged from a dramatic social <b>transformation</b> <b>that</b> took place in the people of the central hill country of Canaan around 1200 BCE, with no signs of violent invasion or even of peaceful infiltration of a clearly defined ethnic group from elsewhere.|$|E

This argument sees human society as evolving from tribes or chiefdoms into states through a gradual process of <b>transformation</b> <b>that</b> lets a small group hierarchically structure society and maintain order through appropriation of symbols of power.

25|$|Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is {{a method}} that allows one to measure brain tissue {{composition}} differences between subjects. To do so, one must first register all images to a standard coordinate system, by mapping them to a reference image. This is done by use of an affine <b>transformation</b> <b>that</b> minimizes the sum-of-squares intensity difference between the experimental image and the reference. Once this is done, the proportion of grey or white matter in a voxel can be determined by intensity. This allows one to compare the tissue composition of corresponding brain regions between different subjects.|$|E

Stress on ecosystems has allowed invasive plants to out-compete native species along Colorado River riparian areas. Native forests of cottonwood and willow have yielded to sand and mudflats dominated by the nonnative tamarisk (also known as salt cedar), arrowweed, and iodinebush, a <b>transformation</b> <b>that</b> has decreased the habitat value of the riparian forest (Briggs and Cornelius, 1997).|$|E

We generalized their work in that we automatically detect composition errors for <b>transformations</b> <b>that</b> add and remove code. Specifically, we detect errors for automated refactorings that transform a program when selected. The generalization is important to detect errors for modules that add and remove code. As a result, we can now guarantee that refactorings and sequences of refactorings compose without errors in featureoriented designs. 1...|$|R

The various representations of the Dirac matrices employed will bring into focus particular aspects of the physical content in the Dirac wave function (see below).

25|$|Some vectors {{transform}} like contravariant vectors, {{except that}} when they are reflected through a mirror, they flip and gain a minus sign. A <b>transformation</b> <b>that</b> switches right-handedness to left-handedness and vice versa like a mirror does is said to change the orientation of space. A vector which gains a minus sign when the orientation of space changes is called a pseudovector or an axial vector. Ordinary vectors are sometimes called true vectors or polar vectors to distinguish them from pseudovectors. Pseudovectors occur most frequently as the cross product of two ordinary vectors.|$|E
