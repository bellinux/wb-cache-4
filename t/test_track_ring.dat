50|$|High Speed Test Track: 7.5-mile (12.1-km) oval <b>test</b> <b>track</b> {{contains}} four asphalt lanes on {{the front}} straightaway and curves and five asphalt lanes on the back straightaway. The 7.5-mile <b>test</b> <b>track's</b> parabolic banking allows neutral speeds up to 140 mph (225 km/h). The <b>test</b> <b>track</b> features level 2-mile (3.2 km) straightaways.|$|R
50|$|The first full-scaled string rail <b>test</b> <b>track</b> was {{constructed}} in Russian town Ozyory (Moscow Oblast, Russia) in 2001. This <b>test</b> <b>track</b> had tube rails supported with a wire rope and spreaders, unlike the monolithic string as proposed now. The length of this <b>test</b> <b>track</b> was about 150 meters. Due to lack of funding the inventors did not produce any railcars for this <b>test</b> <b>track,</b> but used a modified truck ZiL-131 with steel wheels instead of normal road wheels. Later this test site was abandoned and deconstructed.|$|R
50|$|The Transrapid 08 {{was still}} doing trial runs, {{but it did}} carry {{passengers}} along a 31.8 km <b>test</b> <b>track</b> to demonstrate the maglev technology. The Emsland <b>test</b> <b>track</b> runs from Lathen, near where the accident occurred, to Dörpen, with a loop at each end, and a depot side track near the southern loop. Speeds of up to 450 km/h (280 mph) are reached on the <b>test</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the opening}} of the Tokaido Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964, Japanese National Railways (JNR) focused on the {{development}} of faster Maglev technology. In the 1970s, a 7 km <b>test</b> <b>track</b> for Maglev research and development was built in Miyazaki Prefecture. As desired results had been obtained at the (now former) Miyazaki <b>test</b> <b>track,</b> an 18.4 kilometre <b>test</b> <b>track</b> with tunnels, bridges and slopes was built at a site in Yamanashi Prefecture, between Ōtsuki and Tsuru (...) [...] Residents of Yamanashi Prefecture and government officials were eligible for free rides on the Yamanashi <b>test</b> <b>track,</b> and over 200,000 people took part. Trains on this <b>test</b> <b>track</b> have routinely achieved operating speeds of over 500 km/h (310 mph), making this an embryonic part of the future Chuo Shinkansen.|$|R
50|$|A 1,200 m <b>test</b> <b>track</b> {{was built}} to test the control system, using {{prototype}} vehicles on rubber wheels. The track was completed in 1973. This {{was followed by a}} 200 m <b>test</b> <b>track</b> for the maglev system.|$|R

40|$|The Indiana Department of Transportation {{was among}} the first to adopt the Superpave mixture design method and {{relevant}} specifications. When the National Center for Asphalt Technology decided to build a pavement <b>test</b> <b>track,</b> the Indiana Department of Transportation saw an opportunity to validate the mixture design method. It participated in the <b>test</b> <b>track</b> pooled fund study by sponsoring two pavement sections that were part of a larger investigation involving ten pavement test sections. Further, efforts were made to establish rutting performance relationships between the Accelerated Pavement Tester, the Purdue Wheel Laboratory Tracker, and the in-service pavement as represented by the <b>test</b> <b>track.</b> The results show that the Superpave mixture design method and specifications do provide well-performing hot-mix asphalt mixtures with respect to permanent deformation. Also, direct comparisons between the Accelerated Pavement Tester and the <b>test</b> <b>track,</b> and the Purdue Wheel Laboratory Tracker and the <b>test</b> <b>track</b> do exist. Finite element modeling techniques were also used to model rutting development. The finite element modeling suggests that such an approach may be capable of relating the accelerated and in-service results even better than direct comparison...|$|R

50|$|Construction of a <b>test</b> <b>track</b> for the Interstate Highway System between Utica and Ottawa {{began in}} 1952. The <b>test</b> <b>track</b> had six {{different}} segments of roadway, with {{different types of}} surfaces. One of the old <b>test</b> <b>tracks</b> can still be seen from I-80. The first section of I-80 to open was the section that {{is known as the}} Kingery Expressway, this section open in 1957, as US 6. In October 1958 the <b>test</b> <b>track</b> west of Ottawa opens to testing. The section of I-80 that is concurrent with the Tri-State Tollway was opened in 1958. November 1960 the testing at the <b>test</b> <b>track</b> is complete. The interstate opened between IL 71, near Ottawa, and I-55, near Joliet, in 1960. The segment of roadway between IL 23 and IL 71, near Ottawa, open in 1961. In 1962 the highway was extended west to IL 89, near LaSalle, replacing and paralleling the <b>test</b> <b>track</b> most of the way to Utica. Also in 1962, another section of road open between US 67 and IL 78. During 1964 and 1965 the gap between IL 78 and IL 89 was completed and opened to traffic. The north-south section of I-80 in Illinois was open in 1967. The last section of I-80 to open was the section between I-55 and the Tri-State Tollway, with it opening 1968.|$|R

The Mickleover <b>test</b> <b>track</b> was closed and lifted in the early 1990s but Old Dalby is still in use today and has a bright future.|$|R
