50|$|Beeswax {{may be a}} major {{product or}} a minor byproduct.The {{management}} technique that yields the highest amount of wax per hive is the top-bar hive. During the harvest of the honey from top-bar hives the whole honey comb is removed and crushed <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rapeseed {{produces}} great {{quantities of}} nectar, and honeybees produce a light-colored but peppery honey from it. It must be extracted immediately after processing is finished, {{because it will}} otherwise quickly granulate in the honeycomb and be impossible <b>to</b> <b>extract.</b> <b>The</b> <b>honey</b> is usually blended with milder honeys, if used for table use or sold as bakery grade.|$|E
50|$|A common {{chimpanzee}} {{from the}} Kasakela chimpanzee community {{was the first}} nonhuman animal reported making a tool, by modifying a twig to use as an instrument for extracting termites from their mound. At Ta√Ø, chimps simply use their hands to extract termites. When foraging for honey, chimps use modified short sticks to scoop the honey out of the hive, that is, if the bees are stingless. For hives of the dangerous African honeybees, chimps use longer and thinner sticks <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey.</b> Chimps also fish for ants using the same tactic.|$|E
50|$|A {{hive frame}} or honey frame is a {{structural}} element in a beehive {{that holds the}} honeycomb or brood comb within the hive enclosure. The hive frame is {{a key part of}} the modern movable-comb hive. It can be removed in order to inspect the bees for disease or <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> excess <b>honey.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Apart from <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> stored within <b>the</b> central brood frames, {{the bees}} store surplus honey in combs above the brood nest. In modern hives the {{beekeeper}} places separate boxes, called [...] "supers", above the brood box, {{in which a}} series of shallower combs is provided for storage of <b>honey.</b> This enables <b>the</b> beekeeper to {{remove some of the}} supers in the late summer, and <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> surplus <b>honey</b> harvest, without damaging the colony of bees and its brood nest below. If all <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> is [...] "stolen", including <b>the</b> amount of <b>honey</b> needed to survive winter, the beekeeper must replace these stores by feeding the bees sugar or corn syrup in autumn.|$|R
50|$|Some {{hobbyist}} beekeepers and beekeepers {{in developing}} countries, especially keepers of top-bar hives, cut <b>the</b> whole <b>honey</b> comb {{out of the}} frame, and use it directly as cut comb <b>honey.</b> <b>To</b> <b>extract</b> liquid <b>honey,</b> <b>the</b> comb can be crushed to release <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> and strained to remove the wax and other impurities. Alternatively, cut comb is put into a honey press to squeeze out <b>the</b> <b>honey.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Radial baskets {{have the}} top {{bar of the}} frame facing {{outwards}} while tangential baskets have {{one side of the}} comb facing outward. Large commercial extractors are radial and rely on the upward slope of the comb cells. This slope allows to extract honey by applying centrifugal force toward the upper edge of the comb (opposite to the direction of gravity while in the hive). The amount of work during extraction is reduced in the radial type because the frames {{do not have to be}} turned over <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> from the other side of the comb (however some extractors are capable of turning combs automatically). Hobbyist extractors can be hand or electric motor powered. If the extractor is hand powered, it often has accelerating gear to spin with less effort.|$|E
50|$|Skeps, baskets placed open-end-down, {{have been}} used to house bees for some 2000 years. Initially they were made from wicker {{plastered}} with mud and dung but from the Middle Ages they were made of straw. In northern and western Europe, skeps were made of coils of grass or straw. In its simplest form, there is a single entrance {{at the bottom of the}} skep. Again, there is no internal structure provided for the bees and the colony must produce its own honeycomb, which is attached to the inside of the skep. Skeps have two disadvantages; beekeepers cannot inspect the comb for diseases and pests, and honey removal is difficult and often results in the destruction of the entire colony. To get the honey beekeepers either drove the bees out of the skep or, by the use of a bottom extension called an eke or a top extension called a cap, sought to create comb with just honey in it. Quite often the bees were just killed, sometimes using lighted sulfur, to allow the honeycomb to be removed. Skeps could also be squeezed in a vise <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey.</b> As of 1998, most US states prohibited the use of skeps because they can not be inspected for disease and parasites.|$|E
40|$|Improved hive {{management}} Cue: Beehives come in many {{shapes and}} sizes. Traditional beehives are often made from hollowed out logs. A more modern type of beehive is the top-bar beehive, {{and the most}} sophisticated beehive is called a Langstroth beehive. This was designed by an American, the Reverend Lorenzo Langstroth, back in 1851. One {{of the advantages of}} the Langstroth hive is that the bees construct their honeycombs in frames which can be removed from the hive. This allows beekeepers <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> without damaging the honeycomb, and then put the comb back into the hive. As a result, they can make more harvests each year, and get top quality honey. However, Langstroth hives are also more difficult to make. Carpenters may need specialised equipment and training, as the measurements of the structures in the hive must be extremely accurate. Many attempts to introduce Langstroth hives in Africa, particularly among rural communities, have failed. One organisation that has had some success however, is Honey Care Africa, which not only manufactures the hives, but also trains community members in beekeeping skills. Eric Kadenge visited their workshop in Nairobi, and spoke to operations manager Margaret Mimoh about their work. IN:		?This is the workshop, this is where ? OUT:		?are going to a group in Mount Kenya. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Margaret Mimoh, operations manager for Honey Care Africa, an organisation that promotes sustainable community beekeeping in East Africa. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mimoh	This is the workshop, this is where we do the manufacture of hives and we are promoting Langstroth beehives. But when it comes to marketing, we are also helping or supporting the farmers who have different, other types of hives, through our own training, and we help them to improve on the techniques in handling the honey so that they come up with quality honey that conforms to the requirements of the market. Kadenge	Now why do you specifically concentrate or promote Langstroth beehives? Mimoh	Because we came to realise that Langstroth beehives give quality honey and also the production in Langstroth hive is a bit high as compared to the other hives. And especially it is women friendly, because the women can also take up beekeeping. Kadenge	What makes it more friendly to women? Mimoh	Because when it comes to inspections, the hives are placed on hanging stands, which are a bit lower compared to the log hives which were being placed up on top of trees and women cannot climb on top of trees to do inspections. And it is also next to the homestead, and it is very easy for women to carry out inspections. Kadenge	So take us through some of the steps that one needs to take. Mimoh	In fact what has to happen is the beekeeper has to ensure that he has the right equipment to help him manage the hives effectively. So we are talking in terms of the bee suit which is the protective clothing, and we have the smoker, we have the protective gloves and we have the gumboots. So he puts them on and goes to the hive, opening up the hive and checking inside to know what is the progress in the hive, and this will give him the indication of what to do next. Kadenge	And when it comes to observation, what do you need to observe and at what times? Mimoh	Normally inspection is done in the evening because the bees are quite cool at that particular time. So what will happen is, once the farmer goes to the hive in the evening, he has to check the strength of the colony. In that case he will also even see the laying pattern of the queen, which will give him an indication of whether the queen is active or not active. Because if the queen is not active then the laying pattern is so poorly done and the colony is so weak, so getting some good amounts of honey becomes a problem and also the building pattern of the bees becomes too slow. Kadenge	In the event that the laying patterns are poor, what would the farmer need to do? Mimoh	He will definitely know that the colony is a bit weak so he can also do the merging of the colonies or re-queening of the hive. Kadenge	Any other thing that the farmer would observe? Mimoh	If the farmer observes things like pests, he will definitely know what is the remedy I have to take or the action I have to take against this. In case of ants, crawling ants, he should definitely manage his apiary by cutting long grass. He can put also some ash or used oil around the post or modify a pond of water around the post so that the bees can use the water and the pests can drown in the water. Kadenge	Is there any other thing {{that you would like to}} add regarding management of beehives? Mimoh	If you don?t manage your hives then don?t expect a harvest. And this has been a practice that has been taken into account by most of the beekeepers who are born beekeepers. Maybe they just hang their hive, wait for six months and think that they are going to get honey out of it. But we have realised, or that is a challenge we have faced, if you don?t manage your hive very well you don?t get the honey. And you find that is why we are saying the Langstroth hive is women friendly, and the women are really doing very well. And in this case you find that they really take into account the inspections of the hive. And the moment they do that, they are really assured of the harvest and the quality of the honey they produced and the income that is going to be generated from that. You are also promoting nutrition within the families, because they get to know the value of using honey as a nutritional factor within the communities. Kadenge	So how many hives do you manufacture in this particular room in a given time? Mimoh	What I would say is that we work in partnership with non governmental organisations, community based organisations and even the government of Kenya. So what happens with the NGOs and the community groups on the ground, they would give us an order of the hives. So let?s say they have given us an order for 200 hives. We would take even two weeks to manufacture it and send it out. Kadenge	So right now we are looking at how many hives here? Mimoh	Right now we have three hundred. Kadenge	And they are destined to go where? Mimoh	About fifty of them are going to a group in Sudan and some are going to a group in western Kenya and some are going to a group in Mount Kenya. End of track. What beekeepers need to look for when they are inspecting their hives...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPopulation and group-specific {{behavioral}} {{differences have}} been taken as evidence for animal cultures [1 ‚Äì 10], a notion that remains controversial. Skeptics argue that ecological or genetic factors, rather than social learning, provide a more parsimonious explanation [11 ‚Äì 14]. Work with captive chimpanzees has addressed this criticism by showing that experimentally created traditions can be transmitted through social learning [15 ‚Äì 17]. Recent fieldwork further suggests that ecological and genetic factors are insufficient to explain the behavioral differences seen between communities, but the data are only observational [18, 19]. Here, we present {{the results of a}} field experiment [20, 21] that compared the performance of chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) from two Ugandan communities, Kanyawara and Sonso, on an identical task in <b>the</b> physical domain‚Äîextracting <b>honey</b> from holes drilled into horizontal logs. Kanyawara chimpanzees, who occasionally use sticks to acquire honey [4], spontaneously manufactured sticks <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> experimentally provided <b>honey.</b> In contrast, Sonso chimpanzees, who possess a considerable leaf technology but no food-related stick use [4, 22], relied on their fingers, but some also produced leaf sponges to access <b>the</b> <b>honey.</b> Our results indicate that, when genetic and environmental factors are controlled, wild chimpanzees rely on their cultural knowledge to solve a novel task...|$|R
50|$|A honey {{extractor}} is a mechanical device used in <b>the</b> extraction of <b>honey</b> from honeycombs. A <b>honey</b> extractor <b>extracts</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> from <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> comb without destroying the comb. Extractors work by centrifugal force. A drum or container holds a frame basket which spins, flinging <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> out. With this method the wax comb stays intact within {{the frame and}} can be reused by the bees.|$|R
50|$|Beekeepers {{will take}} <b>the</b> full <b>honey</b> supers and <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey.</b> Periods {{when there is}} an {{abundant}} nectar source available and bees are quickly bringing back the nectar, are called a honey flow. During a honey flow, beekeepers may put several honey supers onto a hive so the bees have enough storage space.|$|R
50|$|When beekeepers <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> <b>honey,</b> {{they cut}} off the wax caps from each {{honeycomb}} cell with an uncapping knife or machine. Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, {{and the type of}} flowers gathered by the bees. Wax from the brood comb of <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb. Impurities accumulate more quickly in the brood comb. Due to the impurities, the wax must be rendered before further use. The leftovers are called slumgum.|$|R

40|$|Background: What is <b>the</b> issue? Premium <b>honeys</b> from Australia and New Zealand, in {{particular}} <b>honey</b> derived from <b>the</b> Leptospermum species Manuka and Jellybush, retail for high {{prices on the}} international and domestic market due to their high bioactivity. However, these honeys are increasingly being counterfeited or substituted with cheaper imitations. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop robust analytical protocols for authenticating the floral source of honeys. This will provide market protection for the beekeepers and the consumers. Research questions? Can chromatographic profiles of phenolic and volatile compounds in Australian and New Zealand honeys be used to authenticate the floral source? Do the phenolic compounds in <b>honey</b> contribute to <b>the</b> biological properties, including anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory? Which honey types and phenolic compounds within <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> have <b>the</b> greatest bioactivity? Methods: How was research performed? Volatile and phenolic compounds are currently being chemically fingerprinted using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Preparative chromatography of <b>the</b> phenolic <b>extract</b> has commenced <b>to</b> isolate compounds from <b>honeys.</b> <b>The</b> anti-bacterial activity of <b>the</b> purified phenolic <b>extracts</b> in <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> is currently being investigated, using a well diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus. The anti-inflammatory properties of <b>the</b> purified phenolic <b>extracts</b> in <b>the</b> <b>honeys</b> will be investigated, {{in particular}} the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory enzyme 5 -lipoxygenase and leukotriene B 4. Research findings: Unique biomarker compounds are currently being identified {{for a range of}} honey samples that have been analysed. Mislabelled commercial honeys have been identified. All of <b>the</b> phenolic <b>extracts</b> from <b>the</b> <b>honey</b> samples inhibited Staphylococcus aureus. All <b>honeys</b> and <b>the</b> fractioned compound methyl syringate, common to all of <b>the</b> analysed <b>honeys,</b> have shown inhibition of the pro-inflammatory 5 -LOX enzyme, indicating potential anti-inflammatory activity.
