Department of Energy, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Sunpower Inc., and NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) {{have been}} {{developing}} an Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) {{for use as}} a power system on space science missions. This generator will make use of free-piston Stirling convertors to achieve higher conversion efficiency than with currently available alternatives. One part of NASA GRC's support of ASRG development includes extended operation testing of Advanced Stirling Convertors (ASCs) developed by Sunpower Inc. and GRC. The ASC consists of a free-piston Stirling engine integrated with a linear alternator. NASA GRC has been building test facilities to support extended operation of the ASCs for several years. Operation of the convertors in the test facility provides convertor performance data {{over an extended period of}} time.

40|$|Traffic exhaust is {{the major}} {{pollutant}} source in urban areas that adversely affects air quality and the living standard of stakeholders. Round free jet is an appropriate platform that helps elucidate the turbulence and transport processes {{in the wake of}} a vehicular tailpipe. There is increasing evidence that turbulence structures in the whole flow are all affected by jet initial conditions, such as Reynolds number at the jet exit. However, most of the studies focused on round free jet in the stagnant environment or with extremely low coflow strength, which cannot be used to characterize the effect of background wind. Therefore, it is necessary to study the downstream emission plume being influenced by the interaction between the vehicular exhaust jet and the ambient wind. This research applied laboratory measurement techniques with the assistance of an axisymmetric mathematical model. In the laboratory, a 1 -meter high and 1 -meter wide <b>test</b> <b>rack</b> was built, on which a pipe nozzle and several measurement sensors were mounted. Pipe nozzles of different diameter were employed to control the mean velocity also. The Reynolds number at the jet exit in this study ranged from 6000 to 28000. A constant-temperature hot-wire anemometer with Xprobe and a resistance temperature detector (RTD) were installed on the <b>test</b> <b>rack</b> to detect the mean value and turbulent quantities in the wake of the jet. Due to the difficulty of simulating ambient wind in the laboratory platform, an axisymmetric computational domain was created in the cylindrical coordinates; it was solved by the standard k–ε model and was validated by lab measurement results to examine the flow characteristics in a turbulent round jet in coflow environment. Initial conditions are very significant factors for turbulence development. The critical value of Reynolds number for mean flow field is 10, 000 and is little related to the jet exit diameter. The mean velocity evolves into self-similarity faster than turbulent intensity. The critical Reynolds number for turbulent flow field is larger than the critical value of Reynolds number for mean flow field and is closely related to jet exit diameter. The relationship between critical Reynolds number for turbulent velocity field and jet exit diameter has been achieved by measurement data. The asymptotic value of turbulent intensity is also linearly related to long pipe nozzle diameter, instead of other initial conditions. Coflow strength is another significant factor for turbulence development. The normalized axial excess velocity decay is strongly affected by coflow strength. The mean velocity decay rate is not constant in the flow (except in the near-field region). The velocity field in the far-field region is dominated by the background wind. So the effect of coflow strength on turbulence development in the axial direction varies with coflow strength. Meanwhile, the spreading rate is linearly dependent on coflow strength that means coflow strength has the same effect on the turbulence development in the radial direction. Coflow strength also inhibits the turbulent intensity along the centerline in the intermediate-field and far-field regions. With higher coflow strength, the turbulent flow gets into self-similarity more quickly. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Reduced {{atmospheric}} pressures {{will likely}} be used to minimize mass and engineering requirements for plant growth habitats used in extraterrestrial applications. A chamber with high vacuum capability was used to design and begin construction of a system for testing plant responses to reduced pressure atmospheres. Several preliminary tests were conducted to evaluate chamber suitability for plant tests and to determine performance of thermal and vacuum systems at ambient and reduced pressure atmospheres down to 0. 1 atm. The first tests consisted of measurements of internal gas volume and leakage rate. The method for volume determination was quite sensitive and will be needed for plant gas exchange measurements and calculations. This information will also be {{used in conjunction with}} the leak rate. Measured leak rates on the order of 0. 46 mm Hg/min at 76 mm Hg pressure are low enough to conduct sensitive carbon dioxide exchange rate measurements at reduced pressure given an adequate plant sample (0. 5 to 1. 0 sq m area). A <b>test</b> <b>rack</b> with lighting provided by three high-pressure sodium vapor lamps was built to accommodate both short-term and long-term plant responses. Initial short-term experiments with lettuce showed that a pressure of 77 mm Hg resulted in a 6. 1 -fold increase in the rate of water loss compared to water loss at ambient pressure. Plants were severely wilted after 30 minutes exposure to 77 mm Hg. Water loss was found to be inversely correlated with atmospheric pressure over the range of pressures from 0. 2 to 1. 0 atm; the rate of water loss at 0. 2 atm was 4. 3 times higher than water loss at ambient pressure. Older leaves showed moderate wilting during exposure to 156 mm Hg, but those exposed to 345 mm, Hg remained turgid. Results suggest a reduced atmospheric pressure limit of 0. 2 to 0. 3 atm for lettuce grown in a solid medium. Follow-up experiments with carbon dioxide control and control at high relative humidity (> 90 %) will be needed to further confirm and define safe reduced pressure limits that are feasible for plant tolerance and growth...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 In this thesis, {{the author}} contextualises {{condition}} monitoring of {{active magnetic bearing}} (AMB) systems and proposes the real-time condition monitoring of AMB systems. Three real-time fault detection, diagnosis, correction and identification schemes for vibration forces on the rotor of a rotational AMB system are proposed. Two AMB systems were used to conduct this research. The one was a fully suspended 250 kW water cooling AMB pump from which historical fault data was obtained {{and the other was}} an experimental double radial AMB <b>test</b> <b>rack</b> on which the three real-time schemes were implemented. The historical fault data obtained from the AMB pump were categorised into subsynchronous, rotor synchronous and supersynchronous vibration forces. It was decided to use the historical fault data to induce the same fault conditions that occurred on the AMB pump on the AMB <b>test</b> <b>rack.</b> Various fault detection techniques were implemented on the historical fault data. This was done to obtain the best technique for a specific fault condition. These techniques together with the historical fault data were used {{in the design of the}} three real-time schemes. The focus of this research is on external faults, since the research of internal faults to the magnetic bearing control system is well established. Various schemes exist where off-line diagnosis and identification of internal and external faults are performed on AMB systems, but the area of real-time identification and correction of external faults still needs to be explored. This study proposes three real-time detection, diagnosis, correction and identification schemes for external faults to the magnetic bearing control system of rotational AMB systems. These schemes use the available AMB sensors and actuators to perform condition monitoring and correction, since machine components in industrial applications operate in harsh environments and are not always easily accessible to install condition monitoring equipment. The last scheme focuses on real-time multiple frequency fault detection, diagnosis, correction and identification of external faults on rotational AMB systems, since more than one fault can occur simultaneously on the AMB system. Analysis of a multiple frequency fault by a single frequency fault scheme causes incorrect identification and correction of the fault. Four articles were submitted for publication on the three real-time schemes. The three real-time schemes perform three main tasks: 1) fault detection, 2) fault diagnosis and error correction and 3) fault identification. Displacement and current masking were performed during the fault detection stage. The vibratory amplitudes and frequencies were extracted by means of the Wigner-Ville distribution. Discrete sampling of the displacement and current signals of the physical AMB system was performed by the dSPACE 1104 controller board. Pattern recognition techniques, statistical diagnosis, cascaded fuzzy logic and pattern construction were used to calculate fault features during the fault diagnosis and error correction stages. Error correction algorithms were used to correct the fault during the error correction stage. During the fault identification stage, data fitting, fuzzy logic, IS 0 standards and pattern recognition were used to calculate the type, parameters, vibratory level and zone of the vibration force. A historical fault database was used during the identification process. Correction factors were calculated to observe the improvement each scheme has over the optimised PID controller when vibration forces are applied. Scheme 3 provided the best result for improving subsynchronous vibration forces, scheme 1 the best for rotor synchronous vibration forces and scheme 2 the best for supersynchronous vibration forces. Scheme 3 provided the best overall result with the best average improvement. All three real-time schemes were able to correct and minimize vibration forces to a stable operating condition. The three real-time schemes only stabilize the rotor with respect to the stator and do not remove the vibration force. When correction forces are applied to the AMB system, to correct the effect of the vibration forces, it may increases the stress of other critical components e. g. the power amplifiers and system base, which may cause components to be damaged or break down. These stressed components need to be identified by the user as critical or non-critical and the necessary steps must be taken to operate the AMB system under the fault condition or to shut down the system and repair the fault. The maximum current capability and bandwidth of the power amplifiers, run-time of the DSP processors and bandwidth of the sensors were the main factors limiting the applicability of the real-time schemes. Since the power amplifiers and sensors were designed and specified for normal operational bandwidth, it was not possible to fully evaluate supersynchronous vibration forces. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|This {{article will}} be {{available}} as gold open access on publication. Adhesion requirements for photovoltaic modules to ensure reliability are often discussed but not well defined, neither in terms of tests nor actual requirements. This paper presents a new approach for realistic assessment of the adhesion strength, which shows the conventional peel test may not ensure reliability. The test presented reproduces the actual adhesion requirements for fielded modules much more closely than the commonly used peel testing. The test is conducted in-situ during standard damp-heat test at a temperature of 85 °C and 85 % relative humidity, with the modules installed {{at an angle to}} give an appropriate force vector perpendicular to the backsheet. This is achieved by attaching weights {{to the back of the}} tested samples which are mounted with a 45 ° angle on a <b>testing</b> <b>rack</b> in the environmental cabinet. With an appropriate weight holder, this could be done as part of the standard damp-heat cycle during certification and would not involve additional testing time nor significant changes in the commonly used racking. This approach will identify the weakest interface of the multilayer encapsulation system. A number of test-to-fail bespoke samples are tested to set realistic fail criteria. It is shown that the test allows discrimination between different samples and can identify unsuitable production processes...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} {{activities}} to improve the skills of technical staff members through exchange with staff in other disciplines, mechanical engineering staff members were assigned to a Chemistry and Materials Science Experiment Course (qualitative analysis) offered to first year students of the Department of Chemistry and Materials Science. Asking the mechanical engineering staff members to perform assignments as efficiently as experienced chemical engineering staff without any preparatory measures would have been unreasonable, {{in addition to the}} fact that the assignment already put mental pressure on both the group dispatching the mechanical engineering staff and the group receiving them and caused feelings of uneasiness in both groups. To dispel the uneasiness, various efforts were repeatedly made; for example, teaching staff members elucidated and explained in detail to the mechanical engineering staff members about the four themes of the experiment course, which they would work on over the course of a semester, and the mechanical engineering staff members conducted preparatory experiments with the teaching and chemical engineering staff members. By its nature, the experiment course required its participants to conduct extensive observations. It was felt that there were many experiment phenomena which could be noticed only after they had been explained. These included cases where, for example, observation was very difficult because barely visible precipitate formed in the solution inside a test tube, but became transparent when the test tube was shaken, or where after the precipitate had dissolved, it transformed into crystalline precipitate when it was recrystallized. Furthermore, the mechanical engineering staff members were taught that in some cases, it was very important to observe different deposits and compare them with each other. During the regular experiment classes, the staff members are very busy carrying out their duties, such as preparing chemical reagents, receiving reports, and monitoring and managing students’ safety and the progress of their experiments. Test tube <b>racks</b> for small <b>test</b> tubes used for the department’s student experiment classes were blackened, and some 3 mm long sections between test tube holes were corroded and had disappeared due to more than 30 years of aging deterioration and degradation by chemicals and other materials. However, the experiment staff members could not afford to take the time to solve the test tube racks’ problems due to being so busy and under budgetary constraints. The <b>test</b> tube <b>racks</b> were not commercially available goods, but hand-made products created by a craftsman. Therefore, even if a decision to replace them with new ones was made, arranging for the replacements would be problematic. According to the results of the preparatory experiments conducted by the staff members, it was hard to detect a minute amount of precipitate as well as to observe the colors, crystallization and other precipitate characteristics with the <b>test</b> tube <b>rack</b> because the rack’s upper plate creates a shade while the blackened bottom plate reduces reflectivity, leading to an insufficient amount of light reaching the test tubes inserted in the rack. While the wooden <b>test</b> tube <b>racks</b> were hand-made by a craftsman, the authors proposed new designs from the point of view of the mechanical engineering staff, using stainless steel, acrylic and other plates to produce prototypes, and a laser beam machining tool to finely process acrylic plates to mass produce new rack units to be used in class. In this report, the authors describe their activities to design and manufacture new acrylic <b>test</b> tube <b>racks,</b> and use them for an experiment class. Furthermore, the authors report that the acrylic <b>test</b> tube <b>racks</b> contributed to improving test tube observation results as expected and that this technical staff exchange between different disciplines was successful...|$|R

Observations and results showed that both panel buckling and paperboard cutting at the staples affected the racking response, but the dominating factor influencing the racking response appears to be load transfer through the staples...|$|R

Med {{implementation}} av ett spillvärmeåtervinningsystem går det att återvinna en del av den frigjorda energin i form av elektricitet till lastbilens elsystem. Två termoelektriska generatorer använder avgaserna som värmekälla och ett kylmedel som kall källa för att åstakomma en temperaturdifferans i generatorerna. Med hjälp av Seebeck-effekten går det att omvandla temperaturdifferansen till elektricitet och på så sätt avlastas motorns generator vilket medför en lägre bränsleförbrukning. Detta examensarbete innefattar utvecklandet av en funktion som maximerar nettoeffekten utvunnen från systemet. Funktionen som utvecklats är döpt till Maximum Net-power Point Tracking (MNPT) och har som uppgift att beräkna referensvärden som styrningen av systemet skall uppnå för att få ut maximal nettoeffekt. En simuleringmiljö i Matlab/Simulink är uppbyggd för att kunna implementera en kontrollstrategi för styrningen av kylmedlet samt avgasledning via bypass-ventiler. Systemet har blivit implementerat i en motorstyrenhet på en testrack somkommunicerar via CAN där givare så som temperatur och tryck avläses. Systemet har ej blivit implementerat på lastbilen då samtliga fysiska komponenter ej blev färdigställda under examensarbetets gång. En fallstudie genomfördes i simuleringsmiljön och resultaten visade att användningen av en MNPT-funktion tillät upp till 300 % ökning av den återinförda nettoeffekten till lastbilens elsystem jämfört med utan användning av kontrollalgoritmer, och upp till 50 % ökning jämfört med statiska referensvärden. About 30 % of the {{released energy}} of a truck’s fuel is waste heat in the exhaustsystem. It is possible to recover some of the energy with a {{waste heat recovery system}} that generates electricity from a temperature difference by utilising the Seebeck-effect. Two thermoelectric generators are implemented on a truck and utilises the exhaust gas as a heat source and the coolant fluid as a cold source to accomplish a temperature difference in the generators. The electricity is reintroduced to the truck’s electrical system and thus reducing the load on the electrical generator in the engine which results in lower fuel consumption. This thesis includes the construction of a function that maximises the netpowerderived from the system. The function developed is named Maximum Net Power Point Tracking (MNPT) and has the task of calculating reference values that the controllers of the system must achieve in order to obtain maximumnet-power. A simulation environment has been developed in Matlab/Simulink in order to design a control strategy to three valves and one pump. The system has been implemented on a engine control unit that has been mounted on a <b>test</b> <b>rack.</b> The engine control unit communicates through CAN to connected devices. The system has not been implemented on the truck due that all the physical components were not completed {{during the time of the}} thesis. A case study has been conducted and the results proves that the use of an MNPT-function allows up to 300 % increase in regenerated net power into the trucks electrical system compared with no control algorithms, and up to 50 % compared with static reference values...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of brake application delays in Australian train brake systems {{began with a}} literature review of pneumatic train braking systems. Data located in the review gave examples of brake application delays of pre 1990 designs from the U. K., India and North America. Information on application delays on later Australian designs was scarce. Reading of literature has shown {{a difference between the}} Australian and North American control valves in the way the propagation of the pressure reduction rate in the brake pipe is maintained. Control valves of the North American style allow the brake pipe air to be connected for a short time to a small cavity or quick service volume of each valve. The quick service volume is then released to atmosphere. The action of exhausting a small amount of air from the brake pipe helps to ensure a propagation of an adequate pressure reduction rate as it travels to the next valve. Australian control valves rely on the ratio of the volume of brake pipe between control valves {{and the size of the}} quick service volume or bulb to ensure the propagation of an adequate pressure reduction as it travels to the next valve. The air in a bulb of an Australian valve is not expelled to atmosphere until a brake release is made. The research explored possible reductions in application delays by utilizing an experimental pipe <b>test</b> <b>rack</b> that included 4 control valves and 120 meters of brake pipe. Experiments with different configurations of exhaust orifices or chokes, valves and branch pipe lengths that supplied the valves gave a record acquired by data acquisition of the timing of each valve and the local pressure drop from a valve or each valve for comparison. Experiments with exhaust chokes that gave a reduction drop rate in the brake pipe that approached the minimum required to operate a control valve resulted in instability of the application operation of the control valve. The quick service volume of different sizes was included in the experiments to give comparisons in the propagation of the pressure reduction toward the end of a long train. Further increases into the size of the bulb of a control valve to enhance the propagation features toward the end of a long train are discussed. The branch pipe with different diameters from 12 mm to 20 mm and lengths from 160 mm to 800 mm when fitted to an adaptor pipe bracket were investigated and results show that larger diameters gave larger gulps in the brake pipe. Other components that were studied included the pipe bracket that is fitted on some control valves. The pipe bracket and isolation cock was found to add 282 mm of additional length to the air path and while not changing the operation of the valve, the results showed a smaller drop in local pressure in the brake pipe to assist the pressure reduction rate than shown in valves without pipe brackets...|$|E

Dies stellt aber die Maschinenentwickler häufig vor die Problemstellung der verringerten Steifigkeit und Dämpfung der Maschinen durch Verringerung der Masse. Aus Sicht der Steuerungstechnik existieren unterschiedliche Möglichkeiten auftretende Schwingungen der nachgiebigen Maschinenstrukturen zu vermeiden. Einige Schwingungsvermeidungsalgorithmen sind in gängigen industriell eingesetzten NC-Steuerungen integriert. Allerdings benötigen, die Methoden zur Parametrierung die aktuellen Resonanzfrequenzen der Maschine, die je nach Position und Orientierung der Maschinenachsen unterschiedlich ausfallen. Resonanzfrequenzen von Maschinenstrukturen können über die experimentelle modale Analyse oder durch Simulationsmodelle vorab bestimmt werden und der Steuerung als Tabellen zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Die realen, momentanen Resonanzfrequenzen können bei Anregung alternativ auch mit Sensoren, welche in die Maschine integriert sind, ermittelt und berechnet werden. Demgegenüber steht die Performance der Steuerungshardware, die heutzutage hoch genug ist um Resonanzfrequenzen aus Simulationsmodellen auch online auf der Steuerung zu identifizieren. Der Vorteil dieser Methode liegt vor allem darin, dass teure Sensorik und aufwändige Messvorgänge vermieden werden. In der Arbeit wird aus diesen Gründe eine Methodik untersucht, die eine Online-Identifikation von Resonanzfrequenzen anhand von Simulationsmodellen erlaubt. Diese Methode soll neue Möglichkeiten bieten, um bestehende Schwingungsvermeidungsalgorithmen mit Informationen zu versorgen, wodurch eine Verbesserung der Genauigkeit der Maschinen angestrebt wird. Der Fokus der Arbeit liegt dabei auf der schnellen Berechnung von Maschineneigenschaften, welche auf Genauigkeit und Effizienz hin untersucht werden und für die Schwingungsvermeidung {{verwendet}} werden. By reducing mass in {{machine components}} {{it is possible}} to minimize the energy consumption during the movement of the machine. Unfortunately this leads often to a higher compliance with less damping in the machine components. With standard dynamics in positioning a higher tendency to vibrations of the machine can be expected. Advanced open- and closed loop control concepts are technically capable of providing good disturbance rejection for low damped machines mechatronically, but they have often been rejected by the manufacturing industry because of the strong theoretical background and expert knowledge which is required for their application to practical problems. For the usage of the techniques the knowledge of the machine properties, i. e. eigenfrequency and damping, is necessary. There are different vibration avoidance techniques which require even the knowledge of the instantaneous machine properties or the upcoming machine properties as scheduling input to the controller. To minimize the effort for acquiring information about those properties through measurement and storing the resulting large amounts of data on a machine control, simulation models can be used to identify the behaviour. Nowadays, simulation models are typically created during the design of a machine. Those models, which are usually FE-models, can be used to support the vibration suppression techniques. Helpful seems the deployment in the PC-based control technique. Todays control devices typically use just a small amount of their computing power to control the machine. Therefore, the idea arises to use the standard PC-based control device and integrate a simulation environment. On this environment simulation models from the engineering process can be used to identify the instantaneous machine behaviour depending on the pose of the machine. The present work deals with the integration of standard FE-models into a newly developed simulation environment on the control device. Here techniques have been developed to feed vibration suppression techniques with information about the instantaneous and upcoming machine behaviour calculated by the model. Especially in production machines long distance travel of axes have a high impact on the machine behaviour. To represent this long distance travel of axes in the flexible multi-body simulation componentwise modelling of FE-models can be used and coupled depending on the actual pose of the machine. The coupling of those components is done between the input/output nodes of the single components. To have an accurate representation of the model, typically a high number of nodes are necessary. A mathematical technique for coupling the components has been established in the work for a state space model, which integrates all coupling information into the system matrix. The technique is based on the so called penalty technique, where spring and dampers are used as coupling elements. The coupling is done in a short cycle time to always achieve a most accurate pose dependent complete model. For a fast identification of the complete model small matrices allow a faster calculation. Therefore, reduction techniques need to be investigated and evaluated, which are suitable for the identification. Here, several techniques have been analyzed and the modal reduction has been detected to be the technique with the highest possible reduction and is mature enough to be used in industry. The good reduction capability results {{from the fact that the}} size of the resulting system matrix is not dependent on the number of input/output nodes. Another important benefit of the modal reduction technique appears in the resulting matrix in state space form, which is sparse and diagonally occupied. The evaluation of the technique has been done on an academic example with a mass, which travels along a simple beam. Here, comparisons have been made between a coupled model in a FE-tool and the coupling between two reduced FE-models in a CACE-tool. To identify the actual system behaviour, i. e. eigenfrequencies and the damping rates, the complete model needs to undergo an eigenvalue calculation within short cycles. Therefore, the investigations of the work are focused on finding an eigenvalue method, which calculates eigenvalues efficiently for small to middle sized matrices. The most suitable method – the so called QR-algorithm with double shift – has been identified. For this method a fast calculation of eigenvalues could be shown under real-time conditions. The method itself is not real-time capable, because it is iteratively calculating the eigenvalues. Since eigenvalues do not change rapidly within the short cycle times, they can be used as starting values for the next cycle step. It could be shown, that by indicating the previously calculated eigenvalues a faster calculation of a single eigenvalue is possible instead of calculating all eigenvalues. The results show that a calculation of single eigenvalues as well as all eigenvalues of a reduced system is possible in a cycle time of milliseconds on a standard PC. Tests have been made on an academic example under real-time conditions. All the algorithms need to run on the control device on a simulation environment. Thus, an already existing simulation environment i. e. the virtuos solver of the company ISG has been modified to run as a real-time task on the control device. Data exchange with the CNC and the PLC can be made as well in real-time. For safety reasons a special watchdog clamp is integrated into the control architecture into the safety circuit, to avoid damage of the machine or harm of users, in case of simulation- or model calculation errors. The user interface of the simulation environment has been upgraded to import modally reduced FE-models from a FE-tool and easily combine different models depending on their aggregation. The combination is arranged in a block structure typically found in CACE-tools. By the simple usage it is made sure that it will be adopted by industry. To test the method together with the vibration suppression techniques a <b>test</b> <b>rack</b> has been developed and assembled, which consists of two linear axes and a mass, which represents a processing head. The machine has been modelled componentwise as FE-models and integrated into the control device following the method, which has been developed. The results under real-time conditions show, that a fast calculation of the system behaviour is possible in a time scale of milliseconds and therefore is useful for the foreseen vibration suppression techniques. Finally, vibration suppression has been used to show the benefits of the method. Here the simple method of jerk limitation has been employed, which is already integrated in the CNC. The jerk limits have been set by the data which is gained from the model. By this the vibrations of the machine could be highly suppressed especially under dynamic movements...|$|E

40|$|While {{the design}} and {{technology}} of conventional low rise light framed residential structures are relatively simple, their response to lateral loading is quite complex. This {{is due to the}} high degree of redundancy, the irregular geometry and interaction between the structural and non-structural components. In addition, the designated lateral bracing elements within one structure may exhibit significantly different behaviour due to the different bracing actions and different materials. This paper focuses on the bracing capacity of plasterboard clad walls which could be considered either structural or non-structural. While such walls may be installed purely as partition walls, they may provide lateral strength and stiffness due to the complex load paths. The paper presents in detail the possible load transfer mechanisms to a variety of typical walls. It also highlights the difficulty with performing <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> on isolated walls due to the complex boundary conditions surrounding walls in real structures.
