5|$|A {{new video}} review slot was also {{introduced}} hosted by Ball called Hit, Miss Or Maybe in which three celebrities would review {{three of the}} latest pop videos and decide whether they <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a hit, a miss or a maybe.|$|E
5|$|The Cowboys {{were about}} a block {{and a half}} from the West End Corral at 2nd Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom's wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later testified that he thought Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> departing if they were leaving town.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} destruction caused to {{the city}} by the tornado was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch of Main Street between First and Fourth Street lined with stores, offices and tenements built of brick and stone. Because of the direction the storm had approached the city from and the angle at which it entered the city, the tornado virtually swallowed the entire business district. It was here that {{a large majority of}} the fatalities occurred, as many of those who <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safe {{within the confines of the}} reinforced structures were killed by cascades of falling debris as the buildings on Main Street were swept away. A 1.5-ton safe from the city bank was thrown a full block away. Probably one of the greatest demonstrations of the tornado's strength was seen at the Nicollet Hotel, a newly constructed three-story brick building located adjacent to the Willow River. The tornado swept the building clean down to the foundation, killing at least five people. Almost simultaneously, the town's Methodist Church was completely obliterated, the only remnant being the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet from the church foundation. As the tornado cleared Main Street, it tore the iron-frame bridge spanning the Willow River from its fitting and onto the adjacent riverbank in a twisted heap. The City Hall was completely flattened, the adjacent water tower sent toppling to the northeast and dumping its contents into First Street and transforming it into a muddy deluge. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working class residents lived. As many as forty homes in this neighborhood were completely obliterated, leaving the neighborhood virtually unrecognizable. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was laid to ruins.|$|E

25|$|A serious {{design fault}} in these {{locomotives}} was their very high unsprung weight of 33 tons. Geared motors {{had not been}} used as it was <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> noisy {{in the confines of}} a tunnel. This resulted in serious problems with noise and vibration. Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the unsprung weight to 11 tons.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the Holt Government {{amended the}} {{constitution}} to alter section 51 (xxvi) and remove section 127. This gave the federal government the power to legislate specifically for Indigenous Australians, and also allowed indigenous people to be enumerated in the census. The constitutional amendments required a referendum before they could be enacted, which passed with over 90% of the vote; it remains the largest referendum majority in Australian history. Holt personally considered the amendments unnecessary and mostly symbolic, but <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> well received {{by the international community}} (particularly Asia). According to Barrie Dexter, he was privately shocked by the referendum result, having been uncertain whether it would even pass.|$|E
500|$|The rebellion's leaders—with the {{exception}} of Paul Revere and Joseph Warren—had all left Boston by April 8. [...] They had received word of Dartmouth's secret instructions to General Gage from sources in London well before they reached Gage himself. [...] Adams and Hancock had fled Boston {{to the home of}} one of Hancock's relatives in Lexington, where they <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safe from the immediate threat of arrest.|$|E
60|$|Jim <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> {{warranted}} {{in building}} a shanty at the proposed halting-place, unless loose brush could be found, since the noise of an axe might betray their whereabouts, and he also decided against a fire.|$|R

6000|$|Ruby <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> far {{wrong in}} supposing them a {{pleasure}} party. He objected, mentally, however, to Minnie being styled a [...] "woman"--not {{that he would}} have had her called a man, but he thought that girl <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> more suitable--angel, perhaps, the most appropriate term of all.|$|R
500|$|Lafount {{believed}} that radio could help {{bring about a}} sense of national unity, which he favored, and that [...] "common sources of entertainment" [...] were among those characteristics that [...] "constitute bonds for making our people homogenous." [...] However, he {{believed that}} radio programming should be based upon what listeners in the mass wanted to hear, and not upon what some central authority (such as the BBC in the English model) <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best off hearing.|$|E
500|$|Ashley C. Williams as Lindsay, an American tourist and {{the central}} section of the centipede. Auditioning for the roles of Jenny and Lindsay took place in New York City. Six said during the auditioning process, many actresses walked out of {{readings}} in disgust after hearing the full nature of the role. Others <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able {{to take on the}} role, but found it was [...] "too much" [...] for them once they got onto their hands and knees behind another actor. Williams expressed concerns about the nudity expected of her in the film, but took the role when she was assured it would be modest and of a non-sexual nature.|$|E
500|$|Farrar {{settled on}} the {{preliminary}} look of the wave, and graphics supervisor Jay Riddle used Adobe Photoshop on a Macintosh to establish the final color scheme. Initially the team <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{able to use the}} same methods to create the wave that hits the Excelsior, but found that it did not convey the scale of the wave—in Riddle's words, [...] "this thing had to look really enormous." [...] The shot was created by manipulating two curved pieces of computer geometry, expanding them as they approached the camera's view. Textures that changed every frame were added to the main wave body and over the top of it to give the impression of great speed. Motion control footage of the Excelsior was then scanned into the computer system and made to interact with the digital wave. ILM's [...] "Praxis effect" [...] shockwave became a common feature in science fiction films depicting the destruction of large objects.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{segments}} were incredibly rare in {{episodes of}} the third season, with no 'What Have We Learnt from Current Affairs This Week?' or 'Ad Road Test' segments, despite them being the most popular.

500|$|For {{the naked}} scenes, Spears cleared the set, leaving only Kahn, Blackburn and Rushing {{with her to}} shoot the sequence. Spears also shot scenes {{in which she had}} to dance through a hallway of {{imaginary}} lasers in front of a green screen, something that Kahn deemed as [...] "incredible to watch". The last few scenes of the video in which Spears murders her boyfriend, concerned Kahn, who <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> censored. He explained [...] "the trick was to make it look pop at the same time" [...] and told Henderson [...] "'Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears?'". According to Kahn, the hint of a smile that appears on Henderson's face before Spears pours the poison into his mouth was what managed to get the shot past censors. Although Spears was at first going {{to be involved in the}} editing process with Blackburn, she did not contact Kahn after the media scandal over her wedding in Las Vegas. [...] "Toxic" [...] is Spears's most expensive music video to date, at a cost of $1 million.|$|E
500|$|Lotus Engineering, a {{consultancy}} {{group of}} British sports carmaker Lotus Cars, partnered in 2009 with Harman Becker, {{a producer of}} audio systems, to develop and commercialize a synthetic automotive audio systems. Lotus has worked {{on a number of}} hybrid and electric vehicles and its engineers <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safer if these vehicles made a noise while moving around the factory. Originally developed to cancel out intrusive noises inside a car, the noise canceling system was adapted so that it could also simulate engine sounds that change with speed and use of the throttle, providing audible [...] "feedback" [...] to drivers of vehicles with a silent engine. At the same time, and through the addition of external speakers, the sound system allows pedestrians to hear the noise too, but optionally there can be a different sound within the car from the one that is emitted for the outside. Lotus used a Toyota Prius to demonstrate the device but did not reveal if it intended to bring this technology to market.|$|E
500|$|In late 2010 Jack P. Shepherd, {{who plays}} fellow {{character}} David Platt, revealed {{his desire for}} more scenes with Lane as he thought that they worked well together. In January2011 {{it was announced that}} Kylie would marry David in a [...] "shock storyline". Revealing the news whilst interviewed on talk show Loose Women, Lane said that the pair would meet off-screen in Tenerife. Though she had not read the scripts, Lane <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "a really good combination". Coronation Street publicity said it would make [...] "exciting viewing" [...] for fans. They further stated: [...] "Kylie and David are trouble as individuals so the thought {{of the two of them}} getting together is a nightmare prospect for both their families [...] there is no end to the trouble they will cause for everyone." [...] Lane also revealed that the storyline was implemented because there was no other plausible way for Kylie to return. They did not carry on with the scenario with Becky and Steve, because the viewers needed [...] "something new". Lane was happy with the direction of the storyline because it paved the way for more [...] "explosive" [...] material. Kylie was also tipped to be the one in control of the relationship. She also acknowledged that certain aspects of their relationship would mirror Becky and Steve's relationship, in the sense that when Kylie is with David, a [...] "loved up" [...] nicer side to Kylie surfaces.|$|E

2500|$|On July 4, 1778, the Rev. Mather's son, Joseph, {{along with}} his wife and daughter, moved into the home he had just built on the {{northwest}} corner of what is now Mansfield Road and Brookside Road (then called [...] "Gracious Street"). Since it was farther from the shore, the family <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safe from Tory raiders, and Mrs. Mather encouraged friends and family to store valuables there {{for the duration of the}} war. That was a mistake.|$|E
2500|$|In 1700 and after, French Huguenot settlers, {{who were}} Protestant, {{came to the}} area in the Virginia Colony to escape Catholic {{religious}} persecution in France. Most came from London, where they had resettled as refugees. Although the Crown had offered the French land in Lower Norfolk County, the governor of the colony and William Byrd offered them the village of Manakin Town, which had been abandoned by the Monacan. Byrd and the governor intended to use the French as a buffer settlement, and <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> easier to control apart from the English. The location was about [...] above the head of navigation on the James River at what became Richmond. The French, many of whom were artisans and merchants, struggled to survive on the isolated frontier. The terrain was hilly and largely wooded, and shipping of farm products such as tobacco crops was not easy.|$|E
2500|$|Aqil al-Turehi {{said that}} he [...] "feel furious when I think that this gang of Jim McCormick and the Iraqis working with him killed my people by {{creating}} false security and selling such a useless device". In one incident, a vehicle carrying rockets and missiles travelled undetected through 23 Baghdad checkpoints equipped with the ADE 651. The {{false sense of security}} provided by the device had catastrophic effects for many Iraqi people, hundreds of whom were killed in bombings that the ADE 651 failed to prevent. The victim of one such bombing, 21-year-old Haneen Alwan, told the BBC that her life had been destroyed after she was caught in a bomb attack which caused injuries that killed her unborn child and prompted her husband to divorce her because of her extensive burns, which have so far required her to undergo 59 operations. She said: [...] "When people passed through checkpoints using these devices, they <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safe. But they are useless. The man who sold them has no conscience. He is morally bankrupt. How could he sell them just for money and destroy other people's lives?" ...|$|E
50|$|Rick Ray was {{a program}} manager at WCCB in Charlotte when he {{proposed}} that WCCB produce more basketball games. Ray <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very profitable for WCCB, given North Carolina's {{reputation as a}} college basketball hotbed. However, station management turned him down. Not long after setting up shop, Ray put together an early-season basketball tournament which became the Great Alaska Shootout.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the day of}} his wedding, Imogen told Daniel {{that she}} was in love with him. Phillipps commented that Daniel took Imogen's {{confession}} on board and just went with it. However, after they became trapped in a well, things became awkward between them and they talked it through. Phillipps quipped [...] "poor little Imogen gets let down gently yet again." [...] Both Daniel and Imogen <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> found quickly, but when someone shut the grill and water was pumped into the well, they realised that they might die down there. However, they were eventually rescued and Phillipps joked that he was relieved that he still had a job. He added that he enjoyed working on the storyline with Kaplan. When Daniel and Amber ended their relationship for a second time, an Inside Soap columnist noted that Daniel was [...] "understandably" [...] upset by the break up. In an effort to cheer Daniel up, Imogen suggested a day out at a local nature reserve. Daniel thanked Imogen with a kiss, after realising his feelings for her. However, Imogen did not react well as she was unsure if Daniel actually liked her, or she was just his [...] "rebound girl".|$|E
