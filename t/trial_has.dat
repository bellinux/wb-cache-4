5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the <b>trial</b> <b>has</b> seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evidence}} of bias [...] weakens {{the findings of}} our original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, {{a considerable number of}} new homeopathy <b>trials</b> <b>have</b> been published. The fact that a number of the new high-quality <b>trials</b> ... <b>have</b> negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most [...] "original" [...] subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous <b>trials</b> <b>have</b> less-promising results. It seems, therefore, likely that our meta-analysis at least overestimated the effects of homeopathic treatments.|$|R

25|$|Direct nose-to-brain drug {{delivery}} is being explored {{as a means}} to achieve higher, and hopefully more effective, drug concentrations in the brain. A clinical phase I/II study with glioblastoma patients in Brazil investigated the natural compound perillyl alcohol for intranasal delivery as an aerosol.

25|$|One {{clinical}} study has demonstrated {{the efficacy of}} IV lidocaine or oral mexilitine, though {{it should be noted}} that differences between the primary and secondary forms were not studied. Another <b>trial</b> <b>has</b> shown promise for misoprostol, while other have shown that gabapentin, venlafaxine and oral magnesium may also be effective, but no further testing was carried out as newer research superseded this combination.|$|E

25|$|When {{symptoms}} are present, topical anesthetics {{can be used}} to provide temporary relief. Other medications that have been used to manage the symptoms include antihistamines, corticosteroids or anxiolytics, but these drugs have not been formally assessed for efficacy in geographic tongue.

One uncontrolled <b>trial</b> <b>has</b> shown some benefit in controlling the symptoms of geographic tongue.|$|E

Rexin G represents a nanopharmaceutical in which the nanomaterial, virus was prefabricated by nature. Phase I and II clinical <b>trials</b> <b>have</b> been done in united states between the years 2007 and 2012. Total six clinical <b>trials</b> <b>have</b> been made to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Rexin G, in which 4 <b>trials</b> <b>have</b> been completed and 2 have been eliminated.

50|$|PubMed {{is another}} {{resource}} {{managed by the}} National Library of Medicine. A trial with an NCT identification number that is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov {{can be linked to}} a journal article with an PubMed identification number (PMID). Such link is created either by the author of the journal article by mentioning the trial ID in the abstract (abstract trial-article link) or by the trial record manager when the registry record is updated with a PMID of an article that reports trial results (registry trial-article link). A 2013 study analyzing 8907 interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov found that 23.2% of <b>trials</b> <b>had</b> abstract-linked result articles and 7.3% of <b>trials</b> <b>had</b> registry-linked articles. 2.7% of <b>trials</b> <b>had</b> both types of links. Most trials are linked to a single result article (76.4%). The study also found that 72.2% of <b>trials</b> <b>had</b> no formal linked result article.|$|R
25|$|Tianeptine {{has been}} found to be {{effective}} in depression in Parkinson's disease and in post-traumatic stress disorder of which it was as safe and effective as fluoxetine and moclobemide. A clinical <b>trial</b> <b>has</b> been conducted to compare its efficacy and tolerability with amitriptyline in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. The results of this trial showed that tianeptine was at least as effective as amitriptyline and produced less prominent adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{statutory}} new trial motions, the availability of direct appeal, {{and the expansion of}} the scope of the writ of habeas corpus, writs of coram nobis had, by the 1930's, become a remedy practically obsolete except in the most rare of instances and applicable to only a very limited class of cases.
