40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} the {{transient}} {{behavior of a}} level dependent PH/PH/ 1 /K queue during <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period. We derive in closed-form the joint transform {{of the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period, <b>the</b> number of customers served during <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period, and <b>the</b> number of losses during <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period. We differentiate between two types of losses: the overflow losses that are due to a full queue and the losses due to an admission controller. For the M/PH/ 1 /K, M/PH/ 1 /K under a threshold policy, and PH/M/ 1 /K queues we determine simple expressions for their joint transform...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithmic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period for <b>the</b> M/M/c queueing system. By setting <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period {{equal to the}} time interval during which at least one server is busy, we develop a first step analysis which gives the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period as <b>the</b> solution of a finite system of linear equations. This approach is useful in obtaining a suitable recursive procedure for computing the moments {{of the length of}} a <b>busy</b> period and <b>the</b> number of customers served during it. The maximum entropy formalism is then used to analyse what is the influence of a given set of moments on the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period and to estimate <b>the</b> true <b>busy</b> period distribution. Our study supplements a recent work of Daley and Servi (1998) and other studies where <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period of a multiserver queue follows a different definition, i. e., a <b>busy</b> period is <b>the</b> time interval during which all servers are engaged. ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>busy</b> hour is {{determined}} by fitting a horizontal line segment equivalent to one hour under the traffic load curve about the peak load point. If the service time interval is less than 60 minutes, <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> hour is <b>the</b> 60-minute interval that contains the service timer interval.
