At the time, KLRE only broadcast at 40,000 watts, and the addition of KUAR brought NPR programming to large portions of central Arkansas that hadn't received it before. In 1988, all NPR news and talk programming moved to KUAR during the day, while KLRE began running exclusively classical music.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for generating stylized artistic rendering of caricatures from a given face image, {{with the ability to}} map any one of the main six expressions and control the degree of its expressiveness on the generated caricature. Our method achieves this by manipulating the facial appearance and expressivity of the caricature, using quadratic deformation model representations of facial expressions. A stroke-based nonphotorealistic rendering (NPR) engine is developed to generate the output caricature that appears to be a sketch of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> image. <b>The</b> <b>NPR</b> engine segments the defined rendering path and generates rectangular strokes that approximate each segment. The stroke properties are computed by applying geometric image moments on each segment. To enhance the overall appearance of the caricature, extra strokes are randomly positioned around the rendering path. The results show that from an input neutral facial image, expressive rendered caricatures are generated for the facial expressions neutral, smile, sad, fear, surprise, disgust, and anger. Our approach produces very expressive artistically rendered caricatures, and could lead to future research directions in further extending the method to produce pencil sketch rendering of images or rendering 3 D characters to generate cartoon-like 3 D characters...|$|R

30|$|We {{describe}} {{the effect of}} commitment operations on trust. Before we {{describe the}} effects, let us consider some situations wherein a commitment exists from a debtor toward a creditor. Effect of discharge. When a commitment is discharged, the creditor’s trust for the debtor increases. Effect of violation. When a commitment is violated, the creditor’s trust in the debtor decreases. Effect of delegation and discharge. When a commitment is delegated by <b>the</b> <b>original</b> debtor to a new debtor, and the new debtor satisfies it, the creditor’s trust in both <b>the</b> <b>original</b> and <b>the</b> new debtor increases. Effect of delegation and violation. When a commitment is delegated from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> debtor to a new debtor and the new debtor violates it, the creditor’s trust in both <b>the</b> <b>original</b> and <b>the</b> new debtor decreases. Effect of assignment and discharge. When the commitment is assigned from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> creditor to a new creditor and <b>the</b> <b>original</b> debtor discharges it, the trust of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> and new creditor for <b>the</b> <b>original</b> debtor increases. Effect of assignment and violation.
