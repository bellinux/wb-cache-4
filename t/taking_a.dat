5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> long time. Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E

50|$|The drift-plus-penalty {{algorithm}} (defined below) makes control actions every slot t that greedily {{minimize the}} right-hand-side {{of the above}} inequality. Intuitively, <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> action that minimizes the drift alone would be beneficial in terms of queue stability but would not minimize time average penalty. <b>Taking</b> <b>an</b> action that minimizes the penalty alone would not necessarily stabilize the queues. Thus, <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> action to minimize the weighted sum incorporates both objectives of queue stability and penalty minimization. The weight V can be tuned to place more or less emphasis on penalty minimization, which results in a performance tradeoff.|$|R

Most cases of cervical cancer are detected in this way, without having caused any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include vaginal bleeding, discharge, or discomfort.|$|E
