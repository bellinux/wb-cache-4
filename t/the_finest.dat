Soon afterwards he left Venice for Florence, with the intention of creating a full-size replica of Titian's Venus of Urbino, considered one of <b>the</b> <b>finest</b> works of the Venetian school of painting. Although the Uffizi management were hostile to this proposal, after 10 days of negotiations they allowed Etty to create his copy. His contemporaries considered it among <b>the</b> <b>finest</b> copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy. In late July Etty began the journey home, pausing for a further two months in Venice. On 8October 1823 Etty finally left Venice, travelling via Mantua and Geneva to Paris.|$|E

If these measures do not result into the full collection of <b>the</b> <b>fine,</b> <b>the</b> bailiff will return the case to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will order the police to arrest the convict, in order to execute the earlier written substitute imprisonment.
