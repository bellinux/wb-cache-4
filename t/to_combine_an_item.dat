40|$|This paper {{presents}} Ant colony optimization metaheuristic {{solution for}} Bin packing problem (BPP). In the BPP, {{the aim is}} <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> <b>a</b> set of <b>items</b> into bins of a certain capacity so as to minimize {{the total number of}} bins. The bin packing is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Only very little instances can be solved exactly, so for real-world problems we have to rely on heuristic solution methods. We are proposing an ant based optimization which was introduced by Dorigo in 1992, which in the past proved appropriate to solve many optimization problems. This ACO is inspired by the path-finding abilities of real ant colonies. It <b>combines</b> <b>an</b> artificial pheromone trail with simple heuristic information to stochastically build new solutions. This paper explores the ability of the ACO algorithm to balance between bins and objects in its decision making process. The solution quality and time to solution make ACO competitive as an optimization technique for NP-hard problems in which various factors such as cost and length are involved. [1][2...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} two {{investigations}} {{designed to determine}} the generalizability of source credibility scales for immediate superiors across organizati, [...] ,al contexts. Semantic differential-type scales {{that have been found}} to load on factors of course credibility in previous studies were <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>an</b> <b>item</b> pool for this investigation. In the first investigation, three groups of subjects were asked to vzspond to these scales as they referred to their immediate superior. Subjects were drawn from private industry, the Civil Service Commission, and the Department of the Navy. In the second investigation, 40 scale items were drawn from the original item pool and submitted to subjects across four organizations: private industry, Civil Service Commissior, Navy Department, and retail outlets. The results of the study indicate that there are four meaningful and statistically independent dimensions for the measurement of the source credibility of immediate superiors in an organizational setting.
