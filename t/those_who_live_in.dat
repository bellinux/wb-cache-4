5|$|There {{are many}} more {{citizens}} who live in areas corresponding to classes 1–3 than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the areas corresponding to classes 5 and 6. For example, in Bogotá 73% of the population live in zones of classes 1–3, whereas only 10% live in zones classified as 5 and 6. Consequently, the tariff system permanently causes deficits which require subsidies paid by the national government.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{preventable}} with the polio vaccine; however, {{a number of}} doses are required {{for it to be}} effective. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> countries where the disease is occurring. Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{protective}} effect {{does not begin}} immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This {{is due to the}} cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother. The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E

Fishing is the trade of choice.|$|E

25|$|Although usually invisible, a kobold can {{materialize}} in {{the form}} of an animal, fire, a human being, and a candle.

5000|$|From {{the days}} of the Spanish conquest, some Filipinos had {{received}} Spanish surnames. Most people, however, had no surnames, which caused confusion. On Wednesday, November 21, 1849, Clavería issued a decree sending a long lists of Spanish and local surnames to the chiefs of the provinces. These were sent out to the different towns, and given to the locals who had no surnames. In many towns, all the names for people in that town began with the same letter of the alphabet. [...] For instance, surnames starting with [...] "A" [...] applies for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Alimodian while <b>those</b> starting [...] "M" [...] apply for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Miagao.|$|R

25|$|Ferrin are small, ratlike humanoids {{who live}} across the {{temperate}} world.

25|$|With the {{exception}} of New Zealand, the majority of independent Polynesian islands derive much of their income from foreign aid and remittances from <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> other countries. Some encourage their young people to go where they can earn good money to remit to their stay-at-home relatives. Many Polynesian locations, such as Easter Island, supplement this with tourism income. Some have more unusual sources of income, such as Tuvalu which marketed its '.tv' internet top-level domain name or the Cooks that relied on postage stamp sales.|$|E
25|$|Almost 90% of {{maternal}} deaths during childbirth occur in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, compared {{to less than}} 1% in the developed world. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> poverty have {{also been shown to}} have a far greater likelihood of having or incurring a disability within their lifetime. Infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis can perpetuate poverty by diverting health and economic resources from investment and productivity; malaria decreases GDP growth by up to 1.3% in some developing nations and AIDS decreases African growth by 0.3–1.5% annually.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} main types of monastics. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> monasteries under a common rule are coenobitic. Each monastery may {{formulate}} its own rule, {{and although there}} are no religious orders in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as Mount Athos are highly influential. Eremitic monks, or hermits, are those who live solitary lives. It is the yearning of many who enter the monastic life to eventually become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most advanced monastics and only when their superiors feel they are ready for it.|$|E
25|$|Other sources may {{use either}} a {{somewhat}} wider definition that states the Pacific coast, not the watershed, is the eastern boundary (thus including the whole Russian Far East) or a somewhat narrower one that limits Siberia to the Siberian Federal District (thus excluding all subjects of other districts).
