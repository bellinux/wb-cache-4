500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall liked Frank's final conversation concerning Fauxlivia's pregnancy, {{praising the}} plot twist's potential to [...] "make for some interesting drama, perhaps even allowing {{the show to}} get past the inevitable mawkishness of most pregnancy stories." [...] However, there was some negative fan feedback concerning the pregnancy storyline. In reaction to this, Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our interpretation of it is that people desperately want to see Olivia and Peter together. And that Fauxlivia having a baby makes Olivia’s life <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> and people are angry because of that. Anything that makes Olivia’s life harder, people seem to be angry at. Olivia is a hero, she will conquer all. She’ll deal." [...] After [...] "Immortality" [...] aired, Joshua Jackson expressed sympathy for fans of the Olivia-Peter relationship, commenting that they [...] "have been taken for quite a ride. He [...] wants to be with her , and in his mind it was her. But in her mind, he {{should have been able to}} tell the difference." ...|$|E

IGN's Chris Carabott {{wrote that}} [...] "if last week's 'Not in Portland' didn't {{get you back}} on the Lost hype train then for goodness' sake the equally outstanding 'Flashes Before Your Eyes' hopefully grabbed your attention." [...] Carabott went on to praise the on-screen chemistry of Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond) and Sonya Walger (Penelope), stating that [...] "their on screen chemistry makes the love between the two characters real and makes their inevitable breakup <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to handle." [...] He also complimented the scene between Desmond and Charles, saying that [...] "it's hard not to feel Desmond's heart crushed when Widmore denies him Penelope's hand in marriage." [...] Josh Spiegel, a writer for CinemaBlend.com, had similar praise. He said that for him [...] "it was a nice change of pace to not see Jack, Kate or Sawyer {{on the show and}} focus more on some of the lesser-known castaways." [...] Spiegel {{went on to say that}} the episode was [...] "fantastic". Mania.com's Stephen Lackey wrote that [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] was an [...] "episode has everything die hard LOST fans expect, riveting plot twists, foreshadowing, and as many questions as answers" ...|$|E

Neil Thompson and Paul Wilkinson left the club, with Wilson bringing in several international calibre players, Slovenia captain Ales Krizan, South African Eric Tinkler, Welshman Darren Barnard and for a club record fee of £1,500,000 Macedonian striker Georgi Hristov.

Probably he and Mrs. Redstart will make their home {{on the edge of}} the Green Forest. They like it better over there, for which I am thankful. There's Mrs Redstart now. Just notice that where Zee Zee is bright orange-y red she is yellow, and instead of a black head she has a gray head and her back is olive-green with a grayish tinge. She isn't nearly as handsome as Zee Zee, but then, that's not to be expected. She lets Zee Zee do the singing and the showing off and she does the work. I expect she'll build that nest with almost no help at all from him. But Zee Zee is a good father, I'll say that much for him. He'll do his share in feeding their babies." ...|$|E

[...] There {{was something in}} this which grated against the schoolmaster's pride, though nothing had been said as to {{which he did not}} know <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> things must meet his ears before the matter could be brought to an end between him and the Doctor. The [...] "Mister" [...] had been prefixed to his name, which had been omitted for {{the last three or four}} months in the friendly intercourse which had taken place between them; and then, though it had been done in the form of agreeing with what he himself had said, the Doctor had made his first complaint by declaring that no man had a right to regard his own moral life as isolated from the lives of others around him. It was as much as to declare at once that he had been wrong in bringing this woman to Bowick, and calling her Mrs. Peacocke. He had said as much himself, but that did not make the censure lighter when it came to him from the mouth of the Doctor. [...] "But come," [...] said the Doctor, getting up from his seat at the table, and throwing himself into an easy-chair, so as to mitigate the austerity of the position; [...] "let us hear the true story. So big a liar as that American gentleman probably never put his foot in this room before." ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Fecaloma is {{a mass of}} feces {{accumulated}} <b>that</b> is <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> in consistency than a fecal impactation. The aim of {{this report}} is to give {{a brief review of}} this entity and discuss the treatment options for these cases. Case presentation: We present the case of a 12 -year-old boy who developed a fecaloma associated with chronic constipation. This is a rare case on a child which was treated by a sigmoid colectomy after failure of conservative measures of evacuation. Conclusion: Fecaloma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with history of chronic constipation and abdominal mass. Background Fecaloma is a mass of feces most frequently noted in the rectum and sigmoid, <b>that</b> is <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> than a fecal impactation due to coprostasis.

5000|$|One {{could argue}} that the trusted {{platform}} module comprises a type of HIDS.

50|$|To help avoid {{shortages}} of these drugs, the U.S. CDC recommended oseltamivir treatment primarily for people hospitalised with pandemic flu; {{people at risk}} of serious flu complications due to underlying medical conditions; and patients at risk of serious flu complications. The CDC warned that the indiscriminate use of antiviral medications to prevent and treat influenza could ease the way for drug-resistant strains to emerge, which would make {{the fight against the}} pandemic <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder.</b> In addition, a British report found that people often failed to complete a full course of the drug or took the medication when not needed.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{government}} {{efforts to}} help regulate the private sector, the employees must still weigh their options. They either expose the company and stand the moral and ethical high ground; or expose the company, lose their job, their reputation and potentially {{the ability to be}} employed again. According to a study at the University of Pennsylvania, out of three hundred whistleblowers studied, sixty nine percent of them had foregone that exact situation; and they were either fired or were forced to retire after taking the ethical high ground. It is outcomes like that which makes it all <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to accurately track how prevalent whistleblowing is in the private sector.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, Goldman {{began to}} work with Marciano. Goldman {{believed}} that a trainer should not interfere with a fighter's natural style, but rather refine and improve it. Accordingly, he {{did not try to}} turn him into a slick jabbing boxer. He also sought to turn Marciano's shortcomings into advantages. His adage was: [...] "If you got a tall fighter, make him taller. If you got a short fighter make him shorter." [...] With Marciano, Goldman made him shorter by teaching him to fight out of crouch. By having him stoop low Goldman made the already low target offered by Marciano <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to hit.|$|E
50|$|While moles are {{typically}} found in tunnel systems, the European mole is not exclusively an underground dweller. In {{the spring and}} early summer when the young moles leave their mothers' burrows they must find new territory. This forces them to leave their burrow and they can either make new tunnel systems or enter existing systems. In the summer time, however, they are likely to burrow much more superficially. The superficial burrowing could be {{due in part to the}} soil <b>that</b> is <b>much</b> <b>harder,</b> which makes burrowing a greater challenge.|$|R
30|$|Given the {{available}} countermeasures to untargeted large-scale attacks, some cybercriminals have instead focused on creating individualized attacks suited to their target. Such attacks {{are much more}} difficult to detect using automated methods, since the criminal typically crafts bespoke communications.

50|$|Consistency {{is defined}} as the degree to which an individual’s social rank {{positions}} that exist within important status hierarchies are at a comparable level. The greater mobility of class systems produces less status consistency. In Canada, for example, most university professors with advanced academic degrees enjoy high social prestige but earn only average salaries. Low status consistency means <b>that</b> classes are <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to define than castes.|$|R
