5|$|Larger drugs (>500 Da) can {{provoke a}} {{neutralizing}} immune response, particularly if <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits {{the effectiveness of}} drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods {{have been developed to}} predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.|$|E

Most regimens have an initial high-intensity phase, followed by a continuation phase (also called a consolidation phase or eradication phase): the high-intensity phase is given first, then the continuation phase, the two phases divided by a slash.|$|E
25|$|Reperfusion {{therapy is}} a medical {{treatment}} to restore blood flow, either through or around, blocked arteries, typically {{after a heart attack}} (myocardial infarction) (MI). Reperfusion therapy includes drugs and surgery. <b>The</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> thrombolytics and fibrinolytics used in a process called thrombolysis. Surgeries performed may be minimally-invasive endovascular procedures such as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), followed by a coronary angioplasty. The angioplasty uses the insertion of a balloon to open up the artery, with the possible additional use of one or more stents. Other surgeries performed are the more invasive bypass surgeries that graft arteries around blockages.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> not mixed {{externally}} {{because that}} can cause them to precipitate. Also, a sequential injection is key to achieve the desired effects in the appropriate order: administration of the phenobarbital essentially renders the person unconscious; the infusion of the pancuronium bromide induces complete paralysis, including that of the lungs and diaphragm rendering the person unable to breathe. If the person being executed were not already completely unconscious, the injection of a highly concentrated solution of potassium chloride could cause severe pain {{at the site of}} the IV line, as well as along the punctured vein, but it interrupts the electrical activity of the heart muscle and causes it to stop beating, bringing about the death of the person being executed.|$|E
25|$|Current {{models of}} ADHD {{suggest that it}} is {{associated}} with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine may be effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. Approximately70% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, generally perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. People with ADHD have an increased risk of substance use disorders, and stimulant medications reduce this risk. Some studies suggest that since ADHD diagnosis is increasing significantly around the world, using the drug may cause more harm than good in some populations with ADHD. This applies to people who potentially may be experiencing a different issue and are misdiagnosed with ADHD. The drug is used to treat symptoms that could be better treated through a different, such as behavioural, intervention. People in this category can then experience negative side-effects of the drug which worsen their condition, and make it harder for them to receive adequate care as providers around them may believe <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> sufficient and the problem lies with the user.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance {{occurs to}} the muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant, and sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines, and upon {{cessation}} a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome occurs. This {{can lead to}} benzodiazepines being taken for longer than originally intended, as people continue to take the drugs {{over a long period}} of time to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Some people abuse benzodiazepines at very high doses and devote a lot of time to doing so, satisfying the diagnostic criteria in DSM IV for substance abuse and dependence. Another group of people include those on low to moderate therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines who do not abuse their benzodiazepines but develop a tolerance and benzodiazepine dependence. A considerable number of individuals using benzodiazepines for insomnia escalate their dosage, sometimes above therapeutically-prescribed dose levels. Tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines has been clearly demonstrated in rats. In humans, there is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their anti-anxiety effects beyond four months of continuous treatment; there is evidence that suggests that long-term use of benzodiazepines may actually worsen anxiety, which in turn may lead to dosage escalation, with one study finding 25% of patients escalated their dosage. Some authors, however, consider benzodiazepines to be effective long-term; however, it is more likely that <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> acting to prevent rebound anxiety withdrawal effects. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxing effects of benzodiazepines occurs within a few weeks in most patients.|$|E

No withdrawal symptoms were seen after 6 months treatment. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> however considered not suitable for agitated patients as it presumably made agitation worse. In January 1986 <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn by its manufacturers for safety reasons.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When {{administered}} to rats, echitamine was absorbed rapidly from the tissues and was detected in circulation within 30 min. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> level reached a maximum value by 2 h and then decreased steadily. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> had completely {{disappeared from the}} blood in 6 h. The presence of echitamine was observed within 2 h in urine and {{the maximum amount of}} <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> excreted between 2 and 4 h. About 90 % of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> excreted in urine in 24 h and <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> could not <b>be</b> detected in urine after 48 h. Along with echitamine, its metabolites were also detected in the urine. Plumbagin was not detected in blood upto 24 h when administered into rats. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> detected in urine within 4 h after administration; a major portion of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> excreted in urine by 24 h and traces of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>were</b> observed in <b>the</b> urine even after 48 h...|$|R

As his health worsens, he drives to a Mexican hospital to get more AZT. Dr. Vass, who has had his American medical license revoked, tells him that the AZT is [...] "poisonous" [...] and [...] "kills every cell it comes into contact with". He instead prescribes ddC and the protein peptide T, which are not approved in the US. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved. It occurs to him that he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients.
