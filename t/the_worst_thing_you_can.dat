Bartley and I haven't had time to change our minds about each other yet. But I'll say a good word for him to you. You're his wife, and it's your part to help him, not to hinder him.

[...] As if this word had reminded her of her head, she turned it from side to side, and got the effect in the glass, first of one ear-ring, and then of the other. Her husband patiently waited, and she now confronted him. [...] "You may as well know first as last, Henshaw, and I want you to prepare yourself for it. Nothing can be done, and you will just have to live through it. Lydia--has come over--on that ship--alone,--with three young men,--and not the shadow--not the ghost--of another woman--on board!" [...] Mrs. Erwin gesticulated with her hand-glass in delivering the words, in a manner at once intensely vivid and intensely solemn, yet somehow falling short of the due tragic effect. Her husband stood pulling his mustache straight down, while his wife turned again to the mirror, and put the final touches to her personal appearance with hands which she had the effect of having desperately washed of all responsibility. He stood so long in this meditative mood that she was obliged to be peremptory with his image in the glass. [...] "Well?" [...] she cried.|$|E

5000|$|John M. Coyne Sr. (November 11, 1916 - July 21, 2014) was {{the mayor}} of Brooklyn, Ohio from 1948 to 1999.

He was reportedly responsible for the country's first seat belt (in 1966) and mobile phone laws for motorists, bringing notoriety to Brooklyn.

2500|$|Pentangle {{are often}} characterised as a folk-rock band. Danny Thompson {{preferred}} {{to describe the}} group as a [...] "folk-jazz band."

When we worked on those in the group, Terry Cox worked out his percussion patterns to match the patterns in the songs exactly. In that respect he was the opposite of a folk-rock drummer." [...] This approach to songs led to the use of unusual time signatures: [...] "Market Song" [...] from Sweet Child moves from 7/4 to 11/4 and 4/4 time, and [...] "Light Flight" [...] from Basket of Light includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1978, rhythm guitarist Bob Weir {{began to}} perform slide guitar parts {{with an eye}} toward variegating the group's sonic palette, with Weir {{concluding}} that [...] "desperation is the mother of invention." [...] Garcia biographer Blair Jackson has also asserted that [...] "the quality of Keith’s playing in the Dead fell off in ’78 and early ’79. It no longer had that sparkle and imagination that marked his best work (’72-’74). Much of what he played in his last year was basic, blocky, chordal stuff. I don’t hear many wrong notes but he’s not exactly out there on the edge taking chances and pushing the others, as he frequently did, in his own quiet way, in his peak Grateful Dead years. I guess <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could say about later-period Keith is that he was just taking up sonic space in the Dead’s overall sound. Did this affect the others? No doubt, though it can’t be measured." ...|$|R
5000|$|On February 2, 2009, Zagel sentenced Lombardo, {{seated in}} a {{wheelchair}} and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, {{to life in prison}} for the convictions. [...] "Mr. Lombardo, you are not like the toxic creature I've seen forming in one of your co-defendants," [...] Zagel told Lombardo, referring to Chicago Outfit hit man Frank Calabrese, Sr., whom Zagel had {{sentenced to life in prison}} the previous week. [...] "You evidence some balance and judgment and based on the evidence before me, some ability to charm people. In the end, we are judged by our actions and not on our wit or our smiles....In cases like these, the things that matter most are <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> we do. <b>The</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have done are terrible, and I see no regret in you. I think you felt you were engaged in a game in which you drew satisfaction in how you played the game....It wasn't a game," [...] and it involved, [...] "the destruction of a human life."

5000|$|Ryan's then girlfriend {{joined the}} band in 2002 as bassist. As he stated in an {{interview}} with WSQU 88.9, [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do for a band... set us back two years." [...] This period would not all be negative, as it would allow Gary and Ryan to refine nearly an album's worth of material. The band would also settle on the name [...] "Stigma" [...] to perform under. The band won multiple contests in this line-up and played many shows, including an opening slot for the reunion performance of local band [...] "Tyranny." [...] In 2004, Ryan's relationship ended, and so did another chapter for the band.|$|E
5000|$|Williams {{was asked}} to become a tennis radio {{commentator}} by BBC executive Cliff Morgan.

[...] Jim White later wrote in a 2016 tribute article for the Daily Telegraph that [...] "Williams's ability to trust the audience to appreciate what was going on was one of his abiding strengths." [...] Williams would later say of Maskell that he remembered [...] "...doing a match on Centre Court in Wimbledon {{for the first time with}} Dan. I was in awe of him. He was such a lovely man.

5000|$|Code Pink {{has also}} joined in vigils at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C. The {{group has been}} criticized for actions at the vigils: the {{criticism}} has centered on tactics such as displaying coffins and chanting aggressive slogans. Speaking about the display of coffins, Kevin Pannell, an amputee and former patient at the hospital, said it [...] "was probably the most distasteful thing I had ever seen. Ever. We went by there one day and I drove by and anti-war protesters had a bunch of flag-draped coffins laid out on the sidewalk. You know that 95 percent of the guys in the hospital bed lost guys whenever they got hurt and survivors' guilt is <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> deal with." [...] To those that faulted aggressive chants and signs, Code Pink responded that certain of the disruptive protesters were not part of their group and that they have asked these protesters to be respectful. Code Pink says {{that the purpose of the}} vigils is to highlight the lack of care for veterans and claims that the vigils have helped spur improvements in that care.|$|E
500|$|MacArthur {{remains a}} {{controversial}} and enigmatic figure. He has been {{portrayed as a}} reactionary, although he was in many respects ahead of his time. He championed a progressive approach to the reconstruction of Japanese society, arguing that all occupations ultimately ended badly for the occupier and the occupied. He was often {{out of step with}} his contemporaries, such as in 1941 when he contended that Nazi Germany could not defeat the Soviet Union, when he argued that North Korea and China were no mere Soviet puppets, and throughout his career in his insistence that the future lay in the Far East. This implicitly rejected White American contemporary notions of their own racial superiority. He always treated Filipino and Japanese leaders with respect as equals. At the same time, his Victorian sensibilities recoiled at leveling Manila with aerial bombing, an attitude the hardened World War II generation regarded as old fashioned. When asked about MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey once said that [...] "The best and <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> hear about him are both true." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “It {{was a long}} hard {{night of}} racing and {{fighting}} for track position,” Johnson said. “Once we got up front, {{we were able to}} hang on for the final eight or nine laps, whatever it was.” Martin Truex Jr. finished ninth after leading a race high 95 laps. “Yeah, definitely not the finish we wanted, obviously, but proud of the guys for the weekend we had, just had good speed all weekend, brought a brand new car here and just proud of that,” Truex Jr. said. “It's kind of disappointing, {{but at the same time}} proud of the way we ran, and I think it's something we can build off of. We should have either stayed out or took new tires. We probably did <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could have done there with just staying out and getting gas only, because we ended up being the last guy with no tires. Everybody else behind us had two and they ate us up on the restart. If we'd have taken two, we probably would have come out sixth, been in a pretty good position.” ...|$|R
