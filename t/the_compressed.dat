5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of <b>the</b> <b>compressed</b> gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E

5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of <b>the</b> <b>compressed</b> air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E
5|$|Many {{superficial}} inspections {{were performed}} on the locomotive in 1980 and it {{was found to be}} in relatively sound mechanical condition. There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation.

5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As <b>the</b> <b>compressed</b> snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} GE invention by Tracy Hall {{uses the}} belt press wherein {{the upper and}} lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to <b>the</b> <b>compressed</b> cell. A variation of the belt press uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure. Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.|$|E

He was the chief caretaker of their R engines until the last R-powered record attempt in 1951, after which his responsibilities centred on Campbell's jet engines. Villa's many responsibilities included installing and removing the engines, repairing and tuning them, and operating <b>the</b> <b>compressed</b> air and magneto for starting them. During the World War II years, he was responsible for the upkeep of Blue Bird K4 and the spare R engines, but unknown to him they had been sold along with K3.

5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>compressed</b> {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape {{during an}} ascent, {{particularly}} a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The air may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the second most common cause of death while diving (drowning being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of cases diagnosed as AGE, with approximate estimates of frequency.|$|E

Character data may contain comments with embedded control characters that makes print out impossible. There may be stray text in an otherwise numeric variable making summarization difficult. Important information may be contained in variables that contain both numeric and character components. Prior to version 9, the undesired information was removed out of the variables by a combination of programming and the use of <b>the</b> <b>COMPRESS</b> function with a long list of characters for the function’s second argument. However, <b>the</b> new <b>COMPRESS</b> function has a third argument that allows the user to remove or retain selected types of data. This argument greatly mitigates the need for extensive programming to remove undesired characters from a text. Further, the second argument of <b>the</b> <b>COMPRESS</b> function can be greatly shorten or even eliminated with the proper use of this third argument.

Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system files. The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of <b>the</b> <b>compressed</b> WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project {{is to develop a}} wrinkle-based method to measure {{mechanical}} properties of thin interfacial polymeric films. Instead of working on a mechanically equilibrium system, this study is focusing on the case where mechanical equilibrium is hard to reach due to the very high viscosity of the bulk phases. This thesis describes an air/viscous polymer system with a few-micron scale thick polymer film placed at the interface. We have developed a method to generate dynamic wrinkle patterns on <b>the</b> film via <b>compressing</b> <b>the</b> high viscous substrate. Two experiment parameters are controlled: the substrate thickness H and <b>the</b> <b>compressing</b> strain rateε ̇. This thesis developed an accurate method to measure H while avoiding the interference from the edge effect of <b>the</b> fluid. <b>The</b> <b>compressing</b> strain rate is calculated upon a Matlab program. We report the value of wrinkle number under different compressing strain rate and different substrate thickness. Critical strains under different compression strain rate and substrate thickness has been obtained via analyzing the strain for the onset wrinkle. We normalize the wrinkle number as well as <b>the</b> <b>compressing</b> strain rate in order to compare them with previous works. With dimensional analysis, a power law relation has been demonstrated between normalized wrinkle number and normalized strain rate. ...|$|R
