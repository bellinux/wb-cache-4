5|$|The last {{match of}} the night was the main event between The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage), {{accompanied}} by Miss Elizabeth, and The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), accompanied by André's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil. Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee. The Mega Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase. After Hogan attacked André the Giant, {{who was on the}} ring apron, The Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After a while, all four men began brawling, and André knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring. Subsequently, as part of the scripted ending to the match, Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura, the referee, and ripped off her skirt to reveal her underwear. While the Mega Bucks were distracted, Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped <b>the</b> <b>Macho</b> Elbow on DiBiase, followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase. As Hogan pinned DiBiase, Ventura, a villainous character aligned with The Mega Bucks (despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner), began an obviously slow three-count. As a result, Savage slammed Ventura's arm down for the third time, indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match.|$|E

40|$|Abridged] We {{estimate}} {{the contribution of}} Massive Compact Halo Objects (Machos) and their stellar progenitors to the mass density of the Universe. If <b>the</b> <b>Machos</b> that have been detected reside in the Halo of our Galaxy, then a simple extrapolation of the Galactic population (out to 50 kpc) of Machos to cosmic scales gives a cosmic density ρ_Macho = (1 - 5) × 10 ^ 9 h ^- 3, which {{in terms of the}} critical density corresponds to Ω_Macho=(0. 0036 - 0. 017) h^- 1. Such a mass density is comparable to the baryon density implied by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. If we take the central values of <b>the</b> estimates, then <b>Machos</b> dominate <b>the</b> baryonic content of the Universe today, with Ω_Macho/Ω_Baryon∼ 0. 7 h. However, the cumulative uncertainties in the density determinations only require that Ω_Macho/Ω_Baryon≥ 1 / 6 h f_gal, where the fraction of galaxies that contain Machos f_gal > 0. 17, and h is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s^- 1 Mpc^- 1. Our best estimate for Ω_Macho is hard to reconcile with the current best estimates of the baryonic content of the intergalactic medium indicated by measurements of the Lyman-α forest. We explore the addition constraints that arise if <b>the</b> <b>Machos</b> are white dwarfs as suggested by the present microlensing data. We discuss the challenges this scenario presents at both the local and cosmic scales, emphasizing in particular the constraints on the required mass budget and nucleosynthesis products (particularly carbon).
