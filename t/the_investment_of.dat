5|$|The {{opposing}} armies met at {{the village}} of Albuera. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing struggle and the French finally withdrew on 18 May. Beresford's army was too battered and exhausted to pursue, but was able to resume <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> Badajoz. Despite Soult's failure to relieve the town, the battle had little strategic effect on the war.

5|$|On 10 January, Seeadler {{departed}} for Bombay, where her boilers were repaired {{in a major}} overhaul. Workers from the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel were sent to do the work. Seeadler was back in service by May, and on 18 May she departed Bombay, arriving in East Africa on 31 May. Cormoran was meanwhile detached from East Africa and allowed to continue to the Pacific. The {{rest of the year}} was uneventful for Seeadler, though she became briefly involved in political developments in East Africa. The British Jameson Raid into the Transvaal in December 1895 threatened some 15,000 German nationals in the Transvaal, along with <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> 500million gold marks in the country. The German governor considered ordering Seeadler to contribute a landing force to protect the German consul in Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, but the defeat of the Jameson Raid rendered the plan redundant. Seeadler nevertheless remained in East Africa while tensions cooled. In mid-February 1896, she went to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul.|$|E
30|$|Figure  1 {{presents}} the percentage change in <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government, households, and {{rest of the}} world from the benchmark. It is obvious from the figure that <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government and households were positive, whereas <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the world}} were negative. This implies that after <b>the</b> simulation, <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> government and households increased continuously, whereas <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the world declined. It {{is important to note that}} <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> here represented both real and financial <b>investments.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> figure shows that change in government investments was considerably greater than <b>the</b> change in <b>investments</b> by households. This result was expected because the ECB’s action assumed the government would increase its expenditure after receiving money from the bank’s bond purchases. Therefore, the percentage change in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> government <b>investments</b> was greater than the change in household investments.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the recent financial crisis has affected <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs). Using a novel dataset of private firms from the Netherlands for the period of 2004 – 2012 and controlling for major firm-specific variables, we find that <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> Dutch SMEs suffered a significant decline during the financial crisis. We also find that both internal and external financing have significant positive relationships with <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> SMEs during <b>the</b> pre-crisis as well as the crisis periods. However, these two financing sources exhibit no differential impact during the crisis. The findings of the study lend some relief to those practitioners and policymakers who are concerned that the contraction in bank lending during the economic crisis has a differential damaging impact on <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> SMEs...|$|R
5|$|The {{successes of}} the 1st Ukrainian Front during the first nine days of the battle meant that by 25 April, they were occupying large swathes of the area south and {{south-west}} of Berlin. Their spearheads had met elements of the 1st Belorussian Front west of Berlin, completing <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> the city. Meanwhile, the 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army in 1st Ukrainian Front made contact with the 69th Infantry Division (United States) of the United States First Army near Torgau, on the Elbe River. These manoeuvres had broken the German forces south of Berlin into three parts. The German IX Army was surrounded in the Halbe pocket. Wenck's XII Army, obeying Hitler's command of 22 April, was attempting to force its way into Berlin from the south-west but met stiff resistance from 1st Ukrainian Front around Potsdam. Schörner's Army Group Centre was forced {{to withdraw from the}} Battle of Berlin, along its lines of communications towards Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1367 and September 1370 repairs costing £2,262 {{were carried}} out. Records show that {{sections}} of the curtain wall were repaired and two mural towers built, one of them replacing a tower on the same site. The towers were positioned north-east of the keep and still stand. Although more work was undertaken between 1370 and 1377, the year of Edward's death, what it consisted of is unknown. The royal apartments built during HenryIII's reign were never repaired; {{it has been suggested}} this was because by the 14thcentury, when considerable sums were being spent on repairs elsewhere in the castle, Rochester had fallen out of favour as a royal residence. As the castle's importance as a high-status residence waned, its role as a barracks and administrative centre came to the fore. The reign of RichardII (1377–1400) saw <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> £500 in repairing the castle. This was in part in response to French raids on England's southern coast during the Hundred Years' War as England's fortunes in the conflict worsened. The most significant of these works was the construction of a tower {{at the north end of}} the castle, overlooking the bridge over the Medway. Records document the sum of £350 spent on a new tower between 1378 and 1383, and it mostly likely refers to the one guarding the bridge. Rochester Castle saw fighting for the final time during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. It was besieged and captured by a group of rebels who plundered the castle and released a prisoner. It has been suggested that the £66 10s spent in 1384–1388 and the £91 13s spent in 1395–1397 may have been partially in response to damage incurred during the revolt.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the inaugural}} event of The International, several other eSport events began to {{transition}} from Defense of the Ancients to Dota 2, including the Electronic Sports World Cup. DreamHack would also support Dota 2 in 2011, following a year without {{support for the}} original, on account of other MOBA titles such as Heroes of Newerth and League of Legends. By {{the end of its}} first year in its beta phase, Dota 2 was one of the highest-paying eSport titles of 2011, second only to StarCraft II. In 2012, Dota 2 began as an official title for the World Cyber Games annual event at World Cyber Games 2012. The Electronic Sports League (ESL) began a seasonal tournament for Dota 2 called the RaidCall EMS One in 2013, which was the largest independent tournament for Dota 2 by the beginning of 2013. Beginning in September 2013, the Association for Chinese eSports began a league, called the WPC ACE Dota 2 League, which had the largest third-party prize pool in Dota 2 eSports history at the time. At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013, Nexon announced <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> two billion South Korean won, (approximately $1.7 million), into amateur and professional leagues in South Korea for 2013, to coincide with the launch of their distribution agreement in the fall of that year. Modeled after the interactive compendium for The International, Valve introduced a compendium third-party tournament organizers could sell, beginning with DreamLeague in February 2014. In February 2015, the Valve-sponsored Dota 2 Asia Championships was held in Shanghai with a prize pool of over $3 million, raised through compendium sales.|$|E
