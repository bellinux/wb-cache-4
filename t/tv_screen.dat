5|$|In {{the various}} rooms, she meets men wearing vest tops with their faces painted white with black eyes {{staring at her}} as she passes down the corridor. Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is marcelled and blonde.|$|E
5|$|Monk is briefly {{separated}} from the group after accidentally boarding the wrong train at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. While reuniting with his partners he notices Steven Leight (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) being interviewed on a <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> in Times Square about the recent murder of his wife. Noticing Leight eating a mint from the same bar the ambassador had last been seen, Monk insists Steven Leight is the ambassador's murderer, {{despite the lack of}} supporting evidence. To support his theory, Monk proposes that Leight stole his wife's jewelry to stage a robbery, then proceeded to the bar before calling the police. He asserts Leight and the ambassador were wearing essentially identical coats, and that they must have been switched accidentally at the bar. As rain falls, Leight locates the ambassador's hotel room, and subsequently kills both him and his bodyguards, and switches the newly wet coat with his own.|$|E
5|$|Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra chose several {{camera angles}} to {{simulate}} {{the look of a}} comic book panel. Various visual narrative motifs were also applied. Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass. As a newborn, he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors, and as a young child, he is seen reflected in a blank <b>TV</b> <b>screen.</b> When he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David Dunn's car, he is reflected in a glass frame in his art gallery. Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing. Using purple as Mr. Glass' color to David Dunn's green was also Jackson's idea. Mr. Glass' wig was modeled after Afro-American statesman Frederick Douglass. As he does in his other films, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance. He plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium.|$|E

25|$|A {{video game}} is an {{electronic}} game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback {{on a video}} device such as a <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> or computer monitor.

25|$|The Sensor Bar is {{required}} when the Wii Remote is controlling up-down, left-right motion of a cursor or reticle on the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> {{to point to}} menu options or objects such as enemies in first-person shooters. Because the Sensor Bar also allows the Wii Remote to calculate {{the distance between the}} Wii Remote and the Sensor Bar, the Wii Remote can also control slow forward-backward motion of an object in a 3-dimensional game. Rapid forward-backward motion, such as punching in a boxing game, is controlled by the acceleration sensors. Using these acceleration sensors (acting as tilt sensors), the Wii Remote can also control rotation of a cursor or other objects.|$|E
25|$|The NTSC and PAL TV norms {{call for}} a {{compliant}} <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> to display an electrically black and white signal (minimal color saturation) at a color temperature of 6500K. On many consumer-grade televisions, {{there is a very}} noticeable deviation from this requirement. However, higher-end consumer-grade televisions can have their color temperatures adjusted to 6500K by using a preprogrammed setting or a custom calibration. Current versions of ATSC explicitly call for the color temperature data {{to be included in the}} data stream, but old versions of ATSC allowed this data to be omitted. In this case, current versions of ATSC cite default colorimetry standards depending on the format. Both of the cited standards specify a 6500K color temperature.|$|E

It {{was the first}} time in history that a character displayed on a <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> was generated by a home computer. With the Apple I design, he and Jobs were largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto-based Homebrew Computer Club, a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The Club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry over the next few decades. Unlike other Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1980s, the stadium {{underwent}} another major phase of redevelopment. The West Stand was replaced by an expensive new structure in 1982, and the East Stand was renovated in 1988. In 1992, following the Taylor Report's recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces {{of the south and}} east stand were converted to seating, with the north stand becoming all-seater the following season. The south stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant Sony Jumbotron <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> for live game coverage and away match screenings. In 1997–98 season the Paxton Road stand had a new upper tier as well as a second Jumbotron screen added. Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006 bringing the capacity of the stadium to 36,310.|$|E

There is also a scene where Nolan's movie Following is seen playing on a <b>TV</b> <b>screen.</b> Requiem for a Dream is also seen playing on a TV in the same scene which is also an influence as the movie deals with addiction. Apart from the cinematic influences, the theme of dream and illusion is also shown as an influence of the poem Nee Mayeyolago by Kanaka Dasa which is quoted {{at the beginning of}} the movie. The poem is also partially contained in the lyrics of the song Nee Toreda Galigeyali in the soundtrack.|$|E

25|$|The Wii U GamePad was {{described}} as a survival kit for players. It was inspired by the studio's previous game, Peter Jackson's King Kong, in which players make use of the environment to survive (such as using a torch to scare off enemies); the team made the GamePad a survival kit, taking considerable time to fine-tune the GamePad's functions. Although it was initially possible for players to plan strategy with the GamePad, they rarely did so. The team then retooled the system to include features such as the mini-map, resulting in players focusing on the GamePad and ignoring the action on the TV. Eventually, the team balanced player time on both screens by switching from first- to third-person perspective when the player uses the survival kit. Players are vulnerable when using the kit, prompting them to look at the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> while using the GamePad. This increases the game's tension, making it more scary to play. According to Guillaume, the team realized this potential when they implemented the lock-pick feature (when players must be aware of their surroundings while trying to unlock a door). To further immerse players in the game, the voice of the Prepper is channeled through the GamePad's speakers and players need to read text with the pad; since the GamePad is a real-world object, the experience is more intimate. The pad displayed most crucial information to the player, and the game did not have a user interface.|$|E
