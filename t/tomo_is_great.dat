40|$|Assimilation of toluene by Cladosporium sphaerospermum is {{initially}} catalyzed by toluene monooxygenase (<b>TOMO).</b> <b>TOMO</b> activity <b>was</b> induced by adding toluene to a glucose-pregrown culture of C. sphaerospermum. The corresponding microsomal enzyme needed NADPH and O 2 to oxidize toluene and glycerol, EDTA, DTT, and PMSF for stabilization. <b>TOMO</b> activity <b>was</b> maximal at 35 °C and pH 7. 5 and was inhibited by carbon monoxide, Metyrapone, and cytochrome c. TOMO preferred as substrates also other aromatic hydrocarbons {{with a short}} aliphatic side chain. Its reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum showed a maximum at 451 nm. A substrate-induced Type I spectrum was observed on addition of toluene. These results indicated that <b>TOMO</b> <b>is</b> a cytochrome P 450.
