Multiple tests were performed with different combinations of pre-stress level, number of loads, span-to-depth ratio, beam width and butt-joint configurations. The results of the tests have been analysed and compared with non-linear finite element analyses using solid elements and contact properties. The experimental results and the analysis showed that, {{in the case of a}} high span-to-depth ratio in the deck and without <b>butt</b> <b>joints,</b> there is little or no interlaminar slip. <b>Test</b> elements without <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> showed little slip at pre-stress levels of 300 kPa or higher.

40|$|Using {{conventional}} robots for metal/inert-gas (MIG) {{arc welding}} on thin (1 - to 2 -mm) sheet steel pressings is restricted by {{the difficulty of}} maintaining accurate fit-up and fixturing. Dimensional variations are introduced by wear of tools and fixtures, springback, and thermal distortion during welding. These variations cause errors {{in the position of}} the welding torch relative to the seam of as much as &plusmn; 3. 0 mm, preventing the formation of good welds. We describe an implemented system that forms and uses models for the automatic visually guided control of a MIG welding robot. The system uses its models to aid the detection of the following dimensional variations in sheet steel assemblies: gap width, standoff error, and lateral error. Lap, <b>T,</b> and <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> are dealt with. By use of the model-based visual feedback techniques reported in this paper, errors in the position of the welding torch are corrected to within &plusmn; 0. 5 mm, which is a suitable tolerance for producing good welds in such assemblies. Furthermore, seam widths are detected to dynamically alter welding pa-rameters. Artificial intelligence principles other than models are also used, including island parsing, back constraints, and pattern-directed inference. 1...|$|R

The fatigue fractures were observed and analyzed by a scanning electron microscope of 6360 LA type.

The {{focus of the}} in vitro study is to identify a jointing procedure for InCeram which {{may be used for}} producing full-ceramic fixed-partial-denture frameworks. METHODS. Six groups (n= 15) of machined and jointed InCeram-Alumina (T 1 -T 5) and InCeram-Zirconia (T 6) bars (3 x 4 x 13 mm(3)), respectively, were examined using a 3 -point-bending test. InCeram-Alumina joint-free controls were: machined (C 1), slip cast (C 2, C 3) and cut from the block (C 4) bars. Machined joint-free InCeram-Zirconia bars were used as controls (C 5). InCeram-Alumina slip was used for jointing T 1 -T 5 and InCeram-Zirconia slip for bars T 6.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the static behavior of different type of <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> for application in a timber sofa furniture frame. In timber sofa structure, <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> are commonly used between plywood and hardwood members but they are normally designed without any regard to the effect of grain directions of the wood members on the joint strength. The focus of the paper is to look at the effect of grain directions on the wooden member properties and on the strength of the <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> in order to understand the failure mode to establish a more durable and effective sofa <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> than the one normally used by the manufacturers. Design/methodology/approach - Experiment tests are conducted to determine the mechanical properties of joint members, the maximum load-carrying capacity of the <b>butt</b> <b>joints,</b> and the types of the failure in the joints in relation to different grain orientations under transverse loading conditions. Plywood and hardwood members are used in construction of the joint tests. Four types of <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> are constructed with different condition of grain orientation, glue, and screw used in the joint members. The specimens are tested by fixing the plywood member and applying a transverse load to the hardwood member to simulate the conditions in the sofa frame. Findings - Result shows that <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> with vertical grain orientation and joint with two screws and glue have the maximum load-carrying capacity compared to the other three cases and compared to the current joint type used in the existing sofa frame design.
