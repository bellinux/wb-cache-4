Thereby, Nanshin-ron, {{the concept of the}} Japanese Navy conducting a southern campaign quickly matured and gained further proponents.|$|E
5|$|An amphibious {{landing at}} Mersing was {{originally}} planned by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> sever {{the lines of}} communication between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided to land the rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, they lacked the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943, Whitehead {{was rewarded}} with an {{important}} victory over the Japanese.

5|$|The Big Six and {{the cabinet}} spent August 13 debating their {{reply to the}} Allied response, but {{remained}} deadlocked. Meanwhile, the Allies grew doubtful, waiting for <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> respond. The Japanese had been instructed that they could transmit an unqualified acceptance in the clear, but in fact they sent out coded messages on matters unrelated to the surrender parlay. The Allies took this coded response as non-acceptance of the terms.|$|E
5|$|After his training, Rane {{was posted}} to the 28th Field Company, an {{engineering}} {{unit of the}} 26th Infantry Division which, at the time, was fighting the Japanese in Burma. As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, along with his two sections, was hand-picked by his company commander to stay back behind at Buthidaung to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> reach their lines. Rane, along with his two sections, expertly evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, {{he was promoted to}} havaldar (sergeant).|$|E

5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Japanese {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. Perched on a hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose deluge of gunshots causing <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> scramble for cover. The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy {{but they could not}} advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way. About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated to the city to join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had never}} before served in the Far East, as CEFEO commander, Leclerc was charged with {{recovering}} French Indochina. This territory, comprising the present day states of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, had been conquered by the French during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Vichy regime had allowed <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> use Indochina as a base from which to attack the Allies in Malaya, Burma and China. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese had deposed the French colonial government, taken direct control of Indochina, defeated the French army in several engagements, and imprisoned surviving French soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> overrun them.|$|E

5|$|Both Allied and Japanese {{naval forces}} {{continued}} to converge on 22 August {{and both sides}} conducted intense aircraft scouting efforts, however neither side spotted its adversary. The disappearance {{of at least one}} of their scouting aircraft (shot down by aircraft from Enterprise before it could send a radio report), caused <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> strongly suspect that U.S. carriers were in the immediate area. The U.S., however, was unaware of the disposition and strength of approaching Japanese surface warship forces.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1938, the Selarang Barracks {{was part}} of the Changi Garrison, a heavily {{fortified}} coastal defence where most of the British forces were based during the Battle of Singapore. The Selarang Barracks housed the 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders, a British Army infantry regiment which recruited its soldiers mainly from North East Scotland. The Royal Engineers and the 9th Coastal Artillery Regiment of the Royal Artillery were based in nearby Kitchener Barracks and Roberts Barracks respectively. After the British surrender of Singapore on 15 February 1942, Allied POWs were ordered by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> march to Changi for internment. As the British-built Changi Prison was already crowded with Allied POWs and civilians, the surrounding barracks including Selarang Barracks were used by the Japanese as a holding area for Australian and British POWs.|$|E
5|$|In late June 1942, the Allies {{decided to}} seize {{bases in the}} {{southern}} Solomon Islands {{with the objective of}} denying their use by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. They also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces. They fell under the command of the recently appointed Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area.|$|E

5|$|In the {{resulting}} battle, both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night. Nevertheless, the U.S. succeeded in turning back attempts by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Allied aircraft also sank {{most of the}} Japanese troop transports and prevented {{the majority of the}} Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} action two weeks later, a larger force of U.S. Marines {{successfully}} crossed the Matanikau River, attacked Japanese forces {{under the command}} of newly arrived generals Masao Maruyama and Yumio Nasu, and inflicted heavy casualties on a Japanese infantry regiment. The second action forced <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau and hindered Japanese preparations for their planned major offensive on the U.S. Lunga defenses set for later in October 1942 that resulted in the Battle for Henderson Field.|$|E

5|$|On 24 June, Morris {{ordered the}} 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the Papuan Infantry Battalion, as Maroubra Force, to defend Kokoda. The Japanese {{landed in the}} Buna area on 21 July. At this point, B Company of the 39th Infantry Battalion was at Kokoda, with C Company {{advancing}} along the track, departing Illolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move {{and most of it}} had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was sanguine about this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> withdraw to Buna. Blamey was not so sure, and ordered Major General Arthur Allen's 7th Division to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force.|$|E
5|$|The Third Fleet's {{operations}} in the South China Sea were highly successful. It destroyed {{a large number of}} Japanese ships and aircraft, while losing relatively few of its own aircraft.
