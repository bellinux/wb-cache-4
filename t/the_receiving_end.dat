Later he explained that being at <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end</b> of an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E

5|$|The 1921 Grey Cup {{victory was}} their last until 1933, {{at which point}} the Argonauts became the {{dominant}} team of an increasingly nationwide sport. They put together a number of Grey Cup dynasties in the 1930s and 1940s, winning eight of twenty Grey Cups between 1933 and 1952. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers were most often on <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end</b> of Argo Grey Cup victories in this era. From 1933 to 1941 Lew Hayman coached the team with a still unparalleled winning ratio of 45–15–2. Their first back-to-back Grey Cups came in 1937 and 1938. This was also the era of the famed Stukus brothers—Annis, Bill, and Frank—who proved a potent all-purpose trio in the Argonauts' championship years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most {{party members}} were teachers, {{employees}} of the French colonial government or non-commissioned officers in the colonial army. The VNQDD campaigned mainly among these facets of societythere were few workers or peasants in its ranks. The party's popularity {{was based on a}} groundswell of anti-French feeling in northern Vietnam in the 1920s; many writers had assailed society for glorifying military actions against China, Champa, Siam and Cambodia, Vietnam's historical rivals, while neglecting to oppose French colonialism. The VNQDD admitted many female members, which was quite revolutionary for the time. It set about seeking alliances with other nationalist factions in Vietnam. In a meeting on July 4, 1928, the Central Committee appealed for unity among the Vietnamese revolutionary movements, sending delegates to meet with other organisations struggling for independence. The preliminary contacts did not yield any concrete alliances. The VNQDD also assailed the Vietnamese communists of Ho Chi Minh for betraying the leading nationalist of the timePhan Bội Châuto the French in return for a financial reward. Ho had done this to eliminate other nationalist rivals. The VNQDD would later be on <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end</b> of another of Ho's manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2007, Brown was on <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end</b> {{of a heavy}} tackle by Gilles Binya during Celtic's 1–0 {{win over}} Benfica, but he was {{relatively}} unhurt. Binya was subsequently given a six match European ban following the dangerous challenge. Celtic finished second in their Champions League group with nine points. They were drawn with Barcelona in the last 16, but Brown missed the 3–2 defeat in the first leg through suspension. He returned for the second leg at the Camp Nou, which Celtic lost 1–0. Brown was suspended for three league matches, including two Old Firm games, in April 2008. Due to this suspension, manager Gordon Strachan chose a midfield pairing of Barry Robson and Paul Hartley for the final weeks of the season. Brown made a total of 48 appearances for Celtic {{in his first season}} with the club, scoring three goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} the gap began at 7:30am on 11 August, as a flight of Savioa-Marchetti SM.81 medium bombers {{attacked}} British defenders on Punjab Ridge. This half-hour assault {{was followed by a}} long artillery bombardment lasting until noon. At 12:30, the infantry attack began. II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the trackless wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, Knobbly, and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge. Counterattacks were mounted against the Italians, but these were unsuccessful. The Italian {{attack on the}} hills was renewed the next day, 12 August. Black, Knobbly, and Mill Hills were on <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end</b> of repeated assaults by XIV Brigade, and the weakest of them, Mill Hill, began to reel under the sustained pressure.

5|$|The match {{began as}} a scrappy affair, with plenty of {{challenges}} and little expansive football on show. The game's first notable chance went to Rooney, but Kolo Touré intervened and blocked his effort. Rooney then played in Giggs, whose shot was closed down by Sol Campbell. It took a while before Arsenal gained composure and played their usual passing game, and a move involving Edu and Fredrik Ljungberg in the 19th minute resulted in Rio Ferdinand carelessly tackling the latter. Ferdinand was not shown a card for his challenge – the first controversial decision referee Riley made during the match, which surprised Arsenal as the defender made a professional foul to prevent Ljungberg running clear on goal. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Reyes {{to open up the}} United defence, but the Dutchman's shot was saved by Roy Carroll. The United goalkeeper was on hand to save Henry's low shot three minutes before the break, after the striker was put through by Edu. During the first half action, both Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) were booked for fouling Reyes. Ashley Cole also received a yellow card for his tackle on Rooney. The Arsenal defender was on <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end</b> of a challenge by Van Nistelrooy minutes after, as he attempted to shield the ball and hold on to possession. Television replays showed Van Nistelrooy ran his studs down Cole's shins, but the striker was not punished by Riley despite the action being in full view of his assistant at the touchline.|$|E

In these singular conditions, with a range largely inferior to the typical heights of ionized layers, the elevation of incident waves at <b>the</b> <b>receive</b> <b>end</b> is close to 90 °: this scheme corresponds to the so-called near-vertical-incidence skywave (NVIS) conditions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a wireless communication {{system in which}} the base station is equipped with an antenna array and the mobile user has a single antenna. Classically, in this configuration, the antenna array at the base station is used to perform either beamforming or transmit diversity. We propose a scheme that exploits the antenna array to perform beamforming in order to maximize the diversity of the channel seen at <b>the</b> <b>receive</b> <b>end,</b> i. e., <b>the</b> mobile user. This scheme is based on the criterion of minimizing the variation of <b>the</b> power <b>received</b> by <b>the</b> mobile user due to fading. Moreover, we propose an adaptive method to optimize this criterion, which is a type of CM (Constant Modulus) criterion...|$|R

30|$|Previous {{characterizations}} of HF MIMO channels {{have been described}} by Gunashekar et al. in [17], involving different arrangements of collocated active antennas at <b>the</b> <b>receive</b> <b>end.</b> This <b>receiving</b> system takes benefit of the polarization sensitivity of the different sensors {{in the same way}} that the couple of vertical loop antennas used in our project. However, the work in [17] is based on the transmission of non-modulated carriers separated by an interval of 10 Hz to ensure their identification at the receiver; the MIMO channel is then characterized inside a narrow bandwith equal to 30 Hz. Therefore, it is not relevant to compare the channel correlation coefficients estimated in both projects as the conditions are not similar.|$|R
