Usually fighters who adopt this strategy use takedowns only for scoring, easily allowing the adversary {{to stand up}} and continue the fight. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> to land clear strikes and control the octagon. In order to win the fight by decision all score oriented fighters have to master perfect MMA defense techniques and avoid takedowns.|$|E

2500|$|The {{bidding process}} is {{designed}} to create competition. [...] When multiple parties want the same thing, pit them against one another. When people know that they may lose out on something, they want it even more. Not only do they want {{the thing that is}} being bid on, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> to win, just to win. Taking advantage of someone's competitive nature can drive up the price.|$|E

2500|$|For {{many people}} {{choosing}} an office suite, prime considerations include how much value having learned that office suite {{will prove to}} potential employers, and how well the software interoperates with other users. [...] That is, since learning to use an office suite takes many hours, users want to invest that time learning the office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers and clients, and <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> {{to be able to}} share documents. Similarly, finding already-trained employees is a big concern for employers when deciding which office suite to purchase or standardize on.|$|E

Investigations reportedly revealed that a group of 40 to 50 Maoists had been camping in the area near the blast site for five days before the attack. They recced the site and also visited the local market several times. In the note, the rebels have also put forward seven key demands.

2500|$|The National Hydropower Association (NHA) {{currently}} has five policy priorities on their agenda. [...] The {{first is a}} more efficient regulatory process. [...] They say that an expediting 2-year licensing process for minimal impact projects would allow hydro to be on an “equal footing” with other renewable technologies. [...] The second is a tax credit parity. [...] Hydropower currently receives half of the rate per kWh under the Production Tax Credit, and the NHA thinks {{that it should be}} increased such that it is equal with other renewable technologies. [...] The third priority calls for incentivizing renewable electricity production and manufacturing (manufacturing tax credits, Clean and Renewable Energy Bonds, Production and Investment Tax Credits should be extended). [...] <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> a federal clean and renewable energy standard which promotes development. [...] The last priority calls for continued investment in research and development for both conventional and non-conventional hydropower projects.|$|E

In addition to the new job and office, Big Tom reveals {{that he plans to}} marry Beverly Barrish-Burns (Bo Derek), a woman he had met at a fat farm, and that her son Paul (Rob Lowe) will become Tommy's new stepbrother. At the wedding, Big Tom suddenly dies of a heart attack. After the funeral, doubting the future of the company without Big Tom, the bank reneges on promises of a loan for a new brake pad division and seeks immediate payment of Callahan Auto's debts. Ray Zalinsky (Dan Aykroyd), owner and operator of rival automotive parts company Zalinsky Auto Parts in Chicago, offers to buy them out while the company's shares are high, but Tommy suggests a deal: he will let the bank hold his inherited shares and house in exchange for helping to sell the new brake pads. The bank agrees, but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> the company to prove it still has viability by selling 500,000 brake pads. If they fail, the bank will foreclose, but if they succeed, the bank will underwrite Big Tom's brake pad venture. Tommy volunteers to go on a cross-country sales trip with his father's sycophantic assistant, Richard Hayden (David Spade), a childhood acquaintance who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Tommy.|$|E

6000|$|During {{these years}} at Trieste, however, Dall' Ongaro {{seems to have}} been also much {{occupied}} with pure literature, and to have given a great deal of study to the sources of national poetry, as he discovered them in the popular life and legends. He had been touched with the prevailing romanticism; he had written hymns like Manzoni, and, like Carrer, he sought to poetize the traditions and superstitions of his countrymen. He found a richer and deeper vein than the Venetian poet among his native hills and the neighboring mountains of Slavonia, but I cannot say that he wrought it to much better effect. The two volumes which he published in 1840 contain many ballads which are very graceful and musical, but which lack the fresh spirit of songs springing from the popular heart, while <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> the airy and delicate beauty of the modern German ballads. Among the best of them are two which Dall' Ongaro built up from mere lines and fragments of lines current among the people, as in later years he more successfully restored us two plays of Menander from the plots and a dozen verses of each. [...] "One may imitate," [...] he says, [...] "more or less fortunately, Manzoni, Byron, or any other poet, but not the simple inspirations of the people. And 'The Pilgrim who comes from Rome,' and the 'Rosettina,' if one could have them complete as they once were, would probably make me blush for my elaborate variations." [...] But study which was so well directed, and yet so conscious of its limitations, could not but be of great value; and Dall' Ongaro, no doubt, owed to it his gift of speaking so authentically for the popular heart. That which he did later showed that he studied the people's thought and expression con amore, and in no vain sentiment of dilettanteism, or antiquarian research, or literary patronage.|$|E
