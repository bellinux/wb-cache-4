5|$|In {{stories from}} the 13th century, tengu began to abduct young boys as well as <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> they had always targeted. The boys were often returned, while <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> would be found tied to the tops of trees or other high places. All of the tengu's victims, however, would {{come back in a}} state of near death or madness, {{sometimes}} after having been tricked into eating animal dung.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{sought to}} expand the power of <b>the</b> <b>priests,</b> as from the {{beginning}} of their empire, priests had accompanied Portuguese delegations on diplomatic missions and on occasion were the principal negotiatiors. Treaties they signed with the Keladi Nayakas progressively incorporated clauses which increased the authority of <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> over the local Catholic population, making them obedient to <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> in matters of Christian laws as well as granting priests the authority to punish violations. The Portuguese promised to refrain from slaughtering cows and to halt forcible conversions in their factories. The terms of these treaties were not always honoured by the Portuguese, with the result that whenever hostilities broke out between the Keladis and the Portuguese, the Catholic settlers were often harassed or arrested by the Nayakas.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>priests</b> {{catch the}} snake {{and prepare to}} kill her, but are stopped by the goddess Kwan Im, who tells the stunned pursuers that the snake is {{pregnant}} and thus must not be killed. A month after the snake gives birth, <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> return. The snake-woman gives her child to Khouw and then surrenders herself to her fate. She is captured in a magical jar and brought away.|$|E
50|$|It is {{told that}} once a pandya king came to the temple and {{received}} prasadam from <b>the</b> <b>priest.</b> <b>The</b> <b>priest</b> gave him a garland {{in which there was}} a hair. The king got angry with <b>the</b> <b>priest.</b> However, as <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> was pure and truly devoted to Sivasailanathar, Sivasailanathar thought to save <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> and he sent a vision to the king to not get angry with <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> and gave him a vision of shivalingam. The king became very happy.|$|R

On November 8 {{he had an}} {{argument}} with <b>the</b> parish <b>priest</b> from Tixcacaltuyub, who was in Cisteil to say mass. Canek threatened to kill <b>the</b> <b>priest,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> complained to <b>the</b> authorities. The following day, while <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> was saying mass, Canek raised a false alarm of fire, apparently to empty the church {{so that he could}} kill <b>the</b> <b>priest.</b> <b>The</b> <b>priest,</b> however, was not killed.|$|R

The leader of team A goes to <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> and whispers one {{of the names of}} the players of team B. Then he returns to his place and <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> calls out, [...] "Lapit!" [...] ("Approach!"). One of the players of team B should approach <b>the</b> <b>priest,</b> and if it happens to be the one whom the leader of team A mentioned, <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> will say, [...] "Boom" [...] or [...] "Bung!" [...] The player then falls out of line and stays somewhere near <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> as a prisoner.|$|R
5|$|During the Second Temple period (516 BCE to 70 CE), Hellenistic and Roman culture heavily {{influenced}} cuisine, particularly of <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> and aristocracy of Jerusalem.

5|$|Following the Rising of <b>the</b> <b>Priests</b> in 1775, {{three of}} the rebellion's leaders were {{executed}} without receiving fair trial. The death penalty was signed by the Castellano under the orders of Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada. Prior to judgement, some of <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> and clerics were locked up in the secretive prisons near the courtroom of the Castallania, some at the Castellania dungeons, and in other Valletta buildings. All those arrested were recorded on the Libro del Carcerati Della Magna Curia Castellania. Among them was Gaetano Mannarino, {{the leader of the}} rebellion. Some of them were condemned to death by strangulation in the dungeons of the Castellania. The whole process went against the conformity of the courts in Malta as <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> were not to be subjected to the Castellania but to the court of the Bishop. Ximenes died a natural death within weeks after the sentences, with some locals believing it was a divine providence for his merciless judgement against the clergy.|$|E

5|$|A large temple also owned sizable {{tracts of}} land and {{employed}} thousands of laymen to supply its needs.

5|$|Around 1350BC, the {{stability}} of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt. Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the Near East (where the Hittites, Mitanni, and Assyrians were vying for control). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> of Amun soon regained power and returned the capital to Thebes. Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and possibly even Neferneferuaten/Nefertiti herself worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.|$|E

She escapes, pursued by <b>the</b> <b>priests.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bishop Jocelin styled <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> {{serving the}} cathedral as the Vicars Choral, in the 12th century, their duty being to chant divine service eight times a day.

The Vicars Choral were assigned annuities from his lands and tenements in Congresbury and Wookey, an annual fee from the vicarage of Chew, and endowed them with lands obtained from the Feoffees of Walter de Hulle.|$|E

50|$|The confessor {{reveals that}} he intends to kill <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> (his father) tonight.

Once he looked into his eyes for a brief moment, he was sure of <b>the</b> <b>priest's</b> identity. <b>The</b> <b>priest</b> begs <b>the</b> confessor for forgiveness, and later his own life. The confessor takes aim and fires a single gunshot at <b>the</b> <b>priest,</b> but misses intentionally. He holds to his original agreement: that if <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> agreed to hear his confession, he would not kill tonight. The confessor tells <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> that he will not kill him, nor forgive him for what he did to him and his mother. He tells <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> that he will continue to kill, and will send him newspaper clippings of each killing, so <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> knows that his actions made the confessor the way he is, and he is responsible for their deaths.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, Egypt {{had entered}} a long period of {{political}} and economic decline. <b>The</b> <b>priests</b> at Thebes grew more powerful, and they effectively administered Upper Egypt, while kings ruling from Tanis controlled Lower Egypt. Some attempt at using the open tombs was made {{at the start of the}} Twenty-first Dynasty, with the High Priest of Amun, Pinedjem I, adding his cartouche to KV4. The Valley began to be heavily plundered, so during the Twenty-first Dynasty <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> of Amun opened most of the tombs and moved the mummies into three tombs in order to better protect them. They removed most of the treasure in order to further protect the bodies from robbers. Most of these were later moved to a single cache near Deir el-Bari (known as TT320). Located in the cliffs overlooking Hatshepsut's famous temple, this mass reburial contained a large number of royal mummies. They were found in a great state of disorder, many placed in other's coffins, and several are still unidentified. Other mummies were moved to the tomb of Amenhotep II, where over a dozen mummies, many of them royal, were later relocated.|$|E

5|$|During Easter in 1563, some {{priests in}} Ayrshire celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried {{to enforce the}} law {{themselves}} by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox for the third time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she was bound to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that <b>the</b> <b>priests</b> would be brought to justice.|$|E

5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches to care for the needs of such a large population. <b>The</b> <b>priests</b> were expected to be educators, doctors and counsellors, as well as meeting the spiritual needs of their parishioners. Therefore, in 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary on the land on which the museum now stands.|$|E
5|$|In {{the matter}} of the annulment, no {{progress}} seemed possible. The Pope seemed more afraid of Emperor Charles V than of Henry.
