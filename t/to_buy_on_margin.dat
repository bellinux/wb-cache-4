On advanced settings, the broker may allow the player <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>on</b> <b>margin</b> or short sell stocks if he has enough value of stocks or cash to rely on. The computer players may also engage in these practices and will attempt to bankrupt the player when he is heavily in debt.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effect of}} induced {{positive}} mood on price patterns in experimental asset markets. Smith, Suchanek and Williams (1988) in their seminal paper documented bubbles and crashes in experimental asset markets (i. e., prices exceed fundamental value in the beginning and fall towards or below the fundamental value {{towards the end of}} the market). Since then, a number of studies have shown that the magnitude of the bubble is influenced by experience, the ability <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>on</b> <b>margins</b> and sell short. We believe that price patterns will also be influenced by affect. We use call trading market rules in our experimental asset markets. As expected, our results show a higher deviation of prices from fundamental values under positive affect treatment. ...|$|R
50|$|George Bull {{was offered}} the {{position}} of King's Counsel in 1928. The family was well off, but the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression dramatically changed their circumstances. Within a year the loans Bull had taken <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> stocks <b>on</b> <b>margin</b> were called in, and the family was forced to move to Toronto to look for work.|$|R
50|$|As {{with direct}} {{electronic}} registration, nominee accounts make paperless telephone and internet trading possible with faster settlement periods and lower commissions than certificate deals. They often enable domestic small investors {{to gain access}} to derivatives such as warrants and contracts for difference, to exercise various types of order, and <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> shares <b>on</b> <b>margin.</b> There is no risk of loss or damage to certificates. It is also possible to obtain an instant valuation of a whole portfolio. On the negative side the shareholder is tied into one stockbroker, as opposed to a certificate holder or someone who has direct electronic registration who can pick and choose stockbrokers every time they deal. If the shareholder is unhappy with their nominee service, they have to arrange to transfer the shares out which can be a lengthy process for which there is usually a charge. The lack of a share certificate can also make it difficult to use shares as collateral for a loan.|$|R
50|$|On 12 March, {{the volume}} of trading had reached 3,875,910 shares, an all-time high. By 20 June, 5,052,790 shares were traded in a falling market that many prematurely thought signalled {{the end of the}} bull market. Prices rose once more and after the {{election}} of Hoover, with a “victory boom” resulting in an all-time record trading of 6,641,250 shares in a rising market (16 November). Overall, the market rose during the year from 245 to 331 which was accompanied by a phenomenal increase in trading <b>on</b> <b>margin,</b> which relieved the buyer from putting up the full purchase price of the stock by using the securities as collateral for a loan. The buyer obtained full benefit of ownership in rising stock valuation, but the loan amount remained the same. People swarmed <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> stock <b>on</b> <b>margin.</b> In the early 1920s, brokers' loans used to finance purchases <b>on</b> <b>margin</b> averaged 1-1.5 billion but by November 1928 had reached six billion. By the end of 1928, the interest on such loans was yielding 12% to lenders which led to a flood of gold converging on Wall St. {{from all over the world}} to fuel the purchase of stocks <b>on</b> <b>margin.</b>|$|R

50|$|When {{it comes}} to {{financing}} a purchase of stocks there are two ways: purchasing stock with money that is currently in the buyer's ownership, or by <b>buying</b> stock <b>on</b> <b>margin.</b> <b>Buying</b> stock <b>on</b> <b>margin</b> means <b>buying</b> stock with money borrowed against the value of stocks in the same account. These stocks, or collateral, guarantee that the buyer can repay the loan; otherwise, the stockbroker {{has the right to}} sell the stock (collateral) to repay the borrowed money. He can sell if the share price drops below the margin requirement, at least 50% {{of the value of the}} stocks in the account. <b>Buying</b> <b>on</b> <b>margin</b> works the same way as borrowing money <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a car or a house, using a car or house as collateral. Moreover, borrowing is not free; the broker usually charges 8-10% interest.|$|R
