5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. <b>This</b> <b>exchange</b> of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E

As a result of <b>this</b> <b>exchange,</b> Jenna gets botox and collagen injections that go terribly wrong. Later, during a sketch rehearsal—involving impersonations of Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush, and John Kerry—the various mishaps of Tracy, Jenna, and Josh prompt Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) that it would be impossible for the three to perform on the show.

5|$|Corvinus {{was unwilling}} to break his own truce with Bayezid, having tacit Ottoman backing for his own war in the west. However, he granted his vassal a {{territorial}} gift in Transylvania, comprising the domains of Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă. According to various interpretations, <b>this</b> <b>exchange</b> occurred in or after 1484, and was meant to compensate Stephen {{for the loss of}} his ports. Medievalist Marius Diaconescu dates the lease of Cetatea to 1482, when Corvinus agreed to give Stephen a place of refuge, should Moldavia fall to the Ottomans, while Ciceu only became Stephen's castle in 1489. Both citadels were on land confiscated after conflicts between the Three Nations and Corvinus. Ciceu had been a fief of the Losonczi family, under litigation, while Cetatea had been a special domain of the Voivode of Transylvania, whose last titular owner before Stephen was John Pongrác of Dengeleg.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable and Droits de l'Homme manoeuvred {{around one}} another, exchanging fire when {{possible}} until 18:45, when Amazon arrived. During <b>this</b> <b>exchange,</b> one of Droits de l'Hommes cannon burst, causing heavy casualties on her packed deck. Approaching the larger French ship with all sail spread, Reynolds closed to within pistol shot before raking Droits de l'Homme. Lacrosse {{responded to this}} new threat by manoeuvring to bring both British ships to face the westward side of his ship, avoiding becoming trapped in a crossfire. The battle continued until 19:30, when both Amazon and Indefatigable pulled away from their opponent to make hasty repairs. By 20:30, the frigates {{had returned to the}} much slower French ship and began weaving in front of Droits de l'Hommes bow, repeatedly raking her. Lacrosse's increasingly desperate attempts to ram the British ships were all unsuccessful and what little cannon fire he did manage to deploy was ineffectual, as the rolling of the ship of the line prevented reliable aiming.|$|E

After changing hands three times in 13 years, the FSView was sold to the Tallahassee Democrat in late July 2006, making it part of the Gannett chain. <b>This</b> <b>exchange</b> was allowed because the FSView had been for a long time a for-profit business that was not legally associated with Florida State University.

5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of {{food power}} as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This {{would have the}} same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use <b>this</b> <b>exchange</b> politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E
5|$|They then {{discover}} {{that they are in}} the sheriff's home, who returns soon after.

The entire police force then comes after them, until they are able to jump on a train and arrive in Quahog, only to be met by the sheriff and his deputies. Joe, however, had called ahead and arranged for the Quahog police department to arrive and rescue them. Joe then smashes the sheriff's vehicle, shoots him in the leg, and demands he leave Quahog.|$|E

5|$|Unmentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, Royton {{does not}} appear in records until 1212, when it was {{documented}} to have been a thegnage estate, or manor, comprising twelve oxgangs of land, with an annual rate of 24shillings payable by the tenant, William Fitz William, to King John. From William, who died in 1223, Royton passed to his son Thomas, who was still alive in 1254. Thomas's daughter Margery, who married Alexander Luttrell of Somerset, sold the majority of Royton and its outlying land to John de Byron in around 1260. It is from <b>this</b> <b>exchange</b> that the Byron family came to use Royton as their chief place of residence until {{the early part of the}} 17th century.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1652, Bern devalued its copper Batzen by 50% to adjust its face value to its intrinsic value to combat the inflation. The authorities set a term of only three days to exchange the copper coins at the old rate against more stable gold or silver money. Not many people could thus take advantage of <b>this</b> <b>exchange</b> offer, and for most—and in particular the rural population—half their fortunes just vanished. The other cantons soon followed suit and similarly devalued the Bernese copper money. The situation was most dire in the Lucerne Entlebuch valley, where the Bernese Batzen were in widespread usage. The financial situation of many a peasant became unsustainable. Insider deals of the ruling magistrates of Lucerne furthered the unrest among the population. The peasants of the Entlebuch valley, led by Hans Emmenegger from Schüpfheim and Christian Schybi from Escholzmatt, sent a delegation to Lucerne to demand remedies, but the city council refused to even hear them. The enraged peasants organized a general assembly (Landsgemeinde) {{of the population of}} the valley at Heiligkreuz, in spite of such assemblies being illegal as the authorities' laws of the time denied the freedom of assembly. The assembly, which took place after the mass on February 10, 1653, decided to suspend all tax payments until the authorities in Lucerne fulfilled their demands by reducing taxes and abolishing some of them altogether, such as the taxes on salt, cattle, and horse trades.|$|E
5|$|Behind Volage and Danaé, the Venetian Corona {{had engaged}} Cerberus {{in a close}} range duel, during which Cerberus took heavy damage but inflicted similar {{injuries}} on the Italian ship. <b>This</b> <b>exchange</b> continued until the arrival of Active caused the Danaé, Corona and Carolina to sheer off and retreat to the east. To the rear, Amphion succeeded in closing with and raking Flore, and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the French colours overboard in surrender. Captain Péridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in Flores later movements. Amphion then attacked Bellona and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender. During this combat, the small ship Principessa Augusta fired on Amphion from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn a gun on them and drive them off. Hoste sent a punt to take possession of Bellona but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize Flore. Realising Amphion's difficulty, the officers of Flore, who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between Amphion and Bellona, immediately set sail for the French harbour on Lesina (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the first}} award of the GC to an Australian in 1942 {{and the final}} bestowal to Constable Michael Kenneth Pratt in 1978, 14 Australians were {{directly}} decorated with the medal. Of these, nine were awarded to military personnel and five to civilians. Eight of the medals were awarded posthumously. At {{the time of the}} institution of the GC, living recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal automatically became recipients of the new award, and were required to return their previous medal; two Australians became GC holders through this method. In 1971, the British Government announced that living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal would henceforth be recipients of the GC with the option of exchanging their insignia for that of the GC. The decision for such an action {{was the result of the}} decline in the status and significance of the two awards, leading recipients to feel they were not receiving the recognition they were due. Of the 27 Australian holders of the Albert Medal, six were living at the time and all opted to exchange their insignia for the GC. None of the eight Australians awarded the Edward Medal were alive in 1971, and thus no Australian became a recipient of the GC through <b>this</b> <b>exchange.</b> Including exchange awards, a total of 22 Australians were decorated with the GC.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Octavian {{consolidated}} his political power and in 27BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor. Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, {{who was able to}} quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed <b>this</b> <b>exchange</b> as {{a small price to pay}} to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.|$|E
5|$|In 1834 Alkan {{began his}} {{friendship}} with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, <b>this</b> <b>exchange</b> is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; {{it was published in}} London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo piano, the Twelve Caprices, published in 1837 as Opp. 12, 13, 15 and 16. Op.16, the Trois scherzi de bravoure, is dedicated to Masarnau. In January 1836, Liszt recommended Alkan for the post of Professor at the Geneva Conservatoire, which Alkan declined, and in 1837 he wrote an enthusiastic review of Alkan's Op.15 Caprices in the Revue et gazette musicale.|$|E
