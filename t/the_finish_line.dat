5|$|Beyond Two Rivers, {{the trail}} reaches the Chena River {{northwest}} of Fairbanks. This {{is the final}} stretch, and mushers use the river to enter Fairbanks and reach <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line,</b> {{which is on the}} river itself in the middle of downtown Fairbanks. Regardless of the timing of the finish, several thousand spectators typically gather to watch the first musher cross <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first cyclist {{to cross}} <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> {{received}} 1 point.

In this way, a cyclist could not get more than 11 points more than the cyclist that crossed <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> just before him.|$|E

5|$|The {{finish of}} a race {{is marked by a}} white line 5cm wide.

Di Luca rode with a very high cadence {{in an attempt to}} separate himself from Menchov, but was unable to until the sprint for <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> By virtue of the time bonuses gained for third place as well as the gap on the road, Di Luca closed his deficit to Menchov to under 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is {{not fully}} set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is {{surprised}} to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line,</b> allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E

While running down the home stretch after the third barrel, James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him. Despite these occurrences, the pair crossed <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> {{with a time of}} 14.4 seconds to win both the round and the 1985 World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E

5|$|Duque took a high placing at the Gran Premio dell'Insubria-Lugano, {{finishing}} {{just off}} the podium in fourth place, coming home in a group that trailed two leading riders. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, a race which included most of the sport's top teams, Petit finished ninth in a field sprint finish {{at the front of}} the race. Ista narrowly missed out on a victory at Le Samyn in early March. The race's top finishers came across <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> scattered, in groups of eight or fewer. Ista finished second, alone, 8 seconds back of solo winner Dominic Klemme. Two weeks later, Keukeilere finished fourth in a sprint at Nokere Koerse. Gallopin finished on the podium at Cholet-Pays de Loire. 's Thomas Voeckler won the race with a late attack, with the peloton coming so close to catching him at <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> that there was no time gap. Gallopin was first from the peloton for second overall. Vogondy rode to fourth place at the Route Adélie de Vitré, just missing the podium after figuring into a winning breakaway.|$|E
5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
