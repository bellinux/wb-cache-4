5|$|The Devil Children {{titles are}} {{role-playing}} {{games in which}} the player battles against demons. While the player controls a devil child, that character does not directly fight themselves; instead, they send in their allied demons {{to fight against the}} opponents. This was changed in Book of Fire and Book of Ice, where the devil children are able to fight by using cards. If one of the player's demons falls in battle, another is automatically sent in to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> one's place. To recruit new demons to their party, the player needs to choose to talk to the demon instead of fighting it, with the demon's response mostly being based on chance. The player can trade demons with other players, which is required to be able to collect all demon types. While the player's character gains experience points, their allied demons do not; to increase their power, the player needs to fuse their demons with each other.|$|E
