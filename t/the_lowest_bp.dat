40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{prolonged}} hemorrhagic shock, {{reductions in}} intestinal mucosal blood perfusion lead to mucosal barrier damage and systemic inflammation. Gastrointestinal failure in critically ill patients has a poor prognosis, so early assessment of mucosal barrier injury in shock patients is clinically relevant. Unfortunately, {{there is no}} serum marker that can accurately assess intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess if serum diamine oxidase levels can reflect intestinal mucosal injury subsequent to prolonged hemorrhagic shock. METHODS: Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups: a control group, a medium blood pressure (BP) group (exsanguinated to a shock BP of 50 to 41 mm Hg), and a <b>low</b> <b>BP</b> group (exsanguinated to a shock blood pressure of 40 to 31 mm Hg), in which the shock BP was sustained for 180 min prior to fluid resuscitation. RESULTS: The severity of hemorrhagic shock in <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>BP</b> group was significantly greater than that of the medium BP group according to the post-resuscitation BP, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, and arterial lactate. Intestinal damage was significantly more severe in <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>BP</b> group according to Chiu's scoring, claudin- 1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1, and myeloperoxidase expression. Serum diamine oxidase was significantly increased in <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>BP</b> group compared to the medium BP and control groups and was negatively correlated with shock BP.

We previously reported that in all drug groups combined the BP intervention had similar effects on the primary outcome of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) slope or the main secondary clinical composite outcome of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), death, or GFR decline by 50 % or 25 mL/min per 1. 73 m 2. This report examines {{the effect of the}} BP intervention separately in the 3 drug groups. The BP effect was similar among the drug groups for either GFR slope or the main clinical composite. However, the BP effect differed significantly among the drug groups for the composite of ESRD or death (P 0. 035) and ESRD alone (P 0. 021). Higher event rates for amlodipine patients assigned to the usual BP goal (0. 087 per patient-year for ESRD or death and 0. 064 per patient-year for ESRD) were seen compared with the remaining groups of the factorial design (range, 0. 041 to 0. 050 for ESRD or death; and range, 0. 027 to 0. 036 for ESRD). <b>The</b> <b>low</b> <b>BP</b> goal was associated with reduced risk of ESRD or death (risk reduction 51 %; 95 % confidence interval, 13 % to 73 %) and ESRD (54 %; 8 % to 77 %) for amlodipine patients, but not for patients assigned to the other drug groups.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of lowering blood pressure (BP) in hypertension, {{as well as}} in patients with diabetes, chronic renal disease or with a high cardiovascular (CV) risk profile, have been consistently demonstrated.

Taken together, the results of several recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have challenged the currently prevailing paradigm "the lower, the better" in the hypertension management and have somehow revitalized the concept of the J-curve with respect to relations between BP levels and coronary events.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of obesity and low birth weight on both office and {{ambulatory}} blood pressure (BP) values, as well as on aortic-derived parameters in youths. A total of 422 white youths, from 10 to 18 years of age, were included. Subjects were divided into 4 groups according to the presence (234; 55 %) or the absence (188; 45 %) of obesity and according to low (114; 27 %) or normal (308; 73 %, birth weight. Spacelabs 90207 was used to measure ambulatory BP during a 24 -hour period. SphygmoCor radial/aortic transform software was used to estimate aortic pressure waveform. Office, 24 -hour, daytime, and nighttime systolic BP values were significantly higher in those subjects with low birth weight who became obese. <b>The</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>BP</b> values were present in nonobese subjects in the absence of low birth weight. In the middle, with similar BP values, were nonobese subjects with low birth weight and obese subjects in the absence of low birth weight. No interaction existed between obesity and low birth weight in the office (P 0. 165) or ambulatory (P 0. 603) systolic BP values. Augmentation index, an estimate of the pulse wave reflection, was significantly higher in the nonobese low birth weight group when compared with the other groups after controlling for height, heart rate, and diastolic BP. A significant interaction between low birth weight and obesity (P 0. 005) existed. In conclusion, although the low birth weight children who become obese have the highest systolic BP values, the presence of obesity blunts the increment of the reflecting wave observed in low birth weight subjects.

The variations in BP and renal tubular sodium handling were evaluated using 24 h ambulatory BP recordings, 24 h urine collections and determination of endogenous lithium clearance as a marker of proximal sodium reabsorption. The neurohormonal and BP responses to changes in posture were also determined in a 30 min orthostatic test. This selected group of patients with NPG had lower 24 h ambulatory BPs (P&lt; 0. 001), and a more pronounced fall in BP when assuming an upright position (P&lt; 0. 001) compared with controls. FE(Li) (fractional excretion of lithium) was higher in patients with NPG than controls during the day (36. 6 +/- 21. 8 compared with 20. 4 +/- 8. 7 % respectively; P&lt; 0. 01; values are means+/-S.

40|$|Hypertension and {{diabetes}} frequently {{occurs in the}} same individuals in clinical practice. Moreover, the presence of hypertension does {{increase the risk of}} new-onset diabetes, as well as diabetes does promote development of hypertension. Whatever the case, the concomitant presence of these conditions confers a high risk of major cardiovascular complications and promotes the use integrated pharmacological interventions, aimed at achieving the recommended therapeutic targets. While the benefits of lowering abnormal fasting glucose levels in patients with hypertension {{and diabetes}} have been consistently demonstrated, the blood pressure (BP) targets to be achieved to get a benefit in patients with diabetes have been recently reconsidered. In the past, randomized clinical trials have, indeed, demonstrated that lowering BP levels to less than 140 / 90 mmHg was associated to a substantial reduction of the risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications in hypertensive patients with diabetes. In addition, epidemiological and clinical reports suggested that "the lower, the better" for BP in diabetes, so that levels of BP even lower than 130 / 80 mmHg have been recommended. Recent randomized clinical trials, however, designed to evaluate the potential benefits obtained with an intensive antihypertensive therapy, aimed at achieving a target systolic BP level below 120 mmHg as compared to those obtained with less stringent therapy, have challenged the previous recommendations from international guidelines.

40|$|In {{patients}} with hypertension, do {{lower blood pressure}} (BP) treatment targets reduce mortality and morbidity more than standard targets? Review scope Included studies compared lower (≤ 135 / 85 mm Hg) with stan-dard (≤ 140 to 160 / 90 to 100 mm Hg) BP targets in adults being treated for elevated BP or with documented elevated BP on ≥ 2 occasions. Outcomes included mortality and serious adverse car-diovascular (CV) events. Commentary Cohort studies have compellingly shown that risk for CV events (particularly stroke) increases in a log-linear fashion as SBP rises above 115 mm Hg (1). Such data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>BP</b> that allows a patient to still “mentate, ambulate, and urinate ” is opti-mum. However, observational data are subject to confounding, and optimum treatment thresholds {{should be based on}} RCTs. The systematic review by Arguedas and colleagues seems to definitively answer this question. If analysis of data from> 22 000 {{patients with}} a 7 -mm Hg difference in SBP between lower and standard target groups didn’t show significant differences in CV outcomes, shouldn’t we consider this question closed? I believe there are 3 reasons why we should not. First, almost 90 % of patients and> 75 % of endpoint data in this meta-analysis were from the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial (2) —a study in which lower targets achieved only a small difference in SBP compared with standard targets (140. 6 vs 143. 7 mm Hg). Pooling SBP across all 7 trials is misleading because BP data from the HOT trial are weighted only 18 %, and the pooled SBP difference is much larger than the difference actually observed in the 1 trial driving the outcome analyses.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between total polyphenol excretion (TPE) in urine, as an objective measurement of total polyphenol intake and BP in an elderly population at high cardiovascular risk. Methods and results Cross-sectional substudy of 589 high-risk participants entering in the PREDIMED trial. BP was measured and TPE was determined in urine by Folin–Ciocalteu assay. A significant positive association was observed between TPE in urine and daily intake of fruit and vegetables (F&V), coffee or wine after adjusting for potential confounders. The intake of 100 g of F&V (Beta = 0. 150;P < 0. 001) had a greater contribution to TPE than 100 mL of coffee (Beta = 0. 141;P = 0. 001), and the latter two foods contributed more than the consumption of 100 mL of wine (Beta = 0. 120;P = 0. 019). An inverse association was observed between urinary TPE and the prevalence of hypertension. Participants in the highest quartile of urinary TPE had a reduced prevalence of hypertension compared to those in the lowest quartile (Odds Ratio = 0. 64; 95 % confidence interval 0. 45 to 0. 92; P = 0. 015).

Leptin’s effects on BP are mediated by neuronal circuits in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), as blocking leptin with a specific antibody, antagonist, or inhibition of the activity of LepR-expressing neurons in the DMH caused a rapid reduction of BP in DIO mice, independent of changes in weight. Re-expression of LepRs in the DMH of DIO LepR-deficient mice caused an increase in BP. These studies demonstrate that leptin couples changes in weight to changes in BP in mammalian species...|$|R

40|$|PurposeBlood {{pressure}} (BP) and its variability (BPV) {{are associated}} with an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. This observational study explores the benefits of patients telemonitoring using self-measured BP to optimise treatment and its usefulness in the variability analysisMethodsPatients with uncontrolled hypertension were enrolled during an appointment. 2 SMBP were taken in the morning, at midday and in the evening at set times, the results being sent to a secure server. After 5 days treatment was started if the mean reading was more than 140 / 90. Variability analysis has been realized during all the follow up.

40|$|Background. We {{investigated}} the predictive value of morning blood pressure surge (MBPS) {{on the development}} of microalbuminuria in normotensive adults with a recent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Methods. Prospective assessments of 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and urinary albumin excretion were performed in 377 adult patients. Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression models were used to assess hazard ratios (HRs) between baseline and changes over follow-up in MBPS and the risk of microalbuminuria. The MBPS was calculated as follows: mean systolic BP during the 2 hours after awakening minus mean systolic BP during the 1 hour that included <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> sleep <b>BP.</b> Results. After a mean follow-up of 6. 5 years, microalbuminuria developed in 102 patients. An increase in MBPB during follow-up was associated with an increased risk of microalbuminuria. Compared to individuals in <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> tertile (− 0. 67 ± 1. 10 [*]mmHg), the HR and 95 % CI for microalbuminuria in those in the highest tertile of change (24. 86 ± 6. 92 [*]mmHg) during follow-up were 17. 41 (95 % CI 6. 26 – 48. 42); p for trend < 0. 001.

40|$|Cardiovascular events (CE) occur most {{frequently}} in the morning hours in hypertensive subjects. We studied the association between the morning blood pressure (BP) surge and CE in prognosis of 10 normotensive and 32 well-controlled hypertensive elderly, in whom ambulatory BP monitoring was performed and who were followed prospectively for 5 years. The morning surge (MS) of BP was calculated as mean systolic BP during 2 h after awakening - mean systolic BP during 1 h that included <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> sleep <b>BP.</b> During an average of 60 months, five CE occurred. When the patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to MS, those in the top terzile (MS group; MS ≥ 34 mmHg, n = 14) had a higher prevalence of CE (5 versus 0, p = 0. 001) during the follow-up period, than the others (non-MS group; MS < 34 mmHg, n = 28). The logistic regression analysis showed the MS sleep-trough surge as predictive variable of CE (odds ratio, OR = 0. 794, p = 0. 022). In conclusion, in older normotensives and well-controlled hypertensives, a higher BP MS is associated with vascular risk independently of clinical and ambulatory BP. Reduction of the MS could thus be a therapeutic target for preventing vascular events also in non-hypertensive patients. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with increased blood pressure (BP), which in turn {{increases the risk of}} cardiovascular diseases. We found that the increase in leptin levels seen in diet-induced obesity (DIO) drives an increase in BP in rodents, an effect that was not seen in animals deficient in leptin or leptin receptors (LepR). Furthermore, humans with loss-of-function mutations in leptin and <b>the</b> LepR have <b>low</b> <b>BP</b> despite severe obesity. Leptin’s effects on BP are mediated by neuronal circuits in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), as blocking leptin with a specific antibody, antagonist, or inhibition of the activity of LepR-expressing neurons in the DMH caused a rapid reduction of BP in DIO mice, independent of changes in weight. Re-expression of LepRs in the DMH of DIO LepR-deficient mice caused an increase in BP. These studies demonstrate that leptin couples changes in weight to changes in BP in mammalian species.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{early morning}} blood {{pressure}} surge (EMBPS) {{has been reported}} to be associated with cardiovascular events. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between 24 -hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) parameters and conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Subjects and Methods: Patients (n= 346) never-treated for essential hypertension with no other cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes, dysli-pidemia, and nephropathy were enrolled. The EMBPS was defined as the early morning systolic <b>BP</b> minus <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> night systolic <b>BP.</b> We compared the 24 -hour ABPM parameters in two groups divided by age ( 28 mmHg) after adjusting for gender differences, body mass index, and various 24 -hour ABPM parameters (odds ratio, 1. 051; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 028 - 1. 075; p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Age is an independent risk factor for EMBPS in patients with never-treated hypertension. BP control in the early morning period is more important in elderly patients so as to prevent cardiovascular events. (Korean Circ J 2009; 39 : 322 - 327...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackground and purposeAmbulatory blood {{pressure}} monitoring (ABPM) provides an accurate assessment of {{blood pressure}} (BP) and shows non-dipper BP pattern in many sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) patients with hypertension (HTN); however, little {{information is available}} on the relationship between the severity of SAS and circadian BP changes in SAS patients without HTN. This study investigated whether SAS patients without HTN would have different BP courses in the severity of SAS. Methods and subjectsSeventy-four consecutive outpatients without HTN [systolic BP (BPs) at clinic < 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (BPd) at clinic < 90 mmHg], who received no antihypertensives, underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) and ABPM. The apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated from the PSG results; patients were stratified into the following 4 groups based on their AHI: non-SAS, mild-, moderate-, or severe-SAS. ResultsThe diurnal BPs and BPd showed no differences in the severity of SAS; however, <b>the</b> sleep <b>BPs,</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>BPs,</b> and pre-awake BPs were significantly higher in the severe-SAS group than the non-SAS group (p= 0. 02, p= 0. 04, and p= 0. 006, respectively). The sleep BPd and pre-awake BPd were significantly higher in the severe-SAS than the non-SAS (p= 0. 01 and p= 0. 0003, respectively) and mild-SAS (p= 0. 01 and p= 0. 008, respectively) groups. ConclusionsThe results of this study suggested that SAS affected nocturnal BP elevation even in SAS patients without HTN. The diurnal BP showed no difference in the severity of SAS; however, the severe-SAS group revealed significant nocturnal BP elevation...|$|R
40|$|Many {{important}} decisions on hypertension management must currently be taken {{without the support}} of evidence from large randomized controlled trials. The following issues appear in urgent need to be approached by simply designed trials. (1) Should antihypertensive drugs be prescribed to all patients with grade 1 hypertension, even when total cardiovascular risk is relatively low or moderate? Because of <b>the</b> very <b>low</b> rate of cardiovascular events expected in these patients, a placebo-controlled trial using intermediate endpoints such as signs of organ damage of recognized prognostic importance would be feasible, ethical, and clinically relevant. (2) Should antihypertensive drugs be prescribed to the elderly with grade 1 hypertension, and should antihypertensive treatment achieve a goal of below 140 / 90 mmHg also in the elderly? These trials could make use of hard cardiovascular outcomes and could be placebo-controlled. (3) Should antihypertensive drug treatment be started in diabetic patients or in patients with previous cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease when BP is still in the high normal level, and should BP goal be below 130 / 80 mmHg in these patients? These issues can be approached by placebo-controlled trials because no trial evidence is still available on the benefit of lowering high normal BP or of achieving BP goals below 130 / 80 mmHg. (4) What are <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> safe <b>BP</b> values to achieve by treatment in different clinical conditions? This issue should be approached by trials comparing more or less intense BP-lowering treatment strategies in patients with different cardiovascular risk levels. (5) Are lifestyle measures known to reduce BP also capable of reducing morbidity and mortality in hypertension? A controlled randomized trial using intermediate endpoints (organ damage) would be feasible and desirable in patients with high normal BP or grade 1 hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High blood {{pressure}} (BP) {{is now an}} important public health problem in non-industrialised countries. The limited evidence suggests ethnic inequalities in BP in adults in some non-industrialised countries. However, {{it is unclear whether}} these ethnic inequalities in BP patterns in adults reflect on adolescents. Hence, we assessed ethnic differences in BP, and the association of BP with body mass index (BMI) among adolescents aged 12 – 17 years in Paramaribo, Suriname. Methods Cross-sectional study with anthropometric and {{blood pressure}} measurements. A random sample of 855 adolescents (167 Hindustanis, 169 Creoles, 128 Javanese, 91 Maroons and 300 mixed-ethnicities) were studied. Ethnicity was based on self-reported ethnic origin. Results Among boys, Maroons had a lower age- and height-adjusted systolic BP than Creoles, and a lower diastolic BP than other ethnic groups. However, after further adjustment for BMI, only diastolic BP in Maroons was significantly lower than in Javanese (67. 1 versus 70. 9 mmHg). Creole boys had a lower diastolic BP than Hindustani (67. 3 versus 70. 2 mmHg) and Javanese boys after adjustment for age, height and BMI. Among girls, {{there were no significant differences}} in systolic BP between the ethnic groups. Maroon girls, however, had a lower diastolic BP (65. 6 mmHg) than Hindustani (69. 1 mmHg), Javanese (71. 2 mmHg) and Mixed-ethnic (68. 3 mmHg) girls, but only after differences in BMI had been adjusted for. Javanese had a higher diastolic BP than Creoles (71. 2 versus 66. 8 mmHg) and Mixed-ethnicity girls. BMI was positively associated with BP in all the ethnic groups, except for diastolic BP in Maroon girls. Conclusion The study findings indicate higher mean BP levels among Javanese and Hindustani adolescents compared with their African descent peers. These findings contrast <b>the</b> relatively <b>low</b> <b>BP</b> reported in Javanese and Hindustani adult populations in Suriname and underscore the need for public health measures early in life to prevent high BP and its sequelae in later life. </p...|$|R
