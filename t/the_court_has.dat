5|$|But, the {{defendant}} {{does not have}} a right to a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions, even if the cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months, as long as the actual sentence does not.

5000|$|There are common-law and {{statutory}} {{grounds for}} disqualification that prevent beneficiaries from inheriting, and <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>have,</b> over time, developed the law relating to these.

In consequence, and relying on prevailing values of public policy, new grounds of unworthiness may arise in the future.

5000|$|In a footnote, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> {{noted that}} this ruling was [...] "no innovation", because a {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> already written in Adamson v.

At the time, however, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> not yet ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment made the Fifth Amendment applicable to the States.|$|R
5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E
5|$|In a one-sentence {{per curiam}} opinion, the Court affirmed the D.C. Circuit, citing Barker, Title Insurance, Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock (1903), and Conley v. Ballinger (1910). The Karuk attempt to re-assert their claims decades later {{based upon the}} federal government's general trust {{relationship}} and other statutes were unsuccessful. Since Super, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> twice interpreted the Land Claims Act to also have imposed the requirement to file upon the state of California itself.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its history the Oregon Supreme Court has made a number {{decisions}} as the highest court in Oregon. These cases cover {{a wide range of}} topics from the constitutionality of various ballot measures to contract law to torts and even to the location of the capital when Oregon was still a territory. Although small in comparison to the total number of cases <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> decided, some cases have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Below are some of the cases that have had scholarly discussion, some of which were later decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus is {{the highest}} court in Belarus. While other courts deal with civil or {{criminal}} issues, the Constitutional Court deals with matters involving the Constitution and the legality of certain laws passed by the government. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> the power to declare any law unconstitutional. From April until May 2007, the Constitutional Court reviewed 101 laws and decrees; they were deemed to be constitutional. The court that deals with criminal law matters is the Supreme Court of Belarus.|$|E
5|$|The Free Press Clause protects {{publication}} of information and opinions, and applies {{to a wide variety}} of media. In Near v. Minnesota (1931) and New York Times v. United States (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraint—pre-publication censorship—in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of law: laws made by the governments, called legislation, {{statutes}} or acts; and, laws made by <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b> Laws made by <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> are known as the common law, precedent decisions or case law. They come from the different proceedings that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> heard over hundreds of years, and <b>the</b> decisions <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> made in those different proceedings.|$|R
5|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) was {{established}} by UN Security Council Resolution 827, which was passed on 25 May 1993. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> power to prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violating the laws or customs of war, committing genocide, and crimes against humanity committed in {{the territory of the}} former SFR Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 1851 the Supreme Court was reorganized {{under the}} new state constitution. The {{position}} of justice was changed from an appointed position to an elected one. Judicial terms were changed to six years and the Court's size was set to {{a minimum of three}} members and not more than five. The Court's judges quickly became overwhelmed by an ever-increasing caseload. In 1853 the minimum was increased to four members and in 1872 it was increased to five. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> remained at a minimum of five justices since that time. In 1867 the general assembly transferred all the law books in the Indiana State Library to the Court to create a Supreme Court Law Library. The library grew to become the primary legal library for the state and includes more than seventy-thousand volumes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Powell v. Alabama in 1932, the United States Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to {{defendants}} in capital trials, that is trials where capital punishment was a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own counsel. In Johnson v. Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded this principle to cover all federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to State courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation {{after they have been}} arrested (Miranda v. Arizona), and for line-ups (United States v. Wade).|$|E
25|$|In Marshall's day, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> not {{yet been}} given the {{discretion}} {{whether or not to}} take cases. Scholars such as Edward Hartnett contend that <b>the</b> <b>Court's</b> discretionary certiorari practice undercuts the rationale that Chief Justice Marshall gave in the Cohens case for reviewing the validity of state law, which was that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> no choice in the matter.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E
5|$|The High Court of Chivalry or the Earl Marshal's Court is a {{specialised}} {{civil court}} in England, {{presided over by}} the Earl Marshal. The first references made about the court was in 1348. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction over all matters relating to heraldry as it legalises and enforce decisions of the College of Arms. The court considers all cases relating to questions of status, including disputes over social rank and the law of arms, for example complaints on the infringement {{of the use of}} another individual's coat of arms. The Court of Chivalry meets on the premises of the College of Arms, however the last time it met was in 1954, the first time in 230 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} reviews death penalty cases, state tax court appeals, and items {{regarding}} legal discipline on direct review. Direct review {{means that the}} Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E

5|$|The {{powers of}} the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution’s Article VII. Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts {{primarily}} as a court of appeals. They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions. In this aspect <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court. Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal. With those cases that are denied {{an appeal to the}} Supreme Court, the decision of the lower court becomes final and binding. As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary. The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings. Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case en banc. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in all the cases, unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.|$|E
5|$|Tracing its {{heritage}} to 1841 when Oregon pioneers {{selected a}} Supreme Judge with probate powers, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> {{grown from a}} single judge to its current make up of seven justices. Justices of the court serve six-year terms upon election, however vacancies are filled by appointments of the Governor of Oregon until the next general election when any qualified candidate may run for the position, including the appointee. These seven justices then select one member to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice. The court’s Chief Justice is not only responsible for assigning cases to the other justices to write the court’s opinions, but is also {{the chief executive of}} the Oregon Judicial Department.|$|E
5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
