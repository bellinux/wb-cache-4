40|$|<b>Thiosulfate</b> {{respiration}} in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzyme <b>thiosulfate</b> reductase.

However, the reduction of <b>thiosulfate</b> by menaquinol is highly endergonic under standard conditions (ΔE°' = - 328 mV). <b>Thiosulfate</b> reductase activity was found {{to depend on the}} proton motive force (PMF) across the cytoplasmic membrane. A structural model for <b>thiosulfate</b> reductase suggests that the PMF drives endergonic electron flow within the enzyme by a reverse loop mechanism. <b>Thiosulfate</b> reductase was able to catalyze the combined oxidation of sulfide and sulfite to <b>thiosulfate</b> in a reverse of the physiological reaction.

40|$|Research at ICM on gold {{leaching}} {{and recovery}} related to <b>thiosulfate</b> system is briefed.

This will prevent sulfur species from adsorption on gold, resulting to form sulfur and sulfide passivation coating on its surface. <b>Thiosulfate</b> needed for gold leaching can be produced at the plant site by PTC disporportionation of elemental sulfur to mixed polysulphide and <b>thiosulfate,</b> followed by oxidation of the fresh polysulphide to <b>thiosulfate</b> with aeration.

The presence of <b>thiosulfate</b> increased photosynthetic cell yields on a variety of other organic substrates. Growth of cells in thiosulfate-containing medium, or the addition of <b>thiosulfate</b> to cells grown in thiosulfate-free medium, induced the formation of a thiosulfate-oxidizing system which quantitatively photooxidized <b>thiosulfate</b> to sulfate.

40|$|We {{report on}} <b>thiosulfate</b> {{adsorption}} on a 316 stainless teel electrode in neutral solutions by radiochemical, electro-chemical, and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) measurements. In contrast to previous work on thin metal films or metal electrodeposits to model real-life metal (alloy) samples, our radiochemical approach permits coverage measurements of labeled adsorbates on smooth solid electrodes of convenient size and thickness.

The difficulty limiting application of the thiosulfate (S 2 O 32 -) or polythionate (SxO 62 -) leaching lies in their industrial production.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown by Lindh [1] and others [2] that the shift in the K {{absorption}} edges for various compounds of sulfur, chlorine, phosphorous, iron, and some other substances, depends chiefly on the valence of the element in a given compound. With increasing valence in a given element the wave-length of the edge shifts to smaller values. Stelling [3] has explained the effect of valence as being due to the screening effect of electrons in external parts of atoms. To be sure, other factors influence {{the position of the}} edges, such as other elements occurring in the compounds, and lattice structure, but these factors produce in general only minor fluctuations around a mean value, whereas the mean values for the several valences show rather wide divergences. For example, the wave-lengths of the principal K edge {{of a large number of}} 4 - and 6 -valent inorganic sulfur compounds practically all lie within half an X-unit of the means of their respective groups, whereas the means themselves are separated by 8 X. U. A similar state of affairs is observed in the 2 -valent compounds. The edges do not lie quite so close to the mean, but the mean is 13 X. U. from that of the 4 -valent compounds. All the substances thus far investigated bear out the general statements above. In view of the rather large body of facts now before us, it seems legitimate to try to use x-ray absorption data to obtain information on the valence state of an element in a compound. The substance used in the present investigation was potassium dithionate, the object being to determine the state of the two sulfur atoms in K 2 S 2 O 6. Lindh [4] has already shown that for Na 2 S 2 O 3 and some other <b>thiosulfates</b> there is not just a simple absorption edge, but two edges, corresponding in position to the valence states SII and probably Siv, which states are generally assumed by chemists for the two sulfur atoms in the <b>thiosulfates.</b> Now if valence is calculated in the usual way, then on the assumption that the sulfur atoms of the dithionates are in the same state we get for them a valence of V, and we would expect to find the K absorption edge corresponding to a single state, rather than the two edges shown by the <b>thiosulfates...</b>|$|E
