The variables of the working fluid optimization were the turbine inlet temperature, pressure, and the temperature of flow rate at the compact heat exchangers. They used this approach to retrieve the waste heat from gas turbines SGI- 500 installed on draugen oil and gas platform in the North Sea.

40|$|Small-scale {{hydropower}} {{has been}} one of the frontiers in the development of new renewable electricity generation in Norway from the turn of the 21 st century. Further, small-scale hydropower will be one of the key technologies to utilize in order to fulfill the political objective to increase the production of renewable electricity toward 2020. A better understanding of factors affecting the development of such schemes would therefore be valuable, but has received little attention in academic research. This thesis conducts a quantitative analysis of key external cost drivers for small-scale hydropower projects (1 - 10 MW) commissioned in the past ten years, and attempts to model a cost estimation tool to aid in assessment of new projects that are ready to be deployed. The results showed that <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> are consistently underestimated in license application budgets. The median difference for total costs in nominal values was found to be 49. 1 %, and 1. 12 NOK/kWh (estimated annual production). The analysis further documents that: 1) 	Specific <b>total</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> (in NOK/kWh) increased in real values during the past ten years, with an estimated average growth rate for all projects at 3. 7 pp per year (with 2005 as the base year). 2) 	<b>Total</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> increase with longer construction periods. An average increase of 37. 8 % per year in real values was estimated when all projects in the dataset were taken into consideration. 3) 	Specific <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> differ between geographical regions. Projects in Western Norway tend to have relatively low specific costs with an observed average of 3. 79 NOK/kWh in real values. Projects in Northern Norway tend to have a relatively high specific <b>investment</b> <b>cost,</b> with an observed average of 4. 7 NOK/kWh in real values. 4) 	Projects developed by the owners of the water resource were found to have lower reported costs than projects developed by professional project development companies. Projects in the non-professional group had an observed average specific cost of 3. 95 NOK/kWh in real values, while the projects in the professional group had an average specific cost of 4. 71 NOK/kWh in real values. Two cost estimation models for <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> of small-scale hydropower projects were developed, with use of multiple linear regression. The first was developed for predicting <b>total</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs,</b> and achieved a mean absolute error rate of 18. 0 %,. The second was developed for predicting partial costs, and achieved an error rate of 15. 6 %. This thesis contributes to the literature by documenting the scales of underbudgeting in license applications, and by analyzing estimated effects of the selected cost driving factors. The cost estimation models developed may prove useful in comparing future small hydropower projects with respect to their <b>investment</b> <b>costs.</b> They can be used to produce independent cost predictions, and complement license application budget estimates for increased accuracy and indication of the cost uncertainty for each project. If applied for analyzing future project development, these findings may be useful for the decision makers and for the hydropower industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} new {{approach}} to dealing with real options problems with uncertain maturity. This approach is highly applicable to analyze R&D investments and mine or oil exploration projects. These projects are characterized by significant on-going <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> until completion. Since time to completion is uncertain, the <b>total</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> will also be uncertain. Despite the fact that these projects include complicated American abandonment/switching options until completion and European options at completion (because of fixed final <b>investment</b> <b>costs)</b> we obtain simple closed form solutions. We apply the framework to situations in which the owner of the project has monopoly rights to the outcome of the project, and to situations in which there are two owners who simultaneously invest, but where only one of them may obtain the rights to the outcome. We expand the real options framework to incorporate game theoretic considerations, including a generalization of mixed strategies to continuous-time models in the form of abandonment intensities...|$|R
