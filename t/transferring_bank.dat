These assets must have been acquired before Jan. 1, 2009. 2. In exchange, the <b>transferring</b> <b>bank</b> (from now on just “bank”) receives securities of the SPV which are guaranteed by the German state through the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (“SoFFin”). The bank pays a guarantee fee to SoFFin. 3. As a rule, the transfer of assets is {{made on the basis}} of 90 per cent of the book value in the bank’s balance sheet. 4. The bank has to supply information on the current time value of the asset, which has to be confirmed by an independent expert and by the banking supervisory authority.
