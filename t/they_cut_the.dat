Word of this reached the militia, and thrty-five men mustered to oppose them. The ships reached the log boom, and a firefight began between the two forces. The militia {{resistance}} was sufficient to keep the British from attempting a landing that day. Early the next morning, under the cover of fog, the marines were landed. <b>They</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> log boom, seized a sloop carrying lumber, and set fire to a storehouse, seizing stores of flour, rice, corn, shoes, and ammunition before returning to the ships.|$|E
5|$|The cavalry {{phase of}} the Battle of Sharon began {{as soon as the}} gap was made during the {{infantry}} attacks. The 5th Cavalry Division led the way north up along the Plain of Sharon followed by the 4th Cavalry Division with the Australian Mounted Division in reserve. These divisions subsequently rode across the Mount Carmel Range through two passes, to occupy the Esdraelon Plain, on 20 September. Here <b>they</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> main Ottoman lines of communication. Units of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions converged to capture Afulah with the 4th Cavalry Division capturing Beisan in the afternoon. The Australian Mounted Division captured Jenin along with thousands of prisoners when they captured the main line of retreat from Nablus to Damascus. On 20 September Nazareth, the site of the Ottoman Army's Yildirim Army Group headquarters, was unsuccessfully attacked by the 5th Cavalry Division. During the Battle of Nazareth the Ottoman Commander in Chief, Otto Liman von Sanders, was forced to escape. The 5th Cavalry Division captured the town the following day and several days later this division also captured Haifa and Acre following the Battle of Haifa. On {{the last day of the}} Battle of Sharon, the Australian Mounted Division attacked a German reinforced rearguard garrison at Samakh, which had been put on the alert by Liman von Sanders during his escape from Nazareth. The Australian Light Horse victory at the Battle of Samakh and the subsequent Capture of Tiberias ended the Battle of Sharon and the Battle of Megiddo. As a result of the battles of Sharon and Nablus, known collectively as the Battle of Megiddo, much territory and many prisoners were captured. The Final Offensive of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign began the day after the Battle of Megiddo ended, with the pursuit to Damascus, which was captured on 1 October.|$|E

Following a Denver punt, Jacksonville got the ball back with 57 seconds left. Mark Brunell then completed a 43-yard pass to receiver Jimmy Smith to set up Hollis' 42-yard field goal, giving the team a 13-12 halftime lead.|$|E

25|$|Brown's men {{needed to}} capture the weapons and escape before word could be sent to Washington. The raid was going well for Brown's men. <b>They</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> {{telegraph}} wire and seized a Baltimore & Ohio train passing through. A free black man was the first casualty of the raid. Hayward Shepherd, an African-American baggage handler on the train, confronted the raiders; they shot and killed him. For some reason, Brown let the train continue, and the conductor alerted the authorities down the line. Brown had been sure that he would win the support of local slaves in joining the rebellion, but a massive uprising did not occur, because word had not been spread about the uprising, so the slaves nearby {{did not know about}} it. Although the white townspeople soon began to fight back against the raiders, Brown's men succeeded in capturing the armory that evening.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the raid}} went well, and they met no {{resistance}} entering the town. <b>They</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> telegraph wires and easily captured the armory, which was being defended {{by a single}} watchman. They next rounded up hostages from nearby farms, including Colonel Lewis Washington, great-grandnephew of George Washington. They also spread the news to the local slaves that their liberation was at hand. Things started to go wrong when an eastbound Baltimore & Ohio train approached the town. The train's baggage master tried to warn the passengers. Brown's men yelled for him to halt and then opened fire. The baggage master, Hayward Shepherd, became the first casualty of Brown's war against slavery. Ironically, Shepherd was a free black man. Two of the hostages' slaves also died in the raid. For some reason, after the shooting of Shepherd, Brown allowed the train to continue on its way.|$|E
25|$|In {{his younger}} days, Gan Ning {{was known to}} be very {{energetic}} and eager to behave like a youxia or vigilante. He gathered a group of wayward young men, with him as their chief, and engaged in piracy. They were armed with either bows or crossbows, wore feathers in their hats and tied bells on their bodies. The ringing of the bells alerted people to the presence of Gan Ning and his gang. Gan Ning's plundering and murderous ways earned him infamy throughout Ba Commandery. On land, he and his gang travelled by riding on horses or in chariots in a certain formation; on water, they sailed on light vessels linked together. They were dressed in elaborate and flamboyant garments to attract attention wherever they went. When they stopped at a certain location, they used silk to tie their boats to the jetties; when they were departing, <b>they</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> silk and abandoned it as a display of their extravagance.|$|E

25|$|The Sihanouk Trail was {{activated}} in 1965, {{stretching from}} the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville through Cambodia to {{the southern end of}} the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In Military Region 4 (MR 4) of the Kingdom of Laos, the two trails joined. The Royal Lao Government (RLG) commander of MR 4 and the communist interlopers from the Trails shared a truce by gentleman's agreement. The agreement had been breached in 1966 by fleeting Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) raids against the Sihanouk Trail. MACV-SOG also sent patrols from South Vietnam against both Trails, though with little or limited success in interdiction. The Sihanouk Trail was a product of Norodom Sihanouk's accommodations with the Vietnamese communists. As a counter to this supply effort, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sponsored guerrilla unit raids by hill tribesmen in MR 4; from 2126 June 1969, <b>they</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> Sihanouk Trail for three days during Operation Left Jab. When Sihanouk fell from power in March 1970, the new republican government of Cambodia clamped down on communist traffic in the nation. In May, a RLG delegation led by Prince Boun Oum offered Lon Nol the opportunity to station Khmer troops in southern Laos and fight the communists there instead of in Cambodia. The RLG offer was originally declined, then rethought.|$|E

500|$|The Yardbirds {{began as}} the Metropolis Blues Quartet. By 1963 they had {{acquired}} Eric Clapton as a lead guitarist and were {{acting as the}} backing band for Sonny Boy Williamson on his British tour. They earned a formidable reputation as a live act, developing frantic improvised guitar–harmonica [...] "rave-ups", but they enjoyed only modest success with singles based on R covers. In 1965 <b>they</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> more pop-oriented single [...] "For Your Love", which made the top 10 in the UK and US, but the {{move away from the}} blues prompted Clapton to quit the band for a stint with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and then to form Cream.

500|$|This {{characterisation}} of the Scots {{was often}} politically motivated, {{and many of}} the most hostile writers were based in areas frequently subjected to Scottish raids. English and French accounts of the Battle of the Standard contain many accounts of Scottish atrocities. For instance, Henry of Huntingdon notes that the Scots: [...] "cleft open pregnant women, and took out the unborn babes; they tossed children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: <b>they</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, all was full of horror and full of savagery." [...] A less hostile view was given by Guibert of Nogent in the First Crusade, who encountered Scots and wrote that: [...] "You might have seen a crowd of Scots, a people savage at home but unwarlike elsewhere, descend from their marshy lands, with bare legs, shaggy cloaks, their purse hanging from their shoulders; their copious arms seemed ridiculous to us, but they offered their faith and devotion as aid." ...|$|E

500|$|Itoi {{originally}} intended {{the game to}} have 12 chapters with varied game mechanics; for example, one with classic role-playing game mechanics and another as just cutscenes. He conceptualized the process as designing 3D [...] "puppets" [...] that could then be easily moved around the [...] "stage". In actuality, each custom scene required special programming. The player-character changed between each chapter—a concept they first attempted in their previous game—so as to see multiple characters grow. As development wore on, Itoi offered to compromise by replacing full chapters with sequences of still images and text. <b>They</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> total chapters to seven or nine {{by the time it}} was canceled. Itoi described the story as [...] "normal" [...] for its first half, leading up to a [...] "triple-play twist". One of the game's themes was the reckless appearance and [...] "uncomfortable beauty" [...] of chimera—multiple creatures fused into one—which was the idea behind the metallic and wooden Mother 3 logo. Itoi has said of his role in the Mother series that he wanted to be more of a team member and scriptwriter and less of a manager in Mother 3 development. He saw himself as simultaneously making the game he wanted to play and setting traps for the player, and as making a game Nintendo could not.|$|E
