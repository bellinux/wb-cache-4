It {{has also been}} misidentified as Raia granulata by Theodore Gill, an American ichthyologist, in 1879. The genus name, Dipturus, {{is derived from the}} Greek words di, meaning two, and pteryx, meaning wing. Raja, the original genus which was coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is still recognized as a valid subgenus.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{religious}} {{incident occurred}} in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of Đà Nẵng. Local Buddhists began to believe that <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among Cẩn's district chief and his subordinates. The local law enforcement agencies mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, led by Colonel Lê Quang Tung {{under the direction of}} Nhu. The grenading of the pond finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E
50|$|Cironka (Циронка) is a {{traditional}} Macedonian dish. It originates from Prespa region. This dish is made from common bleak. <b>The</b> fresh <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> salted {{with a lot of}} salt until they become whitish. Then, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> left in a bowl for six to seven days. The bowl must be covered and except <b>the</b> <b>fish,</b> we can put some nettle. After that, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> threaded and they're left to dry on sunny weather, until they get hard. Then <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> fried on both sides, and placed in hot water to become less salty. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> served with some peppermint, oil, vinegar and garlic.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} slender shape, <b>the</b> young <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> often not {{recognised}} as bream, {{but they can}} be identified by their flat bodies and silvery colour. At this stage, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> still pelagic, but after a few months, they acquire their typical body shape and become bottom-dwellers. By three to four years old, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> sexually mature.|$|R
5000|$|The chopped {{pieces of}} <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> washed and <b>the</b> scales removed. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> marinated {{with salt and}} {{turmeric}} powder and fried in mustard oil.

25|$|Anna Karoline {{served as}} a cargo vessel and the cargo changed {{depending}} on what owners she had, {{time of the year}} and where she was stationed. When Ole Vandsvik was one of the owners Anna Karoline started the new year with a voyage to Lofoten to buy fish. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> salted on board the vessel and she returned in May to Kiran in Roan where <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> dried. While <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> drying the jekt was transporting timber from Namsen to Northern Norway. When the fish had dried the vessel was loaded with stockfish, and sailed to Bergen. The vessel was also used for transporting herring and as sleeping quarters during fishing.|$|E
25|$|The Finnmark coast was {{originally}} {{important as a}} source of furs from the trade with the Karelians, but this trade dropped off as the Hanseatic League increased the fur trade through their Novgorod centre. Finnmark remained important as a fishery; <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> shipped as stockfish to Bergen and traded there with the Hansa merchants.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012 up to 18,700 becquerels per {{kilogram}} radioactive cesium {{was detected}} in yamame, or landlocked masu salmon, {{caught in the}} Niida river near the town Iitate, which was over 37 times the legal limit of 500 becquerels/kg. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> caught for testing purposes prior {{to the opening of}} the fishing season. Fishing cooperatives were asked to refrain from catching and eating yamame fish from this river and all streams adjacent to it. No fish was sold in local markets.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{then placed}} in another wire basket and lowered in. After 9-10 minutes, when <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> cooked, <b>the</b> oils {{rise to the}} top of the pot.

25|$|Poole {{established}} successful commerce {{with the}} North American colonies, including the important fisheries of Newfoundland that later resulted in significant lasting trade. By the mid 16th century {{records show that}} large quantities of salt, an essential ingredient for the salt cod trade, was being landed at Poole. Over the next fifty years the trade with Newfoundland steadily grew {{to meet the demand}} for fish from the Catholic countries of Europe. Poole's share of this trade varied but the most prosperous period of trade started in the early 18th century and lasted until the early 19th century. The trade was a three-cornered route; ships went out to Newfoundland loaded with salt and provisions. Caught, dried, and salted in Newfoundland, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> brought back to ports in Spain, Portugal and Italy. Finally the ships returned to Poole with wine, olive oil, dried fruits, and salt.|$|E
25|$|The giant {{trevally}} {{has been}} used by humans since prehistoric times, with the oldest known records of the capture of this species by Hawaiians, whose culture held the fish in high regard. The ulua, as the fish is known to Hawaiians, was likened to a fine man and strong warrior, which was the cause of a ban on women eating the species in antiquity. The species was often used in Hawaiian religious rites, and took place of a human sacrifice when none was available. Culturally, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> seen as a god, and treated as gamefish which commoners could not hunt. There are many mentions of ulua in Hawaiian proverbs, all generally relating to the strength and warrior-like qualities of the fish. The Hawaiians considered the fish to be of excellent quality, with white, firm flesh. Despite this, intrusions of giant trevally into modern-day fishponds used by Hawaiians for rearing fish are unwelcome; being a predator, it eats more than it is worth at market.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{hung over}} <b>the</b> fire, {{the top of}} the barrel is covered with a lid and sealed around the edges with wet jute sacks (the water {{prevents}} the jute sacks from catching fire). All of this serves to create a very hot, humid and smoky fire. The intense heat and thick smoke <b>is</b> essential if <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> to be cooked, not burned, and to have the strong, smoky taste and smell people expect from Arbroath smokies. Typically {{in less than an hour}} of smoking, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> ready to eat.|$|R
50|$|The Māori of New Zealand, to whom <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{known by}} their name kahawai, koopuuhuri, and kooukauka, fish in {{subsistence}} and customary capacities. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> (and are) caught with lines of flax fibre and elaborate hooks of bone, wood, shell such as paua, or stone. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> filleted before being hung on racks to dry. Recreational fishers also seek Australian salmon for their renowned mettle when hooked; <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{a challenge to}} land and often jump, occasionally standing on their tails. A significant number are taken for sport. No records of total recreational catches are kept, but the year's estimated catch of Australian herring from Western Australia's Blackwood River estuary beginning May, 1974, was 68,000 individuals.|$|R
50|$|The islands economy {{also saw}} a huge growth in its <b>fishing</b> industry. <b>The</b> <b>fishing</b> {{technique}} of almadraba {{was used in the}} seas around the island. This used a labyrinth of nets and around fifty boats which channelled huge schools of <b>fish,</b> Tuna being <b>the</b> main catch, in to a holding area. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> then culled and dragged aboard <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> boats. However these catches were so bountiful that not all <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> killed. Some of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> kept alive in aquatic enclosures. There was just this sort of Roman facility, along with a fish processing plant, built at S'Argamassa.|$|R
25|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians traveled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques {{played an important role in}} the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near cod fishing grounds. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> so important to the history and development of Massachusetts, the state's House of Representatives hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.|$|E
25|$|The species, {{as it is}} {{currently}} accepted, was first described and classified by the Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in 1934 based upon a sample taken from Port Hedland in Western Australia, which was designated to be the holotype. Whitley named the species Olistus hedlandensis, placing the fish in what {{was at the time}} a valid genus of jacks. When Olistus was synonymised with Carangoides, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> placed either in Caranx or Carangoides, and {{is currently}} accepted as belonging in the latter. The specific epithet refers to the type location of the species, Port Hedland. This {{was not the first time}} the fish had been described though, with Georges Cuvier applying the name Olistus malabaricus to the species in 1833, which would give it priority over Whitley's name. However, when Olistus was merged into Carangoides, a taxonomic homonym was created with Carangoides malabaricus, thus Whitley's name has been accepted to overcome this problem. The bumpnose trevally is very similar to Carangoides armatus, and appears to have been misidentified as such many times, with 1980 review of the two species finding many misidentified fish in museum collections.|$|E
