5|$|Pickett was {{commissioned}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 8th Infantry Regiment.

5|$|The third door is a vestry door further right, {{leading to}} the small gabled north priests' vestry. It is of {{uncertain}} age and could be of nineteenth century origin. It now includes a modern brick chimney stack.). The priests' vestry in turn leads to the later nineteenth century choir sacristy or vestry. This is a slight lean-to structure, with timber glazing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> in two levels, and is built, none too elegantly, between {{the east end of}} the north transept and the original priests' vestry.|$|E
5|$|Together, the Clan cats {{succeed in}} leading Sharptooth {{into a trap}} in a cave. However, their plan to poison Sharptooth goes awry, and Feathertail jumps up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the cave onto a stalactite, causing it to fall. Both Feathertail and Sharptooth are killed by the impact. The Tribe then realizes that Feathertail was the silver cat in their prophecy, not her brother Stormfur, as they had {{previously}} thought. The five remaining cats then continue their journey. The book ends with Squirrelpaw noticing Highstones, {{which is at the}} edge of WindClan territory; they are almost home.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, Matthew {{caused a}} storm surge {{of up to}} 5.85feet (1.8m) in Frenier, Louisiana. The storm surge and waves {{resulted}} in significant beach erosion in Grand Isle. Matthew produced heavy rainfall across its path, totaling to 16.23inches (410mm) in Reserve in the southeastern portion of the state. Portions of northwestern Louisiana experienced significant rainfall, including a peak of 18inches (460mm) in Haynesville near the Louisiana/Arkansas border. In addition, Matthew spawned one tornado, causing damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of a trailer in Golden Meadow. The rainfall also caused rivers to crest higher than normal, including the Killian River which peaked at 5.7feet (1.7m).|$|E
50|$|The eaves {{overhang}} may also shelter openings <b>to</b> ventilate <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> space.|$|R
5000|$|The Maharani {{passed a}} {{proclamation}} allowing everyone in her kingdom <b>to</b> tile <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of their houses.

5000|$|Gangut-class battleships - As {{built the}} ships of this class were each {{armed with a}} single Pattern 1914/15 gun on the quarterdeck. After 1920-1922 refits three guns were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> end turrets of the three {{surviving}} ships.|$|R
