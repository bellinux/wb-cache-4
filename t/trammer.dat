5000|$|Sykes {{was born}} in Wentworth, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, England [...] As {{a member of a}} poor family, he {{received}} no formal education, and took on paid work from an early age. In 1851 he was recorded as unmarried and working as a coal-pit <b>trammer.</b> In 1853 Sykes married Myra Wilcock, and {{over the next ten years}} they had four children. He was later employed as a puddler.|$|E
50|$|At {{the initial}} party conference on 17 April 2005, Jörg Haider was elected {{leader of the}} Alliance. Hubert Gorbach, the Austrian Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Infrastructure was the {{parliamentary}} leader, with Heike <b>Trammer</b> and Karin Gastinger as his deputies. Uwe Scheuch, {{a member of the}} National Council and former General Secretary of the Freedom Party, is the Alliance's spokesman. On 24 September 2006 Karin Gastinger left the BZÖ, staying Minister of Justice.|$|E
50|$|The mine {{operators}} {{got into}} a dispute with the railroads which had raised rates for hauling ore. Mine operators also introduced hole-boring machines into the mines. The new machines displaced single-jack and double-jack miners, forcing the men into new, lower-paid jobs as <b>trammers</b> or muckers.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the Cornish {{influence}} in the Copper Country mines, the contract system was also used in the Copper Country. However, contracts were only used with miners, who identified and blasted out copper-bearing rock. <b>Trammers,</b> whose job was to remove the blasted-out rock in heavy tram cars, were not paid on a contract, and were often {{considered to be a}} [...] "lower class" [...] of worker.|$|R
50|$|However, many Copper Country mines did {{introduce}} an 8-hour day partway {{through the}} strike, for the miners who had stayed {{to work for}} them. This continued after the strike, when national labor legislation required shorter workdays. Labor legislation also limited use of child labor and mandated higher daily wages for miners and <b>trammers.</b> All mines eventually changed to a daily wage, leaving behind the old family-group contract system entirely.|$|R
50|$|If {{the tunnel}} was long, the <b>trammer</b> was given extra assistants {{to speed the}} exit of spoil and intake of timber. The team was {{responsible}} for its own safety, and would insert a 'sett' of wooden supports every 9 in. As no nails or screws could {{be used due to}} noise, the 'setts' (consisting of a sole, two legs and a cap), were sawn with a rebated step, which, once trimmed into the clay, would expand with the absorbed water into a solid structure.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the last}} leg of their trip they heard a man yelling from behind them. This man {{turned out to be a}} <b>trammer</b> [...] boss by the name of Humphrey Quick, who had been {{directed}} by his boss, William H. Schacht, to patrol the path and ensure that no one crossed this path. Quick told the two men, in English, that they could not cross this path. Kalan and Stimac were Croatian and Kalan spoke very little English. Stimac spoke almost no English. Kalan answered in broken English that they had always crossed this path before. Quick responded by taking out his billy club and angrily waving it in their faces, threatening to beat them with it if they did not comply. The two men simply responded as they had before and continued on walking.|$|E
5000|$|An {{incident}} {{called the}} [...] "Seeberville Affair" [...] occurred on August 14, 1913, when John Kalan and John Stimac, two strikers, walked across mine property and {{were told that}} they could not cross the path by a deputized <b>Trammer</b> boss by the name of Humphrey Quick. They ignored his order, and so the guard notified his supervisor. The guard, another deputy, and some members of the Waddell-Mahon Detective Agency were sent to the residence of Kalan to bring the two men to the supervisor to talk. Kalan refused to go with them, and after going back inside the boarding house, the group of men began shooting at the house. Stimac and another man named Stanko Stepic were wounded. Two boarders with no connection to Kalan or Stimac were killed; Alois Tijan died on the scene and Steve Putrich the next day. The funeral for Tijan and Putrich was attended by 3500 to 5000 people, and the procession was led by labor activist Anna Clemenc. The deaths increased the intensity of the strike. In February 1914, three Waddell-Mahon guards and a deputy sheriff were convicted of manslaughter.|$|E
5000|$|Miners in the Keweenaw {{were not}} unionized {{until just before}} the 1913 strike. Several wildcat strikes had {{occurred}} in previous years, but these were done only at individual mines, and usually involved only one group of workers (especially <b>trammers,</b> who were paid less than miners for physically intensive work). In the late 19th century and early 20th century, several unions had attempted to organize locals within the Copper Country, {{but none of them}} succeeded.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{major issues}} {{contributed to the}} strike of 1913-14. One of the major {{complaints}} was the paternalism of the mines. The Copper Country copper mines operated a heavily paternalistic system, in which the mines watched closely over workers' lives {{both in and out}} of the mines. Historically, this developed for several reasons. Early mines in the distant Keweenaw wilderness had no nearby towns to supply their needs, and so the mines provided all services themselves. Most mines provided housing and schooling for miners and their families, as well as doctors, hospitalization, and even the construction of roads. Houses were assigned with preference to miners and other skilled laborers (as opposed to <b>trammers),</b> and to men with families (as opposed to single men). Additionally, most houses were given to certain favored ethnic groups, especially Americans [...] and Cornishmen. In exchange, miners were expected to act as the mines desired. Miners who fought, drank excessively, or were otherwise found to act improperly could be fired by the mines at any time. Another major complaint was the one-man drill. In a system of hard-rock mining inherited from Cornish mines, miners drilled blast holes in a three-man team. One man held a steel drill, while two other men took turns hitting the steel with sledgehammers. Mines began to look for improvements to this system as early as the 1870s. The first improvement came with the [...] "two man drill", which was a mechanical drill operated by compressed air. This drill was much more efficient than the three-man system, but still required two men to set up and operate. In addition, some mines allowed three men to work on the drill. As a result, the changeover from the three-man system to the two-man drill was relatively smooth.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{application}} of ergonomic intervention into a mining system with the view to increase its productivity. The effectiveness of the Ergonomic Work Rest Scheduling (EWRS) application, a vital tool of ergonomics, to reduce metabolic energy cost and increasing productivity with Effective Utilization of Man shift (EUMS) is {{the main focus of}} the study. Thirty five healthy underground <b>trammers</b> (N= 35) were chosen based on some pre-determined criteria for the assessment. The personnel chosen from the mine were taken on the basis of experience of more than one year with no record of past illness. The study was performed in two different zones for one month of period each, one before application of EWRS and another after application of EWRS. Cardiac frequency of indirect physical parameters like Working Heart Rate (WHR) is recorded continuously at five seconds intermissions with a portable heart rate monitor. In case of Average Working Heart Rate (AWHR) value, it was seen that two different spells of after EWRS application value found lower than before EWRS application AWHR value. Different Cardiac Cost (CC) values like Net cardiac Cost (NCC) and RCC (Relative Cardiac Cost) also followed the trend of AWHR i. e. a significantly lower range after EWRS application. It was observed that application of appropriate EWRS has positively withdrawn the effect of the extra burden on mine workers. Perceived exertion scale had gone down to 13. 91 as compared to before EWRS value of 15. 11. It was also seen that application of EWRS effectively reduced the Net Metabolic Cost (NMC). The NMC of two different spells after application of EWRS seemed to be lower than that of Previous. After application of EWRS, NMC had gone down by 34. 5 % {{in the case of the}} spell 1 and 38. 1 % in the case of spell 2. Physiological job stress had been minimized by implementing adequate EWRS in between different working spells. Hence, it could be suggested that an implementation of EWRS and in depth ergonomic intervention would be very effective to minimize work-stress related problems and thereby increasing work efficiency and productivity of miners...|$|R
