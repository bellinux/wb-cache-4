5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this {{in order to gain}} the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E

50|$|Hanger width {{can greatly}} {{influence}} the turning {{characteristics of a}} truck. A wider hanger {{is thought to be}} more stable (turn less quickly). This is because the board generally has less leverage over the hanger, the wheels have <b>a</b> further distance <b>to</b> travel <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> angle, and more board lean is lost due to bushing compression.|$|R

25|$|The {{risk of the}} diver {{getting lost}} or being unable to call for {{assistance}} is also drastically reduced in comparison with most scuba, as the diver is physically connected to the surface control point by the umbilical, making it relatively simple for the standby diver <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> diver in distress, and the standard application of hard-wired voice communications allows the surface team to constantly monitor the diver's breathing sounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} festivity in the Swedish calendar, or perhaps for many the most important, is Midsummer, midsommar.

Most Swedes try upon this day <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place in the countryside where they can eat pickled herring, boiled potatoes and sour cream as well as strawberries and brännvin. A maypole is often erected around which, at least if there are children present at the celebration, dancing is performed. Houses are often decorated in birch twigs.|$|E
25|$|Snell's law can {{be derived}} from Fermat's principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the {{derivative}} of the optical path length, the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light (though {{it should be noted that}} the result does not show light taking the least time path, but rather one that is stationary with respect to small variations as there are cases where light actually takes the greatest time path, as in a spherical mirror). In a classic analogy, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> drowning person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell's law.|$|E

25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} consequential. General damages are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|E
25|$|In his Policy Statement, {{introduced}} to the Riksdag on 3 October 2014, Löfven said that his Government would recognize the State of Palestine. On 30 October 2014 the Government, through Minister for Foreign Affairs Margot Wallström, announced that the Government had decided to officially recognize the State of Palestine and explained the recognition by {{saying that it is}} the only solution <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> two-state solution between Israel and the State of Palestine. Sweden is the first country within the European Union to do so after gaining membership (with other members, such as Poland, withholding recognition previously issued under Communist rule). Israel called the move unconsidered and Israel recalled its ambassador, Isaac Bachman, following the recognition. Bachman returned to Sweden on 29 November 2014. In December 2015 Löfven caused an outrage in Israel by claiming that stabbing attacks are not considered terrorism by international standards. Later he reiterated himself, explaining that it is now known that the stabbing attacks are sanctioned by some terror organisations.|$|E
25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E

25|$|Hitman: Absolution is a stealth {{video game}} in which the player assumes {{the role of a}} hitman named Agent 47. Presented from a third-person perspective, the {{gameplay}} centers around completing set objectives within a series of levels. Objectives can range from simply reaching the end of the level, to killing specific individuals. Players choose how to complete each level, taking branching paths <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> target or location. Players may use pistols, bottles or bricks, assault rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or steel pipe against enemies if opting for the action-oriented approach, or avoid enemies altogether, not being seen, using disguises, blending into the environment, and only attacking the set target(s), if using the stealth-oriented approach. Agent 47 also has the 'Instinct' ability that lets the player monitor enemies more easily. There are also environmental ways to kill or distract individuals; players can use poison to spike coffee, pull switches to make a disco ball fall and break, cause a massive explosion at a gas station, pull a switch to cause scaffolding to fall down, cause fires, or set off fireworks. Players complete chapters in order to progress through the story. The player journeys to various locations, including a mansion, library, strip club, gun store, wrestling arena, courthouse, and hotel during the story.|$|E
