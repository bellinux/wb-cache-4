5|$|Rumors that PortAventura {{would be}} {{investing}} in a new Bolliger & Mabillard Flying Coaster or Dive Coaster roller coaster emerged in late 2010. In May 2011, speculation that the park was planning to build a hypercoaster that would pass over Dragon Khan arose. Land clearing also began {{in the summer of}} 2011. Shambhala was announced to the public on October 24, 2011; the layout of the roller coaster was leaked 2 days earlier. The last piece of track was installed in mid-April 2012 following a signing event and the placement of the several country flags on the <b>track.</b> <b>Testing</b> of the ride began in the same month. Following the completion of testing, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held on May 12, 2012 before opening to the public the same day. Over 300 workers from countries such as Germany, France, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, and United States of America took part in the construction of Shambhala.|$|E
500|$|International Training Week for luge {{took place}} at the track 7–15 November 2008. A total of 2482 runs took place during the {{training}} with several injuries occurring, most notably Loch, the 2008 men's singles world champion, who injured his shoulder. In a 9 December 2008 press release, the Centre was continuing certification by adding protections on the track against crashes and weather. FIL President Josef Fendt stated that the track's speed was too high with top speeds reaching [...] during training. From the 2482 runs executed during the International Training week for luge, there were 73 crashes, a crash rate of three percent which was normal during new <b>track</b> <b>testing.</b> Three lugers, including Loch, were sent to the hospital, but were later released. Italy's Zöggeler stated that [...] "The track can be tackled." [...] and [...] "does not see big problems for the athletes" [...] while Fendt called for the top track speed for future tracks to be lowered to [...] where possible. For the 2008–09 World Cup season at the Centre, 15115 runs were made for bobsleigh (2153), luge (9672), and skeleton (3290).

40|$|The rutting {{performance}} of asphalt pavement structure {{relies on the}} high temperature properties of asphalt mixture {{as well as the}} pavement structure and thickness. In order to investigate the influence of the structure and thickness, a full-depth wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> is developed in this research by improving the conventional wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> apparatus. The newly proposed test method is capable of varying its load speed and load size, controlling its specimen temperature gradient, and simulating the support conditions of actual asphalt pavement. The full-depth wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> based rutting performance evaluation of different asphalt pavement structures indicates that it is not reasonable to explain the rutting {{performance of}} asphalt pavement structure {{from the point of view}} of single-layer asphalt mixture rutting performance.

50|$|For <b>track</b> <b>testing,</b> a {{detergent}} based solution {{has historically}} been used to provide low adhesion test conditions. European and international standards often refer to this test method (BS-EN 15595, UIC 541-05). In the UK, British Rail Research adopted two approaches including a laboratory simulation method to all WSP approvals from around 1992, and <b>track</b> <b>testing</b> using carefully conditioned paper tape adhered to the railhead. The paper tape method used in the UK is believed to offer a realistic representation of the challenging very low adhesion conditions encountered during the autumn leaf fall. With {{an increase in the}} privatisation of railways in Europe, <b>track</b> <b>testing</b> has become very expensive to organise and to conduct. As a consequence, simulation based testing is rapidly becoming more popular with WSP manufacturers and national bodies.|$|E

40|$|Silicone rubber based {{composites}} {{are widely}} used to produce outdoor insulators. In adverse weather conditions these can be damaged by surface discharge activity resulting in deterioration of their dielectric properties and an eventual need for replacement.

An alternative approach to characterisation is to use an infra-red laser to deposit known amounts of energy at a known rate to the sample’s surface allowing comparative ranking of different materials. In this paper several silicone based composites have been ranked using a laser ablation technique and the results were then compared to those obtained from <b>tracking</b> <b>tests</b> on the same materials. The comparison indicates that laser ablation ranks the materials in the same order as the <b>tracking</b> <b>tests</b> and may therefore constitute a quick and cost effective method for the routine characterisation of outdoor insulation components...|$|R

40|$|The {{movement}} {{characteristics of}} aggregates in asphalt mixtures were investigated with wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>tests</b> under the following loading conditions: reciprocating motion, one-way motion, and one-way motion with braking. The outside wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>tests</b> used fine and gap graded (13 F) asphalt mixtures. The {{tests showed that}} the amount of rutting in one-way motion was larger than that in reciprocating motion. In the case of reciprocating motion, the surface heaved up at the right load end. In the case of one-way motion, the surface heaved up at the point 50 mm from both contact ends of the tire. Consolidation caused the rutting phenomenon during reciprocating motion, and flow caused the rutting phenomenon during one-way motion, based on the movement of aggregates as viewed from the right-angle direction to the loading. Therefore, the rutting phenomenon including the deformation in the transverse direction can be analyzed by wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>tests</b> based on one-way motion, or reciprocating motion, using the conventional wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>test.</b> However, in the case of rutting during one-way motion with braking, the movement of aggregates in the wheel direction caused by tire friction was larger than movement in the depth direction. The inside of the asphalt mixture was dragged by tire friction in the wheel direction. Therefore, at locations where brake operation is frequently needed, the rutting phenomenon caused by flow and abrasion will be greater. 室外で作製した細粒度ギャップアスファルト混合物（ 13 F）に関して，往復走行，一方向走行およびブレーキ走行が可能なホイールトラッキング（WT）試験機を用いて，ホイールトラッキング試験中における内部の骨材の動きの違いを明らかにした。解析結果より，ホイールトラッキング試験による走行荷重直下のわだち掘れは往復走行より一方向走行の方が大きくなり，側方部の隆起は往復走行では荷重端部の右側で生じ，一方向走行では荷重端部から 50 mm程度離れた箇所に生じた。また，荷重直角方向の骨材の動きより，往復走行では圧密によるわだち掘れが主であり，一方向走行では流動によるわだち掘れが主であることが明らかとなった。この結果から，WT試験は往復走行とともに，実際のアスファルト舗装と同様の走行方法である一方向走行も行うことが，横断方向への変形も含めたわだち掘れ現象の解明につながると考えられる。ブレーキ走行を行った結果より，タイヤの摩擦による骨材の動きは鉛直下方向よりも走行方向の方が大きい。これは，タイヤの摩擦によりアスファルト混合物の内部が走行方向へ引きずられるためである。よって，車両のブレーキ操作が頻繁に必要となる場所では，流動によるわだち掘れおよび摩耗によるわだち掘れが生じると考えられる...|$|R
