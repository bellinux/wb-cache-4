40|$|The PHRAP {{assembly}} program provides rapid comparison, alignment, and assembly of large sets of DNA sequences. PHRAP compares sequences by searching for pairs of perfectly matching "words" or sequence regions that meet certain criteria. If a match is found, PHRAP then tries {{to extend the}} alignment into overlapping sections called contigs. PHRAP uses quality values produced by the PHRED basecaller {{to strike a balance}} between <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> and prevention of stacking repeat sequences. The PHRAP assembly algorithm is generally used as part of the PHRED/PHRAP/Consed software suite for sequence analysis. This unit presents instructions for basic usage of the PHRAP assembler, including preparation of the input files (Support Protocols 1 and 2) and explanation of output files (Basic Protocols 1 and 2). Several command line options for changing the PHRAP assembly parameters are also discussed (Basic Protocol 3) ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{patients}} are admitted to, and discharged from hospital {{there is a}} high chance <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> and errors occurring during the transfer of patients' medication information. This often causes drug related problems. Correct and fast communication of patients' medication information between community pharmacy and hospital is necessary. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the number, type, and origin <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> within discharge documents and between discharge documents and information in the pharmacy computer system, concerning the medication of patients living independently when they are discharged from hospital. Second, to test which variables {{have an impact on the}} number <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> found and to study the time spent on the medication reconciliation process. SETTING: One quality-certified community pharmacy in the Netherlands. METHODS: Pharmacists reviewed discharge documents of patients discharged over one year. This information was compared to information available in the pharmacy computer system. Discrepancies were discussed with medical specialists and/or general practitioners. Type and origin <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> were classified. Differences in variables between hospitals were tested using Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney U Test and Pearson Chi Square test. Poisson regression analysis was performed to test the impact of variables on the number <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> found. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number, type and origin <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> for all independently living patients discharged from the hospital. RESULTS: During the study period, 100 discharges took place and were analyzed. No differences were found between the two main hospitals, a university hospital and a teaching hospital. In total, 223 discrepancies were documented. Sixty-nine discharges (69. 0 %) required consultation with a patients' medical specialist. A majority <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancies</b> (73. 1 %) have their origin in hospital information. The number <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> found increased with the number of medicines prescribed at discharge. The community pharmacist spent, on average, 45 min on the medication review after discharge. This included 11 min for counseling the patient. CONCLUSION: Many discrepancies were found between different information sources at patient discharge from hospital. A majority <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancies</b> had their origin in hospital information. The number of medicines after discharge was related to the number <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> found.

Previous {{studies have shown}} that GMPase {{plays an important role in}} <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> plants to salt stress at vegetative stage. However, the function of GMPase in plant responses to salt stress at reproductive stage remains unclear. Studies have shown that heterologous expression of rice GMPase OsVTC 1 - 1 enhanced salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> tobacco seedlings, but the native role of OsVTC 1 - 1 in salt stress <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> rice is unknown. To illustrate the native function of GMPase in response of rice to salt stress, OsVTC 1 - 1 expression was suppressed using RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Suppressing OsVTC 1 - 1 expression obviously decreased salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> rice varieties at vegetative stage. Intriguingly, grain yield of OsVTC 1 - 1 RNAi rice was also significantly reduced under salt stress, indicating that OsVTC 1 - 1 plays an important role in salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> rice at both seedling and reproductive stages. OsVTC 1 - 1 RNAi rice accumulated more ROS under salt stress, and supplying exogenous ascorbic acid restored salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> OsVTC 1 - 1 RNAi lines, suggesting that OsVTC 1 - 1 is involved in salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> rice through the biosynthesis regulation of ascorbic acid.

40|$|Background: Physicians’ <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> {{uncertainty}} (TU) is a trait potentially {{associated with}} desirable outcomes, and emerging evidence suggests it may change over time. Past studies of TU, however, have been cross-sectional {{and have not}} measured <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the different, specific types of uncertainty that physicians confront. We addressed these limitations in a longitudinal exploratory study of medical students. Methods: At the end of medical school (Doctor of Medicine degree) Years 1 and 4, a cohort of 26 students at a US medical school completed measures assessing <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> different types of uncertainty: 1) complexity (uncertainty arising from features of information that {{make it difficult to}} comprehend); 2) risk (uncertainty arising from the indeterminacy of future outcomes); and 3) ambiguity (uncertainty arising from limitations in the reliability, credibility, or adequacy of information). Change in uncertainty-specific TU was assessed using paired t-tests. Results: Between Years 1 and 4, there was a significant decrease in <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity (t= 3. 22, p= 0. 004), but no change in students’ <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> complexity or risk. Conclusions: <b>Tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity – but not other types of uncertainty – decreases during medical school, suggesting that TU is a multidimensional, partially mutable state. Future studies should measure <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> different uncertainties and examine how TU might be improved...|$|R
40|$|This study explores {{patterns}} of language learning strategies {{and the degree}} <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity of Korean Naval Academy midshipmen. The subjects, 377 midshipmen, were divided into three groups according to class, major, and proficiency, {{and the results were}} analyzed by group. The study also sought to find out relationships between motivation, attitude, language learning strategies, and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity. For the study, the Strategy Inventory Language Learning (SILL for ESL/EFL) developed by Oxford (1990 a) and the Second Language <b>Tolerance</b> <b>of</b> Ambiguity Scale by Ely (1995) were used, along with items about motivation and attitude toward language learning. It was found that the language learning strategy mean and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity mean were not high overall. The proficiency levels showed significant mean differences: the high proficiency level students showed a significantly higher mean use of language learning strategies and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity than did the low and mid proficiency level students. With respect to class levels, there were no significant mean differences relating to language learning strategies. The seniors' mean <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity, however, was significantly higher than that of the other class levels. For major, {{there were no significant differences}} in the use of language learning strategies and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity. Correlations between <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity and language learning strategies were significant and positive, although modest.

40|$|Salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> higher {{plants is}} {{determined}} by {{a complex set of}} traits, the timing and rate of evolution of which are largely unknown. We compared the salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> cultivars of sugar beet and their ancestor, sea beet, in hydroponic studies and evaluated whether traditional domestication and more recent breeding have changed salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the cultivars relative to their ancestor. Our comparison <b>of</b> salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> crop cultivars is based on values of the relative growth rate (RGR) of the entire plant at various salinity levels. We found considerable salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the sea beet and slightly, but significantly, reduced salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the sugar beet cultivars. This indicates that traditional domestication by selection for morphological traits such as leaf size, beet shape and size, enhanced productivity, sugar content and palatability slightly affected salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> sugar beet cultivars. Salt tolerance among four sugar beet cultivars, three of which have been claimed to be salt tolerant, did not differ. We analysed the components of RGR to understand the mechanism <b>of</b> salt <b>tolerance</b> at the whole-plant level. The growth rate reduction at higher salinity was linked with reduced leaf area at the whole-plant level (leaf area ratio) and at the individual leaf level (specific leaf area). The leaf weight fraction was not affected by increased salinity. On the other hand, succulence and leaf thickness and the net assimilation per unit of leaf area (unit leaf rate) increased in response to salt treatment, thus partially counteracting reduced capture of light by lower leaf area. This compensatory mechanism may form part <b>of</b> the salt <b>tolerance</b> mechanism <b>of</b> sea beet and the four studied sugar beet cultivars. Together, our results indicate that domestication of the halophytic ancestor sea beet slightly reduced salt tolerance and that breeding for improved salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> sugar beet cultivars has not been effective. ...|$|R

Specific research questions investigated were: Is there a relationship between individualism-collectivism and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> stigma associated with help-seeking among Koreans? Is there a difference in <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> stigma associated with help-seeking after a counseling experience? and Is there a difference in <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> stigma associated with help-seeking between a community sample (n= 192) and a college student sample (n= 151) in Korea? Results suggest that the higher the level of vertical individualism people exhibit, the less tolerant they are of the stigma associated with seeking psychological help. Also results show a significant inverse relationship between vertical-individualism and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> stigma associated with help-seeking in the college student sample, but no significant relationship between individualism-collectivism and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> stigma associated with help-seeking in the community sample.
