5000|$|The fibers in unipennate {{muscles are}} all {{oriented}} {{at the same}} (but non-zero) angle relative to the axis of force generation. [...] This angle reduces the effective force of any individual fiber, as it is effectively pulling off-axis. However, because of this angle, more fibers can be packed into the same muscle volume, increasing the Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). This effect is known as fiber packing, and—in terms of force generation—it more than overcomes the efficiency loss of the off-axis orientation. The trade-off comes in overall speed of muscle shortening and in <b>total</b> <b>excursion.</b> Overall muscle shortening speed is reduced compared to fiber shortening speed, as is the total distance of shortening. [...] All of these effects scale with pennation angle; greater angles lead to greater force due to increased fiber packing and PCSA, but with greater losses in shortening speed and excursion. The vastus lateralis {{is an example of}} unipennate architecture.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether therapeutic communication {{impacts on the}} postural stability of healthy adults. Relevance: Overloading cognitive capacity may contribute to falls, fatigue and reduce patients’ ability to engage in motor learning tasks. The study aimed to investigate whether therapeutic communication has an unacknowledged impact on patients’ postural stability. Participants: 31 Cardiff University staff and student volunteers, aged 18 - 60 years [mean 34 years 9 months] without neurological, musculoskeletal, cognitive or sensory balance impairment. Methods: A within-subject experimental design was used on two age groups. Six collaborating researchers gathered centre of pressure <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> [metres] measurements, from subjects in step-stance for 30 seconds, using a Kistler force platform. Quiet stand [QS, control] and three experimental conditions were tested: General conversation [GC], question and answer [QA] and Stroop test [ST]. Analysis: 2 -tailed paired T-tests [sig p < 0. 05] analysed differences between means of control and experimental conditions. Results: Compared to QS (0. 75 m [SD = 0. 131]), GC and QA produced significant increases in <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> (0. 828 m [SD = 0. 161] p = 0. 000 and 0. 830 m [SD = 0. 179] p = 0. 001 respectively). ST did not alter <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> significantly (0. 759 m [SD = 0. 115] p = 0. 616). Conclusions: GC and QA {{have been shown to}} significantly influence the postural stability of a healthy population where cognitive capacity and motor control are not compromised. Greater variability during QA suggests individual differences are important. Anticipated cognitive challenge [ST] facilitated a securing of postural stability, enabling focus on the expected task. Future research should establish the impact on specific patient populations. Implications: Where cognitive challenge is not anticipated, e. g. during everyday conversation, people do not automatically utilise anticipatory control strategies. Therapists should recognise how therapeutic interactions can shift their patients’ attention away from postural control. Increasing awareness of this in practice and education of patients and carers could enhance safety, optimise benefits of treatment sessions and reduce fatigue...|$|E
40|$|Context. Application of the Nintendo Wii-fit balance {{board and}} its games {{have been used}} in Physical Therapy clinics, showing success in {{individuals}} with neurological disorders, and has been recommended as a minimum baseline assessment of a symptoms checklist and standardized cognitive and balance assessments for concussion management by the NCAA. However, it still faces challenges of being considered a reliable and consistent tool for producing normative data in the allied healthcare. Because there is little to no evidence for the Wii-fit balance board as a valid balance assessment tool for clinical and/or research usage, the significance {{of this study is to}} provide substantial evidence of whether the Nintendo Wii-fit balance board can be used as a valid balance assessment tool. Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of the Wii-fit balance board as an assessment tool for balance by comparing it to the Bertec balance check platform and Kistler force platform. Design. Experimental Study Setting. UNLV research laboratory Patients or Other Participants. Twelve apparently healthy, male (n = 5) and female (n= 7) subjects between the ages of 18 - 30 years (age = 23 ± 3 yrs.) weighing no more than 1468 N (mass = 69. 9 ± 22. 6 kg, height = 167. 6 ± 3 cm). Main Outcomes or Measure(s). Subjects completed five trials of the Nintendo Wii-fit game called the 2 ̆ 2 Stillness Body Test 2 ̆ 2 on each of the following instruments: Bertec balance check platform, Kistler force platform, and Nintendo Wii-fit balance board (WBB). Results from the tests were used to compare center of pressure (CoP) maximum excursion range relationships among the three instruments. Results. The results indicated that there was a significant CoP maximum excursion range positive relationship between the Bertec balance check platform and WBB in both the anterior-posterior (A/P) and medial-lateral (M/L) direction, suggesting measurement validity(r A/P = 0. 710, p A/P = 0. 010, r M/L = 0. 759, p M/L = 0. 004). However, there was only a significant positive relationship between the Kistler force platform and WBB in the medial-lateral direction (M/L) but not in the anterior-posterior (A/P) direction, suggesting comparative validity only in the medial-lateral direction (M/L) (r A/P = 0. 465, p A/P = 0. 128, r M/L = 0. 579, p M/L = 0. 049). Additional results indicated that the A/P CoP <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> and <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> velocity averages between the Kistler and Bertec were found to be significantly different (t A/P = - 2. 841, p excursion = 0. 016 t A/P = - 2. 964, p velocity = 0. 013). However, the M/L CoP <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> and <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> velocity averages between the Kistler force platform and Bertec were not significantly different (t M/L = - 1. 754, p excursion = 0. 107 t M/L = - 1. 349, p velocity = 0. 204) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Tasks {{chosen to}} {{evaluate}} motor performance should reflect the movement deficits {{characteristic of the}} target population and present an appropriate challenge for the patients who would be evaluated. A reaching task that evaluates impairment characteristics of people with shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) was developed to evaluate the motor performance of this population. The objectives {{of this study were}} to characterize the reproducibility of this reaching task in people with and without SIS and to evaluate the impact of the number of trials on reproducibility. Methods Thirty subjects with SIS and twenty healthy subjects participated in the first measurement session to evaluate intrasession reliability. Ten healthy subjects were retested within 2 to 7 days to assess intersession reliability. At each measurement session, upper extremity kinematic patterns were evaluated during a reaching task. Ten trials were recorded. Thereafter, the upper extremity position at the end of reaching and <b>total</b> joint <b>excursion</b> that occurred during reaching were calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC) were used to estimate intra and intersession reliability. Results Intrasession reliability for <b>total</b> joint <b>excursion</b> was good to very good when based on the first two trials (0. 77 0. 92). As for end-reach position, intrasession reliability was very good when using either the first two, first five or last five trials (ICC> 0. 82). Globally, MDC were smaller for the last five trials. Intersession reliability of <b>total</b> joint <b>excursion</b> and position at the end of reaching was good to very good when using the mean of the first two or five trials (0. 69 0. 82). For most joints, MDC were smaller when using all ten trials. Conclusions The reaching task proposed to evaluate the upper limb motor performance was found reliable in people with and without SIS. Furthermore, the minimal difference necessary to infer a meaningful change in motor performance was determined, indicating that relatively small changes in task performance can be interpreted as a change in motor performance. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives : To assess {{reliability}} of traditional and fractal dimension measures of quiet stance {{center of pressure}} (COP). Design : Cross-sectional study. Setting : University laboratory. Participants : Thirty young healthy men (n= 20) and women (n= 10) (mean age, 23 y). Interventions : Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures : COP was recorded for 3 trials across 4 conditions: eyes open and eyes closed standing on firm and foam surfaces. Traditional COP variables—peak sway velocity and range of sway, both in the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions, and <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> area, and fractal dimension of the COP in the AP and ML directions—were calculated. Reliability statistics were calculated. Results : Range of sway (AP) was the most reliable traditional variable (intraclass correlation coefficient model 2, 1 [ICC 2, 1] range −. 28 to. 72.). Peak sway velocity (AP) had poorest reliability (ICC 2, 1 range,. 05 –. 29). Only 1 of the traditional variables had excellent reliability; <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> area (firm, eyes closed) (ICC 2, 1 =. 95). All bar 1 fractal dimension measures had excellent ICCs. Relative technical error of measurement ranged from 4 % to 7 % for the fractal dimension measures. Coefficients of variation were also very good, ranging from 1. 8 % to 6. 7 %. Conclusions : Fractal dimension measures were more reliable than traditional measures of COP. Although traditional measures are used extensively to assess COP, their reliability is questionable. Fractal dimension measures show promise to reliably quantify COP and warrant further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Because of {{the complex}} nature of {{postural}} control and impairment of the numerous systems involved in it after stroke, various clinical and laboratory methods have been addressed for postural control assessment. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the correlation between functional balance tests and postural sway parameters of center of pressure (COP). Materials and Methods: In this correlational study, seventeen chronic stroke patients by mean age of 53. 18 (9. 88) years and the mean time after injury of 66. 18 (77. 03) months were selected by simple non-probability sampling method. Functional Reach (FR) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests were used for clinical assessment of functional balance and force platform was used to measure the average COP velocity, <b>total</b> path <b>excursion,</b> maximum COP displacement in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions in bending and picking up the object on the floor task for each of 6 target locations (in two near and far distances and 3 right, middle and left directions).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{estimate}} the prevalence of potential right to left interatrial shunting and to quantify the morphologic characteristics of the fossa ovalis in adults without a prior history of stroke or systemic embolism. Background. Paradoxic embolization through a patent foramen ovale is an important cardiac mechanism for embolic stroke. Although anatomic and physiologic data obtained by transesophageal echocardiography increase the frequency of demonstration of potential cardiac sources of systemic embolism and occasionally can conclusively demonstrate the mechanism for embolic stroke, the prevalence and prognostic implications of these findings in neurotogically healthy persons are still being actively investigated. Methods. Intraoperative transesophageal saline contrast echocardiography was performed on 50 adult patients without prior history of stroke or systemic embolism who were undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery. Results. No patient had a manifest atrial septal defect by right heart oximetric measurements or transesophageal Doppler echocardiographic examination. Eleven of the 50 patients demonstrated right to left atrial passage of saline contrast medium during apnea or alter release of 20 -cm H 2 O positive airway pressure, signifying patency of the foramen ovale. These 11 patients with a patent foramen ovate had increased <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> of the flap valve (septum primum) of the fossa ovalis (1. 3 ± 0. 7 cm) compared with findings in the 39 patients without a patent foramen ovate (0. 3 ± 0. 5 cm, p < 0. 601). All patients with a patent foramen ovate exhibited some mobility of the septum primum and 73 % of these patients had 1 ̆ cm <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> of the septum primum. In contrast, 56 % of patients without a patent foramen ovale exhibited no motion of the septum primum out of the plane of the atrial septum. The maximal diameter of the fossa ovalis was greater in patients with (1. 4 ± 0. 4 cm) than in patients without (1. 0 ± 0. 3 cm, p < 0. 003) a patent foramen ovale. Conclusions.

At the higher modulation frequencies (20 and 40 Hz) thresholds expressed as <b>total</b> frequency <b>excursions</b> were similar for SFM and QFM suggesting a common mechanism, one perhaps based on single-channel FM-to-AM conversion or on a multi-channel place mechanism. The fact that the nominal envelopes of SFM and QFM are different (SFM has a flat envelope), seems to preclude processing based on the envelope of the external stimulus.

DESIGN [...] Prospective examination of the left ventricular transverse and longitudinal axes, transmitral and transtricuspid flows, and jugular venous pulse recordings. SETTING [...] Tertiary referral centre for cardiac disease. SUBJECTS [...] 23 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy of various aetiologies and a dominant "a" wave in the jugular venous pulse. Controls were 21 normal volunteers. RESULTS [...] Early diastolic filling of the right ventricle was normal. During right atrial systole the (mean(SD)) tricuspid ring motion was exaggerated (1. 2 (0. 4) v 0. 8 (0. 2) cm, p < 0. 001) and Doppler A wave velocity slightly increased (0. 3 (0. 1) v 0. 2 (0. 08) m/s, p < 0. 01), although the E wave remained dominant. By contrast left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time was longer than normal (70 (20) v 55 (10) ms, p < 0. 001) with wall motion incoordinate in the septal long axis, 15 %(9. 5 %) v 6. 6 %(3 %) <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> occurring before mitral valve opening. During early filling the extent of long axis motion was decreased to 0. 6 (0. 5) cm from 1. 1 (0. 2) cm, (p < 0. 001) and 0. 5 (0. 2) cm from 0. 9 (0. 2) cm, (p < 0. 0001) at the left and septal sites, and similarly its peak lengthening rate reduced to 5. 4 (2. 5) cm/s from 10 (3) cm, (p < 0. 001) and 4. 3 (2. 2) cm/s from 8 (2) cm, (p < 0. 001). The atrial component of long axis lengthening was increased to 43 %(18 %) from 29 %(6 %) (p < 0. 01) and 55 %(15 %) from 33 %(8 %) of the <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Non-contact {{anterior}} cruciate ligament injuries (ACL) persist in athletic populations despite years of research to mitigate such injuries. Core stability is purported to be essential in injury prevention, including ACL injury, by healthcare and fitness professionals; however, there is little research investigating this relationship. Examining the relationship between neuromuscular characteristics of core stability and knee kinematics identified to predict or be related to ACL injury may provide insight. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if trunk muscular strength, proprioception, and kinematics as well as sex could predict knee kinematics during a stop jump-cut maneuver (SJCM). Fifty three healthy, physically active college-aged subjects participated (age: 22. 0 ± 2. 1 yrs; height: 172. 5 ± 8. 4 cm; weight: 71. 6 ± 10. 4 kg). Testing order for all subjects was: forward/lateral flexion trunk active joint position sense (AJPS), kinematic assessment during a SJCM, and isokinetic trunk extension/rotation strength. Dependent variables were knee valgus and flexion angles at initial contact (IC), <b>total</b> knee valgus <b>excursion,</b> and maximum knee flexion angle. Independent variables were: trunk extension and rotation average peak torque; trunk flexion and lateral flexion AJPS; trunk lateral displacement and trunk flexion angle at initial contact and maximum; and sex. Backwards stepwise linear regression was performed for each of the dependent variables with their respective, selected independent variables. None of the independent variables were significant predictors for knee valgus angle at IC or maximum knee flexion angle. Trunk rotation strength towards the direction of the cut and sex were found to be significant predictors of <b>total</b> knee valgus <b>excursion</b> (R 2 = 0. 259, p= 0. 001), with lower trunk rotation strength and female sex predicting greater <b>total</b> knee valgus <b>excursion.</b> Trunk extension strength and sex were found to be significant predictors of knee flexion at IC (R 2 = 0. 282, p< 0. 001), with lower trunk extension strength and female sex predicting lower knee flexion at IC.

Though abnormally slow (less than 3 cm/s) or prolonged (greater than 240 ms) diastolic movement was confirmed to be common in mitral stenosis, since it occurred in 35 of 36 patients it was non-specific. Similar abnormalities frequently occurred in other patients with, for example, mitral regurgitation, aortic valve disease, after aortic valve replacement, and in both hypertrophic and congestive cardiomyopathy. The severity of mitral stenosis, assessed at operation, could not be accurately predicted from abnormalities of aortic root movement. Information derived from aortic movement was not diagnostic and did not predict severity in isolated mitral regurgitation though both the peak rate of systolic aortic motion and <b>total</b> aortic <b>excursion</b> were significantly greater than normal.

Methods:. The passive distraction distance and active contraction distance of 36 tendons of 22 patients who underwent forearm tendon transfer or tendon graft during wide-awake surgery were measured. Results:. The passive distraction distance was significantly related to the active contraction distance of the ruptured musculotendinous unit (r = 0. 60, P < 0. 05).

Acquired maps confirm that electro-eroded surfaces are an envelope of craters randomly distributed with <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> up to 1. 7 μm with a crater size of 15 μm. While, the efficient melt expulsion and immediate cooling of water jet guided laser generates a peak to valley distance of 800 nm with a periodicity of 18 μm. Average Rq derived from the measured cylindrical surfaces was 450 nm and 150 nm for EDM and Laser Micro-Jet, respectively. Water jet guided laser drilling {{has proved to be a}} reliable alternative to EDM from the point of view of repeatability of the results and surface quality to facilitate the atomization of the fuel jet...|$|E
40|$|Musculoskeletal pain is {{associated}} with multiple adaptions in movement control. This study aimed to determine whether changes in movement control acquired during acute pain are maintained over days of pain exposure. On day 0, the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle of healthy participants was injected with nerve growth factor (NGF) to induce persistent movement-evoked pain (n =  13) or isotonic saline as a control (n =  13). On day 2, short-lasting pain was induced by injection of hypertonic saline into extensor carpi radialis brevis muscles of all participants. Three-dimensional force components were recorded during submaximal isometric wrist extensions on day 0, day 4, and before, during, and after saline-induced pain on day 2. Standard deviation (variation of task-related force) and <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> of center of pressure (variation of force direction) were assessed. Maximal movement-evoked pain was 3. 3  ± . 4 (0 – 10 numeric scale) in the NGF-group on day 2 whereas maximum saline-induced pain was 6. 8  ± . 3  cm (10 -cm visual analog scale). The difference in centroid position of force direction relative to day 0 was greater in the NGF group than {{in the control group}} (P...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—While volume derived global {{indices of}} right {{ventricle}} (RV) function are frequently abnormal after the Mustard procedure, the mechanism for these abnormalities is poorly understood. RV muscle fibres are predominantly arranged longitudinally and thus indices derived {{in the long}} axis may better describe RV function.  METHODS— 20 survivors of the Mustard operation were studied (age 7. 8 - 37. 3 years, median 14. 2  years). Long axis recordings from the apical four chamber view were obtained with the M mode cursor positioned through the lateral angle of the tricuspid valve annulus. M mode traces were recorded on paper and later digitised to derive <b>total</b> atrioventricular ring <b>excursion,</b> peak lengthening rate, and peak shortening rate. These data were averaged and compared with control data for the normal RV and left ventricle (LV).  RESULTS—RV <b>total</b> atrioventricular ring <b>excursion</b> was lower than that for the RV (p <  0. 0001) or LV (p <  0. 005) of controls. Peak lengthening rate was lower than the normal RV (p <  0. 0001) and LV (p <  0. 0001) rates. Furthermore, peak shortening rate was {{less than that of}} normal RV (p <  0. 0001) and normal LV (p <  0. 005) controls.  CONCLUSION—Systemic RV long axis function is notably reduced compared with that of either the normal subpulmonary RV or the systemic LV. This presumably reflects the response of the predominantly longitudinally arranged myocardial fibres to increased afterload. However, such measurements may provide a more sensitive marker for progressive changes in global function during long term follow up.    Keywords: Mustard procedure; right ventricular function; transposition of the great arterie...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{field theory}} is a {{powerful}} organizing principle that allows to describe physics below a certain scale model-independently. Above that energy scale, identified with the cutoff, the EFT description breaks down and new physics is expected to appear, as confirmed in many familiar examples in quantum field theory. In this work, we examine the validity of effective field theory methods applied to inflation. We {{address the issue of}} whether Planck-suppressed non-renormalizable interactions are suppressed enough to be safely neglected when computing inflationary predictions. We focus on non-derivative non-renormalizable operators and estimate the cutoff that should suppress them using two independent approaches: (i) the usual unitarity and perturbativity argument, (ii) by computing the UV-divergent part of the inflaton entropy, known to scale as the square of the UV-cutoff. We find that in the absence of gravity (decoupling limit) the cutoff appears to depends linearly on the <b>total</b> inflaton <b>excursion.</b> On the other hand, once gravity is restored, the cutoff is brought back to the Planck scale. These results suggest that inflationary scenarios with super-Planckian excursion are not natural from the EFT viewpoint. Comment: LaTeX. 30 pages. 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a coastal}} video time series dataset {{collected}} {{on a high}} energy, reflective gravel beach, simple empirical parameterisations for extreme runup, using the 2 % exceedence value, were developed for use on beaches and structures with similar characteristics. Runup, the elevation of discrete water level maxima, {{is a result of}} two distinct processes; <b>total</b> swash <b>excursion</b> and setup. Gravel beaches have distinctly different characteristics to their sandy counterparts. The impacts of these characteristics were evident when observations from a large scale field experiment were tested against popular parameterisations from the literature. Both extreme runup and its swash components were parameterised separately using relationships between offshore wave height and offshore wavelength. The inclusion of the slope of the beach face was not of significant benefit to the parameterisation of the 2 % exceedence value. However, its inclusion was of benefit to the modeling of infragravity swash, which was contrary to some of the literature. The recommended parameterisation for 2 % exceedence of runup showed a minor bias of 0. 12 cm and an rms error of 38 cm against observations; the mean 2 % exceedence was 1. 74 m. The parameterisation of swash showed a bias of - 3. 985 E- 05 and an rms error of 0. 75 m; the mean observed swash was 2. 57 m...|$|R
40|$|Certain natural {{phenomena}} {{have been identified}} as having fractal properties in their patterns. That is, their seemingly random patterns contain a level of order and deterministic properties that are more complex than previously thought. Centre of Pressure (COP) traces are one of these phenomena. By using a fractal dimension analysis of COP, it is possible that we can gain more information about control during quiet stance than traditional analyses have previously allowed. This Thesis considered a group of young healthy participants and a group of elderly healthy participants to compare traditional measures of COP (range and velocity of sway, and <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> area) against a fractal dimension analysis of COP. Results indicated that both types of analyses are able to distinguish between eyes open and eyes closed in the elderly group. However, the fractal dimension analysis more accurately detects differences between the participant groups when standing with their eyes closed. Based on these results it is suggested that a fractal dimension analysis is more informative about posture control than traditional measures. Recommendations for future research include the development of model that incorporates non-linear properties of control and for further work investigating gait and balance from a dynamical systems perspective.

40|$|Balance in {{rowing boats}} {{is crucial for}} {{experienced}} and non-experienced rowers, allowing them to keep their blades off the water and keep the boat from rolling that requires rowers to contract muscles to even out the boat and to stabilize their bodies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to create reference stabilometric values in fixed seat rowing and compare them between male and female rowers in different sensorial conditions with eyes open and closed. Fifteen subjects voluntarily participated in this study, six male rowers and nine female rowers from University of Alicante fixed seat rowing team, all belonging to the senior category. A FreeMed baropodometric platform (Rome, Italy) was used for the stabilometric measurements: (TE) <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> of the CoP, (CEA) area of the 95 % confidence ellipse, (MV) mean velocity, (MDx) mediolateral direction, (MDy) anteroposterior direction, (RMSx) amplitude in mediolateral direction and (RMSy) amplitude in anteroposterior direction. Results indicate that male rowers had greater ability to maintain balance than female rowers in bipodal stance with eyes open and closed. Female rowers demonstrated more ability to preserve sitting position than male rowers with eyes open and closed. However, there was no clear trend in relation to a greater balance between male and female in monopodal stance...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{the inner}} surface {{characteristics}} of micro-drilled holes of fuel injector nozzles {{were analyzed by}} Shear Force Microscopy (SHFM). The surface texture was characterized by maximum peak-to-valley distance and periodicity whose dimensions {{were related to the}} adopted energy. 180 μm diameter holes were drilled using ultrashort pulsed laser process using pulse energies within the range of 10 - 50 μJ. Laser ablated surfaces in the tested energy range offer a smooth texture with a peculiar periodic structure with a variation in height between 60 and 90 nm and almost constant periodicity. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) photograph of the Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structure (LIPSS) showed the co-existence of Low Spatial Frequency LIPSS (LSFL) and High Spatial Frequency LIPSS (HSFL). A comparative analysis was carried out between the highest laser pulse energy in the tested range energy laser drilling which enables the shortest machining time and micro-Electrical Discharge Machining (μ-EDM). On the contrary, results showed that surfaces obtained by electro-erosion are characterized by a random distribution of craters with a <b>total</b> <b>excursion</b> up to 1. 5 μm with a periodicity of 10 μm. The mean-squared surface roughness (Rq) derived from the scanned maps ranges between 220 and 560 nm for μ-EDM, and between 50 and 100 nm for fs-pulses laser drilling...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} {{of a wide}} range of cellular receptors has been detected previously using a novel instrument, the microphysiometer. In this study microphysiometry was used to monitor the basal and cholinergic-stimulated activity of the Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) (the Na+/K+ pump) in the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE 671. Manipulations of Na+/K+ ATPase activity with ouabain or removal of extracellular K+ revealed that this ion pump was responsible for 8. 8 +/- 0. 7 % of the total cellular energy utilization by those cells as monitored by the production of acid metabolites. Activation of the pump after a period of inhibition transiently increased the acidification rate above baseline, corresponding to increases in intracellular [Na+] ([Na+]i) occurring while the pump was off. The amplitude of this transient was a function of the <b>total</b> [Na+]i <b>excursion</b> in the absence of pump activity, which in turn depended on the duration of pump inhibition and the Na+ influx rate. Manipulations of the mode of energy metabolism in these cells by changes of the carbon substrate and use of metabolic inhibitors revealed that, unlike some other cells studied, the Na+/K+ ATPase in TE 671 cells does not depend on any one mode of metabolism for its adenosine triphosphate source. Stimulation of cholinergic receptors in these cells with carbachol activated the Na+/K+ ATPase via an increase in [Na+]i rather than a direct {{activation of}} the ATPase...|$|R
40|$|Echocardiograms showing left {{ventricular}} cavity and mitral valve cusps simultaneously {{were recorded in}} 36 patients, apex cardiograms being obtained in 26 of them. These were digitised and continuous plots made of {{left ventricular}} dimension, its rate of change, and anterior mitral leaflet velocity, and were compared with those in 20 normal subjects. Peak mitral diastolic closure rate was reduced to 120 +/- 80 mm/s, compared with normal (250 +/- 60 mm/s). Peak rate of increase of dimension was normal (13. 4 cm/s), though the pattern of filling was disturbed, with the duration of rapid filling prolonged in 5, and shortened in 15, suggesting restriction. Mitral valve opening, normally synchronous with minimum dimension, was delayed by a mean of 76 ms, and during this period there was an abnormal increase in dimension. Dimension also increased by 50 +/- 25 per cent of the <b>total</b> diastolic <b>excursion</b> before the 'O' point of the apex cardiogram compared with 21 +/- 7 per cent in normals, and the timing of peak rate of increase of dimension was delayed by 50 +/- 20 ms instead of being synchronous with the 'O' point as normal. None of these findings correlated with the reduction in peak mitral diastolic closure rate. Noninvasive methods thus show that relaxation may be abnormal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Delay in mitral valve opening and disturbances in the rate, duration, and co-ordination of wall movement during filling suggest the presence of segmental abnormalities of left ventricular function...|$|R

The study focuses on the assembly complete outpost configuration and includes pressurized rovers {{as part of a}} distributed outpost architecture in both stand-alone and integrated configurations. A range of life support architectures are examined reflecting different levels of closure and distributed functionality. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the sensitivity of results to volatile high-impact mission variables, including the quantity of residual Lander oxygen and hydrogen propellants available for scavenging, the fraction of crew time away from the outpost on <b>excursions,</b> <b>total</b> extravehicular activity hours, and habitat leakage. Surpluses or deficits of water and oxygen are reported for each architecture, along with fixed and 10 -year total equivalent system mass estimates relative to a reference case.
