[...] Director Kim Manners complimented Anderson's performance, stating [...] "you look at season one and look at season three and that girl exploded as an actress in terms of talent and capability." [...] The 2004 film Alien vs. Predator featured an icebreaker named the Piper Maru, the naming of the ship being a nod to this episode.|$|E

Describing him as [...] "clever and strategic", they wrote that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> him that made the public unsympathetic toward him. He was [...] "handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way—he seemed to exude arrogance and indifference.... Like Meursault in the Camus novel L'Etranger, he did not seem to display the appropriate emotions." [...] He is reported to have passed a lie detector test in 2007.|$|E

Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio.

Swift wrote [...] "Our Song" [...] for her freshman year of high school talent show with no intentions of including it on the album. She claimed she [...] "just knew <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it" [...] and chose to include it on Taylor Swift. [...] "I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one." [...] The song is a narrative and describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song. The banjo-riddled song is placed {{at the end of the}} album due to its closing lyrics, a request to [...] "play it again". [...] "Invisible" [...] is ballad describing loneliness and heartache of going unnoticed. Sean Dooley of About.com writes, the [...] "piano-driven song [...] perfectly captures the awkward teenage angst we all endure—or have endured—at one time or another." ...|$|E

500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened. Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film [...] "probably 20 times," [...] which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving. As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years old, saying, [...] "I always loved Disney animation, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward.

500|$|Control of the Mississippi River {{was the key}} {{to victory}} in the Western theater. Believing Grant was a general of [...] "dogged persistence" [...] and [...] "iron will", Major General John C. Frémont {{assigned}} Grant to command troops on the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois at the end of August (passing over generals John Pope and Benjamin Prentiss). Frémont dismissed rumors of Grant's drunkenness years earlier in the regular army, saying <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Grant's manner [...] "that was sufficient to counteract the influence of what they said." [...] Cairo was a bustling Union military and naval base that was to be used to launch a joint campaign down the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers. After the Confederates moved into western Kentucky, with designs on Southern Illinois, Grant, under Frémont's authority, advanced on Paducah, Kentucky, taking it without a fight, and set up a supply station. Having understood the importance to Lincoln in keeping Kentucky in the Union, Grant assured its citizens, [...] "I have come among you not as your enemy, but as your friend." [...] On November 1, Frémont ordered Grant to [...] "make demonstrations" [...] against the Confederates {{on both sides of the}} Mississippi, but prohibited him from attacking the enemy.|$|E
500|$|In {{an episode}} {{guide to the}} Anderson TV series, science-fiction writer John Peel {{questions}} Mac's ethics in [...] "experimenting on" [...] Joe to further {{the development of the}} BIG RAT. On the subject of Joe as a secret agent he remarks, jokingly, [...] "Presumably there are no child labour laws in the future!" [...] La Rivière's attention is drawn to one of Mac's lines {{at the end of the}} pilot, in a scene that he considers [...] "amusing"; the professor's admonition [...] "Don't come crying to me if you get hurt!" [...] represents his preparedness to [...] "abnegate all parental responsibility" [...] towards his adoptive son. Observing the series' subscription to [...] "wider themes in Cold War culture", Cull likens the BIG RAT's powers to brainwashing, but concludes that it is a fundamentally [...] "benign" [...] technology. The more violent style introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons is sometimes evident in Joe 90: in [...] "Hi-jacked", Joe kills an enemy with a grenade, while in [...] "Project 90", Professor McClaine is menaced by a drill poised to pulverise his head.

500|$|In 1999, Kunis {{replaced}} Lacey Chabert in {{the role}} of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: [...] "What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Mila– something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work." [...] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat." ...|$|E

She was charming and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> her so intriguing to watch", stated Rhimes in response to Pomepo's portrayal of her character. Executive producer Betsy Beers stated that the writing staff was {{going to focus on}} the balance between her vulnerability and her courage, also dealing with changes in the relationship with her friends. Pompeo noted that the uncertainty of her character's fate is what helped her evolve into a more adaptable actor. Rhimes also disclosed that an episode with Ellis Grey's unexpected lucidity and eventual death was in plans {{since the beginning of the}} series. Rhimes described how Pompeo got through the challenge of sending Meredith in the afterlife: [...] "It was an exciting place to take her. Exciting to watch her find her way back." [...] In response to Izzie's arc, Shonda Rhimes discussed the impact Denny Duquette's death will have on her, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Katherine Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the third season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift self-penned [...] "Our Song" [...] for {{the talent}} show of her {{freshman}} {{year in high school}} with no intentions of including it on her debut album. She thought to herself that to be appropriate for the talent show, the song she would write needed to be upbeat and relatable to her classmates. [...] "I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one", she said. The writing process, as with her lead single [...] "Tim McGraw", took place in approximately 20 minutes. Several months after performing it at the talent show, some of her peers approached her to inform her that they enjoyed the song she played at the talent show, singing a few lines. [...] "They'd only heard it once, so I thought, 'There must be something here!'", Swift recalled. When choosing tracks to record for Taylor Swift, Swift [...] "stood by" [...] "Our Song", repeatedly insisting album producers to record it with her. She claimed she [...] "knew <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] She concluded, [...] "I think there's just some sort of magic in the way the track sounds like it's bouncing." [...] Swift said she desired for the song to be placed as the closing track on Taylor Swift due to its last lyrics repeating the phrase [...] "Play it again", which she thought would subliminally request audiences to replay the album. Big Machine Records executives chose [...] "Our Song" [...] to be the third single from Taylor Swift, which Swift was surprised yet glad about.|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} {{entertainment}} industry magazine Variety praised The Projected Man, writing that the screenplay [...] "is a mosaic compiled from other films but the pieces hang together fairly well." [...] However, Variety criticised the character's motives, saying that [...] "the origin and motives {{of the third}} party are never fully explained." [...] The magazine wrote that the performances in the film were [...] "generally good," [...] and that [...] "the characters do not fall prey to the usual cliches." [...] Writing for Ottawa Citizen, Gordon Stoneham, reviewing the double bill of The Projected Man and Island of Terror, called The Projected Man [...] "dreadful stuff," [...] saying that the film was [...] "badly written, woodenly acted, and abounding in the cliches of the horror film genre." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "it is short and to the point" [...] and wrote that [...] "although it trods a familiar path, {{every now and then}} it comes up with some arresting bit of cinematic coloring that rivels the attention." [...] Comparing the two films, he stated that The Projected Man was [...] "the best." [...] A TV Guide review wrote that the [...] "characters are better portrayed than usual in films of this nature, keeping the actors from becoming mere stereotypes" [...] and that [...] "subtle artistic direction and first-quality special effects give this picture a strong visual presence." [...] The review graded The Projected Man with two stars out of four. The anonymous reviewer for the British Kinematograph Weekly called the cast [...] "competent" [...] and noted that, while the [...] "plot [...] at least as old as H. G. Wells", <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the film that would challenge the [...] "hard-boiled child of today".|$|E
