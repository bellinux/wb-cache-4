40|$|This paper empirically {{establishes}} {{the effect of}} the employer's <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> on the wage level of employees. The <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> is defined as the period an employer has to notify workers in advance of their up-coming dismissal. The wages paid during this period are an important element of firing costs and hence employment protection. To find a causal effect, I exploit the exogenous change in the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> that resulted from the introduction of a new Dutch law in 1999. Strong evidence is found that a longer ‘dormant’ <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> leads to higher wages. In my sample, an additional month of notice increases wages by three percent, ceteris paribus. employment protection, wages, fixed effects...|$|E

40|$|In {{chapters}} {{four and}} five – ‘On Power’ – Karen analyzes data on household consumption, labor supply and wages. Chapter four proposes a non-cooperative, theoretical model on how couples jointly decide on what to buy {{and how much to}} work. Applying this model to what households in the U. S. Consumer Expenditures Survey spend on children, she finds that in the majority of households the wife is the ‘Dictator’ in that she decides what to buy. Chapter five assesses wage rates of Dutch employees {{in the context of a}} specific type of employment protection: the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice,</b> which is the period that an employer has to take into account before a worker can be fired. Karen finds that if an extra month is added to the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice,</b> this increases wages by three percent. She explains this by the improved bargaining position of better protected employees. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the motivational {{process of the}} Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model {{in a sample of}} recently dismissed (voluntary and involuntary) Flemish employees (N = 213). Specifically, the relations between three work-related resources (perceived employability, social support, and acceptance of feedback given during the exit conversation) and work-related behavior (in-role and extra-role behavior) were examined. We hypothesized (1) that this relationship is mediated by dedication, and (2) there would be a difference between voluntary and involuntary dismissed employees. The results showed that the resources had an indirect effect on in-role and extra-role behavior, (partially) mediated by dedication. There was a positive relationship and a negative relationship between perceived employability and dedication for voluntary and involuntary dismissed employees, respectively. In summary, the JD-R Model serves as a relevant framework for studying employees’ work behavior and motivational process during their <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice.</b> [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Can an {{employee}} that sexually harass another employee be dismissed {{with or without}} <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice?</b> This question is the focus {{in this study of}} how the Swedish Labour court rules in cases regarding dismissals of employees that is accused of having sexually harassed another employee. Dismissals are regulated in the Employment Act and sexual harassments is defined within the Anti-Discrimination Act. An investigation of these acts in combination with an account of several cases from the Labour court makes up the legal framework of the study. The results show that, of all the rulings used, the employee is a man harassing another woman. Also shown is that the Labour Court, once they have determined that sexual harassment have occurred, focuses on the working relationship between the employer and the harassing employee. Crucial for the dismissal is whether the employer has lost his or her confidence for the employee in terms of future suitability for work, not on the fact that another employee have been violated by this other employee. The study is carried out per the legal dogmatic method and I have chosen only to focus on rulings from the Labour Court, and only on rulings where the sexual harassments has taken place within the employment...|$|E

30|$|Since The Charter of Workers Rights (Law 300 / 1970), {{individual}} dismissals {{are allowed}} in large firms {{only if there}} exists a “just cause” (for productive reasons or for severe misconduct of the employee). More precisely, a worker can be fired for “justified objective motive” that is, “for justified reasons concerning the production activity or the organization of labor in the firm”; or for “justified subjective motive” that is, “in case of a significantly inadequate fulfillment of the employee’s tasks specified by the contract”. Moreover, large firms are required {{to give to the}} employee a <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> in order to proceed with an individual dismissal, whose length depends on the tenure of the worker, with detailed indications {{of the reasons for the}} dismissal. The worker can easily appeal to a Court against the dismissal. If the judge rules that the dismissal is “unfair”, the employee in a large firm has the right to receive as severance payments: 1) all the foregone earnings after the dismissal until the sentence (and the corresponding social security contributions); 2) either an extra financial compensation of 15 months earnings or the reinstatement in the firm (the choice is up to the worker). In addition, the firm has to pay the legal costs and a penalty for the delayed payment of social security contributions of up to 200 % of the original sum due.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} {{an environmental}} impact assessment applied to brass threaded unions. Two different scenarios were analyzed based {{on the amount of}} material used in the process: i) 100 % virgin raw material usage and ii) 92. 3 % of recycled material usage. For the analysis and environmental impact evaluation, this study made use of the life cycle assessment methodology (LCA). It also used Ecoindicator 99 for grading impact, as well as the computer tool Simapro® for calculations. When a composition of 100 % virgin raw material was used, significant impacts were identified on mineral extraction and air suspended inorganic material categories. For 92. 3 % of recycled material, major effects were related to air suspended organic material and impact category related to acidification/eutrophication. The comparison of both scenarios made it possible to detect an impact attenuation in mineral extraction and air suspended inorganic material categories. As a consequence of using recycled material in the product, a significant global impact reduction of 231 % in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> Pt was <b>noticed.</b> an impact attenuation in mineral extraction and air suspended inorganic material categories.

40|$|Visual Merchandising {{has been}} around since the dawn of civilization, since humans started selling {{merchandise}} to a customer. When a vendor arranged his goods to be more attractive for a customer, or when a farmer put the biggest and ripest apples on top of the basket for consumers to see and touch, that is visual merchandising. In present generation, people do not shop merely to obtain items they need, but also to satisfy their wants. Frequently, shopping does not even involve making a purchase. For consumers, window-shopping has become a popular pastime. Visual merchandisers create "miniature worlds" for merchandise in an effort {{to attract the attention of}} consumers, draw them into the store and keep them coming back in the future. Despite the advanced techniques seen in visual displays, visual merchandising is not a new concept or art. As early as the 18 th century, merchandise was staged in interesting and unique arrangements to attract consumers’. Visual Merchandising and communication helps improve the conversion of visitors to purchasers and increase transaction values by encouraging multiple sales. The main objective of the study is that to analyse the general shopping behaviour of the respondents in shopping malls and to assess and analyse the effectiveness of the visual merchandising efforts of the sellers in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> ability, opinion and attractiveness to visit the store. For this a sample of 250 was collected from the respondents were percentage analysis, Kruskal Wallis and descriptive statistics were used as statistical tools to analyse the data. The conclusion is that female respondents have higher impact towards time of visiting the mall and time spent for shopping in malls so female respondents can be targeted towards selling the products through visual merchandising...|$|R
