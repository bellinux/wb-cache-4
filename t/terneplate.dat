There were, of course, other popular roofing materials, and some regions rich in slate had fewer examples of wooden shingle roofs.

Slate, <b>terneplate,</b> and clay tile were used on ornate buildings and in cities that limited the use of flammable wooden shingles. Wooden shingles, however, were never abandoned. Even in the 20th century, architectural styles such as the Colonial Revival and Tudor Revival used wooden shingles.|$|E
