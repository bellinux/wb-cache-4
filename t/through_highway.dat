500|$|MD 528 {{continues}} {{north from}} 9th Street as a divided highway with two lanes northbound and three lanes southbound. [...] The state highway gains a third lane northbound at MD 378 (15th Street).

[...] The road heads into the Midtown section of Ocean City, which is home to numerous restaurants and nightlife, at 28th Street. After passing the Jolly Roger Amusement Park at 30th Street, MD 528 meets 33rd Street, which is one-way westbound coming from the northern end of Baltimore Avenue. North of 33rd Street, MD 528 becomes Coastal Highway, the only <b>through</b> <b>highway</b> on the barrier island that is lined with numerous hotels and businesses.

500|$|The DuPont Highway was {{a boon to}} {{southern}} Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction {{with the rise of}} the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis. Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north. However, the passenger and freight traffic induced by this increased economic integration and the automobile boom of the 1920s meant that these roads in Delaware and Maryland constructed in the 1910s and 1920s, which were built with widths of , were no longer adequate for the traffic they served. In particular, by 1929 the SelbyvilleMilford portion of the DuPont Highway was the only <b>through</b> <b>highway</b> in Delaware with a width of less than [...] The highway's importance was further implied when the Pocomoke City to Dover highway became part of the United States Numbered Highway System. The Pocomoke City–Dover route was designated Route No. 113 in the preliminary system proposed in November 1925, and that number and course were confirmed in the system AASHO and the Bureau of Public Roads approved in November 1926. The U.S. Highway's original southern terminus was the intersection of Market Street and Sixth Street in Pocomoke City. US113's northern terminus was the split between the two main northsouth highways of southern Delaware at Coopers Corner north of Puncheon Run on the southern edge of Dover.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{major issue}} {{surrounding}} {{the use of}} stop signs pertains to the public's variegated understanding of their meaning. One prolific source of crashes is the misconception of law that every motorist who attempts to enter a main highway from a side road, does so {{at his or her}} peril. Such motorists usually have very definite rights granted by provisions of state vehicle codes, which provide that after the driver has 'yielded' by stopping at an arterial sign he or she may proceed and the drivers of all other vehicles approaching the intersection on the <b>through</b> <b>highway</b> shall yield the right of way to the vehicle crossing the <b>through</b> <b>highway.</b> Where a car has actually entered an intersection before the other approaches it, the driver of the first car has the right to assume that he or she will be given the right of way and be permitted to pass through the intersection without danger of collision. He or she has a right to assume that the driver of the other car will obey the law, slow down, and yield the right of way, if slowing down be necessary to prevent a collision. In order to be able fulfill the duty of yielding to entering motorists who have established control of the intersection, the through-driver must travel no faster than permitted by the [...] assured clear distance ahead.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the first}} {{completed}} segments {{were based on}} the HAFRABA plans and thus consisted of straightaways [...] long joined by curves that were arcs of circles, as in railroads; the minimum radius of the curves was defined in planning documents ( [...] , less in mountainous terrain, down to [...] ). A debate spearheaded by Seifert, who argued that straight stretches were [...] "unnatural" [...] and moreover would lead to accidents <b>through</b> <b>highway</b> hypnosis, led to increasing dominance of the view that the autobahns should provide, as Emil Maier-Dorn put it in 1938, [...] "not the shortest but, rather, the most sublime connection between two points". By 1939 and possibly earlier, sinuous forms predominated. Although Todt had hired Seifert and his landscapers in order to ensure the [...] "German character" [...] of the autobahn, he initially favored the railroad engineers' views on layout; the decisive factor was cost, namely the {{reduction in the number of}} embankments and bridges needed.|$|E

2500|$|Greater Sudbury is {{the only}} census {{division}} in Northern Ontario that maintains a system of numbered municipal roads, similar to the county road system {{in the southern part}} of the province. There are three highways connecting Sudbury to the rest of Ontario: Highway 17 is the main branch of the Trans-Canada Highway, connecting the city to points east and west. An approximately [...] segment of Highway 17, from Mikkola to Whitefish, is freeway.

60|$|So saying, {{he strode}} away through the leafy forest glades {{until he had}} come to the verge of Sherwood. There he wandered for a long time, <b>through</b> <b>highway</b> and byway, through dingly dell and forest skirts. Now he met a fair buxom lass in a shady lane, and each gave the other a merry word and passed their way; now he saw a fair lady upon an ambling pad, to whom he doffed his cap, and who bowed sedately in return to the fair youth; now he saw a fat monk on a pannier-laden ass; now a gallant knight, with spear and shield and armor that flashed brightly in the sunlight; now a page clad in crimson; and now a stout burgher from good Nottingham Town, pacing along with serious footsteps; all these sights he saw, but {{adventure}} found he none. At last he took a road by the forest skirts, a bypath that dipped toward a broad, pebbly stream spanned by a narrow bridge made of a log of wood. As he drew nigh this bridge he saw a tall stranger coming from the other side. Thereupon Robin quickened his pace, as did the stranger likewise, each thinking to cross first.|$|E
6000|$|They {{traveled}} onward, Robin {{following his}} fancy {{and the others}} following Robin. Now they wended their way through an open dale with cottage and farm lying therein, and now again they entered woodlands once more. Passing by fair Mansfield Town, with its towers and battlements and spires all smiling in the sun, they came at last {{out of the forest}} lands. Onward they journeyed, <b>through</b> <b>highway</b> and byway, through villages where goodwives and merry lasses peeped through the casements at the fine show of young men, until at last they came over beyond Alverton in Derbyshire. By this time high noontide had come, yet they had met no guest such as was worth their while to take back to Sherwood; so, coming at last to a certain spot where a shrine stood at the crossing of two roads, Robin called upon them to stop, for here on either side was shelter of high hedgerows, behind which was good hiding, whence they could watch the roads at their ease, while they ate their midday meal. Quoth merry Robin, [...] "Here, methinks, is good lodging, where peaceful folk, such as we be, can eat in quietness; therefore we will rest here, and see what may, perchance, fall into our luck-pot." [...] So they crossed a stile and came behind a hedgerow where the mellow sunlight was bright and warm, and where the grass was soft, and there sat them down. Then each man drew from the pouch that hung beside him that which he had brought to eat, for a merry walk such as this had been sharpens the appetite till it is as keen as a March wind. So no more words were spoken, but each man saved his teeth for better use--munching at brown crust and cold meat right lustily.|$|E
