Typically, community wind farms, solar photovoltaic arrays, geothermal installations, and biomass-fuelled power facilities are typically sufficiently limited in their generation capacity that they qualify as distributed energy sources.

40|$|AbstractUnder the {{construction}} of smart <b>grid,</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> investment is faced with many potential risks, and high flexibility of decision-making is asked. Based on technology readiness theory, stage financing issues for <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> investment are studied. Then <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> investment is divided into several stages, {{and in order to}} form an optimal investment scheme and find reasonable fund for each stage, a decision-making model for <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> investment based on technology readiness is established. The model is validated through three-stage <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> investment project in IEEE- 24 bus system, to consider the optimal investment decision between transmission lines and TCSC devices...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel co-simulation is developed, {{to study the}} dynamic {{exchange}} of reactive power from a distribution <b>grid</b> to the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid.</b> This exchange is performed under a regulatory scheme. In particular, a distribution grid optimizer signals to the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> the available reactive power interval at the distribution/transmission nodes every 15 minutes. A <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> optimizer uses this information to compute a reactive power set point, to stabilize the voltage in the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid.</b> The distribution grid optimizer receives this set point and translates it into settings for transformers and renewable generators. This strategy is tested on a running grid simulation, with the tools working in parallel. It is shown that the voltage in the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> can be improved, but {{at the cost of}} power losses in the distribution grid and renewable generators...|$|R

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the world will spend an extra $8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources, a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100% renewable energy. Research that has been published in Energy Policy suggests that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable, but requires political support. It would require building many more wind turbines and solar power systems but wouldn't utilize bioenergy. Other changes involve use of electric cars {{and the development of}} enhanced <b>transmission</b> <b>grids</b> and storage.|$|E
2500|$|While {{in theory}} the LMP {{concepts}} are useful and not evidently subject to manipulation, in practice system operators have substantial discretion over LMP results through {{the ability to}} classify units as running in [...] "out-of-merit dispatch", which are thereby excluded from the LMP calculation. In most systems, units that are dispatched to provide reactive power to support <b>transmission</b> <b>grids</b> are declared to be [...] "out-of-merit" [...] (even though these are typically the same units that are located in constrained areas and would otherwise result in scarcity signals). System operators also normally bring units online to hold as [...] "spinning-reserve" [...] to protect against sudden outages or unexpectedly rapid ramps in demand, and declare them [...] "out-of-merit". The result is often a substantial reduction in clearing price {{at a time when}} increasing demand would otherwise result in escalating prices.|$|E

50|$|Swissgrid was {{established}} in January 2005 by Switzerland’s main electricity grid companies {{as part of the}} liberalisation of the electricity market. From 15 December 2006 Swissgrid coordinated Switzerland's <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> (380/220 kV), comprised up to that point of eight control areas. With the changeover on the night of 31 December 2008 to 1 January 2009 from eight control areas to one zone covering the whole of Switzerland, Swissgrid took over the operation of the entire 6,700-kilometre extra high-voltage grid.When the transfer was entered in the commercial register on 3 January 2013, Swissgrid became the new owner of the Swiss <b>transmission</b> <b>grid.</b> Swiss <b>transmission</b> system operator Swissgrid has since been responsible not only for the operation of the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> but also for its maintenance, renewal and expansion. The statutory requirement was thus met for the electricity companies to have completed the transfer of the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> to Swissgrid by 1 January 2013 at the latest.|$|R

40|$|Electricity {{generation}} in Denmark {{is undergoing a}} gradual transition from taking place in a few large power-plants to taking place at many small and geographically scattered CHP (combined heat and power) and wind-power plants. A new situation is thus being created for the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid.</b> From a mainly unidirectional flow from the few large power plants to the scattered consumption points, the flow is changing to a bidirectional flow subject to scattered electricity production. In this article, {{the requirements of the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> are analysed in (a) a year 2020 situation with power balancing (matching production and consumption) as it is now on the few large power plants, and (b) a year 2020 situation with geographically-scattered power balancing using e. g.

Geographic modelling of production and consumption loads combined with grid analyses reveal that the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> needs reinforcements to meet transmission demands unless geographically scattered power balancing is introduced.
