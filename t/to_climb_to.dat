5|$|On 16 December 2016, EVA Air Flight BR 15 (Boeing 777-300ER B-16726, Delivered January 2016) from Los Angeles International Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport {{narrowly}} missed hitting Mount Wilson and Air Canada Flight 788. The LAX {{control tower}} mistakenly tells the pilot to turn left instead of right to {{head over the}} ocean. BR 15 instead headed north and was maintaining 5000 feet as it headed towards 5700 foot peak Mt. Wilson. EVA was forced <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> 6000 feet. Air Canada Flight 788, also from LAX was taking the same route BR 15 was. Air Canada Flight 788 was forced <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> over 10000 feet to avoid hitting BR 15. It took almost two minutes for the pilot to make a 180 degree turn to go southbound. An investigation is being held and EVA Air also did not comment.|$|E

5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> the bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal is a disused canal in Greater Manchester, England, {{built to}} link Bolton and Bury with Manchester. The canal, when fully opened, was 15miles 1furlong (24.3km) long. It was {{accessed}} via a junction with the River Irwell in Salford. Seventeen locks were required <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> the summit {{as it passed}} through Pendleton, heading northwest to Prestolee before it split northwest to Bolton and northeast to Bury. Between Bolton and Bury the canal was level and required no locks. Six aqueducts were built to allow the canal to cross the rivers Irwell and Tonge and several minor roads.|$|E

5|$|An injury {{sustained}} on 25 August 1990 kept Gibbs out for two months, {{and once}} he had regained full fitness, his team were bottom of the table. His return coincided with a winless run of seven league matches, leaving Watford seven points from safety with nearly half the season gone. Nonetheless, Watford managed <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> 20th place, and despite missing 14 games, Gibbs was once again shortlisted for the club's end of season award. In 1991–92 Gibbs finally became Player of the Season. Missing only three matches, he rounded off a good season by scoring his first goal in four years in Watford's last league game, cementing a top-ten finish in the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers are {{affected}} by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus {{has been used to}} control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> the top of a plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> altitude.|$|E

5|$|Kotzer {{estimated}} that a frontal assault against the Egyptians would be useless, {{as they were}} dug in {{on both sides of}} the pillbox. In complete darkness, the 1st Company made its way south through the wadi hoping to avoid enemy fire from superior positions and weapons until they were close enough to respond. At 03:00, the Israeli artillery barrage started, but did not do significant damage and only alerted all Egyptian positions to the Israeli presence. The only Israeli unit close to engagement at the time was Kotzer's company. About 100 m away from the Egyptian defense line, they stepped into an ambush and the leading squad was eliminated. Kotzer ordered the machine gunners <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> the east bank of the wadi to provide cover for a counterattack, and this move also led to Israeli casualties. The counterattack was difficult and only destroyed some small Egyptian entrenchments.|$|E
5|$|The sky-cycle airship {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> {{about two}} thousand feet and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark {{and went to}} East Sixtieth Street. The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers. Gupther helped the reporter deflate the balloon and pack the airship down {{to the size of}} a flat carpet bag. He then drove the reporter with his sky-cycle airship to the railroad station so he could get back to his place of origin.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E

KCMG had an anxious moment when Lapierre missed the Indianapolis corner, but recovered with marshal assistance without losing the LMP2 class lead. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari slowed on course {{and came to the}} garage with gearbox issues, handing the LMGTE Pro lead back to Corvette and allowing the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> second place after recovering from its earlier issues. Vanthoor drove his car into his pitbox with gearbox problems but his team were unable to repair it before the race's conclusion and retired. Jann Mardenborough's Nissan came to a halt at the Porsche Curves after smoke bellowed out of {{the front of the car}} as the gearbox failed, leaving Nissan with a single car left circulating. Light rain {{began to fall}} on portions of the circuit in the final hour, but it was not heavy enough to affect the race. Dalla Lana, having led the previous 125 laps in LMGTE Am and within forty five minutes of the race finish, went straight on at the Ford Chicane and crashed heavily into an outside tyre barrier, ending the car's run and promoting the SMP Ferrari to the class lead which it held to the finish. Dalla Lana was unhurt.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman railway from Istanbul {{travelled}} {{south to}} Deraa where it branched into two lines. One line continued {{east of the}} Jordan River in a southerly direction to supply the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters and the garrisons and forces scattered along the southern Hedjaz railway several hundred miles to the south. The second railway line turned westward to supply the Ottoman Seventh and the Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills. This second line crossed the Jordan at Jisr Mejamie, ran southwards down {{the west bank of}} the Jordan River to Beisan, then turned westward to run parallel to the front line in the Judean Hills, across the Esdraelon Plain to Afulah. From Afulah the railway forked again into two lines: a branch line running north–westerly to Haifa, while the main line turned south to Jenin. From Jenin the railway wound through a narrow pass in the foothills <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> Messudieh Junction in the Judean Hills where it again branched into two lines. One line ran westward to Tulkarm and the Eighth Army headquarters before turning south to reach railhead behind the Eighth Army' front line on the coastal plain, while the second line continued south–eastward to Nablus. Here, the headquarters of the Seventh Army was located, north of Jerusalem on the main road to Nazareth and Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The Seventh and Eighth Armies Ottoman {{defenders}} were {{supplied by}} two railways which crisscrossed the battlefield. A railway ran from Haifa on the Mediterranean coast {{to join the}} main railway from Istanbul to Deraa, which crossed the Jordan River before passing Beisan to enter the Judean Hills at Jenin. There were also good roads from Haifa and Damascus, via Nazareth and Jenin. From Deraa the extensive railway network, branched into two lines. The southern line known as the Hejaz railway continued east of the Jordan River to supply the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters at Amman, the garrisons at Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt and the forces scattered along several hundred miles of the southern Hejaz railway. The western line known as the Palestine Railways crossed the Jordan River at Jisr Mejamie to become the Jezreel Valley railway, as it ran southwards down {{the west bank of}} the Jordan River to Beisan, on the western edge of the Esdraelon Plain. From there it turned westward to run parallel to the front line in the Judean Hills, to Afulah. Here the railway branched again into two lines, one line running north–westerly to Haifa on the Mediterranean coast, while the main line turned south across the Esdraelon Plan to Jenin. From Jenin the railway wound through a narrow pass in the foothills <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> Messudieh Junction in the Judean Hills where it again branched. One line continued south–eastward to Nablus the Seventh Army headquarters, located on the main road to Jenin, Nazareth and Damascus, while the second line ran westward to Tulkarm and the Eighth Army headquarters before turning south to reach railhead behind the Eighth Army' front line on the coastal plain.|$|E
