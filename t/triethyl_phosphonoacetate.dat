50|$|<b>Triethyl</b> <b>phosphonoacetate</b> is a reagent {{for organic}} {{synthesis}} {{used in the}} Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction (HWE) or the Horner-Emmons modification.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triethyl</b> <b>phosphonoacetate</b> can {{be added}} {{dropwise}} to sodium methoxide solution to prepare a phosphonate ylide. It has an acidic proton that can easily be abstracted by a weak base. When used in an HWE reaction with a carbonyl the resulting alkene formed is usually the E alkene, and is generated with excellent regioselectivity.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{material}} for this preparation is ketoester 1, available {{by one of the}} classical benzomorphan syntheses. Condensation with the ylide from <b>Triethyl</b> <b>phosphonoacetate</b> (HWE reaction) affords diester 2. Catalytic hydrogenation proceeds from the less hindered face to afford the corresponding saturated diester (3). The esters are then reduced by means of LiAlH4 to give the glycol (4); this undergoes internal ether formation on treatment with acid to form the pyran ring of 5. Von Braun reaction with BrCN (or ethyl chloroformate) followed by saponification of the intermediate leads to the 2° amine (6). This is converted to the cyclopropylmethyl derivative 8 by acylation with cyclopropylcarbonyl chloride followed by reduction of the thus formed amide (7) with LiAlH4. Cleave of the O-methyl ether with sodium Ethanethiol affords proxorphan (9).|$|E

CdUPAA- 1 adopts a cubic three-dimensional structure constructed from planar uranyl oxide clusters containing both UO 7 pentagonal bipyramids and UO 8 hexagonal bipyramids that are linked by Cd(II) cations and phosphonoacetate to yield large cavities approximately 16 angstrom across that are filled with disordered water molecules. CdUPAA- 2 forms a rhombohedral three-dimensional channel structure that is assembled from UO 7 pentagonal bipyramids that are bridged by phosphonoacetate. CdUPAA- 3 is layered with the hydrated Cd(II) cations incorporated directly into the layers linking one-dimensional uranyl phosphonate substructures together. In this structure, there are complex networks of hydrogen bonds that exist within the sheets, and also stitch the sheets together. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 An {{approach}} to the generation of polyketides was investigated, which involved ozonolysis of 6, 7 cyclopenteno - 1 > 4, 5, 8 -tetrahydromethoxy- 3 -methylnaphthalene (26), to produce what {{is believed to be}} polyketide 27. Compound 26 was formed by the following sequence: Die ls -Alder addition of 1, 2 -dim. ethylenecyclopentane and 2 -methoxy- 3 -methylbenzoquinone (29) afforded adduct 30 which was reduced with lithium aluminum hydride to diol 31, followed by dehydration with phosphorus oxychloride to 32 and subsequent lithium-ammonium reduction to produce 26. The synthesis of vermiculine (63) was studied. Hagemann's ester was converted to alcohol 113 by the action of isopropenyl acetate and p-toluenesulfonic acid followed by reduction of the resulting mixture with sodium borohydride in aqueous dioxane. Reduction of 113 with lithium aluminum hydride produced diol 115 which was oxidized with manganese dioxide to aldehyde 117. Reaction of 117 with the anion of <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphonoacetate</b> followed by acetylation of the resulting product (98) gave diester 99. Epoxidation of 99 with m-chloroperbenzoic acid yielded 105, which was hydrolyzed to diol 106 by the action of aqueous perchloric acid. The diol was cleaved with lead tetraacetate in pyridine and ethyl acetate to produce the protected vermiculinic acid 107. Ketalization of 107 with ethylene glycol followed by saponification of the esters yielded hydroxy acid 110. Attempts to cyclize 110 were unsuccessful. A route to the noncyclic dimer was developed starting from 98. Bromoacetylation of 98 followed by an Arbusov reaction with trim. ethylphosphite gave phosphonate 127, which was condensed with aldehyde 117 to afford dimer 128. Epoxidation of 128 with m-chloroperbenzoic acid followed by hydrolysis of the bisepoxide (129) with aqueous perchloric acid produced pentol 130. Lead tetraacetate cleavage of 130 gave the protected vermiculinic acid dimer (131) ...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{resistance}} to antibiotics is an emerging epidemic throughout the world {{and there is a}} desperate need for new antibiotics and new strategies to maintain the effectiveness of current agents. β-Lactams, such as the penicillins and cephalosporins, have been the most important class of antibiotic for several decades and represent half of the global antibacterial market, but the continued use of β-lactams is threatened by β-lactamases, enzymes that efficiently inactivate β-lactams through hydrolysis. Class A, C, and D β-lactamases use an active-site serine residue for hydrolysis and achieve turnover through an acylenzyme intermediate while the class B metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) use a zinc-bound hydroxide as the active-site nucleophile. Two successful approaches to combat β-lactamase-mediated resistance have involved the development of β-lactam antibiotics which bind poorly to β-lactamases and the combination of β-lactams with β-lactamase inhibitors. These strategies have been effective for overcoming resistance due to class A β-lactamases, but the ever-increasing prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), metallo-β-lactamases, and carbapenemases compromises the effectiveness of current penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and mechanism-based β-lactamase inhibitors. Cyclobutanone analogues of β-lactam antibiotics were explored in the early 1980 s as potential inhibitors of β-lactamases and D-Ala-D-Ala transpeptidases, but simple analogues showed only weak inhibitory activity and this approach was subsequently abandoned. The increasing threat of multidrug-resistant β-lactamase-producing organisms in recent years, however, has inspired a re-evaluation of these inhibitors since cyclobutanones have the potential to exhibit broad-spectrum inhibition of both serine- and metallo-β-lactamases through the formation of enzyme-bound hemiketals or hydrates. 7, 7 -Dichloro- 2 -thia-bicyclo[3. 2. 0]heptan- 6 -one- 4 -carboxylic acid (65), a dichlorocyclobutanone that had shown modest inhibition of the class B and D β-lactamases IMP- 1 and OXA- 10 in earlier work in this laboratory, was prepared in an efficient seven-step sequence from <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphonoacetate</b> (103) with an overall yield of 28 %. Initial efforts to improve upon the potency of the cyclobutanones involved functionalization at C 3 and a highly stereoselective chlorination with sulfuryl chloride provided the 3 α-chloro derivative 117 α in nearly quantitative yield. Elimination of HCl from 117 α was achieved under a variety of conditions and 3 -alkoxy derivatives were prepared from 117 α through diastereoselective substitution reactions with alcohols. Cyclobutanones with 3 β-OR substituents were found to favour an endo envelope conformation while the 3 α-OR derivatives adopt the exo envelope conformation. Evidence from X-ray crystal structures and ab initio molecular orbital calculations suggests that an anomeric effect contributes to the large conformational preference of the tetrahydrothiophene ring that favours the 3 -alkoxy substituent in an axial orientation. In addition, the conformation of the bicyclic system was found to have a dramatic effect on the tendency of the cyclobutanone to undergo hemiketal formation. Cyclobutanone analogues of penicillins, including 3 -alkoxy derivatives, and cyclobutanone analogues of penems were evaluated against class A, B, C, and D β-lactamases and found to be moderate inhibitors of KPC- 2, IMP- 1, GC 1, and OXA- 10. The cyclobutanones found to be most potent were those which are hydrated to a larger extent in aqueous solution. Dichlorocyclobutanones were found to be better inhibitors than dechlorinated cyclobutanones and a 3 α-methoxy derivative 152 α, which favours the exo envelope conformation in which the C 4 carboxylate is equatorial, was found to be a better inhibitor than cyclobutanones that favour the endo envelope conformation. A 3, 4 -unsaturated penem analogue, 153, showed comparable potency to that of 152 α and molecular models of enzyme-inhibitor complexes indicate that an equatorial carboxylate is required for binding to β-lactamases. An X-ray crystal structure of 152 α bound to the class D β-lactamase OXA- 10 confirms that a serine hemiketal is formed in the active site and that the inhibitor adopts the exo envelope. The biochemical data described above demonstrate that cyclobutanones can indeed act as inhibitors of serine- and metallo-β-lactamases and these cyclobutanones represent the first class of reversible inhibitors to show moderate inhibition of all four classes of β-lactamase. Although the inhibitory potency of these compounds is modest (low micromolar IC 50 values), penem analogue 153 was able to enhance the potency of meropenem against carbapenem-resistant MBL-producing clinical isolates of Chryseobacterium meningosepticum and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and the synergy demonstrated in these antimicrobial assays is encouraging. Synthetic studies toward other C 3 -alkyl and C 3 -thioalkyl-substituted inhibitors are described and the design and synthesis of C 7 -monochloro- and 7 α-hydroxymethyl- 7 β-chloro cyclobutanone derivatives is presented. 1 yea...|$|E
