40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} uncertainty on investment and labor demand for Finnish firms during the time period 1987 – 2000. Utilizing a stock return based measure of uncertainty decomposed into systematic and idiosyncratic components, the results reveal that idiosyncratic uncertainty significantly reduces both investment and labor demand. Idiosyncratic uncertainty seems to influence investment in the current period, whereas <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> effect on labor demand appears with a one-year lag. The results provide support that <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> effect of idiosyncratic uncertainty on investment is stronger for small firms in comparison to large firms. Some evidence is reported regarding differential effects of uncertainty on labor demand conditional on firm characteristics. Most importantly, <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> effect of lagged idiosyncratic uncertainty on labor demand tends to be stronger for diversified firms compared with focused firms.

40|$|Biopolymers, {{produced}} from cellulosic biomass, have promising prospects of application as depressants in mineral processing. In this study, three {{different types of}} biopolymers (i. e., DP- 1775, DP- 1777 and DP- 1778) were used to study the effect of polymer structure on flotation of unactivated pyrite, copper activated pyrite and chalcopyrite. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> effect of DP- 1775 and DP- 1778 was much stronger than that of DP- 1777, and pyrite was depressed to a greater content than chalcopyrite with the same biopolymer at the same dosage. The biopolymer concentration played {{a vital role in}} determining the degree of depression. For each biopolymer, the higher the concentration, the greater <b>the</b> minerals were <b>depressed.</b> <b>The</b> mechanism underpinning <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> effect of these biopolymers was explored in this paper. The concentration of biopolymers could determine the properties of the adsorption layer and the confirmation of biopolymer chains on mineral surfaces. The biopolymer molecules may aggregate when polymer concentration was over a critical value. Molecular weight and functional groups of biopolymers were the key factors characterizing <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> capability of different biopolymers. Differences between the tested biopolymers and features of the adsorbed layer might account for the observed trends in ability to depress pyrite and chalcopyrite flotation. <b>The</b> greater <b>depressing</b> effect of biopolymers on pyrite over chalcopyrite might result from the preferential adsorption of biopolymers on pyrite over chalcopyrite...|$|R

40|$|Synaptic {{depression}} {{is a form}} of short-term plasticity exhibited by many synapses. Nonetheless, the functional significance of synaptic depression in oscillatory networks is not well understood. We show that, in a recurrent inhibitory network that includes an intrinsic oscillator, synaptic depression can give rise to two distinct modes of network operation. When the maximal conductance of <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> synapse is small, the oscillation period is determined by the oscillator component. Increasing the maximal conductance beyond a threshold value activates a positive-feedback mechanism that greatly enhances the synaptic strength. In this mode, the oscillation period is determined by the strength and dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> synapse. Because of the regenerative nature of the feedback mechanism, the circuit can be switched from one mode of operation to another by a very small change in the maximal conductance of <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> synapse. Our model was inspired by experimental work on the pyloric network of the lobster. The pyloric network produces a simple motor rhythm generated by a pacemaker neuron that receives feedback inhibition from a depressing synapse. In some preparations, elimination of the synapse had no effect on the period of the rhythm, whereas in other preparations, there was a significant decrease in the period. We propose that the pyloric network can operate in either of the two modes suggested by the model, depending on the maximal conductance of <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> synapse...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>depressing</b> {{action of}} {{superior}} oblique (making the eye look down towards the mouth) {{is most effective}} when the eye is in an adducted position. This is because as the eye is abducted (looks laterally), the contribution made by superior oblique to depression of the eye decreases, as the inferior rectus muscle causes this movement more directly and powerfully. The main muscle for abduction is the lateral rectus, so although superior oblique contributes to a downwards and lateral eye movement, testing this motion would not be specific enough as inferior and lateral recti muscles would also be tested. Therefore, during neurological examinations, the superior oblique is tested by having the patient look inwards and downwards, testing only <b>the</b> <b>depressing</b> action of <b>the</b> muscle. This {{is a source of}} confusion on the subject as although clinical testing asks the patient to adduct and <b>depress</b> <b>the</b> eye, anatomically <b>the</b> muscle <b>depresses</b> and abducts it.|$|R
25|$|The Bruckner Expressway was {{originally}} the Bruckner Boulevard, designated {{as part of}} NY1A. In the 1930s, a freeway was planned on the Bruckner Boulevard alignment {{in order to provide}} a connection between the Triborough Bridge and a freeway leading north into Westchester County. Moses took over planning for the road in 1951 and called for an elevated freeway between the Triborough Bridge and the Bronx River and a depressed freeway east of there. Construction on the elevated segment of the Bruckner Expressway began in 1957 and on <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> segment in 1959. <b>The</b> <b>depressed</b> portion was opened in 1961 while the elevated portion of the Bruckner Expressway was opened in 1962. In 1972, the large Bruckner Interchange was finished, completing the route. Over the years, the I-278 portion of the Bruckner Expressway has had different designations. When the Interstate Highway System was first created, the road was to be part of I-895 from I-87 to the Sheridan Expressway and I-678 from there to I-95. Later, I-278 was planned to follow the Bruckner Expressway from I-87 to the Sheridan Expressway, where it would continue on that freeway to I-95, while the Bruckner Expressway was not designated an interstate north of there. By 1970, I-278 was routed onto its current alignment, with I-895 created along the Sheridan Expressway.|$|E

25|$|Motivation lies at {{the core}} of many behaviorist {{approaches}} to psychological treatment. A person with autism-spectrum disorder is seen as lacking motivation to perform socially relevant behaviors – social stimuli are not as reinforcing for people with autism compared to other people. Depression is understood as a lack of reinforcement (especially positive reinforcement) leading to extinction of behavior in <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> individual. A patient with specific phobia is not motivated to seek out the phobic stimulus because it acts as a punisher, and is over-motivated to avoid it (negative reinforcement). In accordance, therapies have been designed to address these problems, such as EIBI and CBT for major depression and specific phobia.|$|E
