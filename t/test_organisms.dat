25|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{explored}} the thermoregulatory capacity of rodent tails by subjecting <b>test</b> <b>organisms</b> to {{varying levels of}} physical activity and quantifying heat conduction via the animals' tails. One study demonstrated a significant disparity in heat dissipation from a rat's tail relative to its abdomen. This observation was attributed to the higher proportion of vascularity in the tail, {{as well as its}} higher surface area to volume ratio, which directly relates to heat's ability to dissipate via the skin. These findings were confirmed in a separate study analyzing the relationships of heat storage and mechanical efficiency in rodents that exercise in warm environments. In this study, the tail was a focal point in measuring heat accumulation and modulation.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from its}} direct {{clinical}} use, paclitaxel is used extensively in biological and biomedical research as a microtubule stabilizer. [...] In general, in vitro assays involving microtubules, such as motility assays, rely on paclitaxel to maintain microtubule integrity {{in the absence}} of the various nucleating factors and other stabilizing elements found in the cell. [...] For example, it is used for in vitro tests of drugs that aim to alter the behavior of microtubule motor proteins, or for studies of mutant motor proteins. [...] Moreover, Paclitaxel has been used in vitro to inhibit insulin fibrillation; in a molar ratio of 10:1 (insulin:paclitaxel), it hindered insulin fibrillation near 70%. Iso-thermal titration calorimetry (ITC) findings indicated a spontaneous tendency of paclitaxel to interact with insulin through hydrogen bonds and van der Waal’s forces. Paclitaxel is sometimes used for in vivo studies as well; it can be fed to <b>test</b> <b>organisms,</b> such as fruit flies, or injected into individual cells, to inhibit microtubule disassembly or to increase the number of microtubules in the cell. [...] Paclitaxel induces remyelination in a demyelinating mouse in vivo and inhibits hPAD2 in vitro though its methyl ester side chain. [...] Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc. began phase II clinical trials in 1999 as a multiple sclerosis treatment but in 2002, reported that the results showed no statistical significance.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{familiar}} resazurin test used in {{milk testing}} has been {{adapted to the}} estimation of nisin, using a fast-growing strain of Streptococcus cremoris as <b>test</b> <b>organism.</b> The reproducibility and accuracy of this test compares favourably with the many other assay methods for nisin which use Strep. agalactiae as <b>test</b> <b>organism.</b> Results may be obtained {{in less than an}} hour as compared with 15 - 48 hr. in the other tests and are a measure of bactericidal power only. Aseptic technique during the actual assay procedure is unnecessary. Methods were devised to ensure a suitable standard inoculum, which is imperative for this test. As little as 0. 5 unit nish/ml. may be estimated. Inhibition of reductase activity and acid production by bacteria in milk have been used for the assay of penicillin and streptomycin. Reid & Brewer (1946) used Bacillus subtilis as <b>test</b> <b>organism</b> and added methylene blue as indicator system at the beginning of incubation. Approximate readings were possible after 4 hr. and final readings were taken after 18 hr.

40|$|BaciUus polymyxa was {{originally}} detected {{as a producer}} of an antibiotic (Stansly, Shepherd, and White, 1947) {{by the fact that}} surrounding the colony of the organism was a clear zone of agar, whereas the remainder of the agar plate was covered with a layer of growth of the <b>test</b> <b>organism.</b> Obviously the anti-biotic diffused through the agar and prevented growth of the <b>test</b> <b>organism</b> up to a point where its concentration fell to a value below that required for this inhibition. It was, therefore, anticipated that {{it might be possible to}} de-velop an agar diffusion method to assay for potency similar to the well-known methods for penicillin (Abraham et al., 1941). It was soon apparent, however, that the methods used for the assay of peni-cillin were not strictly applicable to the assay of polymyxin. For example, in a preliminary experiment using ifiter paper disks saturated with solutions of polymyxin, insignificant zones of inhibition were obtained using Escherichia coli as the <b>test</b> <b>organism,</b> even with high concentrations of the antibiotic.
