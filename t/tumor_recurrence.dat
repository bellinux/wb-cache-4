40|$|Background Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) is mainly caused by smoking and alcohol abuse and shows a five-year survival rate of ~ 50 %. We aimed to explore the variation of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in primary oral <b>tumors,</b> <b>recurrences</b> and metastases. Methods We performed an in-depth validation of mtDNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform for its application to cancer tissues, with the goal to detect low-level heteroplasmies and to avoid artifacts. Therefore we genotyped the mitochondrial genome (16. 6 kb) from 85 tissue samples (<b>tumors,</b> <b>recurrences,</b> resection edges, metasta-ses and blood) collected from 28 prospectively recruited OSCC patients applying both Sanger sequencing and high-coverage NGS (~ 35, 000 reads per base).

25|$|Radiation {{therapy or}} radiotherapy, often {{abbreviated}} RT, RTx, or XRT, is therapy using ionizing radiation, generally {{as part of}} cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells and normally delivered by a linear accelerator. Radiation therapy may be curative {{in a number of}} types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrence</b> after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology.|$|E
25|$|Excisional biopsies may {{remove the}} tumor, but further surgery is often {{necessary}} {{to reduce the}} risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate surgical margins and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with 1 to 2cm margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2 to 0.5cm. Many surgeons consider 0.5cm the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ, but 0.2cm margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery (Mohs surgery, or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrence</b> at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades.|$|E
2500|$|Exogenous erythropoietin, {{recombinant}} human erythropoietin (rhEPO) is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA): two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta.

40|$|Detection of micrometastases in the {{regional}} tumor-draining lymph nodes is critical for staging and prognosis in melanoma patients. We applied a quantitative multiple-marker RT-PCR assay to improve the detection of occult melanoma cells in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). From 139 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel lymphadenectomy, a total of 235 SLN were assessed for Melan-A and tyrosinase expression by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Twenty-three patients (17 %) were positive by histopathology and expressed messenger RNA {{of one or two}} markers. Of the patients with histopathologically negative SLN 39 (28 %) were reclassified by positive RT-PCR. Patients were examined for <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences</b> during a median follow-up period of 29 mo. <b>Tumor</b> <b>recurrences</b> were demonstrated in eight patients (35 %) with histopathologically positive SLN, in four patients (10 %) with submicroscopic tumor cells detected exclusively by real-time RT-PCR, and in none of the patients negative by both methods. The differences in recurrence rates were statistically significant (p= 0. 01). These data indicate that real-time quantitative RT-PCR for the detection of minimal residual melanoma in SLN improves the prediction of disease-free survival...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC) of urinary bladder is increasing worldwide. Patients with superficial TCC of urinary bladder {{can have a}} survival period of 10 years if they are detected {{at an early stage}} and appropriate intravesical adjuvant immunotherapy is instilled in time. A total number of 440 patients of superficial TCC were instilled intravesically BCG & Interferon a- 2 b as single drug or in combination and followed up. BCG though was most efficient, had high toxic rate while Interferon α- 2 b was expensive, whereas a low dose combination therapy of both showed excellent result in reducing <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences</b> & prolonging disease pro-gression free interval. The author reviews his experience of 10 years in man-agement of these malignancies with intravesical immu-notherapy and concludes that a low dose BCG (60 mg) with Interferon α- 2 b (5 million IU) has shown to be very effective in reducing <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences,</b> prolonging dis-ease-progression-free interval with a very low toxicity in such patients. To achieve this a periodic maintenance dose therapy is absolutely necessary...|$|R
2500|$|Improvements in {{computers}} and treatment delivery technology {{have led to}} more complex radiotherapy treatment options. One such new technology is using IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy), which can change the shape and intensity of the radiation beam making [...] "beamlets" [...] at different points across and inside the breast. This allows for better dose distribution within the breast while minimizing dose to healthy organs such as the lung or heart. However, there {{is yet to be}} a demonstrated difference in treatment outcomes (both <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrence</b> and level of side effects) for IMRT in breast cancer when compared to conventional radiotherapy treatment. In addition, conventional radiotherapy can also deliver similar dose distributions utilizing modern computer dosimetry planning and equipment. External beam radiation therapy treatments for breast cancer are typically given every day, five days a week, for five to 10 weeks.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, {{to better}} {{aid in the}} {{understanding}} of changes in detailed body composition, body morphomics analysis is an accurate and convenient method for patients to characterize body composition changes in cancer patients using the patient’s staging CT (or PET/CT) scans. Notably, body morphomics appears to be a more sensitive measure of adverse outcomes (i.e. <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences)</b> than <b>tumor</b> stage and weight loss.

40|$|Aggressive {{regrowth}} {{of recurrent}} tumors following treatment-induced dormancy represents a major clinical challenge {{for treatment of}} malignant disease. We reported previously that recurrent prostate tumors, which underwent complete macroscopic regression followed by aggressive regrowth, could be cured with a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) -expressed cDNA library derived from recurrent tumor cells. By screening the protective, recurrence-derived VSV-cDNA library, here we identify topoisomerase-IIα (TOPO-IIα) as a recurrence-specific tumor antigen against which tolerance can be broken. <b>Tumor</b> <b>recurrences,</b> in {{two different types of}} tumor (prostate and melanoma), which had evaded two different frontline treatments (immunotherapy or chemotherapy), significantly overexpressed TOPO-IIα compared with their primary tumor counterparts, which conferred a novel sensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy upon the recurrent tumors. This was exploited in vivo using combination therapies to cure mice, which would otherwise have relapsed, after suboptimal primary therapy in both models. Our data show that recurrent tumors-across histologies and primary treatments-express distinct antigens compared with the primary tumor which can be identified using the VSV-cDNA library technology. These results suggest that {{it may be possible to}} design a few common second-line therapies against a variety of <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences,</b> in some cases using agents with no obvious activity against the primary tumor...|$|R

The management of recurrent glioblastoma is highly challenging, and treatment outcomes remain uniformly poor. Glioblastoma is a highly infiltrative tumor, and complete surgical resection of all microscopic extensions cannot be achieved {{at the time of}} initial diagnosis, and hence local recurrence is observed in most patients. Gamma Knife radiosurgery has been used to treat these <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences</b> for select cases and has been successful in prolonging the median survival by 8 – 12 months on average for select cases. We present the unique case of a 63 -year-old male with multiple sequential recurrences of glioblastoma after initial standard treatment with surgery followed by concomitant external beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy (temozolomide). The patient was followed clinically as well as with surveillance MRI scans at every 2 - 3 -month intervals.

40|$|This {{clinical}} study {{was based on}} experimental results obtained in nude mice grafted with human colon carcinoma, showing that injected 131 I-labeled F(ab') 2 and Fab fragments from high affinity anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibodies (MAb) gave markedly higher ratios of tumor to normal tissue localization than intact MAb. 31 patients with known colorectal carcinoma, including 10 primary tumors, 13 local <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences,</b> and 21 metastatic involvements, were injected with 123 I-labeled F(ab') 2 (n = 14) or Fab (n = 17) fragments from MAb anti-CEA. The patients were examined by emission-computerized tomography (ECT) at 6, 24, and sometimes 48 h after injection using a rotating dual head scintillation camera. All 23 primary <b>tumors</b> and local <b>recurrences</b> except one were clearly visualized {{on at least two}} sections of different tomographic planes. Interestingly, nine of these patients had almost normal circulating CEA levels, and three of the visualized tumors weighed only 3 - 5 g.

Altogether, 86 % of the tumor sites were detected, 82 % with F(ab') 2 and 89 % with Fab fragments. The contrast of the tumor images obtained with Fab fragments suggests that this improved method of immunoscintigraphy has the potential to detect early <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences</b> and thus to increase the survival of patients.

40|$|Patients with {{pheochromocytoma}} or paraganglioma {{are at risk}} {{of developing}} <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences</b> or new <b>tumors</b> after successful resection of the primary tumor.

40|$|Aims and Objectives: The {{incidence}} of bladder malignancy is increasing worldwide and the projected rise is 28 % by 2010 for both sexes (WHO). Though intravesical adjuvant therapy with BCG {{is superior to}} any other immunotherapeutic/chemotherapeutic agent in reducing <b>tumor</b> <b>recurrences</b> and disease progression, its real efficacy remains controversial as one-third of the patients will soon become BCG failure. Hence {{there is a need}} for an alternative intravesical agent for treatment of BCG failure. Our aim was to study the efficacy, tolerability and safety of intravesical Gemcitabine in managing BCG-refractory superficial bladder malignancy. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five BCG failure patients, 26 males and nine females between 20 - 72 years of age were instilled with 2000 mg of Gemcitabine in 50 ml of normal saline intravesically two weeks post tumor resection, for six consecutive weeks. Mean follow-up was for 18 months with cystoscopies. Results: Twenty-one patients (60 %) showed no recurrences, 11 patients (31. 4 %) had superficial recurrences while three patients (8. 6 %) progressed to muscle invasiveness. Average time to first recurrence was 12 months and to disease progression was 16 months. Adverse event was low and mild. Therapy was well tolerated.
