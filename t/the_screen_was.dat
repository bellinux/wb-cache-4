5|$|For the WB's 2004–2005 {{prime time}} schedule, Carey co-produced {{and starred in}} Drew Carey's Green Screen Show, a {{spin-off}} of Whose Line Is It Anyway?. It was canceled by the WB, but picked up shortly afterward by Comedy Central. The show's premise relied {{on the use of}} a green screen for all of the actors' improv interactions. Animation on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> inserted during post-production.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that the removal of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained {{about the same as}} in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E
5000|$|Monochrome {{monitors}} {{are commonly}} available in three colors: if the P1 phosphor <b>is</b> used, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> green monochrome. If the P3 phosphor <b>is</b> used, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> amber monochrome. If the P4 phosphor <b>is</b> used, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> white monochrome (known as [...] "paper white"); {{this is the}} same phosphor as used in early television sets.An amber <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> claimed to give improved ergonomics, specifically by reducing eye strain; this claim appears to have little scientific basis.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> {{a glossy}} display and {{measures}} 12.1 inches (307 mm) diagonally. It has a native resolution of 1280 × 800 pixels. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> LED-backlit. An external display {{can be used}} through the standard VGA connector.|$|R
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Peter McConnell, Michael Land and Clint Bajakian. The three had {{worked together to}} share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis, and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle. According to McConnell, he had composed most of the music {{taking place in the}} game's present, Land for the future, and Bajakian for the past, outside of Dr. Fred's theme for the past which McConnell had done. The music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play, further drawing on Looney Tunes' use of parodying classical works of music, and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game. Many of these themes had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of computers at the time, managed by the iMUSE music interface; such themes would include shorter repeating patterns that would play while the game's screen scrolled across, and then once <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> at the proper place, the music would continue on to a more dramatic phrase.|$|E
25|$|Slide Away <b>The</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} as a CD by Road Goes on Forever Records with three previously unreleased songs added.|$|E
25|$|McTell {{had written}} {{a lot of new}} songs and went into the studio with backing musicians {{including}} Richard Thompson, Dave Pegg and Simon Nicol. The resulting album, Slide Away <b>The</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>was</b> released by Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{elements}} of the game are randomized. Although text-based, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> split into a map, area description, and inventory of items. At the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>are</b> statistics such as hunger, thirst, number of treasures found, total moves, and score.|$|R
50|$|Replacing a <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> {{a simple}} operation. The finder {{is removed from}} the camera, and <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> then pried up using a {{fingernail}} along the silver rear edge of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> pressed into place, and the finder put back on.|$|R
50|$|Other {{terms are}} {{used to refer to}} such {{decorative}} work. If <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> made from iron, the term ironwork is often used. The term in Spanish, reja can also refer to metal fences. If <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> made from cutouts of wood, the term Fretwork is also used.|$|R
25|$|Samsung added its sign in November 1994, {{the space}} having been {{previously}} occupied by Canon (1978–84) and Panasonic (1984–94). The sign was changed from neon to LED in summer 2005. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> upgraded and improved in autumn 2011.|$|E
25|$|In the winter, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> {{removed and}} {{replaced}} with a storm window, which created a two-layer separation between the interior and exterior spaces, increasing window insulation in cold winter months. To permit ventilation the storm window may be hung from removable hinge loops and swung open using folding metal arms. No screening was usually possible with open storm windows, though in the winter, insects typically are not active.|$|E
25|$|Sir George Gilbert Scott led the {{restoration}} of Salisbury Cathedral between 1863 – 1878. It was during this time that Skidmore created the cathedral's choir screen. In 1959, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> removed {{and most of it}} was destroyed. The chancel gates survived and are now in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. As of September 2011, they are on display in the Ironwork gallery, room 114a.|$|E
5000|$|Here, a {{direction}} from the light source toward <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> defined as t direction and that perpendicular to t direction and parallel with <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> defined as s direction. (Both t-s and x-y coordinate systems are set up such that they are reflected each other without mirror-reflective transformation.) ...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{versions}} of this technique that are commonly used, but the concept is the same: when the trigger of the gun <b>is</b> pulled, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> blanked out to black, and the diode begins reception. All or part of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> painted white {{in a way that}} allows the computer to judge where the gun is pointing, based on when the diode detects light. The user of the light gun notices little or nothing, because the period in which <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> blank is usually only {{a fraction of a second}} (see persistence of vision).|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> a 3.3 in {{capacitive}} touchscreen Super AMOLED with an anti-smudge oleophobic coating {{on top of}} the scratch-resistant tempered-glass ( [...] Gorilla Glass Display [...] ). <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> resolution <b>is</b> 800x480 WVGA with 283 PPI.|$|R
25|$|In the Solo Game, the {{champion}} was given sixty seconds to find ten {{words on a}} brand new board. The champion viewed the board on a telestrator screen. On the original Now You See It, the Solo Game board was the same one used in the Semi-final/Qualifying Round and <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> embedded in Jack Narz's podium. On the revival series, a separate podium was used and, as {{in the rest of}} the show, the board was computer-generated.|$|E
25|$|Nelson's {{speech was}} {{considered}} controversial and received mixed reactions. Thousands {{of people who}} had gathered in public spaces in Canberra and Melbourne to hear the apology turned their backs on the screens that broadcast Nelson speaking. In Perth, people booed and jeered until <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> switched off. In Parliament House's Great Hall, elements of the audience began a slow clap, with some finally turning their backs. There were similar reactions and walk-outs in Sydney and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Cathay's Jurong Drive-In cinema {{opened on}} 14 July 1971 and was, at that time, {{the first of}} its kind in Singapore and Malaysia, and the largest in Asia. The 5.6 hectare site was {{equipped}} with 899 speaker stands, 300 seats at the gallery for walk-in customers and <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> elevated 25 feet from the ground. Cathay distributed Golden Harvest films and when Jurong Drive-In screened Bruce Lee's Big Boss, the line-up of cars was so long that many got out and walked. The show was scheduled for midnight but didn't start screening until 1am.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> {{turned off}} and the app is loaded again during the operation, it returns to <b>the</b> start <b>screen,</b> which <b>is</b> an {{annoying}} problem for the users.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{spotlight}} function which allows a single part of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to <b>be</b> visible for focusing the attention of an audience. The visible part of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> movable by <b>the</b> user of the program.|$|R

25|$|A {{screen or}} transenna in marble by Mino da Fiesole, Andrea Bregno, and Giovanni Dalmata divides the chapel into two parts. Originally these made equal {{space for the}} members of the Papal Chapel within the {{sanctuary}} near the altar and the pilgrims and townsfolk without. However, with {{growth in the number of}} those attending the Pope, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> moved giving a reduced area for the faithful laity. The transenna is surmounted by a row of ornate candlesticks, once gilt, and has a wooden door, where once there was an ornate door of gilded wrought iron. The sculptors of the transenna also provided the cantoria or projecting choir gallery.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the US Navy {{required}} a weapon effective against surface ships, {{such as the}} German Bismarck class battleships. Although missile and TV technology existed, {{the size of the}} primitive guidance systems available rendered automatic guidance impractical. To solve this problem, Skinner initiated Project Pigeon, which was intended to provide a simple and effective guidance system. This system divided the nose cone of a missile into three compartments, with a pigeon placed in each. Lenses projected an image of distant objects onto a screen in front of each bird. Thus, when the missile was launched from an aircraft within sight of an enemy ship, an image of the ship would appear on the screen. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> hinged, such that pecks at the image of the ship would guide the missile toward the ship.|$|E
25|$|Between 1956 and 1960 St Peter's {{underwent}} further restoration {{in which}} the tower and nave were re-roofed. St Catherine's Chapel and the nave were refurbished and a large mural of the Ascension by Burrows which covered the wall over the tower arch was painted over. The church was also substantially re-ordered, and the high altar and sanctuary area brought forward under the tower crossing. The wooden 15th-Century rood screen which separated the nave from the crossing was painted and gilded in a medieval style, {{and a set of}} twelve carved figures which had been added in the early 19th century were also painted and mounted higher up the screen. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> backed with oak and re-mounted {{on the back of the}} new sanctuary area to form a reredos behind the altar, also serving as a dividing wall with the old chancel area which was converted into a vestry area.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Pine Trees <b>screen</b> (Shōrin-zu byōbu) <b>is</b> {{a pair of}} six-panel folding <b>screens</b> (byōbu) by <b>the</b> Japanese artist Hasegawa Tōhaku. The precise {{date for}} <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> <b>is</b> not known, but they were clearly made in the late 16th century, in the Momoyama period, around 1595. <b>The</b> <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> held by <b>the</b> Tokyo National Museum, and were {{designated}} as a National Treasure of Japan in 1952.|$|R

25|$|Another bold {{move in the}} show's final months saw Number 96 feature {{what was}} publicised as Australian television's first full frontal nude scene when new {{character}} Miss Hemingway (Deborah Gray) made {{the first of several}} unveilings in April 1977. Number 96 in 1976 had shown a bit-part nurse fleeing Dudley's bedroom which revealed a full frontal nude flash {{but this was the first}} time such nudity was shown front and centre in protracted scenes. In one outrageous moment, Miss Hemingway wore a bra but no panties and yet despite screening at 8.30pm on free-to-air TV, there were barely any complaints (but when the same scene was shown on the ABC during Four Corners, the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> blacked out). Other bedroom farce comedy sequences of the period featured increasing levels of male and female semi-nudity, and some other instances of full frontal female nudity. Meanwhile, a scene where Jane Chester becomes a prostitute and is asked to whip her male client, new Number 96 resident Toby Buxton (Malcolm Thompson) gave viewers a brief glimpse of full frontal male nudity.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson {{transferred}} to the Royal Artillery on 1 June 1942, and was again a temporary lieutenant-colonel, commanding 99th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, when on 13 May 1944, during {{the final stages of}} the Battle of Monte Cassino he performed the actions that led to his appointment as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order on 21 September 1944. His regiment had been detailed to make smoke to cover the bridges over the Gari River, early in the day it was reported that there was no smoke covering one particular bridge (codenamed Amazon). Wilkinson took a jeep to investigate the situation for himself, approaching the bridge the trailer from another jeep was found, which contained the equipment for making smoke, which was then loaded into his own jeep. It was later determined that both officers responsible for the bridge had been injured (one killed), and the sergeant had also been killed, and initial supplies of smoke canisters had been exhausted. Wilkinson proceeded to cross the bridge on foot, under mortar and small arms fire, carrying replacement smoke canisters. He managed to begin the re-establishment of the smoke screen, left the one man still there tending the new smoke canisters, and gathered an additional party of men to ensure <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> maintained.|$|E
500|$|Pratchett {{himself said}} he was [...] "very pleased" [...] with the casting and {{production}} of the film, although he admitted that seeing his literary work adapted for <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> [...] "very bad for me: it's like I'm wandering around {{on the inside of}} my own head".|$|E
40|$|This {{fastener}} used in {{induction heating}} <b>is</b> a wire <b>screen</b> basically of an eddy current carrying material such as carbon steel. Selected wires in <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>are</b> copper, sheathed in an insulating material. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> placed between two sheets of thermoplastics. When inductively heated, the composite softens and flows around the apertures of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> After this heating and joining, the copper wires {{may be used}} to conduct electricity...|$|R
