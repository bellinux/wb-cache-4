5|$|Speaking in <b>tongues</b> is {{the initial}} {{physical}} {{evidence of the}} baptism in the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in <b>tongues</b> as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in <b>tongues</b> was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in <b>tongues.</b> The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in <b>tongues</b> and prophesy.|$|E

5|$|Seymour and {{his small}} group of new {{followers}} soon relocated {{to the home of}} Richard and Ruth Asberry at 216 North Bonnie Brae Street. White families from local holiness churches began to attend as well. The group would get together regularly and pray to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On April 9, 1906, after five weeks of Seymour's preaching and prayer, and three days into an intended 10-day fast, Edward S. Lee spoke in <b>tongues</b> for the first time. At the next meeting, Seymour shared Lee's testimony and preached a sermon on Acts 2:4 and soon six others began to speak in <b>tongues</b> as well, including Jennie Moore, who would later become Seymour's wife. A few days later, on April 12, Seymour spoke in <b>tongues</b> for the first time after praying all night long.|$|E

40|$|Many {{microorganisms}} {{have been}} found colonizing the dorsum of <b>tongue.</b> To prevent infection and development of other pathologies in oral cavity, <b>tongue</b> cleaning has been advocated {{to reduce the amount}} of coating and microorganism loading in the mouth. The aim of this study is to find out the impact of <b>tongue</b> cleaning using <b>tongue</b> scraper against <b>tongue</b> coating index and anaerobic bacterial colony count on <b>tongue</b> dorsum. This study was carried out on 24 male and 16 female participants aged 11 to 17. <b>Tongue</b> coating index was used to assess <b>tongue</b> coating and <b>tongue</b> samples were taken to count the bacterial colony. The result showed that there is a significant difference <b>tongue</b> coating index (Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, p= 0. 000) and amount of anaerobic bacteria colony (tpaired test, p= 0. 007) before and after using <b>tongue</b> scraper. In conclusion, <b>tongue</b> scraper can reduce <b>tongue</b> coating index and there was significant difference in anaerobic bacteria colony count before and after using <b>tongue</b> scraper...|$|R
40|$|The muscular-hydrostat {{model of}} <b>tongue</b> {{function}} proposes a constant interaction of extrinsic (external bony attachment, insertion into base of <b>tongue)</b> and intrinsic (origin and insertion within the <b>tongue)</b> <b>tongue</b> muscles in all <b>tongue</b> movements (22). Yet, research that examines the respiratory-related effects of <b>tongue</b> function in mammals continues to focus {{almost exclusively on}} the respiratory control and function of the extrinsic <b>tongue</b> protrusor muscle, m. genioglossus. The respiratory control and function of the intrinsic <b>tongue</b> muscles are unknown. Our purpose {{was to determine if}} intrinsic <b>tongue</b> muscles have a respiration-related activity pattern and whether intrinsic <b>tongue</b> muscles are co-activated with extrinsic <b>tongue</b> muscles in response to respiratory-related sensory stimuli. Esophageal pressure and electromyographic (EMG) activity of an extrinsic <b>tongue</b> muscle (hyoglossus, HG), an intrinsic <b>tongue</b> muscle (superior longitudinal, SL) and an external intercostal muscle (IIC) were studied in anaesthetized, tracheotomized, spontaneously breathing rats.

40|$|Objective: In this study, optical data on {{color of}} <b>tongue</b> tips were {{collected}} by using a visible reflection spectrum system. Quantitative method of <b>tongue</b> inspection and classification of <b>tongue</b> states including pale, pale red, red and crimson manifestations were investigated. Methods: Chromaticity coordinates of the <b>tongue</b> tips from 98 subjects were calculated {{on the basis of}} the visible reflection spectrum. The <b>tongue</b> color was quantified and classified by the visible reflection spectrum in the range from 590 nm to 780 nm, based on the higher red-band energy distribution on the <b>tongue</b> tip color. Results: It was found that comparison and analysis of <b>tongue</b> tip color from different samples would be well-suited after spectrum vector normalization, and the difference of <b>tongue</b> tip color between different samples could be observed easily when the <b>tongue</b> tip optical data were sited in CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram. The <b>tongue</b> tip colors were analyzed quantitatively and classified by the spectral energy intensity at the wavelength of 670 nm and (or) spectral energy ratio of red bank from 590 nm to 780 nm. The results of classification showed that there was sound corresponding accuracy with the clinical diagnosis of pale <b>tongue,</b> pale red <b>tongue,</b> red <b>tongue</b> and crimson <b>tongue.</b> Conclusion: In this study, based on the collection of the information data on <b>tongue</b> tip characteristics with the visible spectrum from 380 nm to 780 nm, the quantitative analysis of <b>tongue</b> inspection for pale <b>tongue,</b> pale red <b>tongue,</b> red <b>tongue</b> and crimson <b>tongue</b> was established. The quantitative value for <b>tongue</b> tip color is an effective method for classification of the condition of the <b>tongue</b> tip, which provides a useful tool for the modernization of <b>tongue</b> inspection in traditional Chinese medicine...|$|R

5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular <b>tongues</b> and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile <b>tongues</b> to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E

2500|$|Hairy <b>tongue</b> (lingua villosa) {{refers to}} a marked {{accumulation}} of keratin on the filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the <b>tongue,</b> giving a hair-like appearance. Black <b>tongue</b> (lengua negra) {{refers to a}} black discoloration of the <b>tongue,</b> {{which may or may}} not be associated with hairy <b>tongue.</b> [...] However, the elongated papillae of hairy <b>tongue</b> usually develop discoloration due to growth of pigment producing bacteria and staining from food. Hence the term black hairy <b>tongue,</b> although hairy <b>tongue</b> may also be discolored yellow or brown. Transient, surface discoloration that is not associated with hairy <b>tongue</b> can be brushed off. Drug-induced black hairy <b>tongue</b> specifically refers to BHT that develops because of medication.|$|R
40|$|Activity of <b>tongue</b> muscles during respiration: {{it takes}} a village? Almost twenty {{years have passed since}} the muscular hydro-stat theory of <b>tongue</b> {{function}} was set forth (7). Yet few studies have explored one of its central predictions: that “extrinsic” <b>tongue</b> muscles (muscles with origin outside the <b>tongue</b> body) and “intrinsic ” <b>tongue</b> muscles (muscles with both origin and insertion in the <b>tongue</b> body) must be coactive in most <b>tongue</b> movements. An exclusive focus on extrinsic <b>tongue</b> muscles is especially notable in studies of <b>tongue</b> movement during res-piration for which a single <b>tongue</b> “protrusor ” muscle, the genioglossus, commonly serves as the indicator of respiratory drive to the entire <b>tongue.</b> That the situation is substantially more complex is evident from the accompanying study of Bailey and Fregosi (2).

5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing in <b>tongues.</b> There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of <b>tongues.</b> There was prayer in <b>tongues</b> for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E

Its characteristic means that “forward” <b>tongue</b> motion ensures the straight driving performance. In addition, although “forward” <b>tongue</b> motion is misclassified as “down” <b>tongue</b> motion as about 3.4  %, it does not affect the straight driving performance so much because this misclassification reduces the driving velocity while moving backward.|$|R
