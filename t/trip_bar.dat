5000|$|Flat-board design: In this design, a {{flat board}} {{rests on the}} ice. A shaft runs {{perpendicular}} to the board with a spool of line on one end and a <b>trip</b> <b>bar</b> on the other. A spring is mounted to {{one end of the}} board, and a metal [...] "flag pole" [...] is attached to the spring. The flag is set by placing the flag pole under the <b>trip</b> <b>bar.</b> When a fish bites, pulling the line spins the spool, therefore the shaft, and therefore the <b>trip</b> <b>bar.</b> With nothing to hold the flag down, it springs up and alerts the angler to a strike.|$|E

This paper analyzed effects on cavitation stability of a <b>trip</b> <b>bar</b> arranged on high-speed underwater projectile. Small scale water tank experiment and large eddy simulation using the {{open source software}} OpenFOAM were used, and the results agree well with each other.

40|$|Plant, Unit 2, {{operating}} at approximately 99 % power, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) B {{was removed from}} service for scheduled maintenance. Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation 3. 8. 1 Condition B, was entered due one EDG inoperable. During the post-maintenance testing, EDG B Output Breaker 52 / 27 B failed to close. The investigation for the inoperability of Breaker 52 / 27 B determined that the shunt trip attachment (STA) had internal binding that prevented the STA from releasing the <b>trip</b> <b>bar,</b> resulting in the <b>trip</b> <b>bar</b> remaining in the "trip condition " and preventing the breaker from closing. EDG B was inoperable from January 28, 2010 to February 24, 2010, approximately 27 days. In addition, EDG A was declared inoperable on February 8, 2010 for approximately 6 hours and 53 minutes for scheduled maintenance. Additional details are provided in References 1 and 2. Key Event Details. The following event details are significant to the modeling of this event analysis: • There were approximately 27 days that the EDG B was unavailable due to the breaker failure. During this period, EDG A was unavailable due to surveillance testing for 7 hours. Therefore, the total duration of EDG B was unavailable by itself is 27 days minu...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the damage pattern when {{overcurrent}} is applied to a thermal magnetic type molded case circuit breaker (MCCB) using a Primary Current Injection Test System (PCITS). When an overcurrent of 150 A was applied to the PCITS for 5 seconds with the <b>trip</b> <b>bar</b> of an MCCB being damaged, it was found that the sur-face of the temperature control device (bimetallic strip) positioned at the right was significantly carbonized. When an overcurrent of 300 A was applied to the PCITS for 5 s under the same conditions, the entire temperature control device was deteriorated, becoming flattened and in close contact with the MCCB. When an overcurrent of 450 A was applied to the PCITS for 5 s, the coil of the temperature control device was melted and disconnected. In addition, it was observed that the contacts, the enclosure and upper cover were deformed and there was a trace of carbonization on them. When approximately 3 s had elapsed after an overcurrent of 600 A was applied, white smoke occurred inside the MCCB and a flame was radiated out, after which the overcurrent supply stopped with “phutt ” (whomp) sound. It was observed that when the same type of MCCB is damaged by a general flame, the surfaces of its handle, terminal, arc divider (extin-guisher) and temperature control device were carbonized uniformly. In addition, it was found that the <b>trip</b> <b>bar</b> of the oper...|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} episode of the game (sometime around July 1982) Bigby first {{encounters}} Snow at the Woodland Acres Apartments where he and Snow live (although in separate apartments). Snow knocks on Bigby's door to alert him {{to the murder of}} a suspicious woman whom Bigby had encountered earlier that evening. After allowing Bigby to perform a sweep of the area for clues, Snow takes Bigby to Ichabod Crane's office to read into some Fables as to decipher the woman's identity. Throughout the course of the game there is a small spark between Snow and Bigby - including a heart-felt conversation in a taxi {{on the way to the}} <b>Trip</b> Trap <b>Bar.</b> At the finale of {{the first episode}}, Bigby goes to interrogate the Woodsman at the aforementioned <b>Trip</b> Trap <b>Bar,</b> who is a suspect in the murder (which results in a fight between Bigby and Grendel). Bigby returns outside of the Apartments to find Snow murdered in the same fashion as the other woman.|$|R
40|$|Like {{many animals}} {{migrating}} through the oceans, sea turtles face difficult navigational tasks {{when they have}} to reach distant, specific sites. The paradigmatic case of Brazilian green turtles (Chelonia mydas), which nest on the tiny Ascension Island {{in the middle of the}} Atlantic Ocean, has often been the subject of hypotheses concerning their navigational mechanisms. To investigate their nature, we displaced 18 females from Ascension and tracked them by satellite after release from eight different points in the ocean, 60 - 450 km away from the island. Four turtles moved to Brazil soon after the release, 4 moved in various directions before heading to Brazil, and 10 reached the island. All the successful <b>trips,</b> <b>bar</b> 1, were winding but ended with a final straight segment of variable length, as if the turtles were searching for a sensory contact with the island which they obtained at various distances. The approach to Ascension mostly occurred from the direction opposite to the trade wind, suggesting a navigational role of wind-borne information originating from the island...|$|R

50|$|Low {{lighting}} {{levels may}} contribute to slips, trips and falls in the elderly by lowering visibility of hazards such as unexpected steps, or sudden changes in floor surfaces. Obstacles to a safe passage may include clutter or ill-placed furniture, which can cause a slip or a <b>trip.</b> Grab <b>bars</b> and stair rails are obvious aids but must be visible to the user, and so such environments demand strong lighting. Falls of elderly people causes {{a significant number of}} hip joint fractures, replacement of which is a serious medical event. Depending on fall configuration, other bones may be fractured. Head injury is also possible. Falls from ladders are very common among the elderly, especially men, with potentially worse injuries owing to the greater heights involved.|$|R

50|$|To make {{controllable}} {{automatic fire}} possible {{through such a}} system, designer Stechkin employs several mechanical solutions. Firstly, the slide has a very long stroke (three times {{the length of the}} cartridge). This allows time to slow the slide down and reduce felt recoil by minimising the jolt produced through the collision of the slide with the frame. Secondly, the rate-reducer lever offers extra resistance to the opening stroke of the slide, further slowing down the cycling process. Finally, the primary inertial rate reducing plunger delays the dropping of the hammer after the slide closes. The slide has a large cam that strikes a lever downwards. This lever transfers that energy to a spring-loaded weight located in the grip. The weight travels down, compressing its spring, then slams back up into the trigger <b>bar,</b> <b>tripping</b> the sear and firing the gun. Effectively, the rate reducer, which reduced the automatic rate of fire from 1000 RPM to 750RPM, also acts as the auto-sear.|$|R

Matt talks to Bennet after the interview and introduces himself (although {{this is the second time}} they'd met), but he is visibly suspicious of Bennet. He then tells Audrey that the interference he just heard [...] "sounds" [...] similar to the last sound he [...] "heard or did not hear" [...] before losing a whole day after his <b>trip</b> to a <b>bar</b> some time ago. Later on, Audrey and Matt are on a stake-out. As they sit there, Audrey thinks to herself that Matt is cute, then wonders whether he [...] "heard" [...] that. Matt smiles, asks her if she really thinks he's cute, to which she responds, [...] "I really think you're married, and I really think you love your wife" [...] and that it wasn't fair because it was just a stray thought. The light mood dies down when Matt sees the Haitian and Mr. Bennet exiting the building. He recognizes the Haitian as the last thing he saw at the bar. He attempts to read their minds, giving himself a nosebleed in the process, but is unable to get anything other than a single word: [...] "Sylar".|$|R
50|$|The Club {{received}} another {{invitation to}} Paris in 1975, {{when the three}} other teams taking part were Racing Club de Versailles, the Portuguese team Belenenses Lisbon and another French side, C.A.O. Saint-Cyr. The Club was much more prepared and organised on this occasion and the luxurious Manchester United team coach was hired for the <b>trip</b> complete with <b>bar,</b> toilet, dining tables, etc. On returning, the coach {{was used by the}} England soccer team, who were staying in Manchester prior to playing an International Match in Belfast. Skipper Mike Bishop was able to take a strong and youthful side and once again Moor won the competition with wins over Saint-Cyr (33-4) and Versailles (25-0) in the final. Wingers Charlie Beadle and David Belfield were the leading try-scorers with a total of three each over the two games. Teenager Paul Roberts, who made his first team debut in December 1974, was at full-back in both games and kicked a total of 15 points. Paul, a prodigious goal-kicker, went on to enjoy a long and successful playing career with the Club. Playing at prop in both games was Paul Barlow who now lives on Green Lane and is still a regular supporter at our home games. The Tour Manager for both the Versailles trips was Bill Maynard who organised the visits in his usual efficient manner. Racing Club de Versailles were due to visit Heaton Moor in September 1974 but the trip was called off at the eleventh hour, without a satisfactory explanation. Even the French club's President, Jean-Claude Seguier, was left in the dark as he had arrived at Green Lane having cut short a family holiday in Scotland.|$|R
