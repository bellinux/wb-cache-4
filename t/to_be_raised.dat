Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, and {{the banks of the}} Kymer canal were raised by , to allow the water level <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>raised.</b> This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>raised.</b> At the southern end, access to Burry Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> {{that the}} blockhouse's guns could not fire downriver {{and by the}} 1830s it had been decided to focus investment on the New Tavern and Tilbury forts. The blockhouse itself fell out of use as a magazine in 1834, being briefly used as a government store, and the adjacent gun platforms were sold off in 1835. The blockhouse building was subsequently demolished in 1844.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the District and the Met {{were closely}} {{associated}} {{and it was}} intended that they would soon merge. The Met's chairman and three other directors were {{on the board of}} the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies and the construction works for all of the extensions were let as a single contract.

5|$|The act {{authorised}} {{an initial}} £75,000 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> {{to pay for}} construction, together with an option to raise a further £30,000, of which £20,000 should be raised by shares of £100 each among the initial subscribers, and £10,000 by mortgaging the future income of the canal. However, this amount proved insufficient, {{and there was also}} disagreement between the shareholders as to their liability to raise the additional £20,000. As a result, a second act was sought. This received the Royal Assent on 3 March 1797, and made clear the obligations of existing shareholders to pay the extra subscription, and also authorised an additional £24,000 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>raised.</b> The second act also removed restrictions in the first act, and allowed the company to set whatever rates it chose for using the canal.|$|E

Olivia became his guardian and Dorothy spent summers with her mother and son.|$|E
5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose of the craft <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> or lowered by motion control, with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly serving in the artillery or engineers and were assigned in most part to the task of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>raised.</b> This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{decorative}} {{features of the}} building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built.

The ventilation system had thermostatic controls throughout the building, and allowed the air to be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.|$|E

The political situation remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being an}} {{artillery}} tower {{with a flat}} roof to carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery and was therefore unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s.
