She allegedly renounced the County of Jaffa {{in favor}} of her son-in-law, Walter IV of Brienne, who married her daughter, Mary, in the same year, because Walter was styled Count of Jaffa from there on. Alice (who was about forty six) married Ralph of Nesle, a younger son of Ralph, Count of Soissons, who was less than thirty {{at the time of}} the marriage in 1240.|$|E

Stephen also established a number of Benedictine monasteriesincluding the abbeys at Pécsvárad, Zalavár and Bakonybélin this period.|$|E
50|$|In Cyprus {{the title}} became so {{prevalent}} {{as to be}} permanently integrated into some Greek Christian family names, such as Hajiioannou. This was due to Cyprus being so close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Lands</b> and Jerusalem, as Cyprus became a place where Christians and Muslims intermixed freely for many centuries.|$|R
25|$|The fall of Acre {{signaled}} {{the end of}} the Jerusalem crusades. No effective crusade was raised <b>to</b> recapture <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> afterwards, though talk of further crusades was common enough. By 1291, other ideals had captured the interest and enthusiasm of the monarchs and nobility of Europe and even strenuous papal efforts to raise expeditions <b>to</b> retake <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> met with little response.|$|R

It is the earliest extant graphic account of a Christian pilgrimage. The text has numerous lacunae.|$|R
5|$|The only {{significant}} Christian {{success of the}} Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147.

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E
5|$|Although about 300 French knights {{accompanied}} him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> no influential noblemen joined him; they preferred {{participating in the}} French Albigensian Crusade or did not see him as sufficiently eminent. John's cousin, Walter of Montbéliard, joined him only after he was expelled from Cyprus. Montbéliard led a naval expedition to Egypt to plunder the Nile Delta. After most of the French crusaders left the Holy Land, John forged a new truce with Al-Adil {{by the middle of}} 1211 and sent envoys to Pope Innocent urging him to preach a new crusade.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert de Lacy (died after 1163) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Norman baron in England, the {{grandson}} of Walter de Lacy who died in 1085. Gilbert's father forfeited his English lands in 1096, and Gilbert initially only inherited the lands in Normandy. The younger de Lacy {{spent much of his}} life trying to recover his father's English lands, and eventually succeeded. Around 1158, de Lacy became a Templar and went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> where {{he was one of the}} commanders against Nur ad-Din in the early 1160s. He died after 1163.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{supported}} the king during the Becket controversy between {{the king and}} Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury and was excommunicated by the archbishop twice. One excommunication occurred when Neville imprisoned one of Becket's chaplains, William of Salisbury, for six months in Corfe Castle in connection with Becket's actions against the king. Neville was absolved from this excommunication by Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, after Neville decided to go on crusade. Becket was angered by the bishop's action, even though Foliot made the absolution contingent on Neville getting a penance from the pope on his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once he was {{sufficiently}} recovered Cragh undertook {{a pilgrimage to}} Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life. He walked barefoot on the three-day trip, wearing the rope he had been hanged with around his neck. The rope was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh {{said that he would}} make a pilgrimage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> although there is some doubt as to whether he subsequently even left Wales.

5|$|The Franciscan Order had {{a strong}} {{following}} by the 15th century; its Third Order of Saint Francis attracted women and men to local lay confraternities, such as the Confraternity of the Dry Tree in Bruges to which Anselme Adornes belonged. St Francis was closely associated with pilgrimages, then popular and most often taken to holy sites in Spain and Jerusalem. He was revered for his own pilgrimage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> in 1219; by the 15th century the Franciscans were responsible for maintaining the holy sites in Jerusalem, particularly the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{religious}} and political offices in Jerusalem were usually held by Europeans who had arrived on pilgrimage or crusade. William {{was one of the}} few natives with a European education, and he quickly rose through the ranks. After his return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> in 1165, he became canon of the cathedral at Acre. In 1167 he was appointed archdeacon of the cathedral of Tyre by Frederick de la Roche, archbishop of Tyre, with the support of King Amalric.|$|E
5|$|The preeminent prose of {{the period}} was written by Piotr Skarga, the preacher-orator. In his Sejm Sermons Skarga {{severely}} criticized the nobility and the state, while expressing his support for a system based on strong monarchy. Writing of memoirs had become most highly developed in the 17th century. Peregrination <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> by Mikołaj Radziwiłł and Beginning and Progress of the Muscovy War written by Stanisław Żółkiewski, {{one of the greatest}} Polish military commanders, are the best known examples.|$|E
50|$|During {{its height}} (c. 950-c.1130), the Cluniac {{movement}} {{was one of}} the largest religious forces in Europe. At least as significantly as their political consequences, the reforms demanded greater religious devotion. The Cluniacs supported the Peace of God, and promoted pilgrimages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Lands.</b> An increasingly rich liturgy stimulated demand for altar vessels of gold, fine tapestries and fabrics, stained glass, and polyphonic choral music <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> Romanesque churches.|$|R

5|$|The {{two main}} Christian forces that marched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> in {{response}} to Pope Eugene III and Bernard of Clairvaux's call for the Second Crusade were led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Conrad's force included Bolesław IV the Curly and Vladislaus II of Bohemia, as well as Frederick of Swabia, his nephew who would become Emperor Frederick I. The crusade had been called {{after the fall of}} the County of Edessa on 24 December 1144. The crusaders marched across Europe and arrived at Constantinople in September and October 1147.|$|E
5|$|After King Richard went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> on the Third Crusade, Nonant {{supported}} {{the efforts of}} Prince John, King Richard's brother, to seize power in England. Nonant joined with John in trying to wrest control of the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham from William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who had been named justiciar and chancellor during Richard's absence. It was probably Nonant that {{was responsible for the}} meeting at Loddon Bridge on 5 October 1191 that ended in the deposition of Longchamp from office. Nonant supported John's side throughout the time that Richard was on Crusade and in captivity, and was tried with John after Richard's return to England in 1194. Nonant was only restored to royal favour in 1195 after the payment of a fine of 5000 marks. The bishop lost his three sheriffdoms, and retired to Normandy.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Agnes-Anna, Béla {{proposed}} to Theodora, a granddaughter of Emperor Manuel I's sister, Theodora Komnene. However, a synod of the Byzantine Church forbade the marriage in 1185, because Theodora had entered a nunnery. In late 1185 or {{at the beginning of}} 1186, Béla asked for the hand of Matilda of Saxony, a daughter of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, but Henry II of England, Matilda's grandfather, hindered this marriage. Finally, Béla married Henry II's widowed daughter-in-law, Margaret of France, in the summer of 1186. She was the daughter of Louis VII of France. Queen Margaret outlived Béla, and moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> after his death.|$|E
