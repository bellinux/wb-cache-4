5|$|If {{the player}} to move has no legal move, {{the game is}} over; it is either a checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal moves) if <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> under attack, or a {{stalemate}} (a draw) if <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|E
5|$|Bertie and Lionel come {{together}} after King Edward decides to abdicate {{in order to}} marry Simpson, and Bertie becomes King George VI.

50|$|In 20 BC, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> of <b>the</b> Mahan confederacy {{demanded a}} tribute.

Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with {{the conditions that}} <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> placed somewhere between the two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.|$|E

60|$|Here was {{a pretty}} pass, indeed, thought Barney. It was {{sufficiently}} embarrassing to <b>be</b> mistaken for <b>the</b> <b>king,</b> but to <b>be</b> thrown into this false position in company with {{a beautiful young woman}} to whom <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> engaged to be married, and who, with the others, thought him to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>king,</b> <b>was</b> quite <b>the</b> last word in impossible positions.|$|R

5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for <b>the</b> <b>king,</b> <b>is</b> set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but {{it is not surprising that}} all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|A young peasant named Diermot is {{employed}} as a beater for the king's hunting party. One night the king receives a note from a messenger, requesting his services to help quell a rebellion in the remote village of Turnvale. As the king's party departs, Diermot’s pony follows them, unwittingly carrying him to the battle. When the party arrives at Turnvale they are not confronted by a peasant revolt. Instead they find a band of man-eating Skorl, led by an enchantress named Selena, the titular temptress. The king's men are defeated and <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> killed. In the process, Diermot is thrown from his saddle and is knocked unconscious. The Skorl take Diermot prisoner and imprison him in the local dungeon.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as {{the greatest of all}} the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his son. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E

60|$|This advice I pressed {{with such}} arguments, that <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> once going to {{despatch}} {{orders for the}} doing it; but to be irresolute in counsel is always the companion of a declining fortune; <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> doubtful, and could not resolve till it was too late.|$|R

5|$|In Karhide, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> {{reluctant}} {{to accept his}} diplomatic mission. In Orgoreyn, Ai is seemingly accepted more easily by the political leaders, yet Ai is arrested, stripped of his clothes, drugged, and sent to a work camp. Rescued by Estraven, the deposed Prime Minister of Karhide, Genly realizes that cultural differences—specifically shifgrethor, gender roles and Gethenian sexuality—had kept him from understanding their relationship previously. During their 80-day journey across the frozen land to return to Karhide, Ai learns to understand and love Estraven.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia is {{a federal}} {{constitutional}} elective monarchy, and the only federation in Southeast Asia. The system of government is closely modelled on that of the Westminster parliamentary system, a legacy of British colonial rule. The head of state is the Yangdi-PertuanAgong, {{commonly referred to as}} the King. <b>The</b> <b>King</b> <b>is</b> elected to a five-year term by and from among the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states; the other four states, which have titular Governors, do not participate in the selection. By informal agreement the position is systematically rotated among the nine, and has been held by Muhammad V of Kelantan since December 2016. The King's role has been largely ceremonial since changes to the constitution in 1994, picking ministers and members of the upper house.|$|E
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. <b>The</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E

5000|$|Though [...] "highly {{praised by}} his countrymen" [...] for his enlightened rule, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> assassinated by a servant of {{his eldest son}} Dawlya on 5 August 1482. Dawlya had <b>been</b> unhappy about <b>the</b> <b>king's</b> recent {{decision}} to anoint his younger half-brother Gamani as the heir apparent. <b>The</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> 52. <b>The</b> patricidal Dawlya succeeded him.|$|R
50|$|The next Laird of Drum was a {{prominent}} figure in the negotiations to ransom James I of Scotland from the English and when <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> released de Irwyne <b>was</b> knighted.

5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity. Perhaps {{it was due to}} this lukewarmness that Władysław was never able to inspire those he ruled to support, at least in any {{significant}} manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{king of the}} third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, who {{described}} himself as the Mekim of Ebla. A basalt votive statue bearing Ibbit-Lim's inscription was discovered in 1968; this helped to identify the site of Tell-Mardikh with the ancient kingdom Ebla. The name of <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> Amorite {{in the view of}} Pettinato; it is therefore probable the inhabitants of third kingdom Ebla were predominantly Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{first meeting}} of local {{commercial}} and political interests to establish a bridge was made in 1972. By 1983, it was formalized by {{the establishment of the}} company ASSkarnsundsbrua to finance construction. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1986, and construction started two years later. The main contractor was Aker; and after the bridge was finished, maintenance was taken over by the Nord-Trøndelag Public Roads Administration. The bridge cost NOK200 million. The bridge was opened by King Harald V on 19 December 1991, after he had taken the last ferry across the fjord. A monument, the King's Stone, bearing the signature of <b>the</b> <b>king,</b> <b>is</b> located at the resting place on the Mosvik side.|$|E
