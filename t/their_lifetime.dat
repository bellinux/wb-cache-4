5|$|A {{statement}} {{that can be}} made, however, is that most Americans will marry {{at least once in}} <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> with the first marriage most commonly ending in divorce. Today a little over half (52.3%) of US household include a married couple, showing a significant decrease since 1970 when 70.6% of households included a married couple. Current trends indicate that people in the US are marrying later and less often with higher divorce rates.|$|E

5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} yellowish brown {{in color and}} have a dark spot located {{in the center of}} their body. The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from a large number of plants, and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in <b>their</b> <b>lifetime.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries AD, Virgil had gained a {{reputation}} as a virtuous pagan, a term referring to pagans who were never evangelized and consequently during <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> had no opportunity to recognize Christ, but nevertheless led virtuous lives, so that it seemed objectionable to consider them damned. Eventually, some Christians sought to reconcile Virgil's works with the supposed Christianity present in them. Consequently, during the Late Antiquity and beyond, many assumed that the puer referenced in the Fourth Eclogue was actually Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in <b>their</b> <b>lifetime.</b> The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E

In 1873, driven in large part by the actions of Spinner and Clark, Congress prohibited the use of portraits of living people on any U.S. bond, security, note, or fractional or postal currency.|$|E

5|$|If {{symptoms}} develop {{during the}} acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three {{to eight weeks}} in approximately 90% of individuals. Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called indeterminate chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> (called determinate chronic Chagas disease).

5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove {{on the inside of}} the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in <b>their</b> <b>lifetime.</b> The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{estimates}} that 35% {{of women in}} the world have experienced physical or sexual violence over <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> and that the commonest situation is intimate partner violence. 30% of women in relationships report such experience, and 38% of murders of women are due to intimate partners. These figures may be as high as 70% in some regions. Risk factors include low educational achievement, a parental experience of violence, childhood abuse, gender inequality and cultural attitudes that allow violence to be considered more acceptable.|$|E

5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the vulcanoid zone is {{approximately}} 0.21AU from the Sun. More distant objects are unstable due to the gravitational influence of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales of the order of 100 million years. The inner edge is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is hot enough for evaporation of rocks to be the limiting factor in <b>their</b> <b>lifetime.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though {{the general}} public of the United States was aware of oil {{production}} in Texas, the wealth that it generated in the state {{for the first three}} decades after Spindletop was largely unknown. Of the four most prominent oil businessmen in Texas at the end of World War II— Murchison, Cullen, Richardson, and Hunt— only three articles about them appeared in the New York Times during <b>their</b> <b>lifetime,</b> despite their philanthropy and influence in Washington D.C. Stereotypes about Texas in the American imagination generally revolved around cowboys and cattle.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over <b>their</b> <b>lifetime.</b> Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E

5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} appointment, Ramon Perellos became {{very active in}} {{correcting}} cases of corruption and abuse within the Order. One such case involved the request by knights to receive graces and be nominated to the title of Gran Croce di Grazia (literally: great cross by grace). This title implied that a graced knight could replace a knight of the Great Cross upon the latter's death. This procedure was not well reputed among elder knights who spent <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> {{at the service of}} the Order, and resulted in many of them retiring to return to their homelands and leave their inheritances to their respective families, against the rules of the Order. The pleas of Perellos to eliminate such prejudicial recommendations were considered legitimate by Pope Innocent XII who agreed to forbid them.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women {{are far more likely}} to be the primary caregivers of adult family members with depression, so that they bear both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E
