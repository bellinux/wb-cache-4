5|$|In 1900 a spur {{connecting}} the branch to the up slow {{line of the}} West Coast Main Line was constructed. The water supply for locomotives at Wolverton was insufficient, so a water column was built at the intermediate station in Bradwell. Water came from the town's own source, with many houses losing their supply. On Mondays, housewives were known to shake their fists at engine drivers when <b>their</b> <b>weekly</b> wash was interrupted. Eventually drivers were forbidden from taking water from Bradwell on Mondays.|$|E
5|$|Sunday {{was not a}} work day, but {{the prisoners}} did not rest; they were {{required}} to clean the barracks and take <b>their</b> <b>weekly</b> shower. Prisoners were allowed to write (in German) to their families on Sundays. Inmates who did not speak German would trade some of their bread to another inmate for help composing their letters. Members of the SS censored the outgoing mail.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 May, a meeting was held in Southery, Norfolk. The group, {{including}} a Thomas Sindall, marched through Denver to Downham Market {{to meet with the}} magistrates at <b>their</b> <b>weekly</b> meeting at The Crown public house. Sindall was the only person known to have been at both the riots at Downham Market and Littleport. He was killed by troopers at Littleport—see below. The mob of 1,500, mainly men but some women, besieged The Crown until the magistrates agreed to allow a deputation of eight rioters inside to make their pleas: to have work and two-shillings (£) per day. The magistrates acceded to these demands, but they had already called the yeoman cavalry from Upwell, who arrived at 5pm. Backed by the troops, the Riot Act was then read in the market place by Reverend Dering, causing further tussles, which subsided after arrests started to be made.|$|E

5|$|Title changes happen {{mostly at}} NJPW-promoted events. The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin), a Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) tag team, {{defeated}} then-reigning champions No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro) on January 4, 2009, at Wrestle Kingdom III. Their reign lasted until July 5, 2009, {{when they were}} defeated by Apollo 55 (Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi) at a live event. During that time, they had three successful defenses; two were held by TNA due to a pre-existing relationship and an agreement with NJPW. Their first defense in TNA, a rematch against No Limit, occurred on March 31, 2009, at the tapings of <b>their</b> <b>weekly</b> television program TNA Impact!. On April 19, 2009, they made their second, and last, defense in TNA at the Lockdown pay-per-view event in a Three Way Tornado Tag Team Six Sides of Steel cage match against No Limit and The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide).|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{first took}} an {{interest}} in Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1924. In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began {{in the wake of his}} failed attempt to seize power in the Beer Hall Putsch of November 8–9, 1923. The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda. Hitler was sentenced to five years prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year. Goebbels was drawn to the NSDAP mostly because of Hitler's charisma and commitment to his beliefs. He joined the NSDAP around this time, becoming member number 8762. In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to Karl Kaufmann, who was Gauleiter (NSDAP district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with Gregor Strasser, a leading Nazi organizer in northern Germany, who hired him to work on <b>their</b> <b>weekly</b> newspaper and to do secretarial work for the regional party offices. He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for Rhineland-Westphalia. Members of Strasser's northern branch of the NSDAP, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich. Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.|$|E

25|$|The {{issues that}} led to the strike of 1900 were just as {{pressing}} in 1902: the union wanted recognition and a degree of control over the industry. The industry, still smarting from its concessions in 1900, opposed any federal role. The 150,000 miners wanted <b>their</b> <b>weekly</b> pay envelope. Tens of millions of city dwellers needed coal to heat their homes.|$|E

25|$|The police {{dismissed}} Police Constable Thiel, {{a prominent}} {{member of the}} force and a union organiser, for union activities. This action was a catalyst for the 1918 strike, a spark for many grievances over pay and conditions.

The day before the strike began, Police Superintendents reported at <b>their</b> <b>weekly</b> meeting with the Commissioner that all was quiet in the force.|$|E
