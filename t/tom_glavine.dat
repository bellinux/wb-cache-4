5|$|Davis was the 18th player {{taken in}} the first round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft, chosen by the New York Mets in his junior year as {{compensation}} for the Mets' loss of <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine</b> to the Atlanta Braves in free agency. He was drafted for his power bat. Baseball America ranked him the third-best college power hitter in the draft, and The New York Times indicated that he projects to hit 25–30 home runs. He signed for $1.575 million.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, {{only four}} {{pitchers}} {{have joined the}} 300win club: Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine,</b> and Johnson. Changes in {{the game in the}} last decade of the 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E
5|$|Only National League {{pitchers}} {{receive a}} Silver Slugger Award; lineups in the American League include the designated hitter, who replaces the pitcher in the batting order, so the designated hitter receives the award instead. Mike Hampton {{has won the}} most Silver Sluggers as a pitcher, earning five consecutive awards with four different teams from 1999 to 2003. <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine</b> is a four-time winner (1991, 1995–1996, 1998) with the Atlanta Braves. Rick Rhoden (1984–1986), Don Robinson (1982, 1989–1990), and Carlos Zambrano (2006, 2008–2009) each own three Silver Sluggers. Two-time winners include the inaugural winner, Bob Forsch (1980, 1987), and Fernando Valenzuela (1981, 1983), who won the Cy Young Award, the Rookie of the Year Award, and the Silver Slugger in his first full major league season. The most recent winner is Jake Arrieta.|$|E
5|$|On October 5 at Citi Field, in a 3-0 {{win over}} the {{defending}} National League Champion New York Mets in the NL Wild Card Game, Bumgarner pitched his third career postseason complete game four-hit shutout {{to give him the}} most career complete game shutouts {{in the history of the}} Wild Card Era with two. In other words, he set the Major League record for most career complete game shutout wins in winner-take-all-games, the first and only pitcher to have more than one. Bumgarner's third career postseason shutout ties him for second all-time behind Christy Mathewson's four. He also tied <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine's</b> Major League record with six career scoreless postseason starts and lowered his Major League career postseason road record to a microscopic 0.50 ERA.|$|R
5000|$|Braves fans {{had plenty}} to worry about in regard to both {{starting}} pitchers. <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine's</b> post-season career had been less than stellar, including giving up eight runs {{in the second inning}} of Game 6 of the NLCS against Pittsburgh. Entering Game 1, Glavine's career post-season record was 1-5 despite two starts where he had pitched well and only given up one earned run each time. Glavine was 0-2 in those starts. In addition to Glavine's struggles in the postseason, the Braves would be facing their nemesis from the previous postseason. In the offseason, the Blue Jays signed free agent pitcher Jack Morris to be the ace of their staff. Morris was coming off a 1991 World Series performance that saw him win series MVP and two of his three starts for the Minnesota Twins against the Braves. One of those starts was the now-famous seventh game, where Morris pitched a rare ten inning complete game shutout as the Twins rallied to win 1-0.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, Lieber was the Cubs' Opening Day starter. From June 28 to August 14, he won {{a career-high}} six {{consecutive}} decisions. On July 3, he threw a shutout, allowing two hits in a 30 victory over the Pirates. In his next start, on July 8, he had 12 strikeouts and threw a complete game in a 92 win over the White Sox. Lieber was 127 with a 4.12 ERA through his first 29 starts; however, he went 04 in September with a 5.88 ERA. In 35 starts (tied for the NL lead with Randy Johnson, Kevin Millwood, <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine,</b> and Greg Maddux), Lieber had a 1211 record, a 4.41 ERA, and 54 walks. He tied Darryl Kile for ninth in the league with 192 strikeouts, he led the league with 251 innings pitched, he ranked third in the league with 248 hits allowed (behind Liván Hernández's 254 and José Lima's 251), and he tied Maddux for third with six complete games (behind Johnson's and Curt Schilling's eight).|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} in Boston, Lee Smith's first game with St. Louis went poorly as he gave up two runs in his only inning of pitching. He {{recovered}} quickly, registered a 0.00 ERA for the entire month of July, and finished his partial season with St. Louis with a 2.10 ERA and 27 saves. The Cardinals, however, were at a low point in 1990, finishing in last place for the only time since 1918. In 1991, St. Louis righted their ship, and Smith accumulated saves at a record pace. With his salary roughly doubled to nearly $2.8 million, Smith reached 40 saves {{for the first time in}} his career. On September 28, he picked up save number 45 to tie Bruce Sutter's National League record from 1984 (Coincidentally, when Sutter and Smith reached 45 saves in their respective seasons, both were ex-Cubs pitching for St. Louis against the Cubs). Smith claimed the league record for himself three days later and finished the season with a career-high 47 saves. One difference for him in 1991 was walks as he surrendered only 1.60 walks per nine innings, by far the best in his career to that point. Smith won his first Rolaids Relief Award, received the most significant consideration for league MVP in his career, and finished second in Cy Young Award voting behind only <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine,</b> who had a breakout 20-win season in 1991.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the game, the Braves {{unveiled}} their All-Turner Field Team, as chosen on the team's website by fans: catcher Javy López, {{first baseman}} Freddie Freeman, second baseman Marcus Giles, shortstop Rafael Furcal, third baseman Chipper Jones, left fielder Ryan Klesko, center fielder Andruw Jones, right fielder Brian Jordan, utility player Martin Prado, pitchers Greg Maddux, <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine,</b> John Smoltz, Tim Hudson, and Julio Teheran, and relief pitcher Craig Kimbrel.|$|E
25|$|The first postseason {{game played}} at Turner Field was also during the 1997 season between the Braves and the Houston Astros in the NLDS. Starting pitcher Greg Maddux pitched a {{complete}} game, giving up only one run and leading the Braves to a 2–1 victory. Following {{a sweep of}} the Astros, the Braves {{went on to the}} NLCS, where <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine</b> picked up the first NLCS win at Turner Field; however, the Braves lost to the eventual-World Series-champion Florida Marlins.|$|E
25|$|On June 3, 2009, the Braves {{acquired}} Nate McLouth {{from the}} Pittsburgh Pirates for prospects Jeff Locke, Charlie Morton and Gorkys Hernández.

On July 31, 2009, {{hours before the}} trade deadline, the Braves and Boston Red Sox swapped 1st basemen: Atlanta dealt Casey Kotchman to Boston and reacquired Adam LaRoche, whom the Braves had traded away during the 2006–07 off-season to Pittsburgh.|$|E
25|$|Many modern {{baseball}} theorists {{believe that}} a new pitch will swing {{the balance of power}} back to the pitcher. A pitching revolution would not be unprecedented—several pitches have changed the game of baseball in the past, including the slider in the 1950s and 1960s and the split-fingered fastball in the 1970s to 1990s. Since the 1990s, the changeup has made a resurgence, being thrown masterfully by pitchers such as Tim Lincecum, Pedro Martínez, Trevor Hoffman, Greg Maddux, Matt Cain, <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine,</b> Johan Santana, Marco Estrada, Justin Verlander and Cole Hamels.|$|E
25|$|The {{first game}} played at Turner Field was an {{exhibition}} game against the New York Yankees on March 29, 1997; Braves starter <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine</b> threw the first pitch, a swinging fastball strike, to Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and the Braves won the exhibition game 2–0. The first regular season game played at Turner Field was on April 4, 1997 against the Chicago Cubs. The Braves were losing 4–3 {{in the eighth inning}} when Chipper Jones drove in the tying run. A Michael Tucker single gave the Braves the lead as they won their first regular season game at Turner Field 5–4.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} debut with the Braves as their opening day starter against the Cubs at Wrigley Field, beating his former {{teammates}} 10. It {{was a good}} start to another strong season. He led the NL in ERA {{for the first time}} while posting a 2010 record. Maddux won his second straight Cy Young Award, and the Braves took their rotation of Maddux, 22-game winner <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine,</b> 18-game winner Steve Avery, and 15-game winner John Smoltz to the postseason. Maddux won against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game Two of the NLCS, but with Atlanta trailing 3 games to 2, lost the decisive Game Six.|$|E
25|$|Down the stretch, Wakefield {{provided}} a boost for the playoff-bound Pirates, starting 13 games and compiling an 8–1 {{record with a}} 2.15 ERA, a performance that won him the National League Rookie Pitcher of the Year Award from The Sporting News. After winning the National League East division, the Pirates faced the Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship Series. Wakefield won both of his starts against Braves star <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine,</b> throwing a complete game 5-hitter in Game Three of the NLCS and another complete game in Game Six on three days' rest. With the Pirates leading the Braves in Game Seven, Wakefield was poised to be named NLCS MVP until the Braves rallied for 3 runs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth off Stan Belinda.|$|E
25|$|Cox {{returned}} to the dugout as manager {{in the middle of}} the 1990 season, replacing Russ Nixon. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97. They traded Dale Murphy to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach Leo Mazzone began developing young pitchers <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine,</b> Steve Avery, and John Smoltz into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB draft to select Chipper Jones, who became one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, John Schuerholz was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.|$|E

After just one relief appearance, (the first of his regular season career), Mussina returned as a starter, going 30 in his final four starts to end with 11-10 record and a career-high 5.15 ERA. The '07 season for Mussina and Mets' pitcher <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine</b> {{was the subject of}} a 2008 book by John Feinstein, Living on the Black: Two Pitchers, Two Teams, One Season to Remember, showcasing a pivotal season for two New York City pitchers as Mussina nailed down milestone career win #250 with the Yankees and Glavine earned win #300 with the cross-town Mets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine</b> of the Braves faced Darryl Kile of the Cardinals. In {{the top of}} the first, Rafael Furcal drew a leadoff walk, moved {{second on}} a groundout, and scored on Chipper Jones's single. After a double, Brian Jordan's RBI groundout made it 2–0 Braves, but Will Clark hit a three-run homer in the bottom half to put the Cards up for good. Carlos Hernández homered in the second, then in the third, the Cardinals loaded the bases on a single, double and hit-by-pitch before Eric Davis's {{sacrifice}} fly scored a run, then Ray Lankford's two-run double gave the Cardinals a commanding 7–2 lead. Glavine was finished and the Braves changed pitchers five times. Next inning, Edgar Renteria walked, stole second and scored on Jim Edmonds's double off of Andy Ashby. John Burkett hit Fernando Vina with a pitch leading off the sixth, then Edmonds's one-out RBI double made it 9–2 Cardinals. In the eighth, Andruw Jones hit a one-out home run off of Mike Timlin, then after Jones doubled, Jordan's RBI double made it 9–4 Cardinals, who got a run in the bottom half on Mark McGwire's home run off of Mike Remlinger. Matt Morris pitched a scoreless ninth to give the Cardinals a 2–0 series lead.|$|E

Loup said that when he was thirteen, [...] "My dad had me in the backyard almost every day—or at least it seemed that way. I was always doing something, whether it was pitching off the mound or hitting in the cage. I wanted to play baseball and knew that I needed to work hard to get there.

500|$|As {{the season}} wore on, Philadelphia {{developed}} momentum as a wild-card contender. The Phillies dominated the Mets in head-to-head play, posting three separate series sweeps, including a pivotal sweep of a four-game series at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia during late August which included two walk-off hits by Chase Utley and Ryan Howard and comeback victories for the Phillies {{in three of}} the four games. During the season, Burrell also hit two home runs off Wagner, resulting in two blown saves. By the time Philadelphia swept the Mets at Shea Stadium in mid-September, the Phillies were threatening to move from wild-card contender to division leader. With 17 games left to play, the Mets led the Phillies by seven games; during that final stretch, the Mets won only five games and lost twelve, while the Phillies went 13–4. On {{the final day of the}} season, the Phillies won the division, backing up Rollins' quote. Mets starter <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine</b> gave up seven runs in the first inning to the Florida Marlins, while the Phillies beat the Washington Nationals behind Eastern Pennsylvania native Jamie Moyer to win the division for the first time since 1993. Rollins capped his prediction by adding his first career Most Valuable Player award. According to Baseball Prospectus, the Mets' collapse over the end of the season ranked statistically as the second-worst in baseball history.

In the eighth inning of Game Six, Lofton had an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians won the game 40. It was described by The New York Times as [...] "the run that demoralized the Mariners." [...] Fifteen years after Lofton's crossing of home plate, the Plain Dealer recalled: [...] "Of all the electrifying moments on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995." [...] As a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland {{for the first time since}} the 1954 season. [...] "I'm glad for the city of Cleveland to be able to experience this, because they haven't experience this for a long time. The city of Cleveland has grown a lot, and it's improving, and we tried to do this for the city", Lofton said. The Indians lost the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular season with a major league-best 10044 record in the strike-shortened year. Lofton finished with a [...]200 batting average and six stolen bases in his first World Series appearance. In 2010, a few years into his retirement, Lofton stated he felt it was the toughest post-season loss of his 11 career playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike zones for Braves pitchers <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine</b> and Greg Maddux.|$|E
500|$|Before the 2007 season, Baseball America rated Humber as the fourth-best {{prospect}} in the Mets organization.

Óliver Pérez, <b>Tom</b> <b>Glavine,</b> Orlando Hernández, and John Maine were the favorites for the spots in the rotation. Veterans Aaron Sele, Chan Ho Park and Jorge Sosa were also invited to camp so that the team could be patient with former first round draft choices Humber and Mike Pelfrey, who were considered the most promising pitchers in camp. Rated the 73rd-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America prior to the 2007 season, Humber competed for {{a spot on the}} Mets roster in spring training. However, Humber was optioned to the minor leagues during spring training in 2007. Assigned to the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), Humber had an 11–9 win–loss record and 4.27 ERA in 139 innings pitched. He allowed 129 hits and walked 44 while striking out 120 batters in 25 starts. For the season, Humber finished tied for fourth in the PCL in wins and had the tenth-best ERA. He had started the season by earning the PCL Pitcher of the week for the week ending April 22. [...] That week he allowed 2 earned runs in 13 innings of work over two starts, earning a win on April 16 against the Nashville Sounds with six innings of work and suffering a blown save after seven innings against the Albuquerque Isotopes on April 21. He flirted with a no-hitter with the Zephyrs on August 22 when he entered the ninth inning without giving up a hit to the Iowa Cubs. In his subsequent start, he allowed only an unearned run on two hits over five innings, but he was removed from the game when a batted ball hit him in the shoulder.|$|E
