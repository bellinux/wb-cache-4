The net direction of this flux {{is controlled by}} insulin and leptin—if insulin is elevated, {{then there is a}} net inward flux of FFA, and only when insulin is low can FFA leave adipose tissue. Insulin secretion is stimulated by high blood sugar, which results from consuming carbohydrates.|$|E

25|$|From the {{description}} {{in terms of}} independent tosses, the statistics of the model for long lines can be understood. The line splits into domains. Each domain is of average length exp(2β). The length of a domain is distributed exponentially, since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> probability at any step of encountering a flip. The domains never become infinite, so a long system is never magnetized. Each step reduces the correlation between a spin and its neighbor by an amount proportional to p, so the correlations fall off exponentially.|$|E

25|$|In some Native Hawaiian communities, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> use of “talk story” {{which plays}} an {{essential}} role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk story can consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do a chore better or to avoid serious trouble. Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with verbal and nonverbal communication between the elder and children.|$|E
25|$|There are uncountably many {{sets that}} are not recursively enumerable, and the {{investigation}} of the Turing degrees of all sets is as central in recursion theory as {{the investigation of the}} recursively enumerable Turing degrees. Many degrees with special properties were constructed: hyperimmune-free degrees where every function computable relative to that degree is majorized by a (unrelativized) computable function; high degrees relative to which one can compute a function f which dominates every computable function g in the sense that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> c depending on g such that g(x) < f(x) for all x > c; random degrees containing algorithmically random sets; 1-generic degrees of 1-generic sets; and the degrees below the halting problem of limit-recursive sets.|$|E
25|$|Branchwidth is an {{important}} component of attempts to extend the theory of graph minors to matroid minors: although treewidth can also be generalized to matroids, and plays a bigger role than branchwidth in the theory of graph minors, branchwidth has more convenient properties in the matroid setting. Robertson and Seymour conjectured that the matroids representable over any particular finite field are well-quasi-ordered, analogously to the Robertson–Seymour theorem for graphs, but so far this has been proven only for the matroids of bounded branchwidth. Additionally, if a minor-closed family of matroids representable over a finite field does not include the graphic matroids of all planar graphs, then <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> bound on the branchwidth of the matroids in the family, generalizing similar results for minor-closed graph families.|$|E

25|$|The Robertson–Seymour theorem has an {{important}} consequence in computational complexity, due to the proof by Robertson and Seymour that, for each fixed graph G, there is a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether larger graphs have G as a minor. The running time of this algorithm can be expressed as a cubic polynomial {{in the size of}} the larger graph (although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> factor in this polynomial that depends superpolynomially on the size of G), which has been improved to quadratic time by Kawarabayashi, Kobayashi, and Reed. As a result, for every minor-closed family F, there is polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a graph belongs to F: simply check, for each of the forbidden minors for F, whether the given graph contains that forbidden minor.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> {{public debate}} about {{tracking}} students by ability into {{several types of}} secondary school (i.e. Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule). Opponents of streaming by ability claim that streaming is unfair, that parents from higher socio-economic groups are more effective in sending children of similar aptitude to higher-level schools (Gymnasium). Proponents of streaming claim that it limits income segregation {{between rich and poor}} areas, as wealthier parents in poor neighborhoods may still send their gifted children to a fairly good public school due to streaming, giving them less motivation to move to a wealthier area. They also say that potential access to a Selective school would allow gifted children of lower-class parents living in poor neighborhoods better educational opportunities than if they were confined to schools with the average pupil population of their neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|Body {{painting}} {{is not always}} large pieces on fully nude bodies, but can involve smaller pieces on displayed areas of otherwise clothed bodies. There has been a revival of body painting in Western society since the 1960s, in part prompted by the liberalization of social mores regarding nudity and often comes in sensationalist or exhibitionist forms. Even today <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> debate about the legitimacy of body painting as an art form. The current modern revival {{could be said to}} date back to the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago when Max Factor, Sr. and his model Sally Rand were arrested for causing a public disturbance when he body-painted her with his new make-up formulated for Hollywood films. Body art today evolves to the works more directed towards personal mythologies, as Jana Sterbak, Rebecca Horn, Youri Messen-Jaschin, Jacob Alexander Figueroa or Javier Perez.|$|E

25|$|Israel has a {{large number}} of {{environmental}} concerns ranging from natural hazards to man-made issues both resulting from ancient times to modern development. Natural hazards facing the country include sandstorms which sometimes occur during spring in the desert south, droughts which are usually concentrated in summer months, flash floods which create great danger in the deserts due to their lack of notice, and regular earthquakes, most of which are small, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> risk due to Israel's location along the Jordan Rift Valley. Current environmental concerns include the lack of arable land and natural fresh water resources. Whilst measures have been taken to irrigate and grow in the desert, the amount of water needed here poses issues. Desertification is also a risk possible on the desert fringe, whilst air pollution from industrial and vehicle emissions and groundwater pollution from industrial and domestic waste are also issues facing the country. Furthermore, the effects of the use of chemical fertilizers, and pesticides are issues facing the country.|$|E
25|$|There are {{sophisticated}} {{mechanisms to}} prevent cross talk in brains {{where more than}} one language is stored. The executive control system might be implicated to prevent one language from interfering with another in multilinguals. The executive control system is responsible for processes that are {{sometimes referred to as}} executive functions, and among others includes supervisory attentional system, or cognitive control. Although most research on the executive control system pertains to nonverbal tasks, {{there is some evidence that}} the system might be involved in resolving and ordering the conflict generated by the competing languages stored in the multilingual's brain. During speech production <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> need to channel attention to the appropriate word associated with the concept, congruent with the language being used. The word must be placed in the appropriate phonological and morphological context. Multilinguals constantly utilize the general executive control system to resolve interference/conflicts among the known languages, enhancing the system's functional performance, even on nonverbal tasks. In studies, multilingual subjects of all ages showed overall enhanced executive control abilities. This may indicate that the multilingual experience leads to a transfer of skill from the verbal to the nonverbal. There is no one specific domain of language modulation in the general executive control system, as far as studies reveal. Studies show that the speed with which multilingual subjects perform tasks, with and without mediation required to resolve language-use conflict, is better in bilingual than monolingual subjects.|$|E
25|$|Another {{clarification}} {{needed is}} that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> force being applied, which = m*g where m is {{the mass of the}} windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.|$|E
