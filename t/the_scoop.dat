25|$|This shot, though risky in the execution, has the {{advantage}} of being aimed at a section of the field where a fielder is rarely placed – particularly in Twenty20 and One Day International cricket where the number of outfielders is limited. However the Marillier shot is played over the batsman's shoulder to fine leg, but the basis of <b>the</b> <b>scoop</b> stroke is for the batsman to go down on one knee to a good length or slightly short-of-length delivery off a fast or medium paced bowler and scoop the ball over the head of the wicket-keeper. <b>The</b> <b>scoop</b> shot is a risky shot to play as the improper execution of this shot may lead to a catch being offered. One famous example of <b>the</b> <b>scoop</b> backfiring is of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final when Pakistan were 152/9 and needed 6 runs off 4 balls and Misbah-ul-Haq improperly executed this shot resulting in a catch to Sreesanth.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{analytical}} method of human motion by image processing {{to make a}} model of <b>the</b> <b>scooping</b> process, Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>scooping</b> tool is <b>the</b> spoon, and while <b>the</b> <b>scooping</b> process is performing, {{the movement of the}} mouth center position and the spoon top position are measured by two cameras. As the amount of substance is over the uppermost area of the cup, the spoon is stuck obliquely into substance. Then the spoon is rotated and lifted up to the mouth. Secondly, we recognize the mouth center from the characteristic of the face image data and calculate the spoon top position to extract two points on the spoon handle from the time series images by two cameras. Finally, we describe the method of recognizing the coordinate of the mouth center and estimating the coordinate of the spoon top to analyse <b>the</b> <b>scooping</b> process...|$|R

25|$|An {{ice cream}} scoop is any {{specialized}} spoon used to dish and serve ice cream. Most ice cream scoops are hemispherical-shaped and contain a mechanical device {{to force the}} ice cream out of <b>the</b> <b>scoop.</b> The ice cream scoop was invented by African-American Alfred L.

5000|$|A scoop {{splashdown}} is {{an element}} in which each train is equipped with two tubes - called <b>scoops</b> - on <b>the</b> rear sides of each train. <b>The</b> <b>scoops</b> are angled upwards, causing water to spray as the train passes close to a body of water. A number of Bolliger & Mabillard coasters feature the element, such as Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa, and Diamondback at Kings Island. Depending on {{the width of the}} train and the angle of <b>the</b> <b>scoops,</b> <b>the</b> effect can produce different results, such as two distinct streams (Griffon) or one large plume (Diamondback).|$|R

25|$|The Robotic Arm (RA) is {{designed}} to extend 2.35 m from its base on the lander, and {{has the ability to}} dig down to 0.5 m below the surface. It took samples of dirt and ice that were analyzed by other instruments on the lander. The arm was designed and built for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory by Alliance Spacesystems, LLC (now MDA US Systems, LLC) in Pasadena, California. A rotating rasp-tool located in the heel of <b>the</b> <b>scoop</b> was used to cut into the strong permafrost. Cuttings from the Rasp were ejected into the heel of <b>the</b> <b>scoop</b> and transferred to the front for delivery to the instruments. The Rasp tool, also called the Icy Soils Acquisition Device (ISAD), was conceived of at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The flight version of the Rasp was designed and built by HoneyBee Robotics in Manhattan NY. Commands were sent for the arm to be deployed on May 28, 2008, beginning with the pushing aside of a protective covering intended to serve as a redundant precaution against potential contamination of Martian subsoil by Earthly life-forms.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe present {{details of}} the {{development}} of a conceptual framework for systems engineering in a context of Systemic Cooperation, henceforth <b>the</b> <b>SCOOPs</b> model, begun at the International Federation for Systems Research (IFSR) ‘Conversation’ held in Linz in 2014. The authors constitute a group convened by the IFSR with joint sponsorship between the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) Systems Science Working Group (SSWG) and the International Society for the Systems Sciences (ISSS). The 2014 IFSR working group continued with the development of the Systems Praxis Framework (SPF), the product of the previous IFSR conversation in 2012, and focused on a pragmatic framing of Systems Engineering within its wider context. In presenting the {{details of the}} development of <b>the</b> <b>SCOOPs</b> model, we review relevant foundational work in addition to the SPF leading to a critical discussion of its implications for the theoretical underpinnings and practice of Systems Engineering. This is not a final articulation of <b>the</b> <b>SCOOPs</b> model, but a report on an important milestone in its ongoing development...|$|R
25|$|One {{method to}} confirm that the bra is the best fit has been nicknamed the Swoop and Scoop. After {{identifying}} a well-fitting bra, the woman bends forward (the swoop), allowing their breasts to fall into the bra, filling the cup naturally, and then fastening the bra on the outermost set of hooks. When the woman stands up, she uses the opposite hand to place each breast gently into the cup (<b>the</b> <b>scoop),</b> and she then runs her index finger along the inside top edge of the bra cup to make sure her breast tissue does not spill over the edges.|$|E
25|$|The Torino GT was {{relatively}} unchanged from 1968, {{and continued to}} come standard with a 302-2V engine. The grille received minor updates, including revised divider bars and the GT emblem moved to the lower left corner of the grille. The 'C' stripe was revised, and now ran in straight lines, rather than following the body line like in 1968. All 1969 Torino GT's came equipped a non-functional fibreglass hood scoop that had turn signal indicators {{at the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>scoop</b> (this was optional on non-Ram Air Cobras). This scoop became functional if the 428-4V with Ram Air induction was specified. The hood scoop could also be deleted from the GT for a credit. Although the Torino GT could be optioned to include all of the Cobra's performance features, the GT was a more upscale vehicle and had the more deluxe Torino trim.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mentions}} of the My Lai massacre {{appeared in}} the American media after Fort Benning's vague press release concerning the charges pressed against Lieutenant Calley, which was distributed on September 5, 1969. Consequently, NBC aired on September 10, 1969 a segment in the Huntley-Brinkley Report which mentioned {{the murder of a}} number of civilians in South Vietnam. Following that, emboldened Ronald Ridenhour decided to disobey the Army's order to withhold the information from the media. He approached reporter Ben Cole of the Phoenix Republic, who chose not to handle <b>the</b> <b>scoop.</b> Charles Black from the Columbus Enquirer uncovered the story on his own but also decided to put it on hold. Two major national news press outlets—The New York Times and The Washington Post, received some tips with partial information but did not act on them.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} this is mouse gesture trackings, where the motion of the mouse is {{correlated}} to a symbol being drawn by a person's hand, as is the Wii Remote or the Myo armband or the mForce Wizard wristband, which can study changes in acceleration over time to represent gestures. Devices such as the LG Electronics Magic Wand, the Loop and <b>the</b> <b>Scoop</b> use Hillcrest Labs' Freespace technology, which uses MEMS accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors to translate gestures into cursor movement. The software also compensates for human tremor and inadvertent movement. AudioCubes are another example. The sensors of these smart light emitting cubes can be used to sense hands and fingers as well as other objects nearby, and can be used to process data. Most applications are in music and sound synthesis, but can be applied to other fields.|$|E

500|$|Escapement, hydraulic-powered (use in clockworks): Although the {{escapement}} mechanism was first invented by the Greek Philon of Byzantium for a mechanical washstand, an {{escapement mechanism}} for clockworks was first {{developed by the}} Buddhist monk, court astronomer, mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) for his water-powered celestial globe {{in the tradition of}} the Han dynasty polymath and inventor Zhang Heng (78–139), and could be found in later Chinese clockworks such as the clock towers developed by the military engineer Zhang Sixun (fl. late 10th century) and polymath inventor Su Song (1020–1101). Yi Xing's escapement allowed for a bell to be rung automatically every hour, and a drum beaten automatically every quarter-hour, essentially a striking clock. Unlike the modern escapement which employs a suspended oscillating pendulum resting and releasing its hooks on a small rotating gear wheel, the early Chinese escapement employed the use of gravity and hydraulics. In Su Song's clock tower, scoop containers fixed to the spokes of a vertical waterwheel (which acted like a gear wheel) would be filled one by one with siphoned water from a clepsydra tank. When the weight of the water in <b>the</b> <b>scoop</b> filled to an excess, it overcame a counterweight that in turn tripped a lever allowing <b>the</b> <b>scoop</b> to rotate on a pivot and drain its water. However, as <b>the</b> <b>scoop</b> fell, it tripped a coupling tongue that temporarily pulled down on a long vertical chain, the latter yanking down on a balancing lever which would pull upward on a small chain connected to a locking arm, the latter lifting momentarily to release the top arrested spoke before coming back down to repeat the entire process over again. It should be pointed out that the Chinese intermittently working liquid-driven escapement had [...] "only the name in common" [...] with the true mechanical escapement of medieval European mechanical clocks of the 14th century onwards, which worked instead with weights, producing continuous but discrete beats and that derived from the Greek and Roman verge mechanism (alarum) [...] device of earlier mechanisms.|$|E
