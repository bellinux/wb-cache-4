5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>chemistry</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group. <b>The</b> <b>chemistry</b> of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a high melting point (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.|$|E
