The papillon door, slightly different in its architecture from a gullwing door – designed by Jean Bugatti in 1939 Type 64, 14 years before Mercedes-Benz produced its similar, famous 300SL gullwing door – is a precursor, but is often overlooked when discussing gull-wing design.

5000|$|The {{following}} {{types of}} sex swing exist: traditional <b>swing,</b> <b>door</b> <b>swing,</b> body swing, and fantasy swing. The body swing is suspended from one partner's body. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swing</b> {{is mounted on}} a <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> fantasy <b>swing</b> is suspended from an eye bolt in the ceiling. In popular culture, sex swing is mostly associated with BDSM practices.|$|R

2500|$|A {{model for}} this is the hinges on a door. When the door is shut, the hinges are flush against the wall.

5000|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> {{stay within}} <b>the</b> car's track {{throughout}} their range of movement, they are useful when parking in tight spaces. A gullwing door style offers similar visibility, but <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>swing</b> out from <b>the</b> car's area slightly.|$|R

60|$|It is {{difficult}} to wash in these little places, because the cars shake so; {{and when you have}} got both your hands and half your head in the basin, and are unable to protect yourself, the sides of the room, and the water-tap and the soap-dish, and other cowardly things, take a mean advantage of your helplessness to punch you as hard as ever they can; and when you back away from these, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> open and slaps you from behind.|$|E
6000|$|A little {{north of}} the town of Sligo, on the {{southern}} side of Ben Bulben, some hundreds of feet above the plain, is a small white square in the limestone. No mortal has ever touched it with his hand; no sheep or goat has ever browsed grass beside it. There is no more inaccessible place upon the earth, and few more encircled by awe to the deep considering. It is the door of faery-land. In the middle of night it swings open, and the unearthly troop rushes out. All night the gay rabble sweep to and fro across the land, invisible to all, unless perhaps where, in some more than commonly [...] "gentle" [...] place--Drumcliff or Drum-a-hair--the nightcapped heads of faery-doctors may be thrust from their doors to see what mischief the [...] "gentry" [...] are doing. To their trained eyes and ears the fields are covered by red-hatted riders, and the air is full of shrill voices--a sound like whistling, as an ancient Scottish seer has recorded, and wholly different from the talk of the angels, who [...] "speak much in the throat, like the Irish," [...] as Lilly, the astrologer, has wisely said. If there be a new-born baby or new-wed bride in the neighbourhood, the nightcapped [...] "doctors" [...] will peer with more than common care, for the unearthly troop do not always return empty-handed. Sometimes a new-wed bride or a new-born baby goes with them into their mountains; <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> to behind, and the new-born or the new-wed moves henceforth in the bloodless land of Faery; happy enough, but doomed to melt out at the last judgment like bright vapour, for the soul cannot live without sorrow. Through this door of white stone, and the other doors of that land where geabheadh tu an sonas aer pighin ("you can buy joy for a penny"), have gone kings, queens, and princes, but so greatly has the power of Faery dwindled, that there are none but peasants in these sad chronicles of mine.|$|E

60|$|He turned abruptly, {{as though}} he feared his {{resolution}} might fail him, {{and it was not}} until Violet heard <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swing</b> to behind him that she realized she was alone.

25|$|Since its closure, {{reports of}} unexplained clanging sounds, screams, and crying {{have often been}} {{reported}} in the prison blocks. Unexplained footsteps and moaning have been reported in both A and B blocks. C-Block is reputedly haunted by the spirit of former inmate Abie Maldowitz (nicknamed Butcher) who was murdered in the laundry room. On September 5, 1984, a ranger spent the night alone on the island and was awakened by a heavy <b>door</b> <b>swinging</b> in C-Block, but found no cause for it; <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swinging</b> continued on other nights.|$|R
60|$|With oaths {{and threats}} the mob, brainless and heartless, cowardly, bestial, {{filled with the}} lust for blood, pushed and jammed into the narrow {{corridor}} before <b>the</b> cell <b>door</b> where <b>the</b> two prisoners awaited their fate.

50|$|As Billings {{finishes}} his story {{and starts to}} leave, Harper recommends he make an appointment with the nurse for further discussion.

50|$|As the {{survivors}} discuss finding water, {{a knock at}} the door is heard. Sugisaka opens it to find the hijacker lying on the ground with a big scar on his forehead. The survivors carry the hijacker inside and dress his wound. Tokiyasu then uses the rifle to force everyone out of the plane and locks himself safely inside, with the hijacker. Right after, Tokiyasu's screams are heard and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> open. Everyone rushes inside to find Tokiyasu dead, drained of all blood. The hijacker appears and carries Noriko off to the spaceship. At sunrise, Noriko is seen standing on a ridge. She speaks, but with the voice of the alien, the Gokemidoro. It is revealed that the Gokemidoro has invaded the earth, intending to eradicate the human race. Noriko then plunges off the ridge, shriveling into a cadaver.|$|E
50|$|Some time later, Negan is bathing {{and having}} his hair cut by Olivia outside his cell door. After finishing, Negan {{walks back to}} his cell at gunpoint from Andrea, who calls him a 'fucking monster,' much to Negan's amusement. Olivia then {{proceeds}} to lock the door, and they both leave Negan alone. However, it turns out Olivia didn't lock Negan's cell properly as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> open, which Negan notices. However, Negan decides not to escape and remains in his cell with the door open until Rick comes downstairs, then taunts him about the numerous ways he could have destroyed Alexandria without anyone realizing, but claimed to stay as sign of good faith and an offering to amend their trust. As Rick locks up the cage and leaves, Negan taunts him again by stating the only reason he's alive is so Rick can prove to himself that he's still a good person, and that he wants everyone else to believe {{he is the only}} one who can fix the world.|$|E
50|$|A trio {{of young}} people sort through old {{belongings}} in a shack, in a similar style to the one featured in The Evil Dead, at night. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> open, and they find a box containing the 'Would You Love a Monsterman?' doll and a tape, which starts to play when they plug it in. The male is throttled by an invisible force, (which is actually band member Kalma, complete with top hat, when seen through the super 8 film camera he drops). One of the females is also dragged into the closet to her doom, by the guitarist, Amen. The band then appears, and, magically chaining the second female to a rocking chair, continue to sing the song. Her friends appear again, as zombies (with the female mirroring the deadite Linda from The Evil Dead), later in the song. The band continues until the cassette player is unplugged by the second female's struggling foot. The band and zombies disappear. As she looks around, relieved, Mr. Lordi attacks her from behind (seen {{through the lens of}} the camera) just as the camera runs out of film.|$|E
