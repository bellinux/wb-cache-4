50|$|Chamberlain's {{scope for}} {{manoeuvre}} was restricted between 1880 and 1883 by the Cabinet's preoccupation with Ireland, Transvaal Colony and Egypt, {{but he was}} able to introduce the Grain Cargoes Bill, for the safer transportation of grain, an Electric Lighting Bill, enabling municipal corporations to establish electricity supplies, and a Seaman's Wages Bill, which ensured a fairer system of payment for seamen. After 1883, Chamberlain was more productive. A Bankruptcy Bill established a Board of Trade Bankruptcy Department for inquiring into failed business deals. A Patents Bill subjected patenting to Board of <b>Trade</b> <b>supervision.</b> Chamberlain also sought to end the practice of ship owners overinsuring their vessels - 'coffin ships' - while under-manning them, ensuring a healthy profit whether the ship arrived safely or sank. Despite being endorsed by Tory Democrats Lord Randolph Churchill and John Eldon Gorst, the Liberal government was unwilling to grant Chamberlain its full support and the Bill was withdrawn in July 1884.|$|E
40|$|Since 1 January 2001, German {{hospitals}} and establishments engaged in outpatient surgery {{are obliged to}} continually record and evaluate nosocomial infections {{and the emergence of}} nosocomial pathogens showing special resistance and multi-resistance profiles. A survey conducted among 164 hospitals revealed that 79 % of establishments already carried out separate surveillance and evaluation of postoperative wound infections, while 77 % also recorded nosocomial infections and 91 % recorded pathogens with special resistance and multi-resistance profiles. However, only the larger hospitals had their own in-house infection control physician, while the smaller establishments generally consulted external infection control physicians. When asked how long such experts made their services available to the hospitals, no clear answer was given. Furthermore, only two-thirds of hospitals had their own infection control nurses (most of whom worked part time). These findings have induced the State Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL) in Bavaria to expand its advisory and information services and to formulate standards in consultation with partners at state level. The public health offices are legally obliged to supervise infection control policies in {{hospitals and}} medical establishments. These supervisory activities have not always been conducted in a uniform manner, thus engendering anxiety among the institutions to be supervised when it comes to discharging their prescribed duties. A concept devised to improve and standardize the monitoring of hospital hygiene is to be used to standardize supervision of infection control practices (by the statutory authorities). With the incorporation of the, hitherto, State Office for Occupational Safety, Occupational Medicine and Safety Engineering into the LGL, the specialist centers for public health and the Trade Supervisory Office will be united under one umbrella. The idea is to avail of the resulting improved cooperation possibilities, so as to avoid duplication of effort as regards the overlapping areas of medical and <b>trade</b> <b>supervision</b> and limit contradictory commentaries and avoid a situation whereby several public health officials have to pay visits to the various establishments. This will also reinforce partnerships between medical establishments and the public health authorities at local level. Some thirty years ago, while the present author could possibly dream of such an outcome when he took his first steps into the, at times arduous, terrain of hospital hygiene, he probably would not have dared to express it...|$|E

30|$|China’s coal {{administrative}} supervision system and coal industry production system had been repeatedly {{changed with the}} characteristics of frequently separating and integrating in turn after long intervals (Yan 2009). Premier Zhou firstly put forward the policy of “safety first” in the first national coal conference in 1949 and then the Ministry of Fuel Industry was established which managed coal, electricity and oil industry. In 1953, the Technical Supervision Bureau was established which was subordinate to the Ministry of Fuel Industry, it marked the initial formation of coal mine safety management system, “administrative management, <b>trade</b> union <b>supervision</b> and labor department inspection”. In July 1955, the Ministry of Coal Industry and its subordinate Safety Supervision Bureau were established by withdrawing the Ministry of Fuel Industry in the second session of the first National People’s Congress. But coal mine safety supervision had not been paid enough attention in the actual coal production, especially {{in the period of}} “Great Leap Forward” and “Cultural Revolution”, which was interrupted (Wang 2004).

On May 11, 1921 the High Commissioner's Office agreed to his proposed expenditure of 18,000 Swiss francs for the purchase of the library. Carathéodory organized the library according to the current European standards and thus he initiated cooperation with one of Leipzig’s most prominent book catalog agencies.

Some work proceeded on the final section, but the Company was in serious financial difficulty and the contractor Watson, Smith and Watson went bankrupt in 1885; they may have been working for credit.

40|$|On April 16, 2010 the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil {{complaint}} against Goldman Sachs in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that Goldman violated the anti-fraud {{provisions of the}} federal securities laws, {{in connection with a}} 2007 synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) transaction, ABACUS 2007 -AC 1 SPV (ABACUS). Goldman agreed a $ 500 million settlement with the SEC on July 15, 2010. We analyze the ABACUS transaction and the SEC's {{complaint against}} Goldman Sachs in the context of recent technological changes within the investment banking market. Investment banking was historically a relationship-based business, sustained by reputationally intermediated tacit contracts. Recent advances in information technology and financial economics have codified many formerly tacit elements of investment banking. As a result, some investment banking deals are now transacted at arm's length, and rely more upon formal contracts; we argue that, for this type of deal, there is a stronger case for legal rules regulating the investment bank-counterparty relationship. However, some deals continue to be arbitrated by tacit rules and norms and, for these deals, legal rules are less appropriate, because it is very hard for a third party to ascertain tacit understandings made {{in the context of a}} long-lived relationship. An attempt to introduce legal rules into reputationally intermediated relationships may even impair the counterparties' ability to arrive at informal arrangements, and so to <b>trade.</b> The <b>supervision</b> of deals like ABACUS should therefore reflect the extent to which they are transactional or relational; we argue that in neither case is there justification for the application of legal rules or the gap-filling standard of fiduciary duties...|$|R
40|$|Selected {{issues of}} unfair {{competition}} and legal protection against such conduct The purpose of my thesis is to analyse {{one of the}} most frequent unfair competition practice, the misleading advertising and the possibilities of legal protection against this practice. The thesis is composed of six chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of unfair competition. The first chapter describes various attempts on the definition of the economic competition and explains the terms as economic aspect and benefit. The legal regulation of the economic competition includes direct and indirect regulation. Indirect regulation is based on exclusion of certain items or goods from the <b>trading</b> and on <b>supervision</b> of another category of items. Direct regulation is devided into antitrust law, that prevents elimination, restriction or another violation of economic competition, and into competition law, that prohibits the competitors from using unfair practices in the battle for customer.

One of the most essential elements of an unfair competition, the "general clause" concept, is outlined in this chapter by characterization of its attributes and its relationship to special states of facts of an unfair competition.

40|$|This is the {{introductory}} chapter to an NBER conference volume that examined the {{lessons to be}} drawn from the financial and currency crises of the late 1990 s. The paper does not attempt to summarize the specific content of that meeting but provides the author's personal conclusions about crisis prevention and management. The first part of the paper deals with policies of the emerging market economies that affect the likelihood of crises, including exchange rate regimes, capital account convertibility, foreign exchange liabilities and reserves, domestic credit structure, and financial supervision. The paper then considers policies of industrial countries that affect the risk of crises in emerging market economies, including exchange rate instability, interest rates, banking <b>supervision,</b> <b>trade</b> policy, and the provision of a lender of last resort facility. The second half of the paper deals with the way that the crises were managed by the IMF and attempts to answer the following questions: (1) Have the crises been resolved, permitting the crisis countries to return to solid economic growth and to achieve renewed access to international capital markets? (2) Did the IMF stabilization policies resolve the crisis with as little economic pain as possible? (3) Did the agreed structural reforms actually occur and, if so, were they successful? (4) How did the experience of the crisis countries affect the incentives of lenders, borrowers, and countries facing crises in the future? (5) Were the actions of the IMF politically legitimate for an international agency? (6) What were the political consequences of the crises and the policies that followed?...|$|R

40|$|The {{immediate}} {{catalyst for}} the crisis was the reversal in 2006 of the US housing market boom, and the resulting collapse {{in the value of}} Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) widely held by financial institutions not only in the USA, but worldwide. The global financial crisis of 2008 followed by a global economic recession would not have happened with the same severity if there were up to date financial regulations and vigilant oversight in place. The crisis calls for internationally coordinated reforms in the regulatory system, which fully incorporated macro risks and reconsidered some of the products of financial engineering as well as new resolution rules for big non-bank financial institutions. The reactions of governments and the fiscal and monetary policies they followed were swift and unprecedented in size and introduced elements of a new central banking. Thus despite recent actions to save the banking sector, very serious downside risks remain and spread to banks balance sheets all over the world through stock exchanges. This was soon reflected in retrenchment on lending where it was led to downward pressure on business investments which directed to collapse in giant businesses. Then it has been transmitted to Asian countries and then to developing countries via different modes. Hence, even with the crisis far from over, it is already evident that a number of lessons and questions for economic policy management and crisis response should be placed on the table for discussion. This research has been commissioned to identify whether the recessional hit has transmitted to Sri Lanka which is an Asian developing country after the study of the root courses of the global financial crisis initiatives in 2006. Further, it has been developed a transmission mechanism of the financial crisis from US to the Sri Lankan economy via GDP. The study identifies three mechanisms or channels that {{played a key role in}} spreading the consequences of the financial crisis to Sri Lanka; reduction in capital inflows in terms of FDI, reduction in export revenue and changes in exchange rates play a significant role in that context. Moreover, it was investigated the effects due to transmission of financial crisis as high deficit in Balance of Payment, increasing rates of unemployment and decline of performance of local stock market. This study has provided some broad policies and recommendations at the national level which give an overview that the way it has to be counteracted to mitigate recessional penalties under the same conditions in the future. The recommendations have been discussed under seven criteria which are strengthening risk management, strengthening corporate governance, strengthening capital and strengthening liquidity, consolidation of <b>supervision,</b> <b>trade</b> policy and other factors to be concerned...|$|R
