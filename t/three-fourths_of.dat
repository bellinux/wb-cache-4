5|$|Having been {{approved}} by the requisite <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> the several states, there being 14 States in the Union at the time (as Vermont had been admitted into the Union on March 4, 1791), the ratification of Articles Three through Twelve was completed and they became Amendments 1 through 10 of the Constitution. President Washington informed Congress of this on December 30, 1791.|$|E
5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} Electoral College by constitutional amendment have been introduced in Congress over the decades. These efforts have, however, been hampered {{by the fact that}} a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate are required to send an amendment to the states, where ratification by <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> the State legislatures or by conventions in three fourths of the states is required for it to become operative.|$|E

5|$|The 21 grams {{experiment}} {{refers to}} a scientific study published in 1907 by Duncan MacDougall, a physician from Haverhill, Massachusetts. MacDougall hypothesized that souls have physical weight, and attempted to measure the mass lost by a human when the soul departed the body. MacDougall attempted to measure the mass change of six patients {{at the moment of}} death. One of the six subjects lost <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> an ounce (21.3 grams).|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} met on October 25, 1933, and adjourned that day. It elected C. O’Connor Goolrick as its presiding officer. To answer Congressional legislation, it {{ratified the}} 21st Amendment repealing the 18th Amendment {{so as to}} allow the sale of alcoholic beverages. The 21st Amendment is the only amendment that required state convention ratification as of that time. The Amendment was ratified nationally by <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> the states on December 5, 1933.|$|E
5|$|The era of import {{substitution}} ended in 1976, {{but at the}} same time growing government spending, large wage increases and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s. The measures enacted during the last dictatorship also contributed to the huge foreign debt by the late 1980s, which became equivalent to <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> the GNP.|$|E

5|$|Under Arizona laws, {{a county}} {{shall not be}} formed or divided by county {{initiative}} unless each proposed county would {{have all of the}} following characteristics: (1) at least <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> one percent of the total state assessed valuation and at least the statewide per capita assessed valuation; (2) a population of at least <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> one percent of the total state population {{according to the most recent}} United States decennial census; (3) at least one hundred square miles of privately owned land; (4) common boundaries with either (a) at least three other existing or proposed counties; or (b) at least two other existing or proposed counties and the state boundary. A county formation commission is required to be formed to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed county. A proposal to divide a county must be approved by a majority of the votes cast in each proposed new county.|$|E
5|$|Federally, Boston {{is split}} between two congressional districts. The {{northern}} <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> {{the city is}} in the 7th district, represented by Mike Capuano since 1998. The southern fourth is in the 8th district, represented by Stephen Lynch. Both are Democrats; a Republican has not represented {{a significant portion of}} Boston in over a century. The state's senior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Elizabeth Warren, first elected in 2012. The state's junior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Ed Markey, who was elected in 2013 to succeed John Kerry after Kerry's appointment and confirmation as the United States Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{ratified}} by the legislatures of <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> the several states (27 of the 36 states, including those {{that had been in}} rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to all intents and purposes, {{as a part of the}} Constitution. Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings attached. Seward accepted their affirmative votes and brushed aside their interpretive declarations without comment, challenge or acknowledgment.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 12 mm. The forewings are blackish with a moderately broad irregular-edged ochreous-whitish dorsal streak {{from the base}} to the tornus, its upper edge rather triangular-prominent at the middle and <b>three-fourth</b> <b>of</b> the length. There is a short oblique ochreous-white streak from the costa at four-fifths and a triangular clear white spot occupying the lower two-thirds of the termen. The hindwings are grey.|$|R
50|$|Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri visited Hyderabad and {{requested}} the Nizam {{to contribute to}} the National Defence Fund, set up {{in the wake of the}} Indo-Chinese skirmish. Mir Osman Ali announced that he would contribute five tonnes of gold to augment the war fund.

50|$|In 2010, the city's GDP rose 18.5% to RMB 78.1 billion, ranked {{fourth in}} Heilongjiang Province after Harbin, Daqing and Qiqihar. Tourist {{industry}} and light manufacturing are the mainstays of Mudanjiang's economy. Mudanjiang's pillar industries include accessory industry for automobiles, paper making, forest industry, petrochemicals, new materials, pharmacy and energy industry. The foreign trade value increased 71.8% to US$9 billion in 2010, making up <b>three-fourth</b> <b>of</b> Heilongjiang Province's gross.|$|R
5|$|In 1882, {{there were}} 32 soap {{factories}} and 400 looms exporting their products throughout the Middle East. Nablus exported <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> its soap — the city's most important commodity — to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, {{as well as}} linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported by Nablus merchants to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Tornado was {{the clear}} favorite. Georgia Tech outplayed Vanderbilt {{and had the}} ball for <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> the game. Several of Vanderbilt's players left with injuries. Its ends were easily skirted by the Tech backs Buck Flowers, Red Barron, and Frank Ferst. Tech's first {{touchdown}} came when Barron ripped off a 55-yard run. Captain Flowers once made a drop kick from 44 yards out. Ferst came in for Flowers {{in the middle of}} the second quarter when Georgia Tech started to use substitutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the tomb}} monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine notary, in 1424 (by the Florentine calendar) part of the tomb was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> the 800florin budget had been spent. To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E
50|$|During the 19th century, Roubaix {{acquired}} an international reputation for textile industry and wool production. In the 1970s and 1980s, international competition and automation caused an industrial decline {{and resulted in}} the closure of many factories. From that moment on and since {{the implementation of the}} French urban policy in the early 1980s, around <b>three-fourth</b> <b>of</b> the town's territory has been regularly assigned specific zoning designations as well as health and welfare plans.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-13 mm. The forewings are {{brown with}} the extreme costal edge ochreous-whitish. The discal stigmata is hardly darker, edged above by crescentic whitish marks, with the plical rather obliquely {{before the first}} discal, cloudy, dark fuscous, edged on each side with white. There is {{a more or less}} obscurely indicated pale ochreous somewhat angulated shade from <b>three-fourth</b> <b>of</b> the costa to the tornus. The hindwings are rather light grey.|$|R
30|$|The ‘Khasi hill sal’ forest {{showed a}} mixed {{dominance}} of S. robusta and S. wallichii and co-dominance of P. kesiya and C. arborea. These species respectively had a density of 197.3, 133.3, 50.8 and 40.6 individuals ha− 1, a basal area of 4.0, 3.5, 2.1 and 0.7  m 2 [*]·[*]ha− 1, and an IVI of 58.2, 48.2, 23.3 and 14.5 (Table  3). In sal forests, mixed dominance {{of two or}} more species is not common as S. robusta alone weaves the framework of the forest. S. robusta commanded <b>three-fourth</b> <b>of</b> IVI in Kamrup (Deka et al. [2012]), <b>three-fourth</b> <b>of</b> density in Gorakhpur (Pandey and Shukla [2003]), two-third of IVI in Hojai (Dutta and Devi [2013 a]), one-half of IVI in eastern Himalayan terai (Kushwaha and Nandy [2012]), and one-third of density in Tripura (Majumdar et al. [2014]) and Doboka (Dutta and Devi [2013 b]). Mixed dominance of species in a sal-dominated forest occurs in Darjeeling (Shankar [2001]). S. wallichi as second or third dominant species occurs in eastern Himalayan terai (Shankar [2001]; Kushwaha and Nandy [2012]), Garo Hills (Kumar et al. [2006]), Kamrup (Deka et al. [2012]) and Tripura (Majumdar et al. [2014]).|$|R
5|$|The {{requirements}} for establishing a bank under this grant of authority, demanded {{that at least}} <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> {{the board of directors}} lived in Puerto Rico at least for a year. It took the group two years to meet these regulations, but in 1902 the First National Bank of Porto Rico was inaugurated, with Andrés Crosas from San Juan serving as its president. The bank began issuing notes in denominations of 10, 20, 50 and 100 dollars which were manufactured by October 27, 1902, even before all of the requirements were met.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{have affected}} Florida in every {{month of the}} year but March. Nearly one-third of the cyclones affected the state in September, and nearly <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> the storms affected the state between August and October, which coincides with the peak of the hurricane season. Portions of the coastline have the lowest return period, or the frequency at which a certain intensity or category of hurricane can be expected within 86mi (139km) of a given location, in the country. Monroe County was struck by 26 hurricanes since 1926, which is the greatest total for any county in the United States.|$|E

30|$|According to Virchow’s {{classical}} triad (Virchow 1856), thrombus pathogenesis {{depends on}} {{factors related to}} components of the vessel wall (endothelial injury or dysfunction); of the velocity of blood flow (stasis/turbulence); and of the blood consistency (hypercoagulability). Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), consequential to pathologic thrombus formation, is regarded to result from one or, more frequently, more abnormalities related to these factors; and {{remains one of the}} main preventable causes of death (Heit 2015). In-hospital cases account for about <b>three-fourth</b> <b>of</b> the VTE-related fatalities (Cohen et al. 2007).|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13-16 mm. The forewings {{are light}} greyish-ochreous, irrorated with fuscous except towards the costa anteriorly. There {{is a small}} blackish dot {{on the base of}} the costa and the stigmata is moderate, blackish and obscurely whitish-edged, the plical beneath the first discal. There is a faint pale greyish-ochreous slightly curved shade from <b>three-fourth</b> <b>of</b> the costa to the dorsum before the tornus and there is a row of blackish dots around the apex and termen. The hindwings are rather dark grey.|$|R
5|$|The total {{populations of}} the bohor reedbuck are {{estimated}} to be above 100,000. Though the populations are decreasing, it is not sufficiently low to meet the Near Threatened criterion. Thus, the IUCN rates the bohor reedbuck as of Least Concern. Around <b>three-fourth</b> <b>of</b> the populations survive in protected areas. Populations of the reedbuck are either declining or uncertain in Boucle du Baoulé National Park (Mali); Comoé National Park (Ivory Coast); Mole and Digya National Parks (Ghana). Numbers in the Akagera National Park, where its last-known populations in Rwanda exist, have seen a steep fall.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E
5|$|More than 80percent of Madagascar's 14,883 {{plant species}} are found {{nowhere else in}} the world, {{including}} five plant families. The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, {{is limited to the}} spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar. Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium species are endemic to the island. <b>Three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> Madagascar's 860 orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic. Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine and vincristine are vinca alkaloids, used to treat Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and other cancers, were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle. The traveler's palm, known locally as ravinala and endemic to the eastern rain forests, is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E
