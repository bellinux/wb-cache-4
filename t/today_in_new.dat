5|$|The White Horse Turnpike Company was {{incorporated}} January 27, 1854 {{with the authority}} to convert White Horse Road into a turnpike, running from Camden to Stratford and eventually to Atlantic City. By 1913, maintenance of the White Horse Pike became public. The route of US30 <b>today</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Jersey was designated as pre-1927 Route3 from 1916 to 1927 between Camden and Absecon. On October 30, 1925, plans were made for a cross-country route from Salt Lake City, Utah to Atlantic City, New Jersey {{as part of the}} U.S. Highway System. This road was designated U.S. Route30 in 1926. It entered New Jersey from Pennsylvania in Camden and followed the entire length of pre-1927 Route3 to Absecon before continuing into Atlantic City. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route43 replaced the Route3 designation along US30 between US130 and US9 (now Route157) in Absecon while Route25 was designated along with US30 between the Ben Franklin Bridge and US130. In 1938, the portion of US30 from the terminus of Route43 in Absecon into Atlantic City was designated as Route56. Prior to the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, spur routes of Route43 and Route56 were planned. RouteS43 was planned in 1938 to be a route running from Route43 in Germania to Route4 in Northfield; this was never built as a state highway but the alignment is now followed by CR563. RouteS56 was legislated in 1945 to be a spur of Route56 to Brigantine along what had also been legislated as Route S4A; this road became Route87 in 1953.|$|E

500|$|The {{degree to}} which the huia was known and admired in New Zealand is {{reflected}} in the large number of suburban and geographical features which are named after the species. There are several roads and streets named after the huia in the North Island, with several in Wellington (including Huia Road in Days Bay – not far from where one of the last sightings of this species occurred in the early 1920s in the forests of East Harbour Regional Park) and also in Auckland, where there is even a Huia suburb in Waitakere. A river on the west coast of the South Island and the Huiarau Ranges in the central North Island are also named after the bird. The species was once found living in great abundance in the forests of these mountains: Huiarau means [...] "a hundred huia". Businesses include the public swimming pool in Lower Hutt, a Marlborough winery, and Huia Publishers, which specialises in Māori writing and perspectives. The name was first given to a child in the late 19th century, to the son of members of a lower North Island iwi concerned about the bird's rapid decline, and although uncommon, it is still used <b>today</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand as a name for girls and more rarely for boys (e.g. Huia Edmonds), of both European and Māori descent.|$|E
