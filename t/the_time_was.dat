5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection.

Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> ripe for world government.
