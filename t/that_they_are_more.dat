During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has been {{discussed}} by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits. Alexander predicted that the cost to large groups is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to suffer from}} parasitism, but at the same time, they benefit by defense against predation. This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E

Great blue herons {{have been observed}} at the headwaters of Hammersley Fork, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> commonly found in large river valleys. Little yellow stoneflies also inhabit it. Brown trout {{first appeared in the}} stream in the 1920s after being stocked in Cross Fork and in the 1940s the brown trout populations significantly increased.|$|E

50|$|The Adventures of Dennis {{were popular}} in India, where they existed in English and Marathi translations. One {{reason for their}} {{popularity}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> relatable when compared to English children's literature.

5|$|On May 2, Lamb of God {{announced}} via MySpace {{their new}} DVD, Walk with Me in Hell, {{would be released}} on July 1, 2008. The DVD is a double-disc and has nearly five hours of footage, containing the feature documentary Walk with Me in Hell and multiple live performance extras from the Sacrament World Tour. At {{the end of the}} Walk with Me in Hell documentary the members stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> excited than ever to write new material.|$|E
5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, {{also known as a}} subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E
5|$|Lynette grows {{increasingly}} weary at {{the idea}} of having more children. She confesses to Tom that while she began loving her other children before they were born, she does not have the same feelings for her unborn twins. Tom assures her that she will love them once she is able to hold them in her arms. At Lynette's request, the couple conceals the pregnancy from their family and friends. Meanwhile, Gabrielle is irritated with Ana's poor attitude, provocative wardrobe, and disregard for her curfew or other rules. Carlos insists that Gabrielle sign a contract that would make her Ana's legal guardian, but she refuses. However, when Ana expresses interest in becoming a model, Gabrielle understands <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> alike than she initially thought and signs the guardianship documents.|$|E

50|$|The {{system was}} plagued by many bootleg {{versions}} of its games. In particular, {{there were so many}} bootleg versions of Street Fighter II, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> common in some countries than the official version.

5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts in a long time.|$|E

25|$|Charles Darwin {{published}} {{extensively on}} geologic phenomena including {{the distribution of}} erratic boulders. In his accounts written during the voyage of , Darwin observed a number of large erratic boulders of notable size south of the Strait of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego and attributed them to ice rafting from Antarctica. Recent research suggests <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely the result of glacial ice flows carrying the boulders to their current locations.|$|E
25|$|Horned lizards use a {{wide variety}} of means to avoid predation. Their {{coloration}} generally serves as camouflage. When threatened, their first defense is to remain still to avoid detection. If approached too closely, they generally run in short bursts and stop abruptly to confuse the predator's visual acuity. If this fails, they puff up their bodies to cause them to appear more horned and larger, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> difficult to swallow.|$|E
25|$|One unusual {{feature of}} the planet’s surface is the {{numerous}} compression folds which crisscross the plains. It is thought that as the planet’s interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform. The folds {{can be seen on}} top of other features, such as craters and smoother plains, indicating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> recent. Mercury’s surface is also flexed by significant tidal bulges raised by the Sun—the Sun’s tides on Mercury are about 17% stronger than the Moon’s on Earth.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> active swimmers.|$|R
40|$|The {{illusion}} of transparency, or people’s tendency to believe {{their thoughts and}} feelings as more apparent to others than <b>they</b> actually <b>are,</b> was used to investigate adolescent egocentrism. Contrary to previous research demonstrating heightened adolescent egocentrism, adolescents exhibited similar levels of egocentrism to adults. In experiment 1, 13 - 14 year-olds and adult participants both truthfully described and lied about a series of pictures. Both adolescent and adult liars indicated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> confident <b>that</b> other participants would know when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> lying, than other participants actually indicated. In experiment 2, 13 - 14 year-olds, 15 - 16 year-olds and adult participants read to an audience. The {{illusion of}} transparency effect manifested itself differently according to gender: Female participants indicating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> looked more nervous than audiences thought, whilst male participants indicating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> entertaining than audiences thought. Results were interpreted using simulation theory, and suggested that adolescents {{might not be as}} egocentric as previously thought...|$|R
