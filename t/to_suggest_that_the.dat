5|$|There is {{very limited}} data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of the}} rainy season, in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species may be polygynous, with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E
5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} went on <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system {{would have to}} be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to be worthwhile. They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to meet in the middle, and they could not imagine a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E

5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made sure that this was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Resident Evil 4 {{attempted}} {{to redefine the}} genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action genre. Its ambitions paid off, earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005, and the top rank on IGN's Readers' Picks Top 99 Games list. However, this also led some reviewers <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill Homecoming, and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes {{were part of an}} overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay. These changes in gameplay have led some purists <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games. Jim Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat. Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Echmarcach's short reign in Dublin other than an attack on Skryne and Duleek, {{recorded}} by the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters in 1037. This strike could have been undertaken {{in the context of}} the Dubliner's gradual loss of power in Brega, and an attempt to regain authority of Skryne. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann at this point in his career, Sitriuc does not appear to have taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This seems <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> island was outwith Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach may have used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E

5|$|Some of Chopin's {{well-known}} pieces {{have acquired}} descriptive titles, {{such as the}} Revolutionary Étude (Op.10,No.12), and the Minute Waltz (Op.64,No.1). However, {{with the exception of}} his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{disagree with}} this narrative, Professor Constantin Zuckerman going {{as far as}} <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> True Cross was actually lost, and that the wood contained in the allegedly still sealed reliquary brought to Jerusalem by Heraclius in 629 was a fake. In his analysis, the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe, recently turned ally and co-father-in-law, Persian general and soon-to-become king, Shahrvaraz.|$|E

On discovery, she was replaced by her effective and much-loved assistant, Charlotte Bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{contents}} of the Stromata, as its title suggests, are miscellaneous. Its place in the trilogy is disputed – Clement initially intended to write the Didasculus, a work which would complement the practical guidance of the Paedagogus with a more intellectual schooling in theology. The Stromata is less systematic and ordered than Clement's other works, {{and it has been}} theorized by André Méhat that it was intended for a limited, esoteric readership. Although Eusebius wrote of eight books of the work, only seven undoubtably survive. Photius, writing in the 9th century, found various text appended to manuscripts of the seven canonical books, which lead Daniel Heinsius <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original eighth book is lost, and he identified the text purported to be from the eighth book as fragments of the Hypopotoses.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} {{date of the}} Cuban macaw is uncertain. Gundlach's sightings in the Zapata Swamp in the 1850s and Zappey's second-hand {{report of}} a pair on Isla de la Juventud in 1864 are the last reliable accounts. In 1886, Gundlach reported that he believed birds persisted in southern Cuba, which led Greenway <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species survived until 1885. Parrots are often among the first species to be exterminated from a given locality, especially islands.|$|E

An alternative analysis was then proposed by Wilkins et al., in 1953, for the in vivo B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions. In the same journal, James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA X-ray diffraction patterns <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> structure was a double-helix.|$|E
5|$|The {{group that}} would become the Round Table began meeting in June 1919 {{as the result of}} a {{practical}} joke carried out by theatrical press agent John Peter Toohey. Toohey, annoyed at The New York Times drama critic Alexander Woollcott for refusing to plug one of Toohey's clients (Eugene O'Neill) in his column, organized a luncheon supposedly to welcome Woollcott back from World War I, where he had been a correspondent for Stars and Stripes. Instead Toohey used the occasion to poke fun at Woollcott on a number of fronts. Woollcott's enjoyment of the joke and the success of the event prompted Toohey <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group in attendance meet at the Algonquin each day for lunch.|$|E
5|$|The term {{greenwashing}} {{was first}} used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory that}} Henry {{suffered}} from syphilis has been dismissed by most historians. Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to scurvy, {{which is caused}} by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> king may have been Kell positive and suffered from McLeod syndrome. According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may have been the result of traumatic brain injury after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a neuroendocrine cause of his obesity. This analysis identifies growth hormone deficiency (GHD) as the source for his increased adiposity but also significant behavioural changes noted in his later years, including his multiple marriages.|$|E

5|$|A {{road from}} Julian to Kane Springs was {{completed}} in 1925. Efforts to include this road extending to Brawley into the state highway system date back from 1927, {{in order to receive}} state funding for the road. Plans for a cross-country road through Borrego Springs were being discussed by county government officials in 1927, as there were no east–west state highways in between Mountain Springs and Riverside. Those living in Calipatria and Westmorland supported the prospect of the road to Julian being improved, and included in the state highway system. In 1928, state assembly member Myron Witter {{wrote a letter to the}} San Diego County Board of Supervisors <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> highway be incorporated as a second entrance to the county from the east, and that it would not detract from the progress of the other highway from El Centro; however, the county wanted to prioritize the paving over the designation. Chambers of commerce in the Imperial Valley generally agreed with Witter, proposing that the El Centro–Calexico road be made a part of the state highway system, and the Kane Springs–Julian road be given second priority for inclusion.|$|E
