5|$|Beetlejuice is {{the title}} of three {{different}} video games. The original Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) releases were developed by Rare and published by LJN. Another game was released for <b>the</b> <b>DOS</b> in 1990 called Adventures of Beetlejuice: Skeletons in the Closet. Each game is loosely based on the film and the animated series.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz is commemorated as {{a leader}} of the initial {{resistance}} against French rule in Spain and, along with Velarde, is remembered in many monuments across the country. The ashes of Daoíz and Velarde, with those of others involved in <b>the</b> <b>Dos</b> de Mayo uprising, were transferred to the Monumento a los Caidos por España in Madrid after its construction in 1840. The monument originally served as a memorial to those who lost their lives on <b>the</b> <b>Dos</b> de Mayo but on 22 November 1985 King Juan Carlos I redesignated it in memory of all Spaniards who died in war and it now serves as Spain's national Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.|$|E
5|$|Seibal regained its {{independence}} in the late 8th century with the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>Dos</b> Pilas kingdom. Ajaw B'ot acceded to the throne in AD 771, restoring Seibal as an independent capital. After AD 800 Seibal fell into a thirty-year hiatus during which no new monuments were erected.|$|E

All programs {{are led by}} <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> School method, an innovative teaching practice that combines hands-on experiences with blended learning and therewith aims to foster ideas of social innovation. As of 2015, Hoffmann’s international institution operates in three different continents with premises in Berlin, Hamburg, and New York City. Hoffmann regularly speaks on the topics of societal innovation, education and social entrepreneurship and has taught <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> School method at various renowned universities such as the Hasso Plattner Institute at Potsdam University and the EBS University of Business and Law. His work has been covered widely in publications such as the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, Monocle (media company) and more.|$|R
5|$|Banton {{lies on the}} {{northern}} portion of the Sibuyan Sea, and is equidistant between Marinduque Island {{to the north and}} Tablas Island to the south. It is composed of the main island of Banton and the uninhabited islands of Bantoncillo, Carlota and Isabel, the last two of which are collectively known as <b>the</b> <b>Dos</b> Hermanas Islands. There is also an islet near Tabonan Beach on the north-west of the island.|$|E
5|$|After {{the war of}} independence, Lima {{became the}} capital of the Republic of Peru but {{economic}} stagnation and political turmoil brought its urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid expansion of the city. In the next two decades, the State funded the construction of large size public buildings to replace colonial establishments; these included the Central Market, the General Slaughterhouse, the Mental Asylum, the Penitentiary, and <b>the</b> <b>Dos</b> de Mayo Hospital. There were also improvements in communications; a railroad line between Lima and Callao was completed in 1850 and an iron bridge across the Rímac River, the Balta Bridge, was opened in 1870. The city walls were torn down in 1872 as further urban growth was expected. However, the export-led economic expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, fostering social unrest.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>DOS</b> and Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released {{the first version of}} their popular database software Microsoft Access.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> {{condition}} of a lake or sea, authors are developing the liquid film gas dissolution technique. This paper presents a summary of this technique, experimental results of DO improvement, and performance evaluation method for <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> improvement considering <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> concentration of <b>the</b> water to be treated. This DO improvement method transforms the water into bubble clusters which essentially makes water elements of the thin film of bubbles. This method yields a large value of the dissolved gas concentration gradient {{in the water and}} therefore attains an efficient gas dissolution. Also, this method treats deep water utilizing the airlift effect by aeration in the shallow part of the pipe, thus saving energy. The authors have shown experimentally that <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> increment depends on <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> concentration of <b>the</b> water to be treated, and proposed <b>the</b> equivalent <b>DO</b> increment as an index of <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> increment which can be used irrespective of <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> concentration to be treated and which indicates the potential of <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> increment for <b>the</b> same working condition from the theory of the aeration device. The validity of this index was checked using the result of the present experiments...|$|R
5000|$|Six prototypes of <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 317A were ordered, and {{the first}} of these, <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 317 V1, {{commenced}} its flight test program on 8 September 1943. <b>The</b> <b>Do</b> 317 V1 was very similar in appearance to <b>the</b> later <b>Do</b> 217K and -M subtypes, with a visually reframed slight variation of its multiple glazed-panel [...] "stepless cockpit", fully glazed nose design that accommodated a pressurized cabin provision, and triangular tailfins. Trials with <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 317 V1 revealed no real performance advance over <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 217, so {{it was decided to}} complete the remaining five prototypes without cabin pressurization equipment and fit them out with FuG 203 Kehl radio guidance transmitting gear to employ them as Henschel Hs 293 missile launchers. In this form, the prototypes were redesignated Do 217R. At this time, <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 317B project was abandoned due to changing wartime conditions.|$|R
5|$|In 1983, in {{collaboration}} with numerous companies, Microsoft created a home computer system, MSX, which contained {{its own version of}} <b>the</b> <b>DOS</b> operating system, called MSX-DOS; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America. Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after Columbia Data Products successfully cloned the IBM BIOS, quickly followed by Eagle Computer and Compaq. The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to have control of its own QDOS derivative, MS-DOS, and through aggressive marketing of the operating system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry. With the release of the Microsoft Mouse on May 2, 1983, Microsoft continued to expand its product line in other markets. This expansion included Microsoft Press, a book publishing division, on July 11 the same year, which debuted with two titles: Exploring the IBM PCjr Home Computer by Peter Norton, and The Apple Macintosh Book by Cary Lu.|$|E
