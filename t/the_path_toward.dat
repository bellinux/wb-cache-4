25|$|As envisaged by Alberto, <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>toward</b> {{developing}} a Brazilian nuclear sector included the nationalization of nuclear activities and specific compensations for exporting strategic raw materials. Accordingly, Brazil attempted to negotiate trade agreements that, {{in exchange for}} Brazilian raw materials, would include provisions to grant easier access to sensitive technologies and training for Brazilian nuclear engineers. The success of this policy was noticeably limited, but it granted Brazilian scientists and engineers opportunities to undertake academic exchanges and training in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|International {{experts have}} also {{weighed in on}} the controversies {{surrounding}} Brazil’s nuclear program. Hans Rühle, a former official from the German defense ministry who also worked with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wrote an article in 2010 in which he indicated that Brazil might be on <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>toward</b> getting the bomb. He based his argument on the submarine project, which may involve the production of highly enriched uranium, {{and the fact that}} Brazil seeks to develop capacity to conduct all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle indigenously. While Rühle affirms that there is no hard proof of a nuclear weapons program in Brazil, he suggests that Brazil’s relations with Iran and defense of the Iranian nuclear program should be seen as a clue of the path Brazil wants to tread. Commenting on Rühle’s article, the Argentine scholars Federico Merke and Florencia Montal said that Brazil might develop the capacity to manufacture a bomb but that it didn’t seem to have the intention to do so.|$|E

40|$|The {{available}} empirical literature {{tends to}} focus on the performance comparison between business groups (BGs) and non-business groups, and there is no study that quantitatively verifies the origins of the business groups, particularly in China. This paper uses the survey data of SOEs (state-owned enterprises) in China to verify <b>the</b> three <b>paths</b> <b>toward</b> business groups, such as M&As (merger and acquisitions), spin-offs and joint ventures. This study discusses three alternative theories to explain the emergence of the business groups in China. These are the market-based view, the state-activism view and the resource-based view. This paper found that the greater autonomy given after changing into a shareholding corporation {{is one of the most}} consistent and significant factors leading to the business group, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>paths.</b> First, this implies that SOEs have gone from traditional SOEs, to shareholding corporations, and then finally to business groups. Second, it finds that there are certain differences among <b>the</b> three <b>paths</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> business group. The degree of market competition and control by the city-level government are the significant variables in <b>the</b> <b>path</b> via M&A, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> business group. This is consistent with the state activism view. The significant variables for <b>the</b> spin-off <b>path</b> are <b>the</b> low leverages and the connection with the state.

[...] Those eligible to be ordained as deacons include those who are called to a full-time ministry of music, Christian social ministry, or director of Christian education, or another ministry that does not typically involve leading a congregation.

2500|$|After 1948, Sergiu Dan's {{political}} views {{collided with the}} agenda set by the Romanian communist regime, and he was eventually arrested. Reportedly, Dan had first attracted political persecution upon himself when, in 1947, he spoke out as a defense witness at the trial of his friend, the PNȚ journalist Nicolae Carandino. The Securitate secret police confiscated his works in progress, which reputedly formed part of a special secret archive. The conditions of Dan's new detainment were characterized by literary historian Henri Zalis as [...] "savage". He was notably held, with many other public figures of various backgrounds, at Aiud prison. Petre Pandrea, himself imprisoned there after an inner-party purge, later included Dan on his list of writers, humorously titled the [...] "Writers' Union of Aiud"—in contrast to the communist-controlled Writers' Union of Romania.
