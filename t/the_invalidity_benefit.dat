40|$|There are 2. 7 {{million people}} of working {{age in the}} UK who are {{claiming}} Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disability Allowance or Income Support {{on the grounds of}} incapacity. Total spending on benefits for disabled people was in excess of £ 19 billion in 2004. The inactivity rate for men – the proportion of the working age population of men over 25 who are neither in work nor looking for a job – has risen by a multiple of around four since the mid- 1970 s. Among prime-age men (those aged between 25 and 54), the inactivity rate is now 8. 6 %, a rate five times higher {{than it was in the}} mid- 1970 s. The level of inactivity among prime-age men is particularly concentrated among those who are both low skilled and suffering from a chronic health problem or disability. Over time, as inactivity has increased, this concentration has become worse. The main factors underlying these changes are the significant weakening of the labour market for low skilled workers and the operation of <b>the</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefit</b> system. The inactivity rate for prime-age men in the UK is higher than the European (EU 15) average. At the same time, labour market participation of older (55 - 64) men is higher in the UK than in continental Europe...|$|E

At the same time I would like to describe in detail and evaluate above named national legislations in the same structure, if possible. The first chapter deals with historical aspects. After the origins of social security are mentioned, I already focus on the historical development of invalidity benefits' legislation in european and czech context. The next chapter is an analysis of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> at <b>the</b> international level. Especially the achievements of the International Labour Organization, the Council of Europe and the European Union in the field of disablement pensions are highlighted. It is completed by a brief description of bilateral agreements on social security. The third chapter, which is the largest one included in this thesis, examines the czech legislation regarding <b>the</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits.</b> First of all the issue of the pension insurance in general is outlined.

40|$|International audienceThe French {{pattern of}} early {{transitions}} out of employment is basically {{explained by the}} low age at "normal" retirement and by the importance of transitions through unemployment insurance and early-retirement schemes before access to normal retirement. These routes have exempted French workers from massively relying on disability motives for early exits, contrarily to the situation that prevails in some other countries where normal ages are high, unemployment benefits low and early-retirement schemes almost non-existent. Yet the role of disability remains interesting to examine in the French case, at least for prospective reasons {{in a context of}} decreasing generosity of other programs. The study of the past reforms of the pension system underlines that disability routes have often acted as a substitute to other retirement routes. Changes in <b>the</b> claiming of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> seem to match changes in pension schemes or controls more than changes in such health indicators as the mortality rates. However, our results suggest that increases in average health levels {{over the past two decades}} have come along with increased disparities. In that context, less generous pensions may induce an increase in <b>the</b> claiming of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> partly because of substitution effects, but also because the share of people with poor health increases...|$|R

40|$|Social {{security}} expenditure totalled ATS 745 {{billion in}} 1998, the 2. 8 percent growth of nominal expenditure being 0. 7 percent below nominal GDP growth. The social expenditure ratio, i. e., {{the share of}} social expenditure in GDP, stood at 28. 5 percent in 1998, thus continuing its downward trend for the fourth consecutive year. The trend is expected to remain unchanged in 1999, as the cyclical upswing results in employment growth and a reduction of unemployment. At the same time, the budget consolidation measures (austerity budgets) are reinforcing this development. Measured by its social expenditure ratio, Austria ranks seventh in Europe. The ratios are higher in the Nordic countries as well as France and Germany. With a social expenditure ratio of 28. 7 percent, Austria was 0. 5 percentage point below the EU average in 1997. However, the structure of social security spending in Austria differs greatly from the European average. Expenditure for old-age pensions and survivor benefits is 3. 3 percentage points above the EU average and family benefits exceed {{the average of the}} fifteen member states by 1. 9 percentage points. The way Austrian social security is financed also differs from the EU average: contributions by public and private employers are 1 percentage point below the average, while employee contributions to social security are 3. 6 percentage points above the EU average; the share of tax money flowing into social security exceeds the average by 1. 6 percentage points. Old-age benefits (38. 2 percent for old-age pensions and 10. 3 percent for survivor benefits) account for the largest share of social benefits, followed by health care expenditure (25. 8 percent) and family benefits (10. 2 percent). <b>Invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> are <b>the</b> fourth largest expenditure item (8. 6 percent), while unemployment benefits account for no more than 5. 6 percent of all social benefit payments. The shares of old-age pensions and <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> increased between 1997 and 1998. Spending rose most strongly (+ 10. 8 percent) in <b>the</b> field of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> (including early retirement for reasons of partial invalidity) as well as early retirement after long-term insurance coverage (+ 4. 9 percent) and unemployment benefits (+ 4. 1 percent). Changes in legislation resulted in a steep decline of spending for parental leave (– 21. 5 percent) and child-birth benefits (– 75. 4 percent), although family benefit expenditure as a whole increased by 1. 6 percent.

Data has been collected from several different sources, namely: 1) Clickdata from the site www. werk. nl collected from visitors that were not logged in, 2) Clickdata from the customer specific part of the site www. werk. nl (a link is made with the customer that logged in), 3) Werkmap Message data, showing when customers contacted the UWV through a digital channel, 4) Call data from the callcenter, showing when customers contacted the call center by phone, and 5) Complaint data showing when customers complained. All data is accompanied by data fields with anonymized information about the customer as well as data about the site visited or the contents of the call and/or complaint. The texts in the dataset are provided in both Dutch and English where applicable. URL's are included based on the structure of the site during the period the data has been collected. UWV is interested in insights on how their channels are being used, when customers move from one contact channel to the next and why and if there are clear customer profiles to be identified in the behavioral data.

40|$|Hospital {{discharges}} {{and deaths}} attributed to chronic bronchitis and emphysema {{have fallen in}} recent years {{while the number of}} those receiving <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefit</b> for these conditions has remained constant. One hundred and fifty seven such persons were invited to take part in this study, in which the diagnosis, degree of respiratory impairment, and other factors contributing to disability were reviewed. The scope for rehabilitation was considered. One hundred subjects agreed to take part; 96 were men and 70 were over 60 years. In only 67 was the main diagnosis chronic bronchitis and emphysema. There was a bimodal distribution of functional impairment, most being severely disabled, but in 20 the FEV 1 was within the normal range. Among these asthma was more common and psychological factors were important. Economic factors contributed to "invalidity," especially among those with a normal FEV 1. For 32 of the 57 who had declined to take part some information was available from hospital records. The findings in this group were similar. There was little scope for rehabilitation in the group as a whole as motivation was poor. Less than half had ever seen a chest physician.
