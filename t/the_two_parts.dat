5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> of the wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E

5|$|The final {{song of the}} Bat trilogy is a {{short one}} written by Steinman. A few lyrics of Cry to Heaven begin rather sweet, but turning rather bitter: (Cry baby cry/Cry, cry to heaven/If that doesn't do it for you/Go ahead and cry like hell.) <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> are bridged by an {{instrumental}} dominated by an Irish flute.|$|E
5|$|The similar Dardanelles Guns (for the location) {{were created}} by Munir Ali in 1464 and were still in use during the Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09).

5|$|A {{piece of}} {{slightly}} later date, the Dardanelles Gun (see picture), {{was cast in}} bronze and made in two parts: the chase and the breech, which, together, weighed 18.4tonnes. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> were screwed together using levers to facilitate the work. Created by Munir Ali in 1464, the Dardanelles Gun was still present for duty more than 300 years later in 1807, when a Royal Navy force appeared and commenced the Dardanelles Operation. Turkish forces loaded the ancient relics with propellant and projectiles, then fired them at the British ships. The British squadron suffered 28 dead through this bombardment.|$|E

5|$|Aldfrith ruled both Bernicia and Deira {{throughout}} his reign, but <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> remained distinct, and would again be {{divided by the}} Vikings in the late 9th century. The centre of Bernicia lay in the region around the later Anglo-Scottish border, with Lindisfarne, Hexham, Bamburgh, and Yeavering being important religious and royal centres. Even after Ecgfrith's death, Bernicia included much of modern southeast Scotland, with a presumed royal centre at Dunbar, and religious centres at Coldingham and Melrose. The details of the early Middle Ages in northwest England and southwest Scotland are more obscure, but a Bishop of Whithorn is known from shortly after Aldfrith's reign. York, Catterick, Ripon, and Whitby {{appear to have been}} important sites in Deira.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken {{as the beginning of}} that school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays as though they were real people. Hazlitt, who seems to have had little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never to lose sight of Falstaff's status as a character in a play—three plays, in fact, though <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> of Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his best course of action would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E

Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depends on compiler capabilities {{that had never been}} implemented before, so more research was needed.|$|E
5|$|The Charing Cross Hotel, {{designed}} by Edward Middleton Barry, opened on 15 May 1865 {{and gave the}} station an ornate frontage in the French Renaissance style. It had 250 bedrooms spread over seven floors and extended along Villiers Street {{as well as the}} front of the Strand. The public rooms had balconies overlooking the main station concourse. It quickly became popular and was profitable, leading to a 90-bedroom annexe {{on the other side of}} Villiers Street opening in 1878. A bridge over the street connected <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> of the hotel together.|$|E
5|$|The cantata is {{structured}} {{in two parts}} of seven movements each, to be performed {{before and after the}} sermon. It is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, trumpet (Tr), two oboes (Ob), oboe d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc) including bassoon. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> of seven movements each are composed as the same arrangement of alternating recitatives and arias with a concluding chorale, only Part II is opened by a sinfonia instead of a chorus. The duration is given as 35 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer {{the top of the}} stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E
5|$|Dean and Knapp {{record that}} in early 1707 Keiser {{surrendered}} the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became {{responsible for the}} staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as {{they are the first}} works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.|$|E

5|$|Early writers {{claimed the}} Mascarene parrot {{was found on}} Madagascar, an idea that led the French naturalist and ornithologist René Primevère Lesson to coin the junior synonym Mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831. His new genus name prevailed and, when Tommaso Salvadori {{combined}} it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a tautonym (a scientific name in which <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> are identical). Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus, {{but this was not}} accepted by other writers. The following year, the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot (which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system) and the lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). The English zoologist William Alexander Forbes, believing that mascarinus was invalid as a specific name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879, in honour of Dubois. The binomial name was emended from M. mascarinus to M. mascarin by the IOC World Bird List in 2016, to conform with how other species epithets by Linnaeus have been treated.|$|E
5|$|The beak is very distinctive. From {{the side}} the beak is broad and {{triangular}} but viewed from above it is narrow. The half nearest the tip is orange-red and the half nearest {{to the head}} is slate grey. There is a yellow chevron-shaped ridge separating <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> and a yellow, fleshy strip {{at the base of}} the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird has a powerful bite.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface {{platforms}} opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway and the District Railway {{as part of}} the companies' extension of the Inner Circle route eastwards from Gloucester Road to Westminster and deep level platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, which have been modified several times to suit operational demands with the current arrangement being achieved in the 1960s. The deep-level platforms have remained largely unaltered, although the installation of escalators in the 1970s to replace lifts improved interchanges between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> of the station. Parts of the sub-surface station and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed.|$|E
