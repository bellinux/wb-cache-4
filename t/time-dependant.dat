We {{show that the}} system operator generates a positive C 0 -semigroup of contraction in a Banach space, therefore there exists a unique, nonnegative, and <b>time-dependant</b> solution. By analyzing the spectrum of system operator, we deduce that all spectra lie in the left half-plane and 0 is the unique spectral point on imaginary axis. As a result, the <b>time-dependant</b> solution converges to the eigenvector of system operator corresponding to eigenvalue 0. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{time-averaged}} and <b>time-dependant</b> {{nature of}} {{the wake of a}} simplified passenger vehicle (Ahmed model) has been investigated experimentally. Time-averaged results of the far-wake showed good agreement to previously published work, although the near-wake structure was found to be somewhat different, complementing findings made through flow visualisation. <b>Time-dependant</b> analysis revealed that the shedding behind the model is analogous to vortex shedding behind simple bluff bodies, with most of the fluctuations confined to the axial and vertical directions. In addition, the shedding characteristics on the slant showed very similar behaviour to the vertical base, indicating strong turbulent mixing between the two regions, emphasizing time-averaged findings and complementing the proposed flow topology...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. ECC (Engineered Cement-based Composites) {{is a type}} of HPC (High Performance Concrete) {{that was}} {{engineered}} to overcome the weaknesses of ordinary concrete. It shows high ductility as it can resist the full tensile load at a strain of more than 3 %. This superior response is achieved with multiple cracking under tensile loading which has a pseudo strain hardening phenomenon as result. The purpose of the research project reported in this dissertation is to investigate and characterise the <b>time-dependant</b> behaviour of ECC and create a constitutive model to numerically simulate the static and <b>time-dependant</b> behaviour of ECC. To investigate the <b>time-dependant</b> behaviour experimentally, rate and creep tests were done on the meso- and macro-level while rate tests were done on the structurallevel. The meso-level was represented by the pull-out testing of fibres embedded in the cement-based matrix and direct tensile tests were done for the macro-level. Flexural tests on thin beams were done to simulate the structural-level. Strong <b>time-dependant</b> behaviour was found on all three these levels. On the meso-level, the most prominent finding is that the failure mechanism can change with a change of strain rate, i. e. fibre pull-out at a low pull-out rate, while with a high pullout rate, fibre rupture can occur. Even though the strength of a tensile specimen on the macro-level showed a dependence on the strain rate, the ductility remained constant over four orders of magnitude of the strain rate. On the structural-level, however, a reduction of the flexural ductility was found with an increase of the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Basalt fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (BFRP) {{bars are}} proposed as a pre-stressed reinforcement for precast concrete elements {{because of their}} enhanced resistance to aggressive agents which makes them far more corrosion resistant than steel Moreover, the lower elastic modulus enables a limit on the instantaneous and <b>time-dependant</b> losses and makes their application to pre-stressed precast concrete particularly promising. A full scale experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} in the framework of the EU funded research project Eirocrete at Banagher Precast Concrete Ltd on a precast concrete voided light-weight floor slab pre-stressed with basalt reinforced polymer bars and made with fibre reinforced self-compacting concrete (FRSCC).

40|$|High {{embankment}} on soft clay {{layer is}} {{often associated with}} large settlement for long time, even if the failure of the embankment is not occured under construction. Presented herein is an analysis of <b>time-dependant</b> deformation of soft clay layer based on the elasto-plastic stress-strain-time relationship (the constitutive equation) of the cohesive soils previously reported by Tanabashi (1981). In order to verify the contitutive equation, several triaxial tests with complex stress pathes are performed. The finite element method incorporated the constitutive equation is applied to analyse <b>time-dependant</b> deformation of soft clay layer after the construction of road embankment in the bypass of route 3 in Onga-gun, Fukuoka. It has also been shown from the comparison between observed and calculated values that the proposed method estimates the settlement of the embankment with reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, the rate of contribution of each strain compornent to the deformation of soft clay layer is examined...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of a pulsed inductive thruster utilized a <b>time-dependant,</b> two-dimensional, axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics MACH 2 code to predict operation at low energy levels {{for a range}} of propellants and propellant mass values. Previous numerical efforts with pulsed inductive thruster modeling for medium and high energy cases agree well with available experimental data and have established confidence in MACH 2 ’s ability to capture the pertinent physical processes. The high energy pulsed inductive thruster simulations were recently performed using a power circuit model augmented with a plasma voltage algorithm that accounts for the propellant’s <b>time-dependant</b> resistance and inductance to properly account for plasma dynamic effects. The updated circuit model was found to self-consistently calculate the experimentally measured current waveform profile for the first half period with excellent correlation effectively capturing the dominant acceleration phase of the plasma.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to bring together two areas of research the first being a laboratory study of the <b>time-dependant</b> properties of concrete while the second is a study of the <b>time-dependant</b> behaviour of two prestressed concrete structures - the Grangetown and Cogan Viaducts. A study of the influence of shrinkage and creep on a range of normal to high strength concretes in the laboratory found that as concrete strength increased, drying and total shrinkage also increased while the rate at which creep developed decreased. It was shown that autogenous shrinkage is more prevalent in high strength concrete, and the inclusion of pfa in concrete reduces the amount of total shrinkage. The benefits and limitations of using current shrinkage and creep prediction models were determined through a sensitivity study of their input parameters and through comparisons with shrinkage and creep strains determined in the laboratory. It was found that certain models are more sensitive to specific parameters than others. All models predicted strains which gave good to adequate agreement with the measured strains when the material parameters were within the ranges specified by the models, but the prediction was less reliable when the parameters used in the models exceeded the recommended values. It was shown that the prediction of the <b>time-dependant</b> behaviour of the Grangetown and Cogan Viaducts using these models is inadequate due to influences not considered by the models such as prestressing forces and the construction sequence. The influence of the construction sequence and prestressing data was investigated using a complex computer code in conjunction with these models, and while it was not possible to improve the efficiency of predicting reliable strain behaviour over time, an appreciation of the level of detail necessary to do this was gained. Finally, the influence of environmental conditions on the strain behaviour of these two structures was shown to be greater than anticipated...|$|E

40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of egg yolk after different storage periods and temperatures was investigated using rotational viscometer. The eggs were stored for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 weeks at constant temperatures: 4  °C, 8  °C, 12  °C and 16  °C. The apparent viscosity was measured {{as a function}} of shear rate. For given shearing rate, the viscosity was measured in dependence on shearing time. The decrease of viscosity with storage time is attributed to the balance of different osmotic pressure from yolk and albumen of fresh egg. The yolk (with higher dry matter then albumen) absorbs water from albumen through vitelline membrane. It was found that yolk samples exhibited shear-thinning and thixotropic behaviour. The shear-thinning behaviour was fitted well into simple models. The resting of sample at room temperature caused increase of viscosity. This effect is explained by drying off of testing yolk, the regeneration of yolk structures and changing chemical composition during resting. The <b>time-dependant</b> viscosity decreased rapidly with time and at lower share rates reached an equilibrium stage. The <b>time-dependant</b> viscosity was also found to decrease with storage time. The value of pH was changed (increased) during storing. No clear dependence between pH value and viscosity was confirmed...|$|E
