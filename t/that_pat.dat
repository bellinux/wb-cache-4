5|$|Peggy resumes {{her plan}} {{to run for}} council in 2010, but is furious to {{discover}} <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> is also running. The storyline introduces the character of Harvey Freeman, played by Martin Jarvis, a freelance journalist who is reporting on the election. Harvey is a potential love interest for both Peggy and Pat, and causes friction between the friends.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> Kenny would present another television programme, {{was on the}} night he announced his departure from presenting The Late Late Show. By the time of presenting his last programme, it was announced a new current affairs programme would begin in autumn 2009. It was later {{announced that it would}} be 21 September 2009.|$|E

25|$|Another theory suggests, <b>that</b> <b>Päts</b> {{knew of the}} outbreaking {{war between}} Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and was only {{looking for a way}} for Estonia to survive the short period in between. It is {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>Päts</b> knew of the difficulty of the situation and tried to keep Estonians as safe as possible by avoiding war with the Soviets and buying time. While trying not to give the Soviet Union a chance to punish the Estonians, he also continuously postponed the mobilization, which eventually never even took place, unlike in Latvia and Lithuania in 1939–1940. Under international law a war would have invalidated the Tartu Peace Treaty. As a lawyer, he also had to understand that his decisions were not valid when forced by an occupying power.|$|R
5|$|His non-selection in {{previous}} years was widely debated in the media. Bure was often compared with Cam Neely, a player who also waited six years for induction; he recorded similar goals-per-game numbers in a career that was also shortened to 700-plus games. It had been often rumoured <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> Quinn, Bure's former head coach and general manager in Vancouver, who became co-chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame's selection committee, opposed Bure's induction. However, {{in a conference call}} following his selection, Quinn was among the most prominent figures he thanked. Quinn criticized the Canucks organization for not yet retiring Bure's jersey.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Ben Taylor (voiced by TJ Ramini), {{the manager}} at the SDS, is fired by Carbunkle and is {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> doesn't want him anymore, not realising <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> is a robot. Meanwhile, Wilf tries his schemes to stop Pat, not realising <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> going around Greendale {{is in fact a}} robot. The more Pat's family and friends become concerned, the more Pat feels guilty about coming on the contest in the first place. And despite Pat's efforts to tell his wife the truth about why he entered the competition, he fails and starts to become fearful that he might have pushed his family away. It isn't until shortly after Pat's departure that some people in Greendale discover that there appears to be more than one Pat and Edwin Carbunkle's true intent is exposed. It turns out that Carbunkle is in fact making these robots to try and take over the world. Ben Taylor rushes to tell Sara and Julian the terrible truth about Mr Carbunkle's plan, leaving them both shocked.|$|E
25|$|On June 7, 2006, the Islanders {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> LaFontaine {{would return}} to the Islanders as Senior Advisor to the Owner. This was short-lived, however, as LaFontaine resigned in protest only six weeks later on July 18, the same day that Neil Smith was fired by the Islanders.|$|E

25|$|It is {{also claimed}} <b>that</b> <b>Päts</b> purposefully gave up {{valuable}} {{information to the}} Soviets, when he negotiated the Estonian-Russian commerce treaty for Estonia. Päts also supported giving concession rights of the Narva River hydroelectric power plant to the German enterprise Siemens-Schuckert Werke that already had many projects in Russia and was influenced by it.|$|R
25|$|It is also {{suggested}} that Päts's bad health and loneliness did not let him realistically analyze the situation. Furthermore, it is suggested <b>that</b> <b>Päts</b> and his cabinet lacked the necessary knowledge in international affairs and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany may have come {{as a shock to}} the Päts cabinet.|$|R
25|$|When Kenny {{returns to}} Walford in 1988, the {{brothers}} fight about Simon's paternity until Pat suggests {{that neither of}} them are Simon's dad. Pat enjoys the upset she has caused for the Beales, {{and it is not}} until a dying Lou pleads with her to finally name the father <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> succumbs and tells Simon that his father is Brian Wicks, whom she had been having an affair with during her marriage to Pete.|$|E
25|$|Pete {{enjoys a}} simple life, but his old-fashioned views about masculinity cause rifts {{between him and}} Ian. Pete is thrilled when his other son Simon appears in Walford, which {{excludes}} Ian further. Pete grows attached to Simon, but Pat's disclosure in 1986 that Pete is not Simon's father threatens to ruin their relationship. Lou attempts to persuade Pete <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> is lying, all the while believing that she is actually {{telling the truth and}} that Kenny is Simon's father. When Pauline discovers this, she informs Pete, leading to numerous confrontations between him and Pat. When Pat is assaulted in 1987, Pete becomes prime suspect and is interrogated. It is not until the real attacker tries to assault Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton) that Pete's name is cleared.|$|E
25|$|Kyle {{calls into}} Pat's radio show, and tells Pat {{to meet him}} at the Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum, stating that this is the only chance for Pat to {{retrieve}} the laptop. Pat arrives to find Kyle dressed exactly like Pat. Kyle demands <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> strip naked, but Pat runs off into a Ween concert. After Kyle corners Pat on a catwalk, Pat falls, and Pat's clothes get caught on a hook. This tears off Pat's pants and lowers Pat in front of the cheering audience, though Pat's genitals are revealed neither to Kyle nor to the moviegoer. Kyle is subsequently taken away by security guards. Pat then runs to see Chris, just as Chris is leaving on an ocean liner. In an epilogue, Pat and Chris get married.|$|E
60|$|Mr Vince {{removed the}} hand <b>that</b> was <b>patting</b> Ruth's {{shoulder}} and waved it reassuringly at him.|$|R
25|$|His actions {{before and}} during the Soviet {{occupation}} have been questioned even more. In 1918, Päts refused to compromise with the communists, but in 1940, he gave Estonia to Soviets without many objections. This controversy has led to theories, <b>that</b> <b>Päts</b> was either a Soviet agent, a collaborator, took the Soviet invasion as inevitable or was just ill-minded and failed to deal with the situation.|$|R

25|$|In May 2002, Ricky meets up with Bianca in Manchester {{and they}} briefly rekindle their romance after he gets {{her out of}} trouble with her boss Vince. However, Bianca, who is {{struggling}} as a single parent, is manipulated by Ricky's new fiancée, Cassie, into believing that Ricky's life would be ruined if Bianca returns to him. Bianca decides to leave Liam with Ricky and hitches a ride to a destination unknown. Ricky returns to Walford in August 2002 with Liam after hearing from his former stepmother Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement), that his sister Janine (Charlie Brooks) has resorted to prostitution and drug-use. Ricky remains to help Janine and returns to his old job as a mechanic at the Arches. He begins a second affair with Natalie, ending her marriage to Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson), whose father Roy is now married to Pat. Roy then dies {{after a heart attack}} after the affair is uncovered and he discovers <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> had known about the affair but had failed to inform Barry and Roy.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2012, Ryan Richards {{announced}} that he was leaving the band. He cited his family as the reason, saying: “I’ve always put music first in my life – but the time has come now for my family to take the top spot”. It was the band's initial intention that Richards would not be replaced instantly and that the band would only look for a touring member to play for the band. However, it was announced on <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> Lundy would be joining the band as Richards' replacement. Lundy is the former drummer of London-based heavy metal band Rise to Remain, having left the band in January 2012. After being contacted by the band to come to audition in Cardiff for the role, Pat learned their whole setlist in 7 days for the audition. Whilst the line up change occurred the band was recording and mixing their follow up to their fifth studio album. Across the year the band made few live appearances as they were working on the album, performing at Wakestock in North Wales, both the northern and southern dates of Slam Dunk Festival 2012 and the UK Warped Tour festival at the Alexandra Palace in London on 10 November 2012.|$|E
25|$|Suspecting foul play, Natalie {{tries to}} prove Janine has murdered Barry but is unsuccessful. She refuses {{to leave with}} Ricky, who leaves {{following}} Janine's confession of what really happened to Barry (but keeps this to himself). While Natalie comes to terms with Barry's death, she gets close to Paul, who is desperate to make amends to Natalie and Jack {{for his part in}} Barry's death. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Paul struggles with his guilt and when Natalie gets suspicious about Paul's relationship with Janine, he finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul conspired with her from the start and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square in March 2004. She returns briefly in May to witness Janine's incarceration after she is falsely accused of murdering Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman). Natalie makes peace with Paul, holding a ceremony for Barry by scattering his ashes under a tree planted in his memory. She and Jack leave but it is indicated <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> stays in touch with Natalie when she goes to stay with her off-screen in 2007, following an accident.|$|E

He talked soothingly to him, but not for long, then slowly put out his hand, rested it on White Fang's head, and resumed the interrupted patting. White Fang endured it, keeping his eyes fixed suspiciously, not upon the man <b>that</b> <b>patted</b> him, but upon the man that stood in the doorway.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Patterned {{self-assembly}} tile set synthesis (Pats) is the prob-lem {{of finding}} a minimal tile set which uniquely self-assembles into a given pattern. Czeizler and Popa proved the NP-completeness of Pats and Seki showed <b>that</b> the <b>Pats</b> problem is already NP-complete for pat-terns with 60 colors. In search for the minimal number of colors such <b>that</b> <b>Pats</b> remains NP-complete, we introduce multiple bound Pats (mbPats) where we allow bounds for the numbers of tile types of each color. We show that mbPats is NP-complete for patterns with just three colors and, as a byproduct of this result, we also obtain a novel proof for the NP-completeness of Pats which is more concise than the previous proofs. ...|$|R

500|$|Despite her largely demure {{public persona}} as a {{traditional}} wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, [...] "I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?" [...] Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that [...] "women can {{play a vital role}} in world affairs" [...] while still retaining a [...] "feminine manner." [...] Other journalists felt <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them, though, one student told the press that [...] "she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised." [...] Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.|$|E
500|$|The fashion press {{tends to}} take special {{interest}} in First Ladies. The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. Women's Wear Daily stated <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> had a [...] "good figure and good posture", as well as [...] "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. [...] "I consider it my duty to use American designers", she said, and favored them because, [...] "they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. [...] "I'm a size 10," [...] she told The New York Times. [...] "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers." [...] She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, {{at the suggestion of}} Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion.

25|$|Other {{theories}} maintain <b>that</b> <b>Päts</b> {{trusted the}} Soviet officials and had befriended {{some of the}} Soviet leaders.

In private, Richard Nixon {{was described as}} being [...] "unabashedly sentimental", often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts.

Instead, Pat drifted northeast, but remained situated within the monsoon trough. As such, the JTWC revised their forecast, and now expected the storm to move northwest due to the presence of an eastward moving trough situated over Mongolia. Meanwhile, the JMA increased the intensity of Pat to [...] early on August28. Several hours later, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Pat to a typhoon. According to the JMA, the storm leveled off intensity for about a day. By midday on August29, some tropical cyclone forecast models began to show Pat emerging into the Sea of Japan west of the ridge. However, this theory was not supported by the JTWC as they believed that the ridge was too narrow to be picked up a trough. That same day, the JTWC increased the intensity to , equivalent to a Category2 cyclone on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
