25|$|Hubert {{was born}} in Cottonwood, California. He most {{recently}} worked as a rear <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> and a mechanic for Bill Davis Racing's #22 Sprint Cup team, before the team closed down, and also occasionally races road courses for various teams. His hobbies include golf and water skiing.|$|E
25|$|Rudd joined King Racing {{beginning}} in 1988 in the No. 26 Buick Regal owned by drag racing legend Kenny Bernstein. He struggled with engine failures all season long and finished 11th in the point standings, his worst points finish in eight years. After his only win of 1989, which {{came at the}} inaugural Sears Point event, Rudd departed the operation, and in 1990 he signed with Hendrick Motorsports to drive the No. 5 Chevrolet Lumina. He was able to win The Bud at the Glen and finished seventh in the point standings. However, {{he was involved in}} a fatal pit road accident in the season-finale Atlanta Journal 500, in which he spun into Bill Elliott's pit and crushed one of Elliott's <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> Mike Rich, killing him almost instantly. That fatal incident caused NASCAR to implement pit road speed limits at every NASCAR track, for all of the series.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{championship}} season, Elliott {{broke his}} wrist {{in a crash}} during testing at Daytona and required relief by Jody Ridley during several races {{in the first part}} of the 1989 season. Elliott won two poles and three races and finished sixth in the championship standings. In 1990, Elliott won one race and two poles and finished fourth in the championship standings. In the 1990 race at Atlanta, Elliott's rear <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> Mike Rich was killed when Ricky Rudd lost control of his car, spun, and slammed the crew member between his car and Elliott's. This forced NASCAR to restrict the cars' speed on pit road. The 1991 season saw Elliott's sponsorship change to Coors Light and the familiar red on the car was replaced with blue. Elliott won once in the Pepsi 400 and won two poles and finished eleventh in the championship standings during his last season with Mellings.|$|E
5000|$|Motorcycle <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> {{are less}} {{sophisticated}} than passenger cars and light truck or heavy-duty <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> because {{they deal with}} smaller and lighter tires and wheels. Motorcycle <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> mainly provide a simple bead loosening system and rim clamps powered manually. Certain motorcycle <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> can accommodate wheel diameters as small as 10" [...] and wheels at least 1-1/2" [...] wide. [...] In addition, small atv wheels and tires are used on motorcycle <b>tire</b> <b>changers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Heavy-duty <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> require larger {{equipment}} {{because these}} changers deal with larger, heavier tires and wheels. Heavy-duty <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> {{can work with}} some wheels up to 56 inches in diameter and tires up to 90.5 inches in diameter and 43 inches wide. Heavy-duty <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> are used for agricultural, off-road and construction vehicles. However, now, bigger versions of the heavy-duty <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> are designed to mount/demount tires up to 95 inches in diameter and also features a hydraulically operated self-centering four jaw chuck with clamping jaws that can clamp from 14 to 58 inches either from the wheel’s inside or from the center bore.|$|R
50|$|The first {{automatic}} <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> were invented, {{developed and}} produced at Big Four Industries in Mainville, Ohio.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Houston {{had been}} working on the #2 Ultra Motorsports Dodge for three years as <b>tire</b> <b>changer.</b> After the team closed in 2005, Houston went to work as a <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> for Morgan-Dollar Motorsports on Kraig Kinser's crew.|$|E

50|$|Since 2002, NASCAR has {{implemented}} a rule where {{all over the}} wall pit members are required to wear helmets, no visors needed, full fire suits, and gloves; while the gas man must wear a fire apron {{as well as the}} suit. While it is not required yet, it is recommended that <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> wear safety glasses to prevent eye injuries from lug nuts thrown off the car and fuel spills. Some <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> wear face shields or goggles.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1988, {{teams were}} allowed to have six crew members over the wall during a pit stop. The crews would consist of four <b>tire</b> <b>changers,</b> a fueler, and a fuel vent/airhose man. Previously they were only allowed five (i.e., three <b>tire</b> <b>changers).</b> This was {{due in part to}} the fact that after the series changed from {{bias-ply}} tires to radials, the left-front tire (which at the time was seldom changed) would now be changed much more frequently.|$|R
50|$|Simultaneously, {{the four}} <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> remove the wheels and install the new ones. IndyCar wheels are {{affixed to the}} hubs with a single lug nut, making it easier and faster to change them. After the tire changes are complete, the front <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> may use manual {{adjusters}} to adjust {{the angle of the}} car's front wing, remove debris from air intakes, or make other minor repairs. While the service is being completed by the over-the-wall crew, another crew member behind the wall may use a stick to offer the driver a refreshment.|$|R

50|$|A <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> is {{a machine}} {{used to help}} tire {{technicians}} dismount and mount tires with automobile wheels. After the wheel and tire assembly are removed from the automobile, the <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> has all the components necessary to remove and replace the tire from the wheel. Different tire changers allow technicians to replace tires on automobiles, motorcycles and heavy-duty trucks. New tire and wheel technology has improved certain tire changers {{to be able to}} change a low profile tire or a run-flat tire.|$|E

25|$|During a race, teams must pit {{several times}} for {{refueling}} and new tires. Teams are permitted six crew members {{over the wall}} {{at the start of}} the race; that consists of two <b>tire</b> <b>changers,</b> two <b>tire</b> carriers, a jackman, and a gas man. Once NASCAR gives the OK (usually once the leader begins lapping cars), a 7th crew member is permitted only to service the driver/windshield.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>changers</b> have a semi-automated bead {{loosening}} {{system for}} removing tires, {{but due to}} the high cost and lack of portability these are were not suitable. In addition beads frozen by heat and rust to the rim must often be broken free manually. In these case the bead breaker is ideal. Used like a chisel, a bead breaker leverages a mechanical advantage to drive the bead away from the rim.|$|R
50|$|This race began {{a series}} of changes to pit road {{procedure}} after the death of a Melling Racing rear <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> in a pit road accident at Atlanta the previous November.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Barnhart was the left-rear <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> on the pit crew of Unser, Jr.'s winning car. In 1993, {{he served}} as chief {{mechanic}} for Al Unser, Sr.'s King Racing, Kenny Bernstein-owned entry.|$|E
50|$|Pit {{road safety}} {{has become a}} major focus of NASCAR {{officials}} in recent years since the 1990 Atlanta Journal 500, where the rear <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> for Melling Racing was killed in a pit road crash.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Skills Challenges" [...] of the Sprint All-Star Race {{began with}} the May 14 Craftsman NASCAR All-Star Pit Crew Challenge at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte. A winning pit crew - the Jeff Burton #31 RCR team - and {{individual}} <b>tire</b> <b>changers,</b> carriers, and fuelers were crowned as champions of the skills challenge. For winning the event, the Burton team got the first pick on pit road.|$|R
50|$|As of 2015, Ravaglioli S.p.A. {{is one of}} the world’s top-ranking {{companies}} in the garage equipment industry, Europe’s leading manufacturer of lifts, and among the major manufacturers of tire testing equipment. Ravaglioli has a distribution net spanning over 150 countries over the world, including branches in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium, and Spain. Its primary products today include automotive lifts, wheel balancers, <b>tire</b> <b>changers,</b> wheel aligners, and complete test lanes.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 2002, it {{was only}} {{required}} that the crew member operating the fuel rig was to wear a helmet. It was to protect from fire {{in case of a}} fuel spill, and protect him in case he lost his balance. His position between the front and rear axles was deemed particularly precarious. The <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> did not wear helmets, {{despite the fact that they}} were more exposed and vulnerable to injury from other cars entering and exiting the pit lane.|$|R
50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure bleed valve. The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the <b>tire</b> <b>changer,</b> and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual bleed valve is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. The manual bleed valve allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the event}} had {{individual}} winners {{who were the}} best in each category: jack man, gas man, front tire changers, and rear tire changers {{with the addition of}} two tire carriers. The jack man competition was won by Jeff Keer, from Kasey Kahne's Hendrick Motorsports' No. 5 team, while the gas man competition was won by Tom Lampe, who was from Kyle Busch's Joe Gibbs Racing No. 18 team. Jeff Burton's Richard Childress Racing No. 31 team's front <b>tire</b> <b>changer,</b> Tim Sheets, and tire carrier JD Holcomb, who performed a record time of 13.615 seconds. The rear <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> and tire carrier competition was won be Jake Seminara and Kenny Barber from the No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing team.|$|E

50|$|Eury {{worked with}} Dale Earnhardt, Inc. from 1991 to 2007. In 1993, {{he became the}} car chief (and one of the <b>tire</b> <b>changers)</b> for Dale Earnhardt's NASCAR Busch Series team, working under his father, crew chief Tony Eury Sr. In the 2004, 2006, and 2008 seasons, Eury helped Dale Earnhardt Jr. get into the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup and {{challenge}} for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship. The 2004 season began with a win at the Daytona 500, the first of 6 wins that season.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the rules}} of the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) only five {{mechanics}} are permitted to work on the car. One man is permitted to fuel the car; all fuelling must be completed before any other service occurs. The other four mechanics on pit lane at any given time are typically two <b>tire</b> <b>changers</b> and two <b>tire</b> carriers, each of whom handles his task on only one side of the car. Automatic pneumatic jacks are used, integrated into the car itself. At all times the car's engine must be shut off during the stop, and may start only when the stop has concluded.|$|R
50|$|Parrott's {{career began}} in 1968 {{when he became}} a <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> for Huggins Tire, a Goodyear distributor. In 1970, Parrott worked under Harry Hyde for Bobby Isaac; that year Isaac won the Grand National championship. Parrott worked for Hyde's #71 team through 1974, then in 1975 he became the crew chief for Ferrel Harris.|$|E
50|$|Manion {{was born}} in Boylston, Massachusetts, United States. He helped Bobby Fuller in the NASCAR Winston Modified Series {{at the age of}} 14. His first job was {{cleaning}} the car plus general mechanic work. Eventually he was promoted to <b>tire</b> <b>changer.</b> Between 1988 and 1992 he worked as a crew chief for Chris Woods on Late Models at Riverside Park in Agawam, Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|Mark Martin {{actually}} {{rolled his}} car {{during the race}} due to an error by a new <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> (only 2 of 5 lugnuts were properly fastened on the car). Right after the car left the pits, the right rear came off, the car spun, hit the tire barrier and rolled onto its roof. However, {{he came back to}} finish the race in 31st, 5 laps down.|$|E
5000|$|Jeremy Fuller, rear <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> {{with the}} No. 5 team along with Dwayne Doucette and Jason Ingle, {{mechanics}} with the No. 24 team, each have been fined $25,000 and suspended from NASCAR through {{the completion of}} the next six NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship points races (They'll be eligible to return for the March 22, Auto Club 400 at Auto Club Speedway). All three were found to be in violation of: ...|$|E
50|$|Each pit crew group (fueler and an assistant, {{the front}} <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> and carrier as another group, the rear <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> and carrier as another group, and the jackman) was located at {{separate}} {{stations in the}} arena. For safety reasons, the fuel cans carried nine gallons of water, about the same weight as an eleven-gallon can of racing fuel. Upon the starting signal, the jackman would lift a car {{on the right side}}, then lower the car. The tire changers would change the tires of an already-lifted simulated car on their end (front or rear). Both moves were performed on the right side first, then the left. The fueler was required to unload the 18 gallons of water into a simulated fuel tank. When their duties were finished (a NASCAR official would approve) at their time, the six crewmen (the assistant to the fueler does not participate) ran to the start of a 40-yard (36m) dash where all crewmen had to push the car {{down the length of the}} arena where the nose of the car reaching the timing beam stops the clock.|$|E
50|$|After {{working with}} Stanley Smith's stock car team, Knaus became {{employed}} on the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports {{team led by}} crew chief Ray Evernham and raced by driver Jeff Gordon. From 1993 to 1997, Knaus advanced from being a general fabricator to managing the entire chassis and body construction program for the No. 24 team. Serving as a rear <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> on the original Rainbow Warriors pit crew, Knaus {{was a part of}} the 1995 and 1997 championship teams.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Labbe {{moved into}} the NASCAR Nationwide Series, working with driver Terry Labonte. In three seasons the team {{captured}} five victories. In 1994, Labbe joined Hendrick Motorsports, assuming the duties of front <b>tire</b> <b>changer</b> and mechanic for his No. 5 team in the Winston Cup Series. Labbe became the car chief {{in his second year}} with the organization and helped them win the Unocal pit crew championship and the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship in 1996.|$|E
