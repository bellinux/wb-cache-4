25|$|Changing {{times and}} the rise of {{television}} saw Mondt's influence in the sport diminishing. Mondt was an arena booker and was never able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> television like McMahon. That fact coupled with Mondt's gambling problems allowed his business-minded partner to muscle him out of ownership of the New York territory. Toots sold off his share to McMahon in the mid-60s. McMahon reduced Mondt to salaried employee for Capital. Mondt died nearly penniless on June 11, 1976 at the age of 82 after a long battle with an illness. Since then, he has been inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017 as a recipient of its Legacy Award.|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Ed Wood: Burton {{approached}} Depp and [...] "within 10 {{minutes of}} hearing about the project, I was committed," [...] the actor remembers. At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, {{it gave him a}} [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun", and working with Martin Landau, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting". Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through John Waters, who had shown him Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E
2500|$|When Erin {{started the}} {{audition}} process, the producers told her, [...] "Yeah she's a bad girl. We're gonna make her edgier." [...] While {{those were the}} intentions for the character, during Alderson's tenure, the writing strayed from that path. Hayley Erin found it easy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> the character describing Kiki as being [...] "so relatable." [...] She continued and compared Kiki to her former role as Abby Newman on The Young and the Restless: [...] "Abby was very one-dimensional... Kiki's got layers" [...] Erin said. The actress described the character as [...] "kind of tough" [...] yet [...] "sensitive." [...] Of the writings bringing back the character's edge, Erin said [...] "Now, it's fun" [...] and [...] "they made a character that a little foggy seem clearer." ...|$|E

A 25th-place finish at Richmond, 16th-place finish at Darlington, and 15th-place finish at Dover caused Martin to fall to 11th in the points standings, 293 points behind the leader.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-season finale, [...] "Dual", he injects {{himself with}} a power {{granting}} formula and gains a new, more limited mimicry ability called ability replication. He is once again able to mimic others' powers, but now he requires physical contact to do so, and can only retain one ability at a time, losing the previous power each time he gains a new one. Heroes producers Joe Pokaski and Aron Coliete {{said in an interview}} that, [...] "Peter is still trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> his powers. Just like during the first season, it’s going to take him some time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> these powers." [...] By the time of the episode [...] "Cold Wars", he has gained enough control over his mimicry that he can touch people without taking on their powers if he wants to.|$|E

50|$|Urban {{archaeological sites}} are complex affairs, often {{generating}} {{thousands of units}} of archaeological stratigraphy (contexts). It is of even more vital importance when excavating such sites to compile the matrix as the excavation progresses. Such sites by definition produce multi-linear sequences of succession and to date the best way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> of these sequences is to compile the matrix by hand, based on the drawings and the context sheets. This ensures an internally consistent record and that {{the complexity of the}} site is given due regard. Computer programmes do exist which can aid the production of a matrix, though at the moment these tend towards articulating linear sequences rather than multi-linear sequences.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gameplay}} received mixed {{to positive}} responses. Kaiser Hwang {{commented that the}} game [...] "borrows heavily from the Mario series." [...] However he complained {{that one of the}} [...] "irritating things about the game is that every time you start your game and begin a level, the game insists on showing you the same cutscene and voiceover." [...] He also said that the game has [...] "clever puzzles, and the levels have a good variety to them." [...] Kilo Watt of GamePro said that controlling Ty is [...] "a bit cumbersome with jumping being particularly tough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> on." [...] He also cited the camera angles as problematic, as well as detecting collisions in the game.|$|R

5000|$|With the reboot of {{the series}} 20 years later, Dan L. Hollifield of Aphelion {{had this to say}} about The Sacred Band: [...] "I was {{impressed}} with the lyrical quality of the writing.

5000|$|An initial book proposal, {{focusing}} {{primarily on}} Lolita Nation, was submitted by Milano to {{the editors of}} the 33⅓ book series.

5000|$|Once {{he has a}} {{cadre of}} Lensmen {{available}} to defend civilization, Samms uses them to begin tracing leads to the major threats to civilization. Corrupt politicians, illegal drugs, and pirates attacking merchant ships in space. To fight the crooked politics {{all they can do}} for the moment is gather evidence and hold it until the campaign and elections. The leads to the pirates hit a blank wall and stall (for now). Combating the drug traffickers yields the most success. Breaking the drug smuggling {{turns out to be the}} key <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> on all the other threats. As the Lensmen trace the trade in [...] "thionite", a mind-altering drug, from the source to the end user, they find the different leads all coming together, and all leading straight to the corrupt political machine that was then running North America.|$|R
5000|$|Next, Sheridan {{collaborated with}} her father Jim and sister Naomi on the script for In America, a film based on their {{memories}} of their family's years of poverty in New York, {{with the story of}} the death of Jim's younger brother woven in as an added element. Jim directed the film, which went on to success and earned several prestigious awards nominations, including an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Sheridan's latest film is 2007's August Rush, which stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell as star-crossed lovers and musicians, Freddie Highmore as their orphaned musical prodigy offspring, and Robin Williams as a Faginesque character. The Irish Times criticized the film as [...] "bounc(ing) around between so many forms, moods and genres that it proves impossible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> on," [...] while Variety called it [...] "utterly predictable, but with moments of genuine charm." ...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary theorists of {{constituent}} power recognise {{a tension}} {{in which the}} omnipotent novelty of constituent power is necessarily policed by constituted power. Beginning with Arendt’s claim that the categories of constitutional stability and political novelty should be thought together rather than treated as oppositional, this article presents an interpretation of her work that seeks to address this ‘paradox of constitutionalism’. Whilst commentators have come to assert that Arendt repudiates ‘absolutes’ in favour of an account of ‘relative beginnings’, this article demonstrates that Arendt’s argument involves a critical redescription of the absolute, rather than a repudiation. This is significant, for it illuminates {{the manner in which}} her account of founding seeks to dismantle the commonplace temporalisations we attribute to our political vocabulary. This is employed to argue that particular stylings of absolutes naturalise the appearance of the new only as temporal ruptures, allowing us <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> upon the paradox of constitutionalism, and to think tentatively beyond this paradigm...|$|R

5000|$|Andrew J. Robinson {{commented on}} DS9 not being {{as popular as}} its predecessors: [...] "It's not the most popular because it's the most morally ambiguous...

[...] Kaiser Haq called it [...] "... a highly interesting debut collection that bears the stamp of a distinctive, lively and worldly-wise sensibility."

In contrast to earlier efforts to model the economy structurally and to use constant adjustments and judgmental estimates for the exogenous variables, these systems are deliberately automatic and mechanical, simply translating available information into a statistically best estimate of current conditions.
