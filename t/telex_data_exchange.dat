40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>exchange</b> is {{the problem}} of {{transforming}} data structured under a schema, called the source schema, into data structured under another schema, called the target schema. Existing work on <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> considers settings where the source instance does not contain incomplete information. In this paper we study semantics and address algorithmic issues for <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> settings where the source instance may contain incomplete data. We investigate the query answering problem in such <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> settings. First we give two different meaningful semantics to certain answers: One via the certain answers in the corresponding complete <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> problems and the other via the set of all solutions of the corresponding complete <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> problems. We use the chase to compute a universal instance which is materialized over the target schema and is used to compute the certain answers to unions of conjunctive queries. We prove that computing certain answers (under both semantics) for unions of conjunctive queries can be done in polynomial time when the schema mapping contains constraints that consist of a weakly acyclic set of tuple-generating dependencies and equality-generating dependencies. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>exchange</b> {{and virtual}} <b>data</b> {{integration}} {{have been the}} subject of several investigations in the recent literature. At the same time, the notion of peer data management has emerged as a powerful abstraction of many forms of flexible and dynamic data-centere ddistributed systems. Although research on the above issues has progressed considerably in the last years, a clear understanding on how to combine <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> and <b>data</b> integration in peer data management is still missing. This is the subject of the present paper. We start our investigation by first proposing a novel framework for peer <b>data</b> <b>exchange,</b> showing that it is a generalization of the classical <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> setting. We also present algorithms for all the relevant <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> tasks, and show that they can all be done in polynomial time with respect to data complexity. Based on the motivation that typical mappings and integrity constraints found in data integration are not captured by peer <b>data</b> <b>exchange,</b> we extend the framework to incorporate these features. One of the main difficulties is that the constraints of this new class are not amenable to materialization. We address this issue by resorting to a suitable combination of virtual and materialized <b>data</b> <b>exchange,</b> showing that the resulting framework is a generalization of both classical <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> and classical <b>data</b> integration, and that the new setting incorporates the most expressive types of mapping and constraints considered in the two contexts. Finally, we present algorithms for all the relevant data management tasks also in the new setting, and show that, again, their data complexity is polynomial. Copyright 2007 ACM...|$|R
