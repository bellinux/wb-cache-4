40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present article is to {{highlight}} some differences between <b>traductology</b> and translations in order to compare two versions of translations into Italian of Gustave Guillaume work, namely his course dated 23 rd May 1957 “The humanising nature of language: linguistics and anthropology” (“Funzione umanizzante del linguaggio: linguistica e antropologia” in Principi di linguistica teorica, pp. 162) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{describe}} the pragmatic functions of attitudinal boosters that express the degree of a certain quality (ADCQs) in a parallel subtitle transcript corpus. Our review of literature revealed a dearth of information regarding accentuation in this genre of discourse, especially as it related to <b>traductology,</b> and with the English-Spanish language pair. In the conceptual framework, supportive theory was expounded regarding the functional approach to <b>traductology,</b> accentuation, and the communicative situation. Further, a methodological design which would permit the delimitation of the corpus of analysis was proposed. The analysis methodology which would later permit the analysis of extracted data {{was derived from the}} theory presented in the methodological design. Following each step of the methodology is a brief summary of the results of each phase of the investigation. Finally, the results, discussion, and conclusions are presented, recapitulating the objectives, the steps taken to reach them, and the answer that this investigation provided in response to the research question. Lastly, suggestions and recommendations related to the present, and future studies, are given...|$|E
40|$|The essay gives {{a survey}} of basic {{research}} directions in Serbian theolinguistics (in the fields of general linguistics, Serbian studies, Slavic studies and foreign philology), and presents the most important achievements in the fundamental and applicative fields {{of the study of}} the sacral language (from the synchronic perspective) which are presented in monographs, papers published in thematic anthologies, proceedings of scientific conferences and scientific journals in Serbia, Montenegro and the Republic of Srpska (with bibliographic references for the 2000 - 2013 period). Serbian theolinguistics, although in the stage of scientific constitution, potentially has a wide range of fundamental areas of study (some of the main issues from 2000 to 2013 were theoretical and methodological basis of theolinguistics, modern functioning of liturgical languages, confessional markedness of language levels, functional stylistics, genology and stylistics of resources, discourse theory) and spheres of application (lexicography, <b>traductology,</b> linguodidactics). Its perspective in the forthcoming period lies in strengthening the ties with leading centres of theolinguistics in the Slavic world and the integration of researchers of philological and theological profiles in order to further its development.
