5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those <b>two</b> <b>points</b> could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, <b>two</b> <b>points</b> must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points.

40|$|The {{implications}} of restricted conformal invariance under conformal transformations preserving a plane boundary are discussed for general dimensions d. Calculations {{of the universal}} function of a conformal invariant ξ which appears in the <b>two</b> <b>point</b> function of scalar operators in conformally invariant theories with a plane boundary are undertaken to first order in the = 4 -d expansion for the the operator ϕ^ 2 in ϕ^ 4 theory. The form for the associated functions of ξ for the <b>two</b> <b>point</b> functions for the basic field ϕ^α and the auxiliary field λ in the the N→∞ limit of the O(N) non linear sigma model for any d in the range 2 <d< 4 are also rederived. These results are obtained by integrating the <b>two</b> <b>point</b> functions over planes parallel to the boundary, defining a restricted <b>two</b> <b>point</b> function which may be obtained more simply. Assuming conformal invariance this transformation can be inverted to recover the full <b>two</b> <b>point</b> function. Consistency of the results is checked by considering the limit d→ 4 and also by analysis of the operator product expansions for ϕ^αϕ^β and λλ. Using this method {{the form of the}} <b>two</b> <b>point</b> function for the energy momentum tensor in the conformal O(N) model with a plane boundary is also found. General results for the sum of the contributions of all derivative operators appearing in the operator product expansion, and also in a corresponding boundary operator expansion, to the <b>two</b> <b>point</b> functions are also derived making essential use of conformal invariance.
