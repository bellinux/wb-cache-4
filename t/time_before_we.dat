500|$|At Moscow, Kennan {{found the}} {{atmosphere}} even more regimented than on his previous trips, with police guards following him everywhere, discouraging contact with Soviet citizens. At the time, Soviet propaganda charged the U.S. with preparing for war, which Kennan did not wholly dismiss. [...] "I {{began to ask}} myself whether... we had not contributed... by the overmilitarization of our policies and statements... to a belief in Moscow that it was war we were after, that we had settled for its inevitability, {{that it was only}} a matter of <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> would unleash it." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{said that}} the episode and [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] were filled with [...] "enough good gags that, together, they made for a very satisfying hour of comedy." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave this episode a 9.5 out of 10 rating, observing that [...] "...it {{will be a long}} <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> see anything funnier from 30 Rock". Canning said that despite the Tracy character not having too much screen time here [...] "his bits were funny, and his idea to add a woman to his entourage had a lot of potential", and noted that Liz/Randy's plot ended [...] "brilliantly" [...] when the story crossed over to Jenna/James Franco's storyline. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave it a positive review writing it was a [...] "good episode", and [...] "ot one of the best but it still had enough funny situations", and thanked NBC for broadcasting two episodes. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons remarked that the two episodes were terrific, and what stood out from both airings [...] "was how much serialized plot these two eps covered... For a show that's usually so episodic, it was an interesting—totally successful—change of pace." ...|$|E

5000|$|The inverse gambler's fallacy, {{named by}} philosopher Ian Hacking, is a formal fallacy of Bayesian {{inference}} {{which is an}} inverse of the better known gambler's fallacy. It is the fallacy of concluding, {{on the basis of}} an unlikely outcome of a random process, that the process is likely to have occurred many <b>times</b> <b>before.</b> For example, if one observes a pair of fair dice being rolled and turning up double sixes, it is wrong to suppose that this lends any support to the hypothesis that the dice have been rolled many <b>times</b> <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> can see this from the Bayesian update rule: letting U denote the unlikely outcome of the random process and M the proposition that the process has occurred many <b>times</b> <b>before,</b> <b>we</b> have ...|$|R
2500|$|Amber Milton Yeary, II (born 1938), a Laredo businessman, civic leader, Southern Baptist layman, and {{a former}} 25-year LISD board member, {{described}} his friend Treviño as [...] "a man of integrity and character {{with a passion for}} his life's work, totally dedicated to the children and his community.

[...] During a tour in Bethlehem he said, [...] "We are against {{all types of}} {{violence}} ... Our position has not changed.

60|$|Mr. Roundhand {{went through}} the book, and made it up {{nineteen}} hundred pounds in all. We were doing a famous business now; though when I came into the office, we used to sit, and laugh, and joke, and read the newspapers all day; bustling into our seats whenever a stray customer came. Brough never cared about our laughing and singing then, and was hand and glove with Bob Swinney; but that was in early <b>times,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were well in harness.|$|R

40|$|To recruit {{physicians}} into {{a clinical}} trial on hypertension management, we tried to reach 162 family doctors by telephone: 68. 2 % of our calls were answered; 22. 4 % of them raised busy signals; 9. 4 % were not answered at all. Fewer {{than half of the}} doctors came to the phone immediately or returned our first message within a week. We called the majority several <b>times</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> finally got to speak to them. A total of 950 calls were eventually placed <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had spoken to each of 161 family doctors person-to-person— 5. 9 calls per doctor. One physician could not be contacted. It appears, therefore, that family physicians are very well protected against the receipt of unsolicited telephone calls—even from professional colleagues...|$|R
40|$|Last year, {{my manager}} and I engaged in several fun conversations about the {{differences}} between cats and dogs. Although we adore both felines and canines, she is the proud parent of a greyhound and I live with two cats. Somehow our creative sessions merged into an idea of writing a play about cats and dogs. Although the concept of canine and feline rivalry has been used many <b>times</b> <b>before,</b> <b>we</b> wanted to put our own twist on the idea. We wanted the show to be big, fun and silly but with a message. We also wanted kids to associate the fun program with the library...|$|R
