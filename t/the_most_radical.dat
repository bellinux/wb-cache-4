5|$|France outlawed <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> {{political}} party, the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), on 13 July 1955. This {{prompted a}} long guerrilla {{war and the}} assassination of the party's leader, Ruben Um Nyobé. In the more peaceful British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Jadid's {{government}} was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> administration in Syria's history. The coup created a permanent schism between the Syrian and Iraqi regional {{branches of the}} Ba'ath Party and their respective National Commands, with many senior Syrian Ba'athists defecting to Iraq. As {{a legacy of the}} coup, during Jadid's rule, Syria initiated a propaganda campaign against the Iraqi Ba'athists. Jadid's government would be overthrown in the Corrective Movement of 1970, which brought Hafez al-Assad to power.|$|E
5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, reactionary {{conspiracy}} theorists, such as Scottish physicist John Robison and French Jesuit priest Augustin Barruel, began speculating that the Illuminati had survived their suppression {{and become the}} masterminds behind the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The Illuminati were accused of being subversives who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a revolutionary wave in Europe {{and the rest of}} the world in order to spread <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> ideas and movements of the Enlightenment—anti-clericalism, anti-monarchism, and anti-patriarchalism—and to create a world noocracy and cult of reason. During the 19th century, fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of the European ruling classes, and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 the very revolutions they sought to prevent.|$|E
5|$|Military {{architecture}} was {{the supreme}} {{expression of the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as an}} eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, especially in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni madrasas. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also inherited from the Fatimids like machicolations and round towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> {{feature of}} the {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E

Until 1974 a Trotskyist group, the Proletarian Left, led by Erik Meijer, now MEP for the Socialist Party {{operated}} {{within the party}} {{because they wanted to}} use the PSP to electrify the masses. In 1974 nearly all of them (except for their leader Meijer) left the party to found what later became the group Socialist Alternative Politics. In 1975 the moderate so called progressive cooperatives left the party. Many members of them joined the PvdA.|$|R

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} extensively {{in an attempt}} to rectify their machinery problems. All three ships had their propeller shafts lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not improve performance. Sebenico received <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> alteration; her stern was lengthened slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would improve her hydrodynamic shape, though this too failed to provide a significantly higher speed. As a result of her different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re-boilered.|$|E
5|$|Edward I died in 1307 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Edward II. The new King at first enjoyed the good will of his nobility, Valence among them. Conflict soon ensued, however, {{connected}} especially with the enormous unpopularity of Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston. Gaveston's arrogance towards the peers, and his control over Edward, united the Baronage {{in opposition to the}} King. In 1311 the initiative known as the Ordinances was introduced, severely limiting Royal powers in financial matters and in the appointment of officers. Equally important, Gaveston was expelled from the realm - as Edward I had already done once before. Pembroke, who was not among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> of the Ordainers, and had earlier been sympathetic with the King, had now realised the necessity of exiling Gaveston.|$|E
5|$|Several {{favorite}} son candidates had delegates {{interested in their}} nomination, although they were seen as having less of a chance of gaining the nomination. Alexander Campbell had represented Illinois in the House of Representatives several years earlier. He {{was seen as a}} pragmatist who represented the Greenback Party's more conservative members. Henly James {{was the head of the}} Grange in Indiana and had served in the state legislature there, but attracted little support outside his own delegation. In the Wisconsin delegation, many favored Edward P. Allis, an industrialist who owned the Reliance Iron Works. Allis was a longtime supporter of soft money, but had no experience in elected office. Finally, Solon Chase of Maine had some support from the New England delegations. Chase was a publisher of a Greenback newspaper, Chase's Inquirer, and had narrowly lost a House election in 1878. Chase was among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> of the Greenbackers, attracting support from the party's left-wing members.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resignation}} of the last Liberal Cabinet, PedroII invited the rival Conservative Party to form a new cabinet. With his party no longer in control, Paranhos lost much of his influence. The Liberal Party was not willing to accept its loss of power. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> faction of the Liberals in the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da Praia ("Party of the Beach"), openly advocated a rebellion. Nominally Liberal, the praieiros were associated with the Courtier Faction. The proposed rebellion would be an attempt of this branch of the Courtier Faction to regain control of the government. The praieiros had little support, and public opinion was also against them. The group was unable to convince {{the vast majority of the}} population that a revolt would bring them any benefits. On 2 February 1849, the limited uprising of the praieiros was completely defeated after attacking Recife, the capital of Pernambuco. Even though Paranhos had condemned it, the Praiera rebellion, combined with the downfalls of his patron and the Liberal Party, made a continued political career impossible. He turned his focus once again to his work in journalism.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he {{produced}} his final opera, Fennimore and Gerda (1908–10), like A Village Romeo and Juliet written in tableau form, {{but in his}} mature style. His choral works of the period, notably An Arabesque (1911) and A Song of the High Hills (1911) are among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains {{some of the most}} difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in {{the quantity and quality of}} Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to Hassan (1920–23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the civil war between {{grandfather}} and grandson, Andronikos III was successful in getting recognition for himself as junior emperor, with Thrace as his personal appanage. Throughout the conflict, Synadenos was among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> and uncompromising supporters of the younger Andronikos, favouring the eventual deposition of Andronikos II. During the course of the war, Synadenos defeated loyalist forces under Constantine Asen, and in the final round of the civil war, in 1327–28, he served as governor in Thrace. As more and more localities, including the Empire's second-most important city, Thessalonica, switched over to Andronikos III's camp, Synadenos along with Kantakouzenos urged Andronikos III to march on Constantinople and depose his grandfather outright. On the night of 13 May 1328, the three men led their army through a gate after bribing its guard, taking possession of the imperial capital without resistance. Andronikos II was forced to resign the throne and retire to a monastery, with his grandson succeeding him as sole emperor. For his services, Synadenos was promoted to protostrator sometime during the civil war, perhaps as early as 1321.|$|E
