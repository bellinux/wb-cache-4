5|$|If <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> given circles do not intersect, {{a center}} of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given circles become concentric.

In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E
