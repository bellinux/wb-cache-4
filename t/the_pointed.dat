30|$|The forming of {{the chain}} in the upper left region (R_ 3) is also {{illustrated}} as an example; see Fig.  4. Previously, seven points have been sorted in the descending order of x. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> P_ 1 is first checked; and obviously {{it is not an}} interior <b>point</b> according <b>the</b> rule presented in the Fig.  2 c. Similarly, it is also found that <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_ 2 is an exterior point and needs to be kept. However, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_ 3 is an interior point since its y coordinate is less than that of <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_ 2; and obviously, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_ 3 locates inside the triangle formed by <b>the</b> first <b>point</b> (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_maxx), <b>the</b> last <b>point</b> (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_maxy), and P_ 2. After discarding <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_ 3, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_ 4 can also be discarded, while both <b>the</b> <b>points</b> P_ 5 and P_ 6 are not exterior points. However, for that the coordinate y of <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_ 7 is less than that of <b>the</b> <b>point</b> P_ 6, it also should be removed.|$|R

5|$|Although central Leeds has few {{buildings}} {{from the}} Middle Ages, there are examples within the City of Leeds boundaries, including two at Wetherby. Wetherby Bridge {{dates from the}} Medieval period, but has been considerably altered, <b>the</b> <b>pointed</b> Gothic arches of different heights being replaced by semi-circular arches. It is said that the Bishop of York granted absolution of sins to local residents in return for building the bridge.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the i-th {{homotopy}} group, πi(X) {{begins with}} <b>the</b> <b>pointed</b> i-sphere (S'i,s), and otherwise follows the same procedure. The null homotopic class {{acts as the}} identity of the group addition, and for X equal to S'n (for positive n) — the homotopy groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and finitely generated. If for some i all maps are null homotopic, then the group πi consists of one element, and is called the trivial group.|$|E
5|$|The Gothic Revival {{church is}} in the Early English style. It is built from rubble masonry dressed with {{limestone}} and has a slate roof. The vestry is partially built from material used in the old church. The door in the vestry's north wall has medieval doorjambs, and the keystone of <b>the</b> <b>pointed</b> arch, which is also medieval, is a carved human face.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{suppose that the}} {{vertical}} isocline L: 1 - x - y/√(x)= 0 intersects the section ∑^p at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> E_ 0 ((1 - p)h, (1 -(1 -p)h)√((1 -p)h)).

Suppose {{that there is a}} positive constant q^* such that (1 +q)y_ 1 + α=(1 -(1 -p)h)√((1 -p)h). Then, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> F_ 1 ^+ coincides with <b>the</b> <b>point</b> E_ 0 for q=q^*, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> F_ 1 ^+ is above <b>the</b> <b>point</b> E_ 0 for q>q^*, and F_ 1 ^+ is under <b>the</b> <b>point</b> E_ 0 for q< q^*. However, on account of <b>the</b> <b>point</b> E_ 0 on the isocline L and the phase portrait of system (1.2), we find that <b>the</b> <b>point</b> F_ 2 is under <b>the</b> <b>point</b> F_ 1 for any q ∈ (- 1, q^*) ∪ (q^*, ∞).|$|R

5|$|The common {{thresher}} is {{a fairly}} robust shark with a torpedo-shaped trunk and a short, broad head. The dorsal profile of the head curves evenly down to <b>the</b> <b>pointed,</b> conical snout. The eyes are moderately large and lack nictitating membranes. The small mouth is arched and, unlike in other thresher sharks, has furrows at the corners. There are 32-53 upper and 25-50 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small, triangular, and smooth-edged, lacking lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with {{the fourth and fifth}} pairs located over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} common eland is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning {{the same as the}} Latin taurus. Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for pickaxe, referring to <b>the</b> <b>pointed</b> horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and scimitar-horned oryx.|$|E
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by <b>the</b> <b>pointed</b> end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E

5|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} the fortress' territory along the longitudinal axis. It belongs to the domed basilica type of churches, where the bearings join with the side-chapels of the apse. Two pairs of arches divided the longitudinal stretched prayer hall into three naves, the central one of which (with double side-chapels) on the eastern side ends with low staged, half-rounded apse and the side-chapels end with sacristies. They are characterized with stylish iconography, richness of theme and variety of different colors (where blue is dominant). The vertical axis of the building was crowned by a massive dome. <b>The</b> <b>pointed</b> dome with the cylindrical drum has not survived. It was damaged during Tamerlane's invasion and completely demolished in 1784 when the Avar Omar Khan invaded the Transcaucasus from Dagestan. In the 19th century, Viceroy of the Caucasus, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov built a semi-spherical wooden dome covered with iron sheets in place of the original dome. The dome was renovated during Soviet years.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc {{of the plain}} maskray is thin and diamond-shaped with narrowly rounded outer corners, measuring 1.1–1.3 times longer than wide. The leading margins of the disc are gently concave and converge at a broad angle to <b>the</b> <b>pointed</b> tip of the snout. The small eyes are placed close together, and behind them are the spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped flap of skin between them. The small mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor. Small papillae are also found around {{the outside of the}} mouth. There are five pairs of gill slits. The pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed.|$|E
5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to <b>the</b> <b>pointed</b> arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.|$|E

5|$|The {{face and}} the upper lips are reddish to pink, not dark brown to black as in M.mystacinus. Although most of the face is hairy, {{the area around the}} eyes is bare. The {{nostrils}} are heart-shaped, and their back end is broad, as in M.brandtii, not narrow as in M.mystacinus. Several glands are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch {{at the edge of the}} ear, and <b>the</b> <b>pointed</b> tragus (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch; the tragus is longer, extending beyond the notch, in both M.brandtii and M.mystacinus. The base of the inner side of the ear is white; it is much darker in M.mystacinus. The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size of the ear, tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes M.alcathoe from the slightly larger M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the feet are relatively larger than in M.mystacinus.|$|E

At <b>the</b> moment <b>the</b> <b>points</b> open, there is a much smaller gap, say about , across <b>the</b> <b>points.</b> Something must be done to prevent <b>the</b> <b>points</b> from arcing as they separate; if <b>the</b> <b>points</b> arc, then they will drain the magnetic energy that was intended for the spark plug. The capacitor (condenser) performs that task. The capacitor temporarily keeps the primary current flowing so the voltage across <b>the</b> <b>points</b> is below <b>the</b> <b>point's</b> arcing voltage. There is a race: the voltage across <b>the</b> <b>points</b> is increasing as the primary current charges the capacitor, {{but at the same time}} the points' separation (and consequent arcing voltage) is increasing. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> separation will increase to something such as , the maximum separation of <b>the</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
