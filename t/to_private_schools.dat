5|$|The electoral {{district}} of Perth was created {{as one of}} the initial 30 single-member districts, and one of only six in the Perth–Fremantle area. Its first member, who was elected on 10 December 1890, was Dr Edward Scott, a doctor by training who had been elected as Mayor of Perth the previous year. He resigned in December 1891, and was replaced at the resulting by-election on 12 January 1892 by Thomas Molloy. Molloy became embroiled in a controversy regarding provision of state aid <b>to</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools,</b> which he and fellow Catholic MLAs Timothy Quinlan and Alfred Canning supported. The Catholic Vicar General, Father Anselm Bourke, established the Education Defence League with their assistance. However, the issue became a major one in the 1894 election amongst the voting public, and all three MLAs lost their seats, Molloy losing to George Randell, a prominent Congregationalist who had led the cause against state aid. Randell became the Opposition Leader to Premier John Forrest, but stepped down from that role a year later in July 1895, and did not contest the 1897 election, which was won by a supporter of Forrest.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs and {{his wife}} lived in rented {{property}} for {{the first years of}} their marriage. His earnings placed them roughly in the bracket of lower middle class according to McKinstry: although more prosperous than he had been during his childhood, the family were not initially financially comfortable. Hobbs' wages increased with his reputation so that by 1913, he was earning £375 each year, placing his family within the bracket of the London middle class. After several years of moving from one property to another, he was able to buy his own house in 1913, in Clapham Common, a prosperous area of London. By the middle of the 1920s, cricket in England was extremely popular and the players were famous. Hobbs was the biggest attraction and a combination of his cricket earnings (estimated to be around £780 each year), the income from his business, product endorsement—he {{was one of the first}} cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial products—and ghostwritten books and articles made him relatively wealthy. According to McKinstry, his annual earnings probably reached £1,500 a year by 1925, more than a family doctor at the time. Consequently, in 1928 the family moved to a large house in private grounds and Hobbs was able to send his children <b>to</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools.</b> He had greater financial independence than most contemporary cricketers, but was always first concerned to give his family the security lacking from his childhood.|$|E

25|$|The Quebec {{public sector}} teachers' unions oppose {{any form of}} subsidy <b>to</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools.</b> They claim (1) that private schools select only the {{brightest}} and most capable students and reject children with learning difficulties; and argue (2) that by doing this they leave a burden to the public sector.

25|$|Another {{example of}} {{religious}} segregation causing greater society wide segregation {{can be seen}} in private schools. When parents choose to send their children <b>to</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools,</b> they are often religious institutions, and because religious institutions are often racially segregated, this means that students are in turn in racially segregated classrooms. There is some concern that an increase in the use of school vouchers in the United States will also then increase the number of students in segregated schools, as school vouchers are generally used to send children to private religious institutions.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} runs {{a number}} of public elementary and secondary-level schools, as youth in Guatemala do not fully participate in education.

Many middle and upper-class children go <b>to</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools.</b> Guatemala has one public university (USAC or Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala), and fourteen private ones (see List of universities in Guatemala).

Pre-school education is mostly limited to organised neighbourhood nursery schools with some organised chains. Montessori education is also popular, due to Maria Montessori's stay in India during World War II. In 2014, four of the top ten pre-schools in Chennai were Montessori.|$|E
