40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} fundus excyclotorsion after inferior oblique myectomy or myotomy. METHODS: The records of 21 patients undergoing strabismus surgery {{by a single}} surgeon between 2009 and 2012 were examined. Only patients who had undergone an inferior oblique myectomy or myotomy, with or without horizontal rectus muscle surgery, were evaluated. Digital fundus photographs were obtained, and the angle formed by a horizontal line passing through the optic disc center and a reference line connecting the foveola and optic disc center was measured. Associated clinical factors examined include age {{at the time of}} surgery, presence or absence of a head tilt, degree of preoperative vertical deviation, <b>torsional</b> <b>angle,</b> inferior oblique muscle overaction/superior oblique muscle underaction, and surgery laterality. Whether the procedure was performed alone or in combination with a horizontal rectus muscle surgery was also examined. RESULTS: Mean preoperative <b>torsional</b> <b>angle</b> was 12. 0 ± 6. 4 °, which decreased to 6. 9 ± 5. 7 ° after surgery (P < 0. 001, paired t -test). <b>Torsional</b> <b>angle</b> also decreased from 15. 1 ± 7. 0 ° to 6. 2 ± 4. 3 ° in the myectomy group (P < 0. 001, paired t -test) but there were no significant changes in the myotomy group (P = 0. 093, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that preoperative <b>torsional</b> <b>angle,</b> degree of inferior oblique overaction, and age at surgery independently and significantly affected postoperative <b>torsional</b> <b>angle.</b> CONCLUSION: Mean <b>torsional</b> <b>angle</b> decreased after inferior oblique myectomy.

This simple modification of backbone <b>torsional</b> <b>angles</b> reconciles experimental and theoretical views to provide a unified view of amide three-centered hydrogen bonds as crucial components of protein helices. The reason why they have been overlooked by structural biologists depends on the small crankshaft-like changes in orientation of the amide bond that allows maintenance of the overall helical parameters (helix pitch (p) and residues per turn (n)). The Pauling 3. 6 (13) α-helix fits the high-resolution experimental data with the minor exception of the amide-carbonyl electron density, but the previously associated backbone <b>torsional</b> <b>angles</b> (Φ, Ψ) needed slight modification to be reconciled with three-atom centered H-bonds and multipole electrostatics.
