5|$|Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa {{arrive at}} the beach, but {{discover}} {{that the ability to}} help the animals is reserved for celebrities, who are already doing the job. The two are put to work cleaning rocks, and soon abandon the job and drive home. While picking up Bart, Homer learns about <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burlesque house, but does nothing about Bart working there. Principal Skinner visits the house and sees Bart as the door greeter. He reports it to the Lovejoys and the Flanders, who confront Homer about the matter. Homer declares that he has no problem with Bart working there just as Marge returns home unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may not reflect <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{supernova}} remained obscure {{for some}} time. Observers slowly came {{to recognize a}} class of stars that undergo long-term periodic fluctuations in luminosity. Both John Russell Hind in 1848 and Norman Pogson in 1863 had charted stars that underwent sudden changes in brightness. However, these received little attention from the astronomical community. Finally, in 1866, English astronomer William Huggins made the first spectroscopic observations of a nova, discovering lines of hydrogen in the unusual spectrum of the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis. Huggins proposed a cataclysmic explosion as the underlying mechanism, and his efforts drew interest from other astronomers.|$|E

5|$|Urnula craterium, when {{grown in}} liquid culture, {{produces}} bioactive chemicals that inhibit {{the growth of}} other fungi that are pathogenic to aspen; specifically, these chemical are antagonistic to aspen blue-stain fungi Ophiostoma crassivaginatum and O. piliferum, {{as well as the}} wood-decay fungus Phellinus tremulae. Chemicals produced by U.craterium include pestalotin, 5,6-dehydropestalotin, 4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-pyran-2-one, and (4S)-3,4-dihydro-4,8-dihydroxy-1(2H)-napthalenone. However, none of these isolated compounds inhibits the aspen pathogens in vitro, suggesting <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antifungal mechanism in the devil's urn has not yet been resolved.|$|E
5|$|Bedsitcom {{documented}} {{the lives of}} six young adults living in a loft flat in London. Eight episodes in total were created, which {{were divided into two}} distinct halves. The first four episodes centred on the lives of Mel, Paul and Rufus, the three actors, as they lived in the flat with Bob, Dave and Shirine, the three unaware members of the public who believed they were taking part in a genuine reality TV show. After Bob, Dave and Shirine had learnt <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show at the end of episode four, they moved out and were replaced by three new members of the public named Barrington, David and Jessica. These three new cast members remained on Bedsitcom for the final four episodes.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, almost 150 {{years after}} the Byne's disease was first {{mentioned}} in the literature, Norman H. Tennent and Thomas Baird published an extensive study on the subject. Their deep analysis, involving many complex and sophisticated techniques such as X-Ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, finally revealed <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decaying process. They identified the substances involved (the calcium salts), {{as well as the}} chemical reactions that originated them. They concluded that Byne's disease is not actually a disease, and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in the presence of acidic vapors originating from the immediate environment in which the specimens are stored.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Clemens (Charles Dance) is Fury 161's doctor. When Ripley {{crashes into}} the oil sea, he nurses {{her back to}} health and shows her around. Clemens {{performs}} an autopsy on Newt at Ripley's request, although he is annoyed at not being told why. To gain Ripley's trust, Clemens admits that he got drunk after a long shift as a resident and accidentally killed eleven men being treated after a boiler explosion by misprescribing a painkiller. Sentenced to Fiorina 161, he served his time but remained behind with the other inmates when they refused to leave. Ripley still does not reveal <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events taking place; as Clemens injects her with a serum, the Alien kills him and drags his body away.|$|E
5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E
5|$|Week seven saw housemates {{take part}} in a Greek-themed {{shopping}} task with a twist, which involved Charlie and Rodrigo learning a routine by Stavros Flatley, a dance duo featured on Britain's Got Talent. However, playing Zeus, Halfwit was the only housemate aware of <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task. In each of three challenges he had to ensure, while still keeping the secret, that his chosen champion defeated the appropriate Greek god. He failed and the housemates received a basic shopping budget. Bea, Charlie, David, Dogface, Halfwit, Hira, Kenneth, Marcus, Noirin, Siavash and Tom all faced eviction. In the early hours of Day 50, Kenneth escaped from the House via the rooftop with help from Marcus, and this led to the eviction being cancelled.|$|E

5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers <b>the</b> <b>true</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with {{the data from the}} future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain {{for the rest of his}} life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E
