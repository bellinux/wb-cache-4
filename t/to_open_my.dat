She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> soul and heart".

2500|$|At age 16, Chmerkovskiy and {{his father}} opened a youth-oriented {{competitive}} dance studio, Rising Stars Dance Academy, {{on the second floor}} of a building his father owned in Ridgewood, New Jersey. Chmerkovskiy said he chose New Jersey because there was a plethora of dance studios that he disliked already established in Brooklyn. The studio relocated a few times until it ended up in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. He said in 2011 of choosing a New Jersey location, [...] "I didn't want to open a studio that would become just one of the studios in the area. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> studio somewhere where there was nothing like it and where people would look at it with no preconceived notions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crosby {{had lived}} for decades in such areas of Manhattan as Hell's Kitchen, the Bowery, and the Tenderloin. She {{was aware of the}} great needs of {{immigrants}} and the urban poor, and was passionate to help those around her through urban rescue missions and other compassionate ministry organizations. [...] "From the time I received my first check for my poems, I made up my mind <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> hand wide to those who needed assistance". Throughout her life, she was described as having [...] "a horror of wealth", never set prices for her speaking engagements, often refused honoraria, and [...] "what little she did accept she gave away almost as soon as she got it". She and her husband also organized concerts, with half the proceeds given to aid the poor. Throughout New York City, Crosby's sympathies for the poor were well-known, but consisted primarily of indirect involvement by giving contributions from the sale of her poems, and by writing and sending poems for special occasions for these missions to the dispossessed, as well as sporadic visits to those missions.|$|E
