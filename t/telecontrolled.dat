50|$|In territories {{such as the}} UK a core {{function}} of a DMS {{has always been to}} support safe switching and work on the networks. Control engineers prepare switching schedules to isolate and make safe a section of network before work is carried out, and the DMS validates these schedules using its network model. Switching schedules can combine <b>telecontrolled</b> and manual (on-site) switching operations. When the required section has been made safe, the DMS allows a Pemit To Work (PTW) document to be issued. After its cancellation when the work has been finished, the switching schedule then facilitates restoration of the normal running arrangements. Switching components can also be tagged to reflect any Operational Restrictions that are in force.|$|E

40|$|The {{use of the}} <b>telecontrol</b> {{protocols}} helps developing {{of control}} systems. Technical and commercial competitions produce several protocols with different functions and specifications. This leads International Electrotechnical Commission to create standard protocol for <b>telecontrol</b> systems. As {{a result of the}} development of communication systems, the International Electrotechnical Commission produced a series of <b>telecontrol</b> protocols IEC 60870 - 5 that contains several protocols for different purposes. The IEC 60870 - 5 - 101 is used to link two stations, primary and secondary stations, while the IEC 60870 - 5 - 103 is used specially to transfer signals and data of protection equipments. The IEC 60870 - 5 - 104 is used in <b>telecontrol</b> networks and can be easily connected to computer networks. For this simulation, the IEC 60870 - 5 - 101 was selected for its importance due to its widely spreading use among the <b>telecontrol</b> systems, and it is also considered as a base structure for modern <b>telecontrol</b> systems such as IEC 60870 - 5 - 104. The simulation was made by the Delphi programming language to link the primary and secondary stations using IEC 60870 - 5 - 101 protocol.

40|$|OBOTIC {{manipulator}} {{systems have}} been introduced in various surgical fields 4, 10 not only to enhance the surgeon’s dexterity in less invasive surgical procedures, but also to increase the safety and accuracy of surgery. Using mechanical devices {{that can only be}} furnished by robotic systems, these systems also make possible tasks that previously were impossible. 6, 10 An additional benefit {{lies in the fact that}} the robotic system can be <b>telecontrolled.</b> 18 The amount of surgical education and skill development provided to clinicians may soon become limited due to lowered surgical case volumes, especially in the face of the development of nonsurgical methods, the increasing numbers of neurosurgeons, and increasing social demands for highquality care. In the future, difficult tasks that cannot be managed without surgery will be treated by less experienced surgeons. To overcome the difficulties inherent in this circumstance, we must develop tools capable of managing complicated tasks in less experienced hands. 320 Although various stereotactic and endoscopic robotic manipulator {{systems have been}} introduced in neurosurgery, 1, 5, 9, 15 no practical robotic micromanipulator has been developed that can be used in routine microsurgical procedures. 11, 14, 17 Microneurosurgery in the deep surgical field should be the ideal indication for the use of robotic systems, which have the advantage of enhanced dexterity and accuracy.

40|$|The {{telecommunication}} networks of <b>telecontrol</b> systems in electric utilities have undergone an innovation process. This has removed {{many of their}} technical restrictions and {{made it possible to}} consider carrying out <b>telecontrol</b> tasks with general standard protocols instead of the specific ones that are used currently. These are defined in the standards 60870 - 5, 60870 - 6, and 61850 from the International Electrotechnical Commission, among others. This paper is about the implementation, using the services of general standard protocols, of the <b>telecontrol</b> application functions defined by the standard IEC 60870 - 5 - 104. The general protocols used to carry out <b>telecontrol</b> tasks are those used in the Internet: the telecommunication network-management protocol SNMPv 3 (simple network management protocol version 3), the clock synchronization protocol network time protocol and Secure SHell. With this new implementation, we have achieved, among others, two important aims: 1) to improve performance and, above all, 2) to solve the serious security problems present in the <b>telecontrol</b> protocols currently being used. These problems were presented by IEEE in an article published in the website of the IEEE Standards Association. In this paper, the use of general standard protocols to perform the <b>telecontrol</b> of electrical networks is justified.

40|$|The {{proposed}} project {{shows the}} results obtained in the implementation and testing in lacustrine and marine environment of an innovative laterals hydro floating tilting systems control for USV or remote/autonomous surface nautical vehicles. This vehicle {{is based on a}} pending patent belonging to Palermo University (Patent Pending RM 2012 A 000209 and RM 2012 A 000209). The system allows, during operation as a vehicle USV, set changes sailing trim and make turns with very narrow angle with little shunting movements. In fact the main benefits obtained were able to change or adjust the navigation structure by changing the tilt of one or two hydro floating during navigation without intervening directly on the flaps of the vehicle. Another benefit obtained by reversing the position of the two hydro floating {{is to be able to}} make the tight turn in very little room to maneuver and with little propulsion. The system allows, during operation as a vehicle USV, set changes sailing trim and make turns with very narrow angle with little shunting movements. The tilting system control allows a benefit of fuel or energy for electric vehicles and on the reduced space for maneuvering. The experimental tests were carried out on an <b>telecontrolled</b> electric power vehicle coupled with a jet propulsion, (USV) where the sensor telemetry on-line has allowed us to verify the effectiveness of the complete system, just during the performance of trim and maneuver of the vehicle. Then, the proposed system can be used for applications in all the fields of the nautical vehicle. The procedures applied in the present article, as well as the main equations used, are the result of previous applications made in different technical fields that show a good replicability (1 - 4, 14, 18 - 20) ...|$|E
40|$|Object Robotic surgery can {{be applied}} as a novel technology. Our {{master-slave}} microscopic-micromanipulator system (NeuRobot), which has a rigid endoscope and three robot-arms, has been developed to perform neurosurgical procedures, and employed successfully in some clinical cases. Although the master and slave parts of NeuRobot are directly connected by wire, {{it is possible to}} separate each part and to apply it to telesurgery with some modifications. To evaluate feasibility of NeuRobot in telesurgery, some basic experiments were performed. Methods The quality of telemedicine network system between Shinshu University and one of the affiliated hospitals, which was completely separated from other public network systems, was investigated. The communication delay was calculated from the transmitting and the receiving records in the computers set in each hospital. The relationship between the change in communication delay from the master part to the slave part of NeuRobot (0, 100, 300, 500 and 700 ms) respectively and feasibility of NeuRobot was investigated. The task performance time in each time changing group was compared. Feasibility of NeuRobot in telesurgical usage was evaluated. The master part and the slave part of NeuRobot placed in each hospital were connected through private network system. Interhospitally connected NeuRobot was compared with directly connected one in terms of task performance time. Results Less than 1 ms was required for corresponding the data in a steady transmitting state. Within 2 seconds after connection, relative time delay (maximum 40 ms) and packet loss were sometimes observed. The mean task performance time was significantly longer in over 500 ms delayed group compared with directly connected NeuRobot. There {{was no significant difference in}} the task performance time between directly connected NeuRobot and interhospitally connected NeuRobot. Conclusion Our results proved that telesurgical usage of NeuRobot was feasible. Telesurgical usage of <b>telecontrolled</b> manipulator system is recommended for application in a private network system in order to reduce technical and ethical problems.

5000|$|In year 1974, packet {{switching}} was a technology known only in research circles. The concept started by year 1968 associated to the USA's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) research project ARPAnet. The idea of applying the {{packet switching}} concept to electric utilities control communication networks {{first appeared in}} 1974 when the Swedish Power Utility Vattenfall started to create its TIDAS packet switching network [...] and {{it was followed by}} the Spanish electric utility ENHER, which was targeting to <b>telecontrol</b> and automate its high voltage power network. With that goal ENHER created a specific team of people for developing both the packet switching network and the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system also named <b>telecontrol</b> system. In year 1978 the first four TRAME routers were already available [...] and in year 1980 eight of them were already deployed and operating. [...] The printed circuit boards (PCBs) controlling the communication lines were connected to a shared memory PCB allowing them to exchange data and messages. The project was developed together with its main initial application, the <b>Telecontrol</b> or SCADA system SICL (Sistema Integral de Control Local) [...] with which initially they shared a very similar hardware. By year 1980 the maximum link capacity was 9.600 bit/s which in 1980 was the maximum possible on a voice channel of 4 kHz width. These channels were the basic unit of the then analog communication systems in use. By that time power utilities used either telephone calls or low speed (below 1200bit/s) dedicated links for <b>telecontrol,</b> typically shared among ten high voltage electrical substations.|$|R
