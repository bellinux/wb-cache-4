5|$|<b>That</b> <b>shot</b> {{was totally}} and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} gunpowder attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the gunpowder ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, ground porcelain and iron filings. The flame <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> from the lance reached a distance of three meters. The heated tinder that ignited the weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the gunpowder was consumed, the fire lance could be wielded like a normal spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with gunpowder.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren wanted <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for <b>that</b> <b>shot.</b> Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot was the first one they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E

5000|$|Six local villagers, {{including}} a young boy, {{were reported to}} have been injured by gunfire from the rescuing U.S. forces, Although a Marine spokesperson aboard USS Kearsarge denied <b>that</b> <b>shots</b> were fired: [...] "The Osprey is not armed, and the Marines barely got off the aircraft. I was in the landing center the whole time, where we were monitoring what was going on, and firing was never reported", Pentagon sources were later reported to have confirmed <b>that</b> <b>shots</b> were fired.|$|R
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Jiyuan {{was hit by}} a {{multitude}} of shells, disabling her forward-mounted Krupp gun and severely damaging all the structures above her armour belt. Captain Fang gave orders to flee at full speed towards Waihaiwei, with Yoshino in pursuit. Reports differed on why Jiyuan was not overtaken by the faster Japanese cruiser, with one claim stating that Jiyuans aft mounted Krupp gun scored a hit on the bridge of the Yoshino, and another indicating <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> was fired by the Kuang Yi. While Jiyuan got away, the Kuang Yi fought against the remaining two cruisers until she was holed and sinking, at which point she was beached to allow her crew to escape. As the Tsi Yuan headed to Weihaiwei, she passed the Kowshing which was still heading to Korea. The troop ship was stopped by the Japanese, and after prolonged negotiations she was sunk with loss of a great number of the troops and crew on board.|$|E
5|$|Nielly {{recognised}} Bligh's intentions {{as soon as}} Canada {{began to}} move however, and interposed his division so that they blocked Hamilton's manoeuvre, both ships of the division now firing on Hamilton's ship. Bligh was thus isolated, Alexander falling further behind Canada. At 11:00, the French ship Jean-Bart was able to draw close enough to Alexander to discharge its main broadside at the British vessel, the two ships engaging in a fierce duel for 30 minutes, both suffering damage. At 11:30 Jean-Bart sheered away from the engagement, assisted by a French frigate, and its place {{was taken by the}} next French ship in line, Tigre. Tigre could not pull directly alongside Bligh's ship, but was still able to attack the British ship with heavy fire, receiving a battering in turn <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> away the French ship's main and mizen topmasts and inflicted severe damage to its rigging.|$|E
25|$|There were 104 ear {{witnesses}} in Dealey Plaza {{who were on}} record with an opinion as to the direction from which the shots came. Fifty-four (51.9%) thought <b>that</b> all <b>shots</b> came {{from the direction of}} the Texas School Book Depository. Thirty-three (31.7%) thought <b>that</b> all <b>shots</b> came from the area of the grassy knoll or the triple underpass. Nine (8.7%) thought <b>that</b> all <b>shots</b> came from a location entirely distinct from the knoll or the depository. Five (4.8%) thought <b>that</b> they heard <b>shots</b> from two locations, and 3 (2.9%) thought <b>that</b> the <b>shots</b> came from a direction consistent with both the knoll and the depository.|$|R
50|$|A reason many box {{scores and}} stat sheets list {{the number of}} scoring chances is to {{differentiate}} between <b>shots</b> <b>that</b> are relatively easy saves for the goaltender (<b>shots</b> <b>that</b> are not scoring chances) and <b>shots</b> <b>that</b> are not easy saves (<b>shots</b> <b>that</b> are also scoring chances).|$|R

5|$|On 26 August 1940, 5K+AR {{was taking}} part in a raid by KG 2 and KG 3, {{targeting}} the RAF stations RAF Debden and RAF Hornchurch. While flying over clouds, the aircraft became separated from the bomber formation and lost its bearings; it was then attacked by Boulton Paul Defiant fighters of No. 264 Squadron RAF. One of the Dornier's engines was disabled and the other damaged, so the wounded pilot, Feldwebel (Flight Sergeant) Willi Effmert, elected to make a crash landing on the Goodwin Sands. He and another crew member survived and were taken prisoner. The other two crew were killed; one is buried at Cannock Chase German war cemetery and the other in the Netherlands. The identity of the Defiant <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> down the Dornier is not certain – it may have been one of three 264 Squadron aircraft that was shot down soon after in a battle with Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter escorts from Jagdgeschwader 3.|$|E
5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E
5|$|Bows of {{any kind}} seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian {{laminated}} bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records {{of any kind}} are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> them has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; {{there is no indication}} that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, 50–70cm long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|E
50|$|Mary Moorman {{said in a}} TV {{interview}} {{immediately after}} the assassination that there were three or four <b>shots</b> close together, <b>that</b> <b>shots</b> were still being fired after the fatal head <b>shot,</b> and <b>that</b> {{she was in the}} line of fire. In 1967, Josiah Thompson concluded <b>that</b> four <b>shots</b> were fired in Dealey Plaza, with one wounding Connally and three hitting Kennedy.|$|R

5|$|Upon commissioning, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet, together with , under the command of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta. She was tasked to support Operation AL, an attack planned to seize several Aleutian Islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while {{the main body of the}} American fleet was occupied defending Midway. Jun'yō carried 18 A6M2 Zeros and 18 D3As for this operation. At dawn on 3 June, she launched 9 Zeros and a dozen D3As to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. They had to turn back due to bad weather, although an American PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by a Zero. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. As the aircraft from Jun'yō were regrouping after the attack, they were attacked by 8 Curtiss P-40 fighters <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> down 2 Zeros and a pair of D3As while losing 2 of their own. Another D3A got lost and failed to make it back to the carrier. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the company}} went public on 12 July 1973, as J Sainsbury plc, the company was wholly owned by the Sainsbury family. It {{was at the time}} the largest ever {{flotation}} on the London Stock Exchange; the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible. A million shares were set aside for staff, which led to many staff members buying shares <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> up in value. Within one minute the list of applications was closed: £495million had been offered for £14.5million available shares. The Sainsbury family at the time retained 85% of the firm's shares.|$|E

25|$|After a while, the {{old lady}} {{returned}} to the cave and noticed Yūkei's departure, whereupon her appearance transformed into that of a fearsome onibaba and then started to give chase at a furious speed. The onibaba caught up and was right behind Yūkei. In this time of desperation, Yūkei took out his statue of Nyoirin Kan'non Bosatsu (a form of Guanyin) from his pack and started to desperately chant a sutra. As he did so, the Bosatsu statue started to dance up into the sky, forming a shining demon-slaying pure white bow and a vajra (indestructible substance) arrow <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> and slew the onibaba.|$|E
25|$|Hawk survives but lapses into a coma. General Joseph Colton {{returns to}} fill in for Hawk as {{commander}} of the team. While in a coma, Hawk has a dream that he was finally retiring and settling down with his wife Carolee, who in reality was long dead. He then visits Cobra Commander in prison, and the two argue before Cobra Commander moves from the shadows to reveal Hawk's face. When Hawk wakes up, he learns that he has an unretractable bullet lodged in his spine, which has left him paralyzed below the waist. This experience makes him a bit crazed, intensifying his hatred for Cobra Commander. Unknown to Hawk, it was not Cobra Commander <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> him, for Zartan had switched places with the Commander shortly before the incident.|$|E
25|$|On May 26, the {{conclusions}} were publicised {{of an investigation}} into the spy plane downings conducted by a fact-finding team of the UN Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). It found that the fighter plane <b>that</b> <b>shot</b> down a spy plane on April 20 had indeed been Russian. The fact-finding team judged that both Georgian air radar data and the video footage were authentic. Based on the fighter jet's twin-tail marking and the location of the air intakes, it concluded that the aircraft seen on the video was either a MiG-29 or a Su-27. Given this, and given the fact that after the shootdown, the radar record showed the aircraft heading north towards Maykop/Krasnodar into Russian airspace, {{and in the absence of}} any evidence to the contrary, the fact-finding team concluded that the aircraft belonged to the Russian air force.|$|E
5000|$|Foote denied {{making the}} claim that Duggan had fired at police, saying he was [...] "surprised" [...] that early reports of the {{incident}} described a [...] "shoot out".

50|$|He quotes {{many more}} {{witnesses}} than Donahue or Menninger as having believed <b>that</b> <b>shots</b> were fired at ground level, and observes {{a pattern of}} concealment of evidence. His conclusion, like those of Reppert and of Menninger, is that Donahue is correct in both the broad theory and the details.|$|R
50|$|The second {{mechanism}} is <b>that</b> <b>shots</b> hitting sloped armour {{are more likely}} to be deflected, ricochet or shatter on impact.
