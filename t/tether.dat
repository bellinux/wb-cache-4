5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his <b>tether</b> and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the <b>tether</b> gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the <b>tether</b> to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E

40|$|Rab small G-proteins control {{membrane}} trafficking events {{required for a}} multitude of processes including secretion, lipid metabolism, antigen presentation, and growth factor signaling. Rabs recruit effectors that mediate diverse functions including vesicle <b>tethering</b> and fusion. However, many mechanistic questions about Rab-regulated vesicle <b>tethering</b> are unresolved. Using chemically defined reaction systems we discovered that Vps 21, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of mammalian endosomal Rab 5, functions in trans with itself and {{with at least two}} other endosomal Rabs to directly mediate GTP-dependent <b>tethering.</b> Vps 21 -mediated <b>tethering</b> was stringently and reversibly regulated by an upstream activator, Vps 9, and an inhibitor, Gyp 1, which were sufficient to drive dynamic cycles of <b>tethering</b> and de-tethering. These experiments reveal an unexpected mode of <b>tethering</b> by endocytic Rabs. In our working model, the intrinsic <b>tethering</b> capacity Vps 21 operates in concert with conventional effectors and SNAREs to drive efficient docking and fusion. Vesicle and organelle <b>tethering</b> are reversible recognition events that precede docking and bilayer fusion. <b>Tethering</b> also mediates transient contacts that allow materials such as lipid...|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} control the librational motion of a <b>tethered</b> {{satellite}} system in an elliptic orbit is presented. To simplify the analysis, gravity is treated as the only external force affecting the <b>tethered</b> satellite system, only in-plane motion is considered, and the flexibility and mass of <b>tethers</b> are neglected. The <b>tethered</b> satellite system treated in this paper consists of two subsatellites and a mother satellite, such as the space shuttle, connected together in series via massless <b>tethers.</b> This type of <b>tethered</b> satellite system has very important applications in Earth observation, space observation, communications, and satellite constellations. The librational motion of the <b>tethered</b> satellite system in an elliptic orbit {{is known to be}} chaotic and can be stabilized to undergo periodic motion by the delayed feedback control method. The periodic motion of a <b>tethered</b> satellite in a circular orbit is employed as the reference trajectory for tracking by the actual <b>tethered</b> satellite, which is in an elliptic orbit. The decoupling and model tracking control methods, based on differential geometric control theory are combined with the delayed feedback control method in a new approach to controlling the librational motion of the <b>tethered</b> satellite system in elliptic orbits. The results of numerical simulations show that the proposed control scheme has good performance in controlling the librational motion of a <b>tethered</b> satellite system in an elliptic orbit...|$|R

40|$|Rab GTPases are master {{regulators}} of eukaryotic endomembrane systems, particularly {{functioning in}} membrane <b>tethering</b> to confer the directionality of intracellular membrane trafficking. However, how exactly Rab GTPases themselves act upon membrane <b>tethering</b> processes has remained enigmatic. Here, we thoroughly tested seven purified Rab GTPases in human, which localize {{at the various}} representative organelles, for their capacity to support membrane <b>tethering</b> in vitro. Strikingly, we found that three specific human Rabs (endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi Rab 2 a, early endosomal Rab 5 a, and late endosomal/lysosomal Rab 7 a) strongly accelerated membrane aggregation of synthetic liposomes {{even in the absence}} of any additional components, such as classical <b>tethers,</b> <b>tethering</b> factors, and Rab effectors. This Rab-induced membrane aggregation was a reversible membrane <b>tethering</b> reaction that can be strictly controlled by the membrane recruitment of Rab proteins on both apposing membranes. Thus, our current reconstitution studies establish that membrane-anchored human Rab GTPases are an essential <b>tethering</b> factor to directly mediate membrane <b>tethering</b> events...|$|R

40|$|Homotypic {{fusion of}} {{endoplasmic}} reticulum membranes {{is driven by}} atlastin GTPases; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, using a FRET-based single-vesicle fusion assay with liposomes bearing the yeast atlastin Sey 1 p, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of atlastin-mediated membrane <b>tethering</b> and fusion. Although Sey 1 p-bearing proteoliposomes frequently underwent membrane <b>tethering</b> in a GTP hydrolysis-dependent manner as reported in studies using bulk assays, {{only a small fraction}} of the <b>tethered</b> liposomes proceeded to fusion. Strikingly, the rest of the <b>tethered</b> liposomes failed to fuse or dissociate. This stable <b>tethering,</b> however, did not require continued GTP hydrolysis because GTP omission and magnesium chelation did not disrupt <b>tethering.</b> Interestingly, an increased Sey 1 p density on the membrane markedly accelerated <b>tethering</b> but barely affected the fusion rate of the <b>tethered</b> liposomes, indicating that Sey 1 p requires additional factors to support efficient fusion in vivo. Finally, the assay also revealed that Sey 1 p-mediated liposome fusion occurs through hemifusion, suggesting the mechanistic conservation between biological membrane fusion events despite the existence of diverse fusogens...|$|R

5|$|Development work on {{the castle}} continued. There was {{extensive}} restoration of the medieval masonry in 1921, with architect John Grant rebuilding the South Gate and the barbican tower, and reconstructing the medieval West Gate and town wall alongside the castle, with the Swiss Bridge being moved in 1927 {{to make room for}} the new West Gate development. Further archaeological investigations were carried out into the Roman walls in 1922 and 1923, leading to Grant redesigning the northern Roman gatehouse. The second half of the castle stables were finally completed. The Animal Wall was moved in the 1920s to the west side of the castle to enclose a pre-Raphaelite themed garden. The grand staircase in the main range was torn out in the 1930s. During World War II, extensive air-raid shelters were tunnelled out within the medieval walls, with eight different sections, able to hold up to 1,800 people in total, and the castle was also used to <b>tether</b> barrage balloons above the city.|$|E

30|$|Because {{the chain}} {{conformation}} {{is dependent on}} the molecular weight and surrounding environmental conditions such as temperature, solvent quality and other factors, the reduced <b>tethering</b> density (ÏƒÌƒ) is more generally used instead of <b>tethering</b> density, Ïƒ.

5|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the identification of}} the tethers between the mitochondrial and ER membranes suggest that the scaffolding function of the molecular elements involved is secondary to other, non-structural functions. In yeast, ERMES, a multiprotein complex of interacting ER- and mitochondrial-resident membrane proteins, is required for lipid transfer at the MAM and exemplifies this principle. One of its components, for example, is also a constituent of the protein complex required for insertion of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins into the lipid bilayer. However, a homologue of the ERMES complex has not yet been identified in mammalian cells. Other proteins implicated in scaffolding likewise have functions independent of structural tethering at the MAM; for example, ER-resident and mitochondrial-resident mitofusins form heterocomplexes that regulate the number of inter-organelle contact sites, although mitofusins were first identified for their role in fission and fusion events between individual mitochondria. Glucose-related protein 75 (grp75) is another dual-function protein. In addition to the matrix pool of grp75, a portion serves as a chaperone that physically links the mitochondrial and ER Ca2+ channels VDAC and IP3R for efficient Ca2+ transmission at the MAM. Another potential <b>tether</b> is Sigma-1R, a non-opioid receptor whose stabilization of ER-resident IP3R may preserve communication at the MAM during the metabolic stress response.|$|E

Though many Decepticons are provided with jobs and fall into line, Bombshell continues with mysterious experiments that result in Prowl, {{at the end of his}} <b>tether</b> and increasingly emotionally closed-off, executing him. Fortunately, Ironhide is able to prevent chaos by successfully petitioning to have the I/D chips installed in the Decepticons turned off, restoring a sense of equality. Ironhide then recruits the Dinobots to join him in venturing into the wilderness to searching for the missing Aerialbots, only to go missing themselves. It is while they are being searched for by the other Autobots, Decepticons and NAILs that something else is discovered instead: a Metrotitan has returned to Cybertron, and it dubs Starscream the destined leader of the Transformer race. Before Starscream can exploit this new standing to any great extent, Megatron makes a surprising return and is taken into custody, causing the Decepticons to riot in the streets. It turns out that Megatron has secretly been working with a small team of Decepticons within Iacon to perfect the combination process, and he creates a new, more-powerful Devastator out of the Constructicons and Prowl, who has been under the mind-control of the still-living Bombshell. Ironhide, the Dinobots and the Aerialbotsâ€”now Superionâ€”make a triumphant return to take Devastator down, while Megatron himself is neutralized by a failsafe created by Wheeljack.
