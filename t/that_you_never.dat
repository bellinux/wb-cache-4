500|$|... "Without" [...] premiered on American {{television}} on November 12, 2000 on Fox. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.0, {{meaning that it}} was seen by 9.0% of the nation's estimated households, and was viewed by 9.07 million households, and 15.1 million viewers. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline [...] "Once in a great while a story takes a turn <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> expect... Tonight {{this is one of}} them." [...] The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 3 – Colonization, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien Colonist's plans to take over the earth.|$|E

[...] You never saw a killer. [...] And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in my own life. [...] For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, 'Hey, he just {{died in a plane crash}} – that's a little weird.' [...] We wrote that version of that experience into the script." ...|$|E
500|$|S. Saraswathi of Rediff called [...] "Nilaave Vaa" [...] a [...] "timeless classic <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> tire of". Sruthi Radhakrishnan of The Hindu {{described}} [...] "Mandram Vandha" [...] as a [...] "song {{that drives}} fans crazy", and [...] "Chinna Chinna Vanna Kuyil" [...] "showcased Janaki's vocals with such astounding effect". About [...] "Panivizhum Iravu", she said: [...] "It's {{one of those}} only-80s songs {{that served as a}} stand-in for sexual tension, where you'd have two people looking intensely at each other. And it's a brilliant composition too. The percussion gets you hooked and the chorus is almost eerie." [...] For Firstpost, Apoorva Sripathi said: [...] "The film traces a couple's marital discord— the heroine is torn between the man she loved and the man she finally marries— and the soundtrack beautifully mimics it." [...] She called [...] "Mandram Vandha" [...] a [...] "masterpiece, sung soulfully by SP Balasubramaniam." [...] Sify praised the songs, the background music and the re-recording, calling Ilaiyaraaja the [...] "king of re-recording".|$|E

500|$|Tipping the Velvet {{was adapted}} into a BBC {{television}} drama serial {{of the same}} name, originally screened in three episodes on BBC Two in 2002. It was produced for the BBC by the independent production company Sally Head Productions, and starred Rachael Stirling as Nan, Keeley Hawes as Kitty, Anna Chancellor as Diana, and Jodhi May as Florence. The BBC had previously adapted Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1990 and some other scenes in dramas to follow, but none had been so explicit. Sally Head Productions defended the decision to air the entire program uncut. Waters was quite surprised that the BBC chose to produce and broadcast a television adaptation that faithfully followed the relish and detail of sexual escapades in the book. Stirling thoroughly enjoyed the role, despite her avowed heterosexuality: [...] "To counteract any hard-core sex within it, there's a huge sense of humour and a huge sense of fun and frivolity and joy of life. It was so utterly believable <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> for a moment thought, Fuck, there's no reason why I'm standing here naked." ...|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E
500|$|Martin Campbell {{spent three}} days of {{preparation}} on the [...] "Box" [...] set, analyzing it from every angle to learn {{the feel of the}} room. Fontana comes from a playwriting background, and [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] involves long lengths of dialogue in a single setting, much like a play. The actors shot about 14 pages of dialogue each day, and had a very small amount of rehearsal time before shooting. According to Fontana, Campbell never shot a scene from the same angle twice, [...] "So the entire hour keeps changing {{the point of view of}} the camera, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> get tired of being in that room." [...] While filming the episode, Campbell would shoot single scenes with multiple pages of long dialogue, then film the scene again from another angle. Braugher said the experience felt more like staging a play than shooting a television episode, and allowed for a feeling of spontaneous human emotion in the performances. Although the dialogue in the final episode did not stray from the original script, Fontana said Campbell and the actors came up with the rhythm and pacing of the performances largely on their own, particularly during the fast-paced questions when Pembleton and Bayliss team up on Tucker.|$|E

500|$|Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 11 reviews. The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] is an enjoyable season finale that manages {{to deliver a}} few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends." [...] James Queally from The Star-Ledger commented about the season and its finale, [...] "After a wildly uneven first nine episodes... and two red-hot episodes {{leading up to the}} finale... "Afterbirth" [...] starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, [...] "Afterbirth" [...] turns into a wandering epilogue." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "Part of the fun of those early episodes – even when I really didn't like them – was <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> quite had a good sense of what the hell kind of show you were watching. The finale sticks us into {{what seems to be a}} pretty basic setup for season two." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Afterbirth" [...] "an exhilarating shocker." [...] Matt Fowler at IGN gave the episode a score eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He stated, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] was a very odd finale and I'm pretty sure that it was nothing like most of us thought it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+, considering {{that despite the}} [...] "convoluted plot" [...] the episode [...] "pays off in white-knuckle tension." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club labeled the episode as a [...] "good" [...] stand-alone story. He described it as [...] "a memorable episode, due {{in no small part}} to its humor", praising the [...] "simultaneously absurd and frightening" [...] story with scenes that make the viewer [...] "snicker even as you shudder". In addition, Handlen praised William Sanderson's performance, as well as the ending, calling it [...] "the punchline [...] of Mulder's deepest fears, a group [...] so secret <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> be sure they exist at all". Starpulse named the episode the tenth best of the series, defining it as [...] "very creepy" [...] and what turned The X-Files [...] "from a mere creepfest to a show that offered real psychological thrills". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. [...] The two wrote positively of the episode's flourishes, noting [...] "minute by minute, there is tons to enjoy." [...] However, Shearman and Pearson argue that the premise is [...] "disjointed and not a little frustrating" [...] {{due to the lack of}} overall coherence and narrative. The plot for [...] "Blood" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin, under the title Fear.|$|E
500|$|Mike Higgins of The Independent {{deemed the}} episode [...] "a {{technical}} triumph", praising the [...] "smooth, almost flawless" [...] and [...] "fluent" [...] production. Shane Donaghey of The Belfast Telegraph {{also called the}} episode a [...] "triumph", opining {{that it could not}} possibly have lived up to the hype surrounding the storyline, but that transmitting live gave EastEnders [...] "an energy it normally lacks, with great violence, excellent direction". He summarised: [...] "the story gripped so well you forgot to look for the cock-ups, before a genuinely shocking denouement <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> saw coming amid all of the hype." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was [...] "a slight let-down" [...] and [...] "a little bit predictable", calling the episode [...] "a triumph of logistics over logic". However, Stacey wrote that aside from the [...] "damp-squib" [...] ending, [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] was [...] "surprisingly enjoyable [...] even for a committed 'Endersphobe like self." [...] She felt that transmitting live [...] "added a tangible layer of tension" [...] to proceedings, lamenting: [...] "If only EastEnders was this exciting all the time." [...] The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith similarly felt that transmitting live made for [...] "tension, not clarity", commenting that bookmakers would be [...] "absolutely delighted" [...] with the outcome, but that viewers would be [...] "incredulous". [...] Cate Devine of The Herald was similarly critical, describing the episode as [...] "30 minutes of cheesy dramatic counterpoint", and highlighting the [...] "ropey lighting and poor sound effects." ...|$|E

500|$|The pilot episode {{received}} acclaim {{from television}} critics. TV Guide's Matt Roush praised {{the marriage of}} Scorsese and Winter, saying it [...] "... brilliantly marries Martin Scorsese's virtuosic cinematic eye to Terence Winter's panoramic mastery of rich character and eventful story," [...] and finished his review by stating [...] "It's the most purely—and impurely—enjoyable storytelling HBO has delivered in ages, like a movie <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> want to end." [...] Variety's Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying [...] "This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot that—for all the able competition—still remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch... For those wondering when the channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put {{it on top of}} the world, Ma, the wait is over: Go directly to [...] "Boardwalk."" [...] "One of the unexpected joys of [...] "Boardwalk Empire," [...] though, lies in the way the show revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep the liquor flowing," [...] says online magazine Salon's Heather Havrilesky who went on to call the pilot [...] "breathtaking." [...] Roberto Bianco from USA Today said in his review that Boardwalk Empire was [...] "Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, Boardwalk Empire {{brings us back to the}} world's former playground at the start of Prohibition—and brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race." ...|$|E
500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E
