50|$|In {{the case}} where all the {{neighbouring}} trajectories approach the limit cycle as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> infinity, it is called a stable or attractive limit cycle (ω-limit cycle). If instead all neighbouring trajectories <b>approach</b> it as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> negative infinity, then it is an unstable limit cycle (α-limit cycle). If there is a neighbouring trajectory which spirals into the limit cycle as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> infinity, and another one which spirals into it as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> negative infinity, then it is a semi-stable limit cycle. There are also limit cycles which are neither stable, unstable nor semi-stable: for instance, a neighboring trajectory may approach the limit cycle from the outside, but {{the inside of the}} limit cycle is approached by a family of other cycles (which wouldn't be limit cycles).|$|R

I came to see this type of reflective walking as Wandering, which I define as walking that becomes pedagogical in its imaginative call to slowness and reflection.

This <b>timed</b> <b>approach</b> to learning, and the stresses it brings, is what brought me to the autobiographical examination of the possibilities of wandering as reflection. I begin with a look at historical connections between walking and thinking. I then discuss my modes of inquiry: narrative, poetic and performative.

This approach {{can also be used}} to predict behavior of any response function in molecular as well as spin glasses. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Wind farms (WFs) {{contribution}} in frequency deviations curtailment is a grey area, especially when WFs replace large conventional generation capacities. This study offers an algorithm to integrate hydro-pumped storage station (HPSS) to provide inertial and primary support, during frequency drops by utilising stored wind energy. However, wind turbines follow maximum power tracking, {{and do not}} apply frequency support methods, thus the wasted wind energy is mitigated. First, HPSS rated power and energy capacity are determined based on several givens, including wind speed and load characteristics. Thus, HPSS major aspects are estimated [e. g. pump(s), reservoir layout and generator(s) ]. Second, offered algorithm coordinates energy storage, and releasing through several dynamic and static factors. HPSS output is continuously controlled through a <b>timed</b> <b>approach</b> to provide frequency support. A hypothetical system is inspired from Egyptian grid and real wind speed records at recommended locations to host WFs. Case studies examine the algorithm impact on frequency recovery, at 40 % wind power penetration. The responses of thermal generation and HPSS are analysed to highlight the influence of tuning {{the parameters of the}} proposed algorithm. The assessment of several frequency metrics insures the positive role of HPSS in frequency drops curtailment. Simulation environments are MATLAB and Simulink...|$|E

In discrete <b>time</b> <b>approach</b> the accelerators with memory are described by discrete maps with memory, which are derived from the fractional-order differential equation without approximations.

40|$|The {{inversion}} of a Levy measure {{was first introduced}} (under a different name) in Sato 2007. We generalize the definition and give some properties. We then use inversions to derive a relationship between weak convergence of a Levy process to an infinite variance stable distribution when <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> zero and weak convergence of a different Levy process as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> infinity. This allows us to get self contained conditions for a Levy process to converge to an infinite variance stable distribution as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> zero. We formulate our results both for general Levy processes and for the important class of tempered stable Levy processes. For this latter class, we give detailed results {{in terms of their}} Rosinski measures...|$|R
