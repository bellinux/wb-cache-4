40|$|A {{follow-up}} study {{of those students}} who exited the Manpower Office Training Program at Southern Utah State College, Cedar City, Utah, {{during the period from}} September l, 1974, through August 31, 1976, was conducted. Of the 49 students contacted, 48 responded to the questionnaire. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the extent to which the curriculum of the Manpower Office Training Program at Southern Utah State College, Cedar City, Utah, met the needs of the students. The majority of the Manpower Office Training Program students obtained employment in the related clerical/secretarial field upon completion of the program. Personal Development - Human Relations ski ll was most beneficial to students employed in the related and unrelated clerical/secretarial field. <b>Transcribing</b> from <b>Transcribing</b> <b>Machines</b> skill was least beneficial to students employed in the related area, and the majority of the skills were least beneficial to students employed in the unrelated area. The Human Relations course was most beneficial to students employed in the related and unrelated clerical/secretarial field. The Exploring Clerical Careers course was least beneficial to students employed in the related area, and the majority of the courses were less beneficial to students employed in the unrelated area. In the related and unrelated areas, students indicated they were satisfied with the current training program curriculum. In the related area, the majority of the students indicated they were adequately prepared for initial employment. In the unrelated area, the majority of the students indicated they were not adequately prepared for initial employment...|$|R

5000|$|Henry Mill (c. 1683-1771) was an English {{inventor}} who patented {{the first}} typewriter in 1714. He {{worked as a}} waterworks engineer for the New River Company, and submitted two patents during his lifetime. One was for a coach spring, while the other was for a [...] "Machine for <b>Transcribing</b> Letters". The <b>machine</b> that he invented appears, from the patent, to have been similar to a typewriter, but nothing further is known. Other early developers of typewriting machines include Pellegrino Turri. Many of these early machines, including Turri's, were developed to enable the blind to write.|$|R
50|$|Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.S. 647 (2011), is a {{significant}} 6th Amendment Confrontation Clause case decided by the United States Supreme Court. On June 23, 2011, the Supreme Court considered the issue whether a defendant's Confrontation Clause rights extend to a non-testifying laboratory analyst whose supervisor testifies as to test results that the analyst <b>transcribed</b> from a <b>machine.</b> In a five to four decision authored by Justice Ginsburg, the Court held that the second surrogate analyst could not testify about the testimonial statements in the forensic report of the certifying analyst under the Confrontation Clause.|$|R
40|$|A study {{reports a}} set of {{labelling}} criteria which {{have been developed to}} label prosodic events in clear, continuous speech, and proposes a scheme whereby this information can be <b>transcribed</b> in a <b>machine</b> readable format. A prosody in a syllabic domain which is synchronized with a phonemic segmentation was annotated. A procedural definition of syllables based on the grouping of phones is presented. The criteria for hand labelling the prominence of each syllable, tone-unit boundaries and the pitch movement associated with each accented syllable, are described. Work to automate this process is presented and experimental results evaluating its performance are included. (Three tables of data are included; contains 18 references.)

40|$|We {{report a}} set of {{labelling}} criteria which {{have been developed to}} label prosodic events in clear, continuous speech, and propose a scheme whereby this information can be <b>transcribed</b> in a <b>machine</b> readable format. We have chosen to annotate prosody in a syllabic domain which is synchronised with a phonemic segmentation. A procedural definition of syllables based on the grouping of phones is presented. The criteria for hand labelling the prominence of each syllable, tone-unit boundaries and the pitch movement associated with each accented syllable, are described. Work to automate this process is presented and experimental results evaluating its performance are included. I. INTRODUCTION The need for a large corpus of prosodically labelled English speech is motivated by the use of prosodic events in training speech synthesisers, in automated foreign language pronunciation teaching, and to aid parsers used in speech recognition to disambiguate phonetically similar, but syntactically diffe [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{automatically}} estimating {{probability of}} indi-vidual words of Japanese English (JE) being perceived correctly by American listeners and clarifying {{what kinds of}} (combina-tions of) segmental, prosodic, and linguistic errors in the words are more fatal to their correct perception. From a JE speech database, a balanced set of 360 utterances by 90 male speakers are firstly selected. Then, a listening experiment is done where 6 Americans are asked to transcribe all the utterances. Next, using speech and language technology, values of many segmen-tal, prosodic, and linguistic attributes of the words are extracted. Finally, relation between transcription rate of each word and its attribute values is analyzed with Classification And Regression Tree (CART) method to predict probability {{of each of the}} JE words being <b>transcribed</b> correctly. The <b>machine</b> prediction is compared with the human prediction of seven teachers and this method is shown to be comparable to the best American teacher. This paper also describes differences in perceiving intelligibility of the pronunciation between American and Japanese teachers. 1...|$|R

In this paper, we describe {{a method to}} enhance the readability of the textual output of a large vocabulary speech recognizer when out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words occur. The basic idea is (i) to mark, in the transcriptions of the speech recognizer, the words which are uncertain and (ii) to replace these words with phoneme strings generated by a phoneme recognizer and to convert the phonemes to graphemes. This paper concentrates on the second step: we show that the phoneme strings can be reasonably reliably <b>transcribed</b> orthographically using <b>machine</b> learning techniques. More specifically: (i) we show baseline performance of a machine learning approach to phoneme-to-grapheme conversion when different levels of artificial noise are added (simulating phoneme recognizer errors), (ii) we provide results on real phoneme recognition data, and (iii) we provide a detailed error analysis. The experiments show that, even when the grapheme strings are not fully correct, the resulting transcriptions are more easily readable than the original ones. status: publishe...|$|R

V. (12 th computational linguistics in The Netherlands meeting - CLIN 2001, November 2001, Enschede, The Netherlands). In this paper, we describe a method to enhance the readability of out-of-vocabulary items in the textual output in a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system. The basic idea is to indicate uncertain words in the transcriptions {{and replace them with}} phoneme recognition results that are post-processed using a phoneme-to-grapheme (P 2 G) converter. We concentrate on the final step, P 2 G conversion: we show that the phoneme recognition results can be reasonably reliably <b>transcribed</b> orthographically using <b>machine</b> learning techniques. More specifically, (i) we present experimental results of a machine learning approach to P 2 G conversion, and compare these results with an estimation of the upper and lower baseline performance, (ii) we give an error analysis and list some examples of the converter’s output, (iii) we investigate spelling correction as post-processing of the orthographic transcriptions, and (iv) we report on the interaction of the P 2 G converter with a speech recognizer. status: publishe...|$|R
