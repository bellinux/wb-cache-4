500|$|Mahler made {{arrangements}} with the impresario Emil Gutmann for the symphony to be premiered in Munich {{in the autumn}} of 1910. He soon regretted this involvement, writing of his fears that Gutmann would turn the performance into [...] "a catastrophic Barnum and Bailey show". Preparations began early in the year, with the selection of choirs from the choral societies of Munich, Leipzig and Vienna. The Munich Zentral-Singschule provided 350 students for the children's choir. Meanwhile, Bruno Walter, Mahler's assistant at the Vienna Hofoper, was responsible for the recruitment and preparation of the eight soloists. Through the spring and summer these forces prepared in their home towns, before assembling in Munich early in September for three full days of final rehearsals under Mahler. His youthful assistant Otto Klemperer remarked later on the many small changes that Mahler made to the score during rehearsal: [...] "He always wanted more clarity, more sound, more dynamic contrast. At one point during rehearsals he turned <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'If, after my death, something doesn't sound right, then change it. You have not only a right but a duty to do so.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to set the}} game four thousand years before [...] {{was one of the}} first details about the game made known. LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. [...] "LucasArts came <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that we could do an [...] game," [...] BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. [...] "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before." [...] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom. They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor. Concept work had to be sent to [...] "the ranch" [...] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: [...] "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So it was all very feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with." [...] Zeschuk said that [...] "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like we had enough freedom to truly create something wonderful." ...|$|E
6000|$|The plain {{was covered}} with grass tall as ripe wheat and when my father stopped his team and came back <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Well, children, here we are on The Big Prairie," [...] we looked about us with awe, so endless seemed this spread of wild oats and waving blue-joint.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was the doubt," [...] said Margaret, [...] "but papa said {{he would}} answer for it nothing would happen <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> mamma <b>said</b> {{if you would be}} so kind." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Titmarsh," [...] said Lady Fanny, {{laughing}} to me, [...] "who is {{that great}} fat curious man, {{the master of}} the house? Do you know he asked me if you were not related <b>to</b> <b>us?</b> <b>and</b> I <b>said,</b> 'Oh, yes, you were.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|On seeing this, Peterkin turned with a grave face <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's {{my opinion}} that these birds are all stark, staring mad, {{and that this is}} an enchanted island. I {{therefore}} propose that we should either put about ship and fly in terror from the spot, or land valorously on the island and sell our lives as dearly as we can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He flatly {{refused to}} give it <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> we {{had no right to}} unlock his drawers. He was so angry that he even {{declared}} it was lucky for us he was too weak to rise from his bed. I answered civilly that our duty obliged us to examine the drawer, and that if he still declined to produce the key, he would only oblige us to take the table away and have the lock opened by a smith.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{said her}} hostess, with the duly {{impressive}} emphasis of a privileged chronicler, [...] "we've always regarded Claire as the marrying {{one of the}} family, so when Emily came <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I've got some news for you,' we all said, 'Claire's engaged!' 'Oh, no,' said Emily, 'it's not Claire this time, it's me.' So {{then we had to}} guess who the lucky man was. 'It can't be Captain Parminter,' we all said, 'because he's always been sweet on Joan.' And then Emily said--" ...|$|E
60|$|So {{then he was}} in a fidget for {{the rain}} to let up, so we could turn out and run across some of the people and see if they would say {{anything}} about it <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> <b>And</b> he <b>said</b> if they did we must be horribly surprised and shocked.|$|R
6000|$|He said it placidly, but it {{took our}} breath {{for a moment and}} made our hearts beat. He did not seem to notice that, but mended our halberdiers and things with a touch, handing them <b>to</b> <b>us</b> finished, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Don't you remember?--he was an angel himself, once." ...|$|R
6000|$|George's {{meeting with}} Mr. Will {{was not known}} for some days in Dean Street, for he {{did not wish to}} disturb those kind folks with his quarrel; but when the ladies were made aware of it, you may be sure there was a great flurry and to-do. [...] "You were {{actually}} going to take a fellow-creature's life, and you came <b>to</b> see <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> not a word! Oh, George, it was shocking!" [...] said Theo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly he is a saint," [...] {{said one}} of the gentlemen, who had come down from the room where Coligny was lying. [...] "He {{suffered}} atrociously {{in the hands of the}} surgeon, for he had come without his instruments, and amputated Coligny's fingers with a dagger so blunt that it was only on the third attempt that he succeeded. Merlin, his minister, was by his side, with several of his most intimate friends. We were in tears at the sight of our noble chief thus traitorously struck down. He turned <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> calmly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, let's {{hope that}} they don't find out {{anything}} about it," [...] I replied, to change the subject. Then taking Roderick by the hand I led him to where Maqueda stood a yard or two apart, listening to our talk, but, of course, understanding very little of it, and introduced him to her, explaining in a few words the wonderful thing that had happened. She welcomed him very kindly, and congratulated me upon my son's escape. Meanwhile, Roderick had been staring at her with evident admiration. Now he turned <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in his quaint broken English: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That we {{have managed}} already, captain," [...] Medart replied. [...] "As I told you, I spoke to Emile Moufflet {{the first morning}} I went ashore, {{and he said that}} it was at the {{magazines}} that his chum was employed. Yesterday evening he came <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that if I gave him the two thousand francs that you had given me for the purpose, he would hand us over two barrels of powder, at eleven o'clock last night. We got them; and carried them, as you told us, to Brenon's; and helped him to bury them in his shed. We also got, as you ordered, a couple of yards of fuse." ...|$|E
5000|$|In October 1982, Van de Kamp {{petitioned the}} court to allow the burial of all but the 193 late-term fetuses in common graves at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery, which offered free burial. The fetuses were not buried at Valhalla, which later stated it offered the burial plot because [...] "the right-to-life groups came <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> we <b>said</b> we wouldn't endorse any {{political}} viewpoint, but we thought that interring the bodies was a proper thing {{to do as a}} service".|$|R
2500|$|The Chernobyl {{disaster}} {{occurred at}} the same time that the cast and crew were filming scenes in Ukraine, forcing them to evacuate the area and postpone shooting for a month. In a 2008 Details interview, Christian Bale briefly recalled their evacuation and subsequent return: [...] "We knew something had occurred, because production came <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> they <b>said,</b> 'We're done. We have to leave.' A month later we were back. We would have somebody with a Geiger counter at every dinner, scanning each plate".|$|R
5000|$|On 6 February 2012, Wang {{traveled}} <b>to</b> the <b>U.S.</b> {{consulate in}} Chengdu.

[...] The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledged on 9 February 2012 Wang's visit <b>to</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Consulate, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that the matter was [...] "under investigation".|$|R
6000|$|... "You are badly hurt, lad, {{and must}} lie {{perfectly}} quiet. Luckily the messenger who {{was sent to}} fetch a doctor, seeing Mr. Curtis and me walking up the street, ran up <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that a young officer of our ship was hurt, {{and that he was}} sent in to fetch a doctor. He had, in fact, already seen one, and was in the act of returning with him when he met us. Of course I introduced myself to the French doctor as we came along together, for we fortunately got hold of a trap directly, so that no time was lost. The black boy who brought the message told me that you and a young lady had been bitten by a great hound belonging to his master, and that you had killed it. Now, my lad, I am going to cut off your coat and look at your wounds. The Frenchman is attending to the young lady." ...|$|E
60|$|We had not marched far, but our scouts brought {{word they}} had {{discovered}} some horse, {{but could not}} come up to them, because a river parted them. At the heels of these came another party of our men upon the spur <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> the enemy was behind, which might be true for aught we knew; {{but it was so}} far behind that nobody could see them, and yet the country was plain and open for above a mile before us. Hereupon we made a halt, and, indeed, I was afraid it would have been an odd sort of a halt, for our men began to look one upon another, as they do in like cases, when they are going to break; and when the scouts came galloping in the men were in such disorder, that had but one man broke away, I am satisfied they had all run for it.|$|E
6000|$|Here {{are a few}} of {{the gifts}} to the Institution {{selected}} very much at random:--One gentleman leaves it a legacy of 10,000 pounds. Some time ago a sum of 5000 pounds was sent anonymously by [...] "a friend." [...] There comes 100 pounds as a second donation from a sailor's daughter, and 50 pounds from a British admiral. Five shillings are sent as [...] "the savings of a child"; 1 shilling, 6 pence from another little child, in postage-stamps; 15 pounds from [...] "three fellow-servants"; 10 pounds from [...] "a shipwrecked pilot," [...] and 10 shillings 6 pence from [...] "an old salt." [...] Indeed, we can speak from personal experience on this subject, because, among others, we received a letter, one day, in a cramped and peculiar hand, which we perused with deep interest, for it had been written by a blind youth, whose eyes, nevertheless, had been thoroughly opened to see the great importance of the lifeboat cause, for he had collected 100 pounds for the Institution! On another occasion, at the close of a lecture on the subject, an old woman, who appeared to be among the poorest of the classes who inhabit the old town of Edinburgh, came <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Hae, there's tippence for the lifeboat!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Nine {{petitions}} {{were filed}} in supreme court requesting for a stay of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Bill, 2013 tabling in parliament. The supreme court later rejected the pleas saying, [...] "We {{do not think}} this is the appropriate stage for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> interfere". <b>And</b> <b>said</b> they would take them up later.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 February 2012, Wang {{traveled}} <b>to</b> the <b>U.S.</b> {{consulate in}} Chengdu.

6000|$|Long {{before sunset}} an Indian came up <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> smilingly <b>said,</b> [...] "You hoss--come." [...] And {{a few minutes}} later the young ty-ee came riding into town leading [...] "Major Grunt," [...] well as ever, but a little sullen. He had taken the back trail till he came to a narrow and {{insecure}} bridge. There he had turned up the stream, going deeper and deeper into the [...] "stick," [...] as the Siwash called the forest. I paid the reward gladly, and Major took his place among the other horses with no sign of joy.|$|R
60|$|We {{were now}} {{put in a}} coaster, and sent to Halifax by water. We were in irons, but {{otherwise}} were well enough treated. We were kept in the Navy-yard guard-house, at Halifax, several hours, and were visited by a great many officers. These gentlemen were curious to hear our story, and we let them have it, very frankly. They laughed, and said, generally, we {{were not to be}} blamed for trying to get off, if their own look-outs were so bad as to let us. We did not tell them, however, by what means we passed out of the prison-barracks. Among the officers who came and spoke to us, was an admiral, Sir Isaac Coffin. This gentleman was a native American, and was then in Halifax to assist the Nantucket men, whom he managed to get exchanged. His own nephew was said to be among them; but him he would not serve, as he had been captured in a privateer. Had he been captured in a man-of-war, or a merchantman, he would have done all he could for him; but, as it was, he let him go to Dartmoor--at least, this was the story in the prison. The old gentleman spoke very mildly <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he could not blame us for attempting to escape. I do not think he had ever heard of the twelve pounds; though none of the navy officers were sorry that the privateer's-men should be punished. As for us, we considered them all enemies alike, on whom it was fair enough to live in a time of war.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with the BBC, Steen said: [...] "At three she heard a lullaby by Richard Strauss, and she came <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> '...how can music be so beautiful?' She {{was struck by the}} beauty of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Robin also recalls, [...] "We {{recorded}} 'Run to Me' and Andy Williams cut {{it on his}} LP. If Andy Williams came up <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> write a {{song and}} we wrote 'Run to Me' for him, he probably wouldn't have recorded it. But we recorded it and then he recorded it." ...|$|E

'Waiter,' said Bullfinch piteously, 'we have been a long time waiting.' The waiter who ought <b>to</b> wait upon <b>us</b> laid the blame upon the waiter who ought not <b>to</b> wait upon <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it was all that waiter's fault.|$|R

60|$|Effie <b>said</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> we <b>said</b> nothing <b>to</b> Effie, {{except to}} show her Chung's note next morning in a casual, off-hand fashion. Two days later a note came for us from the Embassy in Chung's pretty incisive handwriting. It {{contained}} copious excuses for his hasty departure, and a few lines {{to say that he}} was ordered back to China by the next mail, which started two days later. Marian and I talked it all over, but we could think of nothing that could be of any use; and after all, we said to one another, poor Chung might be mistaken about the probable fate that was in store for him.|$|R

And that's why those albums, and especially 'Thriller', sound so incredible.

60|$|Riley has a ready wit, a {{quickness and}} aptness at {{selecting}} and applying quotations, and a countenance {{that is as}} solemn and as blank as {{the back side of}} a tombstone when he is delivering a particularly exasperating joke. One night a negro woman was burned to death in a house next door <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> Riley <b>said</b> that our landlady would be oppressively emotional at breakfast, because she generally made use of such opportunities as offered, being of a morbidly sentimental turn, and so we should find it best to let her talk along and say nothing back--it {{was the only way to}} keep her tears out of the gravy.
