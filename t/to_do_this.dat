5|$|In 1901 Churchill {{bought a}} factory in Griffin Court, Chapel Street, Salford, {{initially}} as a facility to tool up the imported machinery. It {{was not the first}} British company <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> as Sharp, Stewart & Co had built American machinery under license since at least 1873.|$|E
5|$|There was {{consideration}} that Aer Lingus {{would take over}} the Little Red routes under their own brand with the Little Red fleet repainted. However they declined <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> stating that they wanted more flexibility with the returned aircraft to support their current fleet and operation.|$|E

5|$|Agrippa's {{death in}} 12BC {{elevated}} Tiberius and Drusus {{with respect to}} the succession. At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was very reluctant <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> as Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Dutton {{explained}} that his present object was to induce {{the friends of}} the family to prevent annoyance by preserving the furniture and personals at a valuation; and Mr. Egremont readily agreed <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> though he said the sisters and stepmother were well able also <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their share.|$|R
5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their gills {{in order for them}} to breathe, however not all species need to be moving <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> Those that are able to breathe while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E
5|$|Another {{objective}} {{to finding}} and defeating Malkil in Wizards & WarriorsIII {{is to find}} four secret gems which will unlock the hidden passage through the town of Piedup to the castle's throne room where the evil wizard is located. <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> Kuros must rescue King James' three princesses who are hidden somewhere in Piedup; each of them will grant Kuros a gem and agree to marry him when rescued. The final gem is obtained by defeating a dragon in the town's underworld.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E

5|$|By early July 1907 Shackleton {{had secured}} little {{financial}} support beyond Beardmore's guarantee and was lacking {{the funds to}} complete the refit of the ship. In mid-July he approached the philanthropic Earl of Iveagh, otherwise known as Edward Guinness, head of the Anglo-Irish brewing family, who agreed to guarantee the sum of £2,000 (updated value £) provided that Shackleton found other backers to contribute a further £6,000. Shackleton was able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> the extra funds including £2,000 from Sir Philip Brocklehurst, who paid this sum to secure {{a place on the}} expedition.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog turtles indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the bog turtle and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy bog turtles into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have been permitted to breed bog turtles in captivity.|$|E
5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. The division was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division would be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after this}} loss, England {{could have kept}} their chances alive by winning their final pool match against Spain. However, they were unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> losing 1–0, and {{finishing}} the First Round {{with a record of}} 1–0–2. The U.S. also lost their next match 5–2, versus Chile, ending their 1950 World Cup run with a First Round record of 1–0–2. They would not qualify for the World Cup again until 1990. Spain advanced to the four-team Final Round, finishing fourth. Uruguay won the 1950 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes {{resolved}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> taking {{the greater part}} of the army with him. Mardonius handpicked the troops who were to remain with him in Greece, taking the elite infantry units and cavalry, to complete the conquest of Greece. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, however, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt city for the winter.|$|E
5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E

5|$|However, Bell was {{speaking}} only {{for himself and}} without {{the auspices of the}} owners. At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority. Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
