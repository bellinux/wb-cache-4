Another city, Jenin, was not occupied but its residents fled. The combined Arab forces captured 14 Jewish settlement points, but only one of them, Mishmar HaYarden, was in the territory of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Jewish State according to Resolution 181. Within the boundaries of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Jewish state, there were twelve Arab villages which opposed Jewish control or were captured by the invading Arab armies, and in addition to them, the Lod Airport and pumping station near Antipatris, which were within the boundaries of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Jewish state, were {{under the control of the}} Arabs. The IDF captured about 50 large Arab villages outside of the boundaries of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Jewish State and a larger number of hamlets and Bedouin encampments. 350 square kilometers of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Jewish State were under the control of the Arab forces, while 700 square kilometers of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> Arab State were under the control of the IDF.
