500|$|On 17 May, Gerhardt {{and other}} doctors, {{including}} Ernst von Bergmann, diagnosed the growth as laryngeal cancer. Bergmann recommended consulting a leading British cancer specialist, Morell Mackenzie; he also recommended a thyrotomy to gain {{better access to}} the inside of the larynx, followed by the complete removal of the larynx - a <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> - if the situation proved serious. While Victoria was informed of the need for an immediate operation, Frederick was not told. Despite the tentative diagnosis of cancer, the doctors hoped the growth would prove to be a benign epithelioma. A room on the top floor of the Crown Prince's palace was then equipped as an operating theatre, but Bergmann elected to put the operation on hold until Mackenzie could provide his assessment. Mackenzie arrived in Berlin on 20 May, but after examining Frederick recommended a biopsy of the growth to determine whether or not it was malignant. He conducted the biopsy the following morning, after which he sent tissue samples to the distinguished pathologist Rudolf Virchow for microscopic examination. When Virchow was unable to detect any cancerous cells despite several separate analyses, Mackenzie declared his opposition to a laryngectomy being performed, as he felt it would be invariably fatal, and said he would assume charge of the case. He gave his assurance that Frederick would fully recover [...] "in a few months." [...] While Gerhardt and Physician-General August Wegner concurred with Mackenzie, Bergmann and his colleague Adalbert Tobold held to their original diagnosis of cancer. In addition to Mackenzie's opinion, Bismarck strongly opposed any major operation on Frederick's throat, and pressed the Kaiser to veto it. On 9 June, Mackenzie again biopsied the growth and sent the samples to Virchow, who reported the following day that he was again unable to detect any signs of cancer.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The first EKT Department in Novi Sad was {{established}} in 1926. In I 960 the ENT Clime {{became a part of}} the Facility of medicine Novi Sad and treatment of malignant disease started in 1973 at the Laryngology Department. Surgical treatment of malignant laryngeal tumors. Treatment of laryngeal cancers in Novi Sad started in 1960 's. Until 1971, the treatment of choice was radiotherapy, and surgical treatment started in 1971, when the first laryngectomy was performed. After the first surgery, 31 years have passed until we have reached the number of one thousand performed laryngectomies at ENT Clinic in Novi Sad. Period: 1971 - 1988. During this period, 138 laryngectomies were performed at ENT Clinic. <b>Total</b> <b>laryngectomies</b> were done as salvage surgeries in 136 cases, and 2 patients underwent functional partial lariigectomies. Direct laryngomicroscopy was introduced by Živko Majdevac in 1972. Oncology consilium was founded. Period: 1990 - 2002. New protocol was adopted. Surgery became me primary treatment of laryngeal carcinoma, while radiotherapy remained a valid therapeutic alternative. All known surgical techniques were introduced, including Pearson's near-total laryngectomy. In this period 834 patients were operated, and 873 laryngectomies were performed, out of which 388 <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomies.</b> Year after year the number of patients increased and in 2002. 90 laryngectomies were performed.

500|$|On 3 November, Frederick and {{his entourage}} {{departed}} for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while {{there was no immediate}} danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had [...] "unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn," [...] and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared {{on the right side of}} the larynx, and that an immediate and <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, [...] "To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?" [...] Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering [...] "foreigner" [...] who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father [...] "whether he is ill or not, [...] whether the K is then unable permanently to perform his duties," [...] would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution. [...] Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.|$|E

50|$|This {{procedure}} is performed during the <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> surgery. After {{removal of the}} larynx and creation of the tracheostoma, the puncture is made through {{the back wall of}} the trachea into the front wall of the esophagus.

40|$|Purpose Advances in transoral laser microsurgery, {{radiotherapy}} {{and chemotherapy}} (and their combinations) {{have reduced the}} indications for open partial laryngectomies, though they have replaced <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomies</b> in selected advanced or recurrent laryngeal carcinomas (LSCC). Tissue hypoxia in malignancies appears to be strongly associated with tumor cell invasiveness and metastases. Whether hypoxia-inducible factors can contribute to a rational recommendation of open partial laryngectomy should be investigated. Materials and Methods Fifty consecutive patients who had undergone open partial laryngectomy (supraglottic and supracricoid laryngectomies) were investigated, measuring the immunohistochemical expression of the hypoxia-inducible proteins angiogenin and endoglin in their primary LSCCs, also with image analysis.

40|$|The role in tumor {{spread and}} the {{prognostic}} value of metastasis in a prelaryngeal node were investigated in 124 cases of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma selected from about 900 <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomies</b> and pharyngolaryngectomies. Metastasis in a prelaryngeal node was noted in 26 cases: 22 without capsular rupture (N+) and 4 with capsular rupture (N+R+). Vascular embolism (E+) was never noted. Patients with a metastatic prelaryngeal node had a tumor of the piriform sinus in 13 cases (50 %), a transglottic tumor in 6, glotto-subglottic in 3, glottic in 2 and supraglottic in 2. They also more frequently had {{involvement of the}} cervical nodes (81 %) and of the thyroid gland. The 5 -year survival in these patients is very poor: only 3 patients (11. 5 %) were alive and free of disease. These data demonstrate the role of prelaryngeal nodes in tumors that affect the hypopharynx and the antero-inferior portion of the larynx and that directly reach this node through the anterior lymphatic peduncle...|$|R

50|$|Indications include voice {{rehabilitation}} {{for patients who}} are undergoing a <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> (primary puncture) or patients {{who have had a}} <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> in the past (secondary puncture).Contra-indications are mainly related {{to the use of the}} voice prosthesis and not the puncture procedure itself. It is important to have healthy tissue at the puncture site. This will help ensure the voice prosthesis is properly supported. Poor tissue condition at the puncture site can be a contra-indication for TE puncture. It is also important that the patient candidacy be taken into account. Patients must be able to understand and manage proper prosthesis maintenance and monitor for complications or device problems. Bleeding disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, poor vision and poor manual dexterity are all factors that may negatively interfere with successful voice restoration using tracheoesophageal techniques and should be discussed further with an appropriate healthcare provider who is knowledgeable in this topic.|$|E
40|$|Laryngeal and {{tracheal}} {{tumors are}} rare in pets; {{some piece of}} information on their disease behavior, therapy and evolution are limited.

The goal {{of this study is to}} report a successful case of a laryngeal neoplasm removal through endoscopy. A head and neck radiogram revealed a mass in the laryngeal lumen protruding into the trachea. The patient then underwent an endoscopy to confirm the radiographic diagnosis and to surgically remove the tumor. The histopathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated carcinoma. The most appropriate treatment for laryngeal tumors is the resection of the submucosa or a partial laryngectomy however, partial and <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomies</b> are associated with many postoperative complications. In contrast, the endoscopic approach allows for highly magnified visualization of the lesion in situ, which facilitates the surgical removal of the mass through videosurgery.

40|$|Personal {{experience}} in performing linear stapler {{closure of the}} pharynx during 70 <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomies</b> is reported. Laryngeal staplers (55 and 60 cm) with an angled handle were used, permitting vertical closure with 19 or 20 metal staples in a double row. A closed technique was initially used, but, over the years, this has gradually {{been replaced by the}} semi-closed technique to avoid trapping the suprahyoid part of the epiglottis between the jaws of the stapler. The stapler is inserted below the larynx after having separated it from all muscular and neurovascular connections, and after performing a mini-pharyngotomy at the vallecula epiglottica in order to extract the epiglottis, evert it ventrally and suture it to the hyothyroepiglottic space. The jaws of the stapler are closed and the staples are fired while the flaps of the mini-pharyngotomy are raised above the jaws. The scalpel is inserted above the stapler to remove the larynx. When the stapler is opened, the vertical linear suture of the pharynx is evident and can be examined. This procedure takes only a few minutes to perform. It guarantees a long-term stable watertight closure, dramatically reduces contamination of the operating field by pharyngeal secretions, and permits rapid healing time, greatly lowering patient management costs. In the cases presented here, there was a 1. 8 % rate of pharyngocutaneous fistulae in patients who were not radiated, whereas the rate was 13. 1 % in pre-radiated patients. In agreement with the international literature, this procedure does not increase the rate of fistulae and, in fact, it seems to reduce it. Moreover, it is particularly indicated for pre-radiated patients. Nevertheless, the Authors recommend reserving this type of procedure to cases in which, based on meticulous pre-operative assessment by means of endoscopy and imaging, the endolaryngeal site of the tumour has been assessed and {{there is no need for}} peri-operative exploration of the pharynx or tongue base...|$|R

50|$|During a <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy,</b> {{the entire}} voicebox (larynx) is removed, {{which leads to}} a {{permanent}} disconnection of the upper and lower airways and a permanent tracheostoma (a breathing hole in the neck). Prior to the operation, breathing primarily occurs through the nasal airways. In the upper airways, the inhaled air is warmed up or cooled down, to prepare the optimal temperature before the air reaches the lungs. After a <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy,</b> the upper airways are bypassed and breathing in and out occurs through the tracheostoma in the neck which means that the inhaled air flows directly into the lungs. These anatomical changes lead, among others, to changes in voice production, breathing, and olfaction. The nasal functions of regulating the temperature, humidifying, and filtering of the inhaled air are lost. The lack of these functions impairs the lower airways and the activity of the cilia, which leads to pulmonary problems such as tracheobronchial mucus, excessive sputum production, crusting, which can also cause fatigue and shortness of breath. To at least partially reduce these restrictions and compensate the nasal functions, an HME cassette can be attached over the tracheostoma to provide a means for conditioning, humidifying and to a certain extent filtering the inhaled air.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} regeneration {{of natural}} sounding speech from whisper-speech, produced by patients with vocal tract lesions affecting the glottis.

Reconstruction of speech from whispers has been demonstrated previously, however the resulting speech does not exhibit particularly high intelligibility, and more importantly, sounds un-natural. It is the conjecture of the authors that limited pitch variations in the reconstructed speech contributes most to that lack of naturalness. In this paper, a method for pitch contour variation in reconstructed speech is presented. This method extracts voice factors which are important to ‘naturalness’ from the whispered signal and applies these to the reconstructed speech. The method is based upon our previous published work which implemented an analysis-by-synthesis approach to voice reconstruction using a modified CELP codec...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo study {{quality of}} life in {{patients}} treated for advanced hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer, with laryngeal conservation or laryngectomy. Patients and methodsA retrospective 2 -center study included 100 patients in remission from squamous cell carcinoma, treated between 1998 and 2009. Seventy patients (24 hypopharynx, 46 larynx) were treated by <b>total</b> (pharyngo-) <b>laryngectomy</b> followed by external radiation therapy, and 30 (13 hypopharynx, 17 larynx) underwent an organ-conservation protocol with concurrent radiochemotherapy or with induction chemotherapy using platin- 5 FU or taxan-platin- 5 FU followed by radiation therapy. All patients responded to the {{quality of life}} questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C 30 and QLQ-H&N 35). ResultsAdvanced tumor stages IVa and IVb were significantly more frequent in the surgery groups (hypopharynx: 71. 6 % vs. 45. 9 %, p= 0. 01; larynx: 72. 4 % vs. 37. 5 %, p< 0. 01). In pharyngeal cancer, the only significant difference between surgical treatment and laryngeal conservation was for “sensory disorder” (taste and odor), with better results in case of laryngeal conservation (p< 0. 0001). For the other items, there was a trend for quality of life to appear better in patients with laryngeal conservation (p=NS). In laryngeal cancer, the only significant difference was for “dry mouth”, which was significantly less invalidating with surgical treatment (p< 0. 001). The impairment of the other quality of life items did not differ between surgical and conservative treatment.

50|$|A tracheo-oesophageal {{puncture}} (or tracheoesophageal puncture) is a surgically created hole {{between the}} trachea (windpipe) and the esophagus (the tubal pathway between {{the throat and}} the stomach) in {{a person who has}} had a <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy,</b> a surgery where the larynx (voice box) is removed. The purpose of the puncture is to restore a person’s ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed.

5000|$|Laryngectomy is {{the removal}} of the larynx and {{separation}} of the airway from the mouth, nose and esophagus. In a <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> the entire larynx is removed; in a partial laryngectomy only a portion is taken out. The laryngectomee breathes through an opening in the neck known as a stoma. [...] This procedure is usually performed by ENT surgeon in cases of laryngeal cancer. However, many laryngeal cancer cases are now treated only with more conservative surgeries through the mouth or with radiation and/or chemotherapy; laryngectomy is performed when those treatments fail to conserve the larynx or there is sufficient destruction by the cancer that would prevent normal function once it is destroyed. Laryngectomy is also performed on individuals with other types of head and neck cancer or severe swallowing problems.|$|E

After a partial laryngectomy, {{the individual}} breathes mainly through the stoma, but a connection still exists between the trachea and upper airways; these individuals are able to breathe air through the mouth and nose. They are therefore termed partial neck breathers. The extent of breathing through the upper airways in these individuals varies and a tracheostomy tube is present in many of them. Ventilation and resuscitation of total and partial neck breathers is through their stoma; however, in these individuals the mouth should be kept closed and the nose sealed to prevent air escape.|$|E

40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} of the hypopharynx represents a distinct clinical entity. Most patients present with significant comorbidities and advanced-stage disease. The overall survival is relatively poor because of high rates of regional and distant metastasis at presentation or early {{in the course of}} the disease. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial in the overall management of these patients to achieve the best results and maintain or improve functional results. Traditionally, operable hypopharyngeal cancer has been treated by <b>total</b> (occasionally partial) <b>laryngectomy</b> and partial or circumferential pharyngectomy, followed by reconstruction and postoperative radiotherapy in most cases. Efforts to preserve speech and swallowing function in the surgical treatment of hypopharyngeal (and laryngeal) cancer have resulted in a declining use of total laryngopharyngectomy and improved reconstructive efforts, including microvascular free tissue transfer. There are many surgical, as well as nonsurgical, options available for organ and function preservation, which report equally effective tumor control and survival. The selection of appropriate treatment is of crucial importance in the achievement of optimal results for these patients. In this article, several aspects of surgical and nonsurgical approaches in the treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer are discussed. Future studies must be carefully designed within clearly defined populations and use uniform terminology and standardized functional assessment and declare appropriate patient or disease endpoints. These studies should focus on improvement of results, without increasing patient morbidity. In this respect, technical improvements in radiotherapy such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, advances in supportive care, and incorporation of newer systemic agents such as targeted therapy, are relevant developments...|$|R

To compare functional and survival outcomes for patients undergoing total glossectomy (TG) or <b>total</b> glossec-tomy plus <b>laryngectomy</b> (TGL) for advanced {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC) of the tongue. Study Design. Case series with chart review. Setting. Academic tertiary referral center. Subjects and Methods. There were 30 included patients (20 TG, 10 TGL). Outcomes included tumor recurrence, disease-free survival, and functional data (swallowing, gastrostomy tube dependence, speech, airway). Results. Mean patient age was 56 years with a male predominance (90 %). Compared with TG, TGL was more commonly performed for recurrent tumors (90 % vs 55 %, P =. 06). Perineural invasion and extracapsular extension occurred more commonly in the TGL group (80 % vs 50 %, P =. 12). At 12 months postoperatively, 61 % of TG patients had disease recurrence compared with 40 % of TGL patients (P =. 43), and 12 -month disease-free survival was 40 % (TG) and 50 % (TGL). Functionally, more TG patients were totally gastrostomy tube dependent (70 % vs 30 %, P =. 04), and 50 % of TG patients were also tracheostomy dependent. Intelli-gible speech was achieved by 30 % of TG and 10 % of TGL patients (P =. 68). Conclusion. Patients undergoing TGL had similar functional and survival outcomes to patients undergoing TG alone {{despite the presence of}} more locally advanced disease with greater adverse pathological features. Following TG alone, positive or close mar-gins occurred most commonly at the inferior margin of resec-tion (hyoid/valleculae), which could explain why TGL in patients with advanced tongue SCC may improve local disease control...|$|R

The internationally most widely used are devices made by InHealth and Atos Medical. In 1980, the first commercially available prosthesis was introduced by Singer and Blom: the ‘Blom-Singer® Duckbill’, a 16 French diameter, non-flanged device that the patient could remove, clean and replace him- or herself (non-indwelling). The first indwelling voice prosthesis (Groningen) was described in 1984.

50|$|A voice {{prosthesis}} (plural prostheses) is {{an artificial}} device, usually made of silicone {{that is used}} to help laryngectomized patients to speak. During a <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy,</b> the entire voice box (larynx) is removed and the windpipe (trachea) and food pipe (esophagus) are separated from each other. During this operation an opening between the food pipe and the windpipe can be created (primary puncture). This opening can also be created at a later time (secondary puncture). This opening is called a tracheo-esophageal puncture (TE puncture). The voice prosthesis is placed in this opening. Then, it becomes possible to speak by occluding the stoma and blowing the air from the lungs through the inside of the voice prosthesis and through the throat, creating a voice sound, which is called tracheo-esophageal speech.The back end of the prosthesis sits at the food pipe. To avoid food, drinks, or saliva from coming through the prosthesis and into the lungs, the prosthesis has a small flap at the back.There are two ways of inserting the voice prosthesis: through the mouth and throat (retrograde manner) {{with the help of a}} guide wire, or directly through the tracheostoma (anterograde) manner.

Bergmann recommended consulting a leading British cancer specialist, Morell Mackenzie; he also recommended a thyrotomy to gain {{better access to}} the inside of the larynx, followed by the complete removal of the larynx - a <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> - if the situation proved serious. While Victoria was informed of the need for an immediate operation, Frederick was not told. Despite the tentative diagnosis of cancer, the doctors hoped the growth would prove to be a benign epithelioma. A room on the top floor of the Crown Prince's palace was then equipped as an operating theatre, but Bergmann elected to put the operation on hold until Mackenzie could provide his assessment. Mackenzie arrived in Berlin on 20 May, but after examining Frederick recommended a biopsy of the growth to determine whether or not it was malignant. He conducted the biopsy the following morning, after which he sent tissue samples to the distinguished pathologist Rudolf Virchow for microscopic examination. When Virchow was unable to detect any cancerous cells despite several separate analyses, Mackenzie declared his opposition to a laryngectomy being performed, as he felt it would be invariably fatal, and said he would assume charge of the case. He gave his assurance that Frederick would fully recover [...] "in a few months." [...] While Gerhardt and Physician-General August Wegner concurred with Mackenzie, Bergmann and his colleague Adalbert Tobold held to their original diagnosis of cancer. In addition to Mackenzie's opinion, Bismarck strongly opposed any major operation on Frederick's throat, and pressed the Kaiser to veto it. On 9 June, Mackenzie again biopsied the growth and sent the samples to Virchow, who reported the following day that he was again unable to detect any signs of cancer.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: In {{this study}} we aimed to assess the frequencyof {{distribution}} for cervical metastases, according to the necklevel in patients with larynx cancer who underwent neck dissection. In addition, we also evaluated the safety of selectiveneck dissection compared to comprehensive neck dissectionespecially in preoperative N 0 patients. Materials and methods: In our experience, to determine thefrequency of metastases in each level, the specimen is sentfor pathological examination by dividing each level separatelyafter neck dissection. In our study; we retrospectively analysedthe medical records of 145 laryngeal cancer patientswho were treated with surgery (<b>total</b> or partial <b>laryngectomy)</b> as primary treatment and combined with neck dissectionbetween 2005 and 2010 in our Otolaryngology Department. The patients with the diagnosis of laryngeal cancer who underwentsurgery without neck dissection were excluded fromthe analysis. Results: Level I or level V involvement was not observedin preoperative N 0 cases. In cases that had contralateralinvolvement, there was ipsilateral involvement too and allof these cases were preoperative N+ cases. The classificationbased {{on the distribution of}} levels of 145 cases’ cervicalmetastases revealed that among ipsilateral involvements, 1 (0. 6 %) was detected at level IA, 32 (22 %) at level IIA, 3 (2 %) at level IIB, 19 (13 %) at level III, 2 (1. 3 %) at level IV and 1 (1. 3 %) at level V. When contralateral involvement considered, 13 (8. 9 %) were detected at level IIA and 1 (0. 6 %) atlevel III. Conclusions: The neck specimen findings of 145 laryngealcancer patients treated with surgery as either total or partiallaryngectomy and combined with neck dissection revealedthat the most common metastases were observed at thelevel IIA and level III; however metastases at level I, levelIIB, level IV and level V were least common. Those findingsindicated that selective neck dissection was a safe surgicalapproach (levels II-IV) in T 1 T 2 N 0 cases.

5000|$|On 3 November, Frederick and {{his entourage}} {{departed}} for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while {{there was no immediate}} danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had [...] "unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn," [...] and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared {{on the right side of}} the larynx, and that an immediate and <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, [...] "To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?" [...] Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering [...] "foreigner" [...] who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father [...] "whether he is ill or not, and whether the Kaiser is then unable permanently to perform his duties," [...] would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution. [...] Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{find out}} the pattern of complications, frequency, risk factors and the {{management}} after <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> Methods: It was a cross sectional study done in the Department of Otolaryngology & Head-Neck Surgery, Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, Dhaka from July 2007 to Dec 2009. 15 patients undergoing <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for histologically proven Carcinoma larynx were included in this study. Patients were reviewed after surgery and any complication that occurred was recorded. The presentation, diagnosis and management of these complications were discussed after <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> Results: There were 15 male patients, 3 non radiated cases and 12 post irradiated cases. Age of patients ranged from 35 - 75 years. Complications included wound infection (04), pharyngocutaneous fistula (03), flap necrosis (01), pharyngeal stenosis (01), stomal stenosis (01) and stomal recurrence (01). Conclusions: Wound infection and pharyngocutaneous fistula are most common complications after <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> Preoperative radiotherapy is an important risk factor for development of pharyngocutaneous fistula in <b>total</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> patients.
