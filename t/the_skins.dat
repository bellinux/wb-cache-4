5|$|Sauvignon blanc can {{be greatly}} {{influenced}} by decisions in the winemaking process. One decision {{is the amount of}} contact that the must has with <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> of the grape. In {{the early years of the}} New Zealand wine industry, there were no wineries on the South Island which meant that freshly harvested grapes had to be trucked and then ferried to the North Island, often all the way up to Auckland. This allowed for prolonged exposure of <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> and juice which sharpened the intensity and pungency of the wine. Some winemakers, like the Loire, intentionally leave a small amount of must to spend some time in contact with the skin for later blending purposes. Other winemakers, like in California, generally avoid any contact with the skin due to the reduced aging ability of the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|The bark {{of other}} {{varieties}} of oak {{has traditionally been}} used in Europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere.

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> {{properties}} like skin dryness, fungus and allergic symptoms i. e. etching kind {{of problem}} correlation with skin texture profile is discussed in the proposed thesis work. In the existing scenario, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> images are analyzed in frequency domain. However, {{it is observed that}} <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> color in texture images does not vary over a wide range. Hence, the histogram profile of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> texture remains almost flat. In the proposed work, we have shifted <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> texture analysis towards the gray level profile analysis. The gray color profile of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> texture may give fair idea about <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> sensitivity and is a new emerging skin texture analysis tool. In <b>the</b> proposed work, <b>skin</b> gray color profile has been taken as the input parameter in order to ascertain <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> profile. In <b>the</b> proposed thesis work, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> image is computed. The GLCM functions characterize the texture of an image by calculating how often pairs of pixel with specific values and in a specified spatial relationship occur in an image, creating a GLCM, and then extracting statistical measures from this matrix. Further, the image entropy and energies are also computed in order to correlate <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> symptoms to <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> texture images...|$|R

5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. <b>The</b> <b>skins</b> were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>skin</b> blood {{volume and}} <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> {{temperature}} were measured on 18 sites of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> surface {{of males and}} females each. The measurement were made at a temperature of 12. 4 ℃ in May, 22. 6 ℃ in July, 13. 6 ℃ in October and of - 1. 3 ℃ in January using a topographical photoelectric plethysmograph with transistor and by a thermister thermometer. The results were as follows; 1) <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> blood volume shows a gradual increase in spring and summer following winter, and decreases in autumn and winter following sammer. The same tendency was seen in skin temperature. In females this tendency was enhanced in winter. 2) <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> blood volume was larger in autumn than in spring, and <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> temperature was lower in autumn in spite of the high room temperature. These phenomena showed a congestive tendency in autum as compared with that in spring. 3) <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> temperature was somewhat lower in winter, but <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> blood volume was higher in females. These phenomena are brought about by the considerably lower temperature than the critical temperature. 4) Regional specifity of seasonal variations of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> blood volume are observed. In the both trunk and adjacent regions, however, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> blood volume and <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> temperture do not show too larger seasonal variation. But in the limbs especially in the extremeties such as the hands, feet, fingers and toes, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> blood volume shows a small variation {{in the first half of}} the warm and cold seasons, and it is larger in the latter half, and <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> temperature shows greater variations in the warmer seasons.

5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. Phyllobates frogs kept in captivity do not develop the toxins, {{and the extent of}} the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> and feathers rules out the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 {{scientists}} preparing <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> of the {{hooded pitohui}} for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It {{was reported in}} 1992 that this species and two other pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming quails (although toxicity in quails is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in Colombian poison dart frogs from the genus Phyllobates (family Dendrobatidae). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than strychnine. Later research found that the hooded pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A cis-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.|$|E

5|$|The {{body plan}} {{of an adult}} frog is {{generally}} characterized by a stout body, protruding eyes, cleft tongue, limbs folded underneath, {{and the absence of}} a tail. Besides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. <b>The</b> <b>skins</b> of frog are glandular, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Warty species of frog tend to be called toads but the distinction between frogs and toads is based on informal naming conventions concentrating on the warts rather than taxonomy or evolutionary history. Frogs' skins vary in colour from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to advertise toxicity and warn off predators.|$|E
5|$|The evening draw also {{consisted}} of skins play. Jennifer Jones and Mirjam Ott {{played in the}} women's skins game, in which Jones dominated, scoring four skins and winning four points for Team North America. Glenn Howard and Thomas Ulsrud played in the men's skins game. Ulsrud played a fairly open game, forcing carryovers for five ends until a misfire from Ulsrud led to Howard making the cup-winning shot, scoring three points with a tap for two points. Ulsrud won the remaining points in the game on a draw to the button. A mixed team of Kevin Martin, Heather Nedohin, Marc Kennedy, and Laine Peters played Eve Muirhead, Greg Drummond, Vicki Adams, and Michael Goodfellow in the mixed skins game. Martin skipped against Muirhead and controlled most of the game, securing four points on four skins before Muirhead took the last skin.

50|$|There {{are several}} methods of moxibustion. Three {{of them are}} direct scarring, direct non-scarring, and {{indirect}} moxibustion. Direct scarring moxibustion places a small cone of moxa on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> at an acupuncture point and burns it until <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> blisters, which then scars after it heals. Direct non-scarring moxibustion removes the burning moxa before <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> burns enough to scar, unless the burning moxa is left on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> too long. Indirect moxibustion holds a cigar made of moxa near the acupuncture point to heat <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> or holds it on an acupuncture needle inserted in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> to heat <b>the</b> needle.

50|$|Strip waxing (soft wax) is {{accomplished}} by spreading a wax thinly over <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> A cloth or paper strip is applied and pressed firmly, adhering the strip to the wax and the wax to <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> <b>The</b> strip is then quickly ripped against the direction of hair growth, as parallel as possible to <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> to avoid trauma to <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> This removes <b>the</b> wax along with the hair.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skins</b> of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skins</b> of wild {{cats and}} other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the {{beginning}} of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem. During this period, the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay, and the biggest importers were the USA and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all of the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E
