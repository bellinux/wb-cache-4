5|$|Beginning in 2003, PEARL {{deemed the}} {{operation}} self-sufficient and reduced {{financial support for}} the Abahuzamugambi Cooperative. The cooperative provided its growers with loans that helped improve living standards and allowed for livestock investments, affordable medical insurance, and education. A cooperative bank was opened in the village in March, enabling farmers to maintain and manage their own funds locally, rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> trek the long distance to Butare.|$|E
5|$|The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, often {{referred}} to as the 808, is a drum machine introduced by the Roland Corporation in 1980 and discontinued in 1983. It was one of the earliest programmable drum machines, with which users could create their own rhythms rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> use preset patterns.|$|E
5|$|Using public {{transport}} {{for at least}} part of the journey means that walkers can plan walks that start and finish at different places, rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> circle back to their start point to collect their cars.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the custom}} had {{no basis in}} law and {{frequently}} resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, {{the attitude of the}} authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> maintain the family in workhouses.|$|E
5|$|They have {{naturally}} short tails, {{which do}} not require docking. They also moult their fleece naturally, rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> be shorn annually, though older individuals do not moult as easily and may require additional shearing. Fleeces are grey or creamy white on the body, though darker individuals occur whose colouring {{is similar to the}} Soay sheep. Rough in quality, the wool is mostly used in the creation of tweeds or carpet yarns. A tweed is a rough-surfaced coarse cloth, typically made in Scotland. Its colour is a mix of flecked colours. The face and legs are wool-free and black and white, with the proportions varying between individuals.|$|E

6000|$|... "He will. But I feel {{at present}} that I would rather change places with the poorest gentleman I know <b>than</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell him. I {{have done with}} races, Lupton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As much so as possible," [...] Morris promised. [...] "It won't be much use, but I shall try. I {{certainly}} would rather <b>have</b> you easily <b>than</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight for you." ...|$|R
25|$|Clustering {{can reduce}} travel and {{administrative}} costs. In the example above, an interviewer {{can make a}} single trip to visit several households in one block, rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> drive to a different block for each household.|$|E
25|$|These early {{architectures}} introduced {{parallel processing}} at the processor level, with innovations such as vector processing, {{in which the}} processor can perform several operations during one clock cycle, rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> wait for successive cycles.|$|E
25|$|Facebook's {{social impact}} has also changed how people communicate. Rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> reply to others through email, Facebook {{allows users to}} {{broadcast}} or share content to others, and thereby to engage others or be engaged with others' posts.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think I {{would rather}} feel that {{painting}} is beautiful <b>than</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> read {{it as an}} enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures sooner than yours with the very wide meaning," [...] said Dorothea, speaking to Will.|$|R
25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{complications}} of sex and recombination, we initially restrict our attention to an asexual population without genetic recombination. Then fitnesses can be assigned directly to genotypes rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> worry about individual alleles. There are two commonly used measures of fitness; absolute fitness and relative fitness.|$|E
25|$|Plans for {{a tunnel}} southward {{underneath}} the CBD to Mt Eden {{and even to}} Morningside were debated for nearly a century. With Britomart in operation since 2003, the tunnel would allow trains to run through the station rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> reverse out over {{the same set of}} tracks.|$|E
25|$|Franco-Pondichériens are customarily allowed {{access to}} Indian schools and {{universities}} on par with Non-Resident Indians (NRI). India's tourism boom has turned Pondicherry into a popular travel destination and slowed the population decline of Franco-Pondichériens who find more business and work opportunities locally <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> repatriate to Europe.|$|E
50|$|At {{seven in}} the morning {{everything}} was prepared for the explosion. At eight in the morning Čuljat, Markon, Galjer and other participants in the organization of sabotage that <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be compromised, went by train to Karlovac to switch <b>to</b> Kordun and <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> Yugoslav Partisans.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd sooner be a {{horse in}} a mill <b>than</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{go to an}} office every day," [...] said Mrs. Smith, coming to her husband's assistance. [...] "You, Sir Raffle, have kept {{yourself}} fresh and pleasant through it all; but who besides you ever did?" ...|$|R

25|$|The wheellock {{was used}} {{along with the}} matchlock until both were {{replaced}} by the simpler and less-costly flintlock, by the late 17th century. The wheellock mechanism however gave faster ignition than the flintlock, because the sparks were produced directly in the pan rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> fall a certain distance from the frizzen.|$|E
25|$|Peter Bramley {{discovered}} in the 1990s that a single phytoene desaturase gene (bacterial CrtI) {{can be used to}} produce lycopene from phytoene in GM tomato, rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> introduce multiple carotene desaturases that are normally used by higher plants. Lycopene is then cyclized to beta-carotene by the endogenous cyclase in Golden Rice.|$|E
25|$|The Intel Core Duo (and later, {{including}} the current i5, i7 and Xeon) processors found in Intel Macs support Intel VT-x, allowing for high performance (near native) virtualization, {{which gives the}} user the ability to run and switch between two or more operating systems simultaneously, rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> dual-boot and run only one operating system at a time.|$|E
5000|$|... "Traders are not {{fooled by}} the Black-Scholes-Merton model. The {{existence}} of a 'volatility surface' is one such adaptation. But they find it preferable to fudge one parameter, namely volatility, {{and make it a}} function of time to expiry and strike price, rather <b>than</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> precisely estimate another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall have," [...] he said, laughing, [...] "to get the {{printing}} officer to strike off {{a number of}} copies of my statement, and to issue one to each regiment.

5000|$|Ramazzini saw {{prevention}} {{as being}} better than cure. In his Oratio given in 1711, {{he suggested that}} [...] "it is much better to prevent than to cure, and {{so much easier to}} foresee future harm and avoid it rather <b>than</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get rid of it after having fallen prey".|$|R
25|$|Although the {{maintenance}} of so large a mounted force in the Jordan Valley had been expensive as regards the level of fitness and numbers of sick soldiers of the garrison, it was less costly <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> re-take the valley prior to the Battle of Megiddo and the force which continued to garrison the valley played {{an important part in}} that battle's strategy.|$|E
25|$|This {{developed}} into the Surge hanging milker. Prior to milking a cow, a large wide leather strap called a surcingle was put around the cow, across the cow's lower back. The milker device and collection tank hung underneath the cow from the strap. This innovation allowed the cow {{to move around}} naturally during the milking process rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> stand perfectly still over a bucket on the floor.|$|E
25|$|France {{adopted the}} Valée system in 1829. The new system reduced the calibers of field {{artillery}} to 8- and 12-pound cannons and 24-pound and 6-inch howitzers. Mobility was increased by standardizing limber sizes so that 8-pounders and 24-pound howitzers used the smaller type while 12-pounders and 6-inch howitzers used the larger type. In all cases, the gunners rode into action while {{sitting on the}} limbers rather <b>than</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> walk beside the guns. All batteries were provided with four cannons and two howitzers.|$|E
5000|$|Vivian Smith in The Bulletin found Rowbotham [...] "striking out in new directions." [...] He went on: [...] "Rowbotham's {{strength}} {{has always}} been that of simple affection for and appreciation of country life and living. His tone is subdued, unassertive. One feels that he would rather not be heard <b>than</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> raise his voice." ...|$|R
5000|$|In some cases, {{like that}} of Henry Cook in 1814, the Poor Law {{authorities}} forced the husband to sell his wife, rather <b>than</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> maintain her and her child in the Effingham workhouse. She was taken to Croydon market and sold for one shilling, the parish paying {{for the cost of}} the journey and a [...] "wedding dinner".|$|R
