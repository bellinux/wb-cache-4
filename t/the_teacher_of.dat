5|$|Many {{scholars}} have gleaned from this passage that the Wicked Priest and <b>the</b> <b>Teacher</b> <b>of</b> Righteousness followed different liturgical calendars, thus enabling the Wicked Priest {{to travel on}} Yom Kippur; some have even suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Teacher</b> <b>of</b> Righteousness was a schismatic High Priest during the pre-Jonathan intersacerdotium.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the time}} of de Vaux, the default {{assumption}} {{has been that the}} Wicked Priest is a single individual, if only because of the appealing parallelism to <b>the</b> <b>Teacher</b> <b>of</b> Righteousness. The consensus time period for the founding of Qumran (150-140 BCE) includes five High Priests: three Hellenized and two Maccabean: Jason, Menelaus, Alcimus, Jonathan, and Simon, and also the various figures potentially associated with the intersacerdotium.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} Sōshū tradition, {{from the late}} Kamakura period to the {{beginning}} of the Nanboku-chō period, the smiths' goal was to produce swords that exhibited splendor and toughness, incorporating some of the best features of the Bizen and Yamashiro traditions. The Midare Shintōgo by Awataguchi Kunitsuna's son, Shintōgo Kunimitsu, is considered to be the first true Sōshū tradition blade. Shintōgo Kunimitsu was <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>of</b> Yukimitsu and of Masamune who is widely recognized as Japan's greatest swordsmith. Together with Sadamune, whose work looks modest compared to Masamune's, these are the most representative smiths of the early Sōshū tradition. Sōshū tradition sugata is characterized by a shallow torii-zori, bigger mihaba, smaller kasane, medium or large kissaki. The jihada is mostly itame-hada with ji-nie and chikei and the hamon is gunome, midareba and hitatsura. Nie, sunagashi and kinsuji are often visible in the hamon.|$|E

25|$|Wicked Priest: The Wicked Priest is <b>the</b> <b>Teacher</b> <b>of</b> Righteousness's main opponent, {{who also}} sought to kill <b>the</b> <b>Teacher</b> <b>of</b> Righteousness. The {{identity}} of the Wicked Priest is more clear than that of <b>the</b> <b>Teacher</b> <b>of</b> Righteousness, with scholars suggesting {{that he was a}} Hasmonean high priest such as Jonathan and Alexander Jannaeus. The Wicked Priest is referenced the most in the Commentary on Habukkuk, which states that the Wicked Priest was originally reliable, but once he became ruler he forsook God for riches and rebelled against God and committed abhorrent deeds. In the Commentary on the Psalms, the Wicked Priest sought to kill <b>the</b> <b>Teacher</b> <b>of</b> Righteousness for sending a law to him, some scholars have suggested that this law was 4QMMT. If the Wicked Priest was in fact Jonathan Jannaeus, then he met his own end in 142 B.C.E at the hands of Diodotus Tryphon, which would match well with the Habakkuk Commentary that comments on the terrible end met by the Wicked Priest.|$|E
