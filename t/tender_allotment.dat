40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the optimal bidding behaviour of a single bank in the context of fixed rate liquidity tenders. Banks’ bidding is shown to depend crucially on the central bank’s liquidity policy as regards <b>tender</b> <b>allotments.</b> The paper also analyses ECB liquidity policy in terms of the model. The ECB, while applying fixed rate tenders, appears to have been attempting stabilise the market interest rate at a level close to the main refinancing rate. However, this aim was at least partially overridden by that of stabilising total money market liquidity {{over the course of the}} reserve maintenance period – even more so when banks were expecting the ECB to raise the main refinancing rate in the near future. The banks’ aggregate bids increased considerably during the period of fixed rate tenders. This was seen to result mainly from profit opportunities associated with a positive spread between market interest rate and main refinancing rate. The positive spread resulted from the combination of expectations of an interest rate hike and liquidity-oriented allotment policy. bidding; money market tenders; liquidity policy; central bank operating framework...|$|R
40|$|Most OECD {{central banks}} {{implement}} monetary policy by supplying reserves to the banking sector {{with the aim}} of influencing short-term interbank interest rates. To interpret the monetary policy stance accurately, one needs to be familiar with the mechanism for determining the money market equilibrium. The aim {{of this study is to}} deepen our understanding of the various effects of different intervention styles on the short-term money market when monetary policy is implemented with an operational framework similar to that of the European Central Bank (ECB). In the first essay of this study, we model banks' demand for central bank reserves (liquidity) for each day of an n-day reserve maintenance period and analyse liquidity determination under alternative liquidity policy rules that a central bank might apply in fixed rate tenders. It is shown that there is a tradeoff between the central bank's ability to keep a market interest rate close to the tender rate and the stability of liquidity holdings within a maintenance period. The second essay presents a model of a single bank's optimal bidding in the context of fixed rate liquidity tenders. It is shown that banks' bidding crucially depends on the central bank's liquidity policy for <b>tender</b> <b>allotments.</b> This essay also analyses ECB liquidity policy in terms of the model. The final essay models the money market equilibrium and analyses banks' bidding when the central bank uses variable rate tenders. The liquidity supply is fully endogenised by having the central bank minimise a loss function the includes deviations-from-target of interest rate and liquidity. ECB experiences with variable rate tenders are also studied in this essay. central bank operational framework; short-term interest rates; money markets; tenders; liquidity policy; bidding...|$|R

Our empirical evidence shows that measures of dollar shortage derived from ECB tenders, and actions to move to fixed-rate <b>tenders</b> with full <b>allotment</b> and to expand the eligible collateral by the ECB have significant power in explaining the cross currency basis. We show that the relaxation of Euro funding constraints through 3 -year Long Term Re-financing Operations (LTROs) does {{not contribute to the}} narrowing of the cross-currency basis, consistent with the theory developed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Open market {{operations}} play a {{key role}} in allocating central bank funds to the banking system and thereby in steering short-term interest rates in line with the stance of monetary policy. Many central banks apply so-called 'fixed rate tender' auctions in their open market operations. This paper presents, on the basis of a survey of central bank experience, a model of bidding in such tenders. In their conduct of fixed rate tenders, many central banks faced specifically an 'under-' and an 'overbidding' problem. These phenomena are revisited in the light of the proposed model, and the more general question of the optimal <b>tender</b> procedure and <b>allotment</b> policy of central banks is addressed.

This note presents some elements of a theory of bidding in central bank tenders in a framework such as the one of the Eurosystem.

40|$|In the Eurosystem, banks’ {{interest}} rate expectations {{should no longer}} {{have resulted in a}} non-zero tender spread, the difference between marginal and minimum price for liquidity, when the ECB reformed its op-erational framework for monetary policy implementation in March 2004 so that the policy rates remain constant within reserves maintenance periods. Yet, the tender spread was wider in 2005 than in any single year after 2000, when the ECB switched from fixed to variable rate tenders. Parts of the relevant literature have argued that because of the ECB’s asymmetric preferences over deviations of the market rates up and down from the policy rate, the shortest euro {{interest rate}}s persistently exceed the policy rate This paper argues, however, that when the central bank applies a quantity oriented liquidity policy, a positive tender spread may result from money market inefficiencies and banks’ risk aversion even if the central bank preferences are symmetric and the markets do not anticipate any changes in the policy rates. In such a case, {{the driving force behind the}} tender spread is banks’ uncertainty about their individual allotments at the marginal rate for the Eurosystem main refinancing operations (MROs). Furthermore, the allotment uncertainty is shown to be significantly related to the amount of liquidity supplied in each operation. Hence, the expansion in the MRO volumes experienced since 2002 may have had a major contribution to the emergence and observed growth of the tender spread. main refinancing operations; liquidity; <b>tender</b> spread; <b>allotments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Open market {{operations}} play a {{key role}} in allocating central bank funds to the banking system and thereby to steer short-term interest rates in line with the stance of monetary policy. This note presents some elements of a theory of bidding in central bank tenders in a framework such as the one of the Eurosystem, i. e. with high reserve requirements and averaging and possible expectations of rate changes within the reserve maintenance period in which a tender is executed. The ECB has so far used fixed rate tenders and a variant of the variable rate tender, which may be similar to a fixed rate tender depending on market circumstances. In doing so, it faced consecutively an “under- “ and an “overbidding ” issue. The tools developed in this note to understand the bidding behavior of banks in these operations allow revisiting both under- and overbidding and the more general question of the optimal <b>tender</b> procedure and <b>allotment</b> policy. The results of the model suggest that the discretionary fixed rate tender procedure performs well under conditions of stable interest rates, but may have some disadvantages in case of strong rate change expectations. The variable rate tender performs, in terms of the aspects analyzed here, well under all cases of rate expectations. Finally, the 100 %-allotment fixed rate tender always tends to perform poorly in terms of interest rate control by the central bank. I...|$|R
40|$|WP 16 / 2000; n {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} {{shed some light on}} the way the {{regulation}} of public transit systems has been approached in the past and is presently addressed in Italy. The reduction of x-inefficiency represents a great challenge for the local authorities, given the high operating costs faced by the transportation companies and the moderate tariffs level that do not allow the operators to balance costs and revenues. Throughout the 1980 's and {{the first half of the}} 1990 's, the problem was essentially met by means of stopgap measures taken mainly for emergency, to curb the deficit build-up. In the past five years it has been turning the efforts towards a radical reorganization of the whole local public transportation (LPT) industry, with the law 549 / 95, completed with the Decreti Legge 422 / 97 and 400 / 99. The reform process includes among its goals the attribution of financial responsibility to the sector operators and the start of privatization of the public transit systems. The introduction of more competitive environment, mainly by the resort to <b>tendering</b> for the <b>allotment</b> of concessions, represents the challenge for the future. A complete evaluation of the achieved results is probably still premature. Nevertheless, as the first goal is concerned, the reform appears suitable to yield some positive result. On the contrary, the liberalization and privatization of the LPT sector is progressing very slowly, due to the protection still given to the public-owned companies. It is then expected that in the future a decisive action with regard to such important aspects of the regulatory reform will be undertaken...|$|R
