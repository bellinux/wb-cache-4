40|$|When {{government}} entities procure {{goods or}} services, they generally consider and award contracts only to bidders who {{complied with the}} specifications and conditions of tender as laid down in the tender invitation. Tenders received must in other words be conforming, compliant or responsive. This enables procuring entities to compare tenders {{on an equal footing}} and ensures equal treatment amongst bidders. In South Africa the extent to which bidders must comply with <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> and conditions is a thorny issue in practice. In 2008 the Supreme Court of Appeal in Millennium Waste Management (Pty) Ltd v Chairperson, Tender Board: Limpopo Province confirmed the views of the courts in South Africa regarding compliance with tender conditions and the amendment of tenders before award. The recent 2013 decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Dr JS Moroka Municipality v The Chairperson of the Tender Evaluation Committee of the Dr JS Moroka Municipality, however, has moved public procurement regulation in South Africa to a point where procuring entities have very limited discretionary powers when evaluating compliance with <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> and conditions. This paper argues for an approach that allows procuring entities in South Africa more discretion when evaluating compliance with <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> and conditions. In doing so, reliance is placed on the treatment of "responsiveness" in international instruments as well as the views of the South African courts since first they were confronted with the issue. ...|$|R

40|$|Innovation is a {{key driver}} for social {{development}} and {{economic growth in the}} Netherlands. To remain the position in the top 20 th economies worldwide the Dutch government initiated several incentives for innovation. Public procurement is considered a powerful tool to stimulate innovation in private companies. Various studies showed a great potential of the procurement-instrument through efficient use of this tendering tool. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge and understanding of the conditions that stimulate of hinder innovation. The problem statement of this study is: To what extent are factors, related to public procurement, a barrier to innovation in the private sector? This study is conducted in the construction industry which, in comparison with other sectors, is seen as less innovative and is depended of the workload from the public sector through public procurement. A survey was conducted among employees of construction and consulting companies with experience in participating in public tenders. A total number of 102 public tenders were included in this study. Literature describes various barriers to innovation and has led to seven hypotheses of factors that influence company’s innovation propensity. The factors that form a barrier to innovation in construction and (construction) consulting companies are: procurement competences, management of risk during the procurement process, interaction with the procurer, public demand for innovation, <b>tender</b> <b>specifications,</b> incentives and management of intellectual property rights. There was also the expectation that a company with higher scores on innovation culture will experience less resistance of barriers to their propensity to innovate. The research revealed a positive effect of flexibility and freedom in the <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> on innovation propensity. Also, confirmation was found for the positive influence of incentives on innovation propensity. These factors may be a barrier to innovation in tenders with lack of incentives and very narrow <b>tender</b> <b>specifications.</b> Remarkably, we found a negative relation between interaction with the procurer and the innovation propensity of construction companies. For the other factors no significant impact was found on the innovation propensity in the private sector. No support was found for the expected moderating effects of innovation culture of the company in relation to barriers to innovation. This study provides some recommendations for practice. Public procurers should allow flexibility of specifications in order to stimulate the development of innovative solutions by (private) suppliers. Suppliers also need to be stimulated by increasing size and duration of the contracts or use stimulating selection criteria in the tender (EMVI). The procurer must create conditions within the procurement process where there is space for suppliers creativeness and innovativeness. The interaction between the procurer and suppliers should focus on the conditions of the innovation process, not on the innovation itself. The study had a limited research group of 51 respondents, mainly from the southern Netherlands. Therefore, the research should be extended to other regions in the Netherlands. The conclusions are based on opinions and judgments of the respondents. The results of this study should be supported by qualitative research. Further research could also focus on the perspective of public organizations on the innovation in public procurement and on the obstacles within the influence of private organizations...|$|R

Author also used {{a case study of}} an evaluation performed on Objective 3 Single Programming Document (Prague), co-financed by the ESF in the period 2004 [...] 6. In addition to the main objective stated above, the thesis includes data on real public tender documentations and evaluation reports. The output is represented by data on estimated prices of external evaluation, tender documentation contents and also on methods and techniques, which were used in the evaluations examined. Such set of empirical data has been scarcely found in recent studies, which adds to usability of this thesis for expert audience. External evaluation is an expert project financed with public resources, carried out through public procurement. Based on the model process of such evaluation, the author searches for preconditions of realizing an efficient external evaluation. Efficiency and its factors then become main subject of research. As a key factor of performing an efficient evaluation through public procurement, the author identifies the tender documentation and its qualities. This thesis contains a research performed on a sample of evaluations of five programs co-financed by the ESF in the Czech Republic. Examined tender documentations contained serious drawbacks, namely incomplete and inexact definitions of expected outputs, missing list of required methods for the evaluation and also missing scale of statistical samples for the research. Quantitative tests also did not prove any dependence of estimated price of the evaluation stated by the tenderers on pre-defined cost-effective factor. The thesis ends with summative conclusions of the drawbacks and, in accordance with research findings, brings a set of methodical recommendations for proper construction of public <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> of an evaluation, which may lead to increase in efficiency of tendering external evaluations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCSP Solar Fields are {{designed}} as lightweight structures. Nevertheless, {{due to their}} size and complexity, large amounts of materials are required. Environmental conditions like wind loads are a key driver {{for the design of}} solar fields, including required strength of materials and therefore mass. To give a solid example: Structural steel work for the solar field of a 500, 000 m 2 aperture parabolic trough plant (typical 50 MW plant in Spain with 7 h thermal storage) amounts to approx. 12, 500 tons of steel. Due to changes in European design codes and the respective loading conditions, the design wind speed increased from 34 m/s to 38 m/s, which increases solar field structural steel mass to 14, 450 tons, i. e. by about 16 %. Obviously, prescribed load conditions have a tremendous effect on steel mass and hence cost and environmental impact.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of industrial evolution, industrialization has created a dominating unilateral production- and consumption model. This one-way model of production, also described as a linear model, encompasses a ‘take, make, waste’ pattern in which natural resources are extracted from the Earth, manufactured into goods, used and eventually discarded as waste. It {{is characterized by a}} shift in responsibility from the producer of products or goods towards the user in which the consumer has to take care of disposal. Without any incentive to do otherwise, waste will be the final stage of products or goods. The linear economy has proven to be successful in providing affordable products for consumers and material welfare. However, since the publication of ‘limits to growth’ by the Club of Rome during the 70 ’s, we have witnessed a rising deliberation due to this model’s paradox. The world is finite. The exponential growth in resource extraction due to population growth and shifting consumption patterns in a linear economy is putting stress on our planet. As a result, resource efficiency and depletion will become one of the main challenges during the 21 st century. One of the difficulties in developing the circular economy has been related to the topic of procurement. This research focuses on the procurement of circular buildings, specifically on how it should be specified during tender processes. It focuses on the main research question: how can clients (or commissioning companies) of construction projects specify their need/demand order to stimulate circular building? In order to answer this question explorative and unstructured research has been employed on three main themes: circular economy, circular building and <b>tender</b> <b>specification.</b> The circular economy is an economic and industrial system, regenerative by design that aims to maximize the reuse of products and materials and minimizes or eradicates waste by ‘system thinking’. In this research, system thinking is portrayed in form of seven ‘loops’: biochemical feedstock; cascades; maintenance; reuse; remanufacture/refurbish; recycle, which allow materials to flow between the economy and user without becoming waste. Literature study, and interviewees have resulted in three main principles for circular building: 1) using materials that undermine the circular economy; 2) design for circularity; and 3) safeguarding circularity. In order to find out how these principles can be translated to the built environment and how it can be specified during tendering, four case studies have been conducted on construction projects that include circular economy as one of the main concepts. The case studies concluded that the involved parties did their best in attempting circularity but that circular economy in the built environment needs to be further developed in order to fully achieve these principles. The lack of knowledge and measuring tools makes it difficult to specify the circular economy in <b>tender</b> <b>specifications.</b> All four cases had included innovative and new ways of procurement methods. The research concludes the following five steps for clients to stimulate circular building using tender specification: 1) Defining a clear formulation of the client’s ambition; 2) Translating these ambitions to performance-based requirements and possible circular solutions; 3) Determine where to put the emphasis. The more detailed the specification, the more the market parties will be limited; 4) Involving a consortium; 5) Willingness, trust and transparency between the involved parties are key to stimulate innovation and circular solutions.

40|$|One {{objective}} {{of government is}} to provide services at least cost whilst maintaining or improving service quality. While this {{may be an important}} objective, questions are being asked whether services can be provided more efficiently and effectively by the private rather than by the government sector. The shift of service provision from the public to the private sector is known as outsourcing or contracting out. The objective in this study is to critically examine whether the contracting out of services by local government to the private sector is an efficient management practice. The contracting out of Parks and Grounds Maintenance services for the City of Kingston in the State of Victoria, Australia, is used as an exploratory case study to identify the variables associated with management decision-making in the contracting out process. Factors relevant to the contracting out decision such as the criteria used in selecting a contractor; the evaluation of a contractor’s performance; and any subsequent changes to management practice relating to the contracting out of the services are identified and discussed. Political forces were found to be an important consideration in the initial contracting out decision, and the selection of a contractor was influenced by the potential to avoid costs. It was also found that under-bidding and associated cost /profit constraints lead to contractors engaging in non-sustainable environmental practices which resulted in the degradation of the local government’s Parks and Gardens assets. A sustainable asset management philosophy as opposed to an avoidable costs approach now underpins the contracting out process to ensure the preservation of such assets. Further, administrative processes have been revised to make <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> more prescriptive, critical components of services have been brought back in-house, and management practices have been amended so that a greater degree of control is exercised over contractors’ activities. <br /...|$|R
