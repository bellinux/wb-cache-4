5|$|Troilus' {{death was}} also {{described}} in the Cypria, one of {{the parts of the}} Epic Cycle that is no longer extant. The poem covered the events preceding the Trojan War and the first part of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself</b> up to the events of the Iliad. Although the Cypria does not survive, most of an ancient summary of the contents, thought to be by Eutychius Proclus, remains. Fragment 1 mentions that Achilles killed Troilus, but provides no more detail. However, Sommerstein takes the verb used to describe the killing (phoneuei) as meaning that Achilles murders Troilus.|$|E
5|$|In this way, much to Metternich's {{disappointment}} and to Franz Josef's embarrassment, Austria began the Second Italian War of Independence against the combined forces of Piedmont-Sardinia and its ally France. Though Metternich {{was able to}} secure the replacement of Buol with his friend Rechberg, who had helped him so much in 1848, involvement in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself</b> was now beyond his capacity. Even a special task given him by Franz Josef in June 1859—to draw up secret papers addressing the event of Franz Josef's death—was now too taxing. Shortly afterwards Metternich died in Vienna on 11 June 1859, aged 86, and the last great figure of his generation. Almost everyone of note in Vienna came to pay tribute; in the foreign press his death went virtually unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1793, amid {{mounting}} tensions {{following the}} French Revolution of 1789, the recently formed French Republic, already {{at war with}} the Austrian Empire and Prussia, declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. This act spread the French Revolutionary Wars beyond Europe to encompass the British, French and Dutch colonies in the Americas and the East Indies. Britain and France were already rivals in the East Indies, having fought campaigns in the Indian Ocean during both the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) and the American War of Independence (1775–1783). More recently British and French naval forces had fought the Battle of Tellicherry in 1791 as part of the Third Anglo-Mysore War, a conflict between the East India Company (EIC), which controlled British mercantile interests in the East Indies, and the French-supported Kingdom of Mysore in Southern India. The battle was a French defeat, but it had little impact on either <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself,</b> which saw the EIC extract significant concessions from Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, or the worsening political climate in Europe.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself</b> {{seemed to}} be in a stalemate, with foreign troops and the FAZ now massed in Kolwezi, but little {{fighting}} taking place. On April 14, Moroccan General Ahmed Dlimi arrived in Kolwezi, and a combined Zairian and Moroccan force counter-attacked. 30 FAZ casualties were reported after a fortnight of quiet. They were joined by a unit of Pygmy archers.|$|E
25|$|California {{was settled}} {{primarily}} by Midwestern and Southern farmers, miners, and businessmen.

25|$|The {{causes of}} the war, the reasons for its outcome, and even the name of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself</b> are {{subjects}} of lingering contention today.

25|$|The {{theme for}} this series was people {{who contributed to}} the {{formation}} of a modern Ireland, and to this effect it includes politicians, a language, a literary and a religious figure.

25|$|Another {{change was}} the {{infusion}} of story lines based on actual events and medical developments that materialized during the Korean War. Considerable research {{was done by the}} producers, including interviews with actual MASH surgeons and personnel to develop story lines rooted in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself.</b> Such early 1950s events as the McCarthy era, various sporting events, and the stardom of Marilyn Monroe were all incorporated into various episodes, a trend that continued {{until the end of the}} series.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the colour}} and {{intensity}} in this rivalry is added by the fans themselves.

25|$|The cities {{played a}} major role in fomenting the American Revolution, but they were hard hit during <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself,</b> 1775-83.

Furthermore, the British occupied the cities, especially New York 1776-83, and the others for briefer periods. During the occupations they were cut off from their hinterland trade and from overland communication. When the British finally departed in 1783, they took out large numbers of wealthy merchants who resumed their business activities elsewhere in the British Empire.|$|E

25|$|Professional {{historians have}} paid much more {{attention}} to the causes of the war, than to <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself.</b> Military history has largely developed outside academe, leading to a proliferation of solid studies by non-scholars who are thoroughly familiar with the primary sources, pay close attention to battles and campaigns, and write for the large public readership, rather than the small scholarly community. Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote are among the best-known writers. Practically every major figure in the war, both North and South, has had a serious biographical study.|$|E
25|$|Over all, between April 2003 {{and late}} December 2004 {{there were an}} {{estimated}} 123 attacks on Iraqi energy infrastructures, including the country's 7,000km-long pipeline system. In response to these attacks, which cost Iraq billions of US dollars in lost oil-export revenues and repair costs, the US military set up the Task Force Shield to guard Iraq's energy infrastructure and the Kirkuk-Ceyhan Oil Pipeline in particular. In {{spite of the fact}} that little damage was done to Iraq's oil fields during <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself,</b> looting and sabotage after the war ended was highly destructive and accounted for perhaps eighty percent of the total damage.|$|E
25|$|Political {{repression}} and fraud, {{as well as}} huge income inequalities exacerbated by the land distribution system based on latifundios, in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of underpaid peasants living in precarious conditions, led to the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), an armed conflict that drastically transformed Mexico's political, social, cultural, and economical structure {{during the twentieth century}} under a premise of social democracy. <b>The</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself</b> left a harsh toll on the economy and population, which decreased over the 11-year period between 1910 and 1921. The reconstruction of the country was to take place in the following decades.|$|E
50|$|The New York City draft {{riots in}} July 1863 were violent {{disturbances}} in New York City {{that were the}} culmination of working-class discontent with new laws passed by Congress that year to draft men {{to fight in the}} ongoing American Civil <b>War.</b> <b>The</b> riots remain the largest civil insurrection in American history, aside from <b>the</b> Civil <b>War</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|R

25|$|Patriotic fervor swept California {{after the}} attack on Fort Sumter, {{providing}} the manpower for Volunteer Regiments recruited mainly from the pro-Union counties {{in the north of}} the State. When the Democratic party split over the war, Republican supporters of Lincoln took control of the state in the September elections. Volunteer Regiments were sent to occupy pro-secessionist Southern California and Tulare County, leaving them generally powerless during <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself.</b> However some Southerners traveled east to join the Confederate Army, evading Union patrols and hostile Apache. Others remaining in the state attempted to outfit a privateer to prey on coastal shipping, and late in the war two groups of partisan rangers were formed but none was successful.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt proved highly {{energetic}} and an equal match for Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan's famous barnstorming style of campaigning. In a whirlwind campaign that displayed his {{energy to the}} public, Roosevelt made 480 stops in 23 states. He denounced the radicalism of Bryan, contrasting it with the heroism of the soldiers and sailors who fought and won the war against Spain. Bryan had strongly supported <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself,</b> but he denounced the annexation of the Philippines as imperialism, which would spoil America's innocence. Roosevelt countered that it was best for the Filipinos to have stability and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. With the nation basking in peace and prosperity, the voters gave McKinley an even larger victory than that which he had achieved in 1896.|$|E
25|$|There {{remains a}} lively {{debate on the}} left, over whether the Red Clydeside {{movement}} constituted a revolutionary opportunity for the working-class, though {{on the face of}} it, {{it would appear that the}} revolutionary potential of the Clydeside working-class has been exaggerated. Firstly, except Maclean, none of the labour leaders developed a class analysis of the war, nor did they seriously consider threatening the power and authority of the state. Furthermore, it was the behaviour of those conducting the war, not <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>itself</b> that provoked opposition within the labour movement. The Independent Labour Party's May Day Manifesto of 1918 makes this very clear in calling for A Living Wage for all and Justice for our Soldiers and their Dependants. Moreover, the massive demand for men to fight in the war meant that few Glaswegian families escaped personal loss of some kind. To undermine the war effort was to risk alienating the working-class, which many labour leaders were unwilling to do-–apart from Maxton, Gallacher and Maclean.|$|E
