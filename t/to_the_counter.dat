5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign, Perfect Dark features a multiplayer mode. With {{the help of a}} Game Link Cable, two players can link together and compete in four different types of deathmatch modes, ranging from the standard kill-the-other-person on a pre-set time <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Force mode, where the first player must rescue two hostages while the second player has to guard them. Various multiplayer maps are unlocked as the player progresses through the single player mode. Additionally, {{with the use of the}} optional Transfer Pak, players can use the game's cartridge to alternatively unlock some cheats in its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Players may also use the Game Boy Printer to print out character profiles.|$|E
5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E

During his time in Italy, he met the Pope, who congratulated him on having done a [...] "great service to the Church," [...] by which he was referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> arguments he had provided against the challengers to the Biblical chronology.

2500|$|One of the efﬁcient DSSCs devices uses ruthenium-based {{molecular}} dye, e.g. [...] (N3), that {{is bound}} to a photoanode via carboxylate moieties. The photoanode consists of 12μm thick ﬁlm of transparent 10–20nm diameter TiO2 nanoparticles covered with a 4μm thick ﬁlm of much larger (400nm diameter) particles that scatter photons back into the transparent ﬁlm. The excited dye rapidly injects an electron into the TiO2 after light absorption. The injected electron diffuses through the sintered particle network to be collected at the front side transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrode, while the dye is regenerated via reduction by a redox shuttle, I3/I, dissolved in a solution. Diffusion of the oxidized form of the shuttle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> electrode completes the circuit.|$|E
