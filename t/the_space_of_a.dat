Arsenal ended their pre-season with a 3–1 victory against Watford, who staged their centenary match.

5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position. Then, in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few days, Jews {{and other minorities}} from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such as teachers, civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What {{to the majority of}} Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E

5|$|Agricola's successors {{were unable}} or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The {{fortress}} at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion, and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge were abandoned within <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few years. By CE 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands, {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period, as may Castle Greg in West Lothian. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from coast to coast.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the crisis}} of the 3rd century was not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since {{the last days of the}} Republic. Within <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.|$|E
5|$|Coulson {{started his}} career with {{hometown}} club Scarborough, making his first-team debut in a Conference National match in 2004. His first goal for the club, scored later that year, made him the youngest goalscorer in the club's history. He signed for Championship club Barnsley in 2006, before making a return to Conference Premier football with a loan at Northwich Victoria in 2007. Coulson suffered two cruciate ligament injuries in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year before being loaned to Chester City of the Conference Premier in 2009. Coulson joined League Two club Grimsby Town on loan later that year, signing for the club permanently in 2010 after their relegation to the Conference Premier. He left Grimsby in 2012, signing for newly promoted League Two club York City. In 2016, after four years with York, Coulson signed for Scottish Premiership club St Johnstone.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the sale}} of Jimmy Case, Kennedy began to become disillusioned with Liverpool, and was sent off twice in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few weeks early in the 1981–82 season – the first red cards of his career. He made his final league {{appearance}} for the club on 5 December, when he scored in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. His final cup game for the club came eight days later, in a 3–0 defeat to Brazilian side Flamengo in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium. He was replaced in the team by Ronnie Whelan. Liverpool {{went on to win}} the league title after finishing four points ahead of second-place Ipswich Town, and Kennedy's 15 league appearances in the first half of the campaign were enough to earn him another league championship medal. Sunderland attempted to sign him on loan in January 1982, but were denied by Liverpool, and Kennedy could not agree personal terms with manager Alan Durban so was not signed by Sunderland on a permanent transfer.|$|E
5|$|Joan {{gradually}} strengthened as {{it passed}} over the southern Windward Islands on October 15. It continued heading west {{in response to a}} strong Ridge, and passed over the Guajira Peninsula on October 17. After entering the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea, Joan strengthened into a hurricane. It then slowly executed a small counterclockwise loop, possibly in response to the nearby Tropical Depression Eighteen. Upwelling caused by the quasi-stationary hurricane weakened the system. As the nearby depression dissipated, Joan resumed its westward track. A strong anticyclone over the southwestern Caribbean Sea created an extremely favorable environment, and Joan underwent rapid deepening at a rate of 38millibars in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> day. With a minimum pressure of 932millibars, Joan was one of the strongest October hurricanes since 1961. At the time, it was located at 12°N, the southernmost Category 4 hurricane ever recorded at the time. That record has since been broken by Hurricane Ivan.|$|E
5|$|Manager Bill Nicholson and his {{assistant}} Eddie Baily then began a period of transition at White Hart Lane– key players such as Danny Blanchflower, John White and Dave Mackay would all leave the club within <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few years {{and had to be}} replaced. Greaves remained a consistent goalscorer though, and in the 1963–64 season he scored hat-tricks in victories over Nottingham Forest, Blackpool, Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers. Spurs finished in fourth place, six points behind champions Liverpool, and exited the FA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup at the opening stages. Greaves scored 35 goals in 41 league games to again finish as the division's top scorer. Strike partner Bobby Smith left the club in the summer, though Greaves felt the partnership he went on to form with new signing Alan Gilzean was even more effective.|$|E

The club broke the British transfer record again in 1981 with the £1.5million signing of Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. When Andy Cole signed for United in January 1995, the club paid £7million, almost double their previous record of £3.75million, which they paid for Roy Keane 18 months earlier. In the summer of 2001, the club broke their transfer record twice in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> month, first paying PSV £19million for Ruud van Nistelrooy, and then £28.1million to Lazio for Juan Sebastián Verón.|$|E
5|$|President Antanas Smetona's {{unconditional}} {{acceptance of a}} second ultimatum in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> little over one year became {{a major source of}} dissatisfaction with his authoritarian rule. The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis: the passive cabinet of Vladas Mironas was replaced by a cabinet headed by General Jonas Černius. For {{the first time since the}} 1926 coup d'état, the government included members of the opposition: Leonas Bistras, of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, was named Minister of Education and Jurgis Krikščiūnas, of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union, was named Minister of Agriculture. Because other parties were banned, Bistras and Krikščiūnas were officially billed as independent private citizens. Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well. However, even the looming international crisis did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite, and they continued to engage in petty political disputes.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E
