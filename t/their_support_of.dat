5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>their</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Truman, the Joint Chiefs became viewed as {{politically}} tainted. Senator Taft regarded Bradley in particular with suspicion, due to Bradley's focus on Europe {{at the expense of}} Asia. Taft urged Eisenhower to replace the chiefs as soon as possible. First to go was Vandenberg, who had terminal cancer and had already announced plans to retire. On 7 May 1953, Eisenhower announced that he would be replaced by General Nathan Twining.

5|$|Gandhi took {{leadership}} of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew <b>their</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him {{and tens of thousands}} of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.|$|E

When Leslie, who enjoyed only lukewarm support from his party, sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1871, Brown's name was among those put in nomination against his; after a few ballots, however, it became clear that Brown {{would not be able to}} gain a majority, and his supporters abandoned <b>their</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> him in favor of other candidates. The following year, Brown was re-elected to the House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote of 10,888 to 457 and was allowed to assume his seat. He was twice re-elected, serving until 1877.|$|E
5|$|No Doubt became {{frustrated}} {{at the lack}} of progress they were making with Interscope, who were proving unreliable in <b>their</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the band.

Their independence shocked their company representative, Tony Ferguson, who had assumed they were recording a third single.|$|E
5|$|Questions of {{allegiance}} immediately arose amongst indigenous rulers. Central Javanese principalities, for example, immediately declared themselves Republican, while many raja ('rulers') {{of the outer}} islands, who had been enriched from <b>their</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch, were less enthusiastic. Such reluctance among many outer islands was sharpened by the radical, non-aristocratic, and sometimes Islamic nature of the Java-centric Republican leadership. Support did, however, come from South Sulawesi (including the King of Bone, who still recalled battles against the Dutch from early in the century), and from Makassarese and Bugis raja, who supported the Republican Governor of Jakarta, a Menadonese Christian. Many Balinese raja accepted Republican authority.|$|E

5|$|Sound Transit {{suspended}} {{planning for}} the Portage Bay tunnel in 2000 after it received construction bids that were $171 million higher than expected and found, through soil testing, that a deeper tunnel would be required. The project's costs overall rose $1 billion over budget and the schedule was delayed by three years, due to unrealistic cost and time estimates made during previous stages of planning. Capitol Hill businesses, while initially supportive of the light rail station's placement, later pulled <b>their</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the cut and cover option due to the longer period required for construction. Sound Transit, faced with budget issues and further schedule delays, deferred construction of the segment between Downtown Seattle and the University District in 2001 while re-evaluating alignment options.|$|E
