5|$|St Edern's {{is built}} in the Perpendicular style using local stone, with blocks of cut {{sandstone}} as the external face. The roof is made from slate with stone copings and has a bellcote at the west end, with one bell (dating probably from the 17th century). There is one external buttress to the south-east of the nave to help support {{the weight of the}} building, and there are crosses on the roof of <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> at the east end of the nave and chancel roofs.|$|E
5|$|The Town Hall {{was built}} in 1778, with <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> arcade being added in 1861 and the balcony and round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building. It {{replaced}} the former {{on the site of}} the Market and Assize Hall in the Market Place, and a Canonical House also known as 'The Exchequer', on the authority of an Act of Parliament dated 1779. The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The Assize court last sat here in October 1970.|$|E

In particular the ornamental iron fencework shows Eastlake influence in its medieval design.|$|E
25|$|The church (extensively {{restored}} in 1894) still retains its unpretentious character.

25|$|During the encounters, the Fords fired several {{shots at}} the {{creature}} and believed that they had hit it, though no traces of blood were found.

25|$|The nave and {{choir of}} the cathedral of Notre Dame were built next, in the 13th century, against the south wall {{of the church of}} St. Étienne. The first part {{constructed}} was <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> bell tower, at the western end of the nave, between the baptistery and the nave. This part of the church, like the residence of the bishop at the other end, had a strongly military appearance, as if to stress the power of the bishop in temporal as well as spiritual affairs.|$|E

25|$|In 1976 Williams {{was wounded}} in a drive-by {{shooting}} in Compton {{by members of the}} Bloods. While sitting on the porch of his house one evening as he'd let his dog out for a walk, a carload of Bloods drove by the house and opened fire on Williams. Attempting to avoid getting hit, Williams dove from <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> {{was wounded in}} both of his legs. Despite being told by doctors that he would never walk again, Williams began a nearly year-long process of physical rehabilitation and an intense workout regimen, ultimately regaining his ability to walk.|$|E
25|$|The front (east) {{elevation}} {{is framed}} by two octagonal towers {{and the entire}} structure is clad in a pink-colored brick. The building's hip roof features overhanging eaves, an element common to Prairie style architecture. The entire structure rests upon a stepped, limestone water table. The main feature of the front facade, besides the octagonal towers, is the 20ft (6.10 m) X 20ft, one-story sun porch projecting from the building. The sun porch has a low-pitched hip roof with an eave that projects over the front door, which is centered on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> flanked by two pairs of casement windows. Above the sun porch, on the second floor, {{is a pair of}} art glass doors which open onto a balcony between the two octagonal towers.|$|E
25|$|The front {{facade of}} the {{residence}} consists of eye-catching peach and white brick masonry and stucco front porch with a main arched balcony crowned by a female face. A second, smaller, arched entrance is the main entryway into <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> house. Early 1900s ironworks gracefully separate the front porch from the front street sidewalk. The front doors of the house are wooden louvered characteristic of the middle-to-late 19th century. A circular front wall wind hole with decorative molding accentuates the porch; another smaller circular opening decorates high above the archway into the porch. The interior consists of nine rooms, a long, sunny, lateral hallway with multiple wooden veneer shutters, and an external cobble-stone foyer leading to the back courtyard.|$|E

25|$|Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral is a Romanesque cathedral, {{which was}} built in the 11th century. It was the Bishop Gontard (1063–1099) who drove {{construction}} of this edifice which is now the oldest in the city. Several blocks of stone from the Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral were reused from the Gallo-Roman buildings of the city of Valentia. The Cathedral of St. Apollinaris, which has an architecturally notable apse, and was consecrated in 1095 by pope Urban II. It suffered extensive damage in the French Wars of Religion, but it was restored {{in the first decade of}} the 17th century. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> the stone tower above it were rebuilt in 1861. The church contains the monument of Pius VI, who died at Valence in 1799. The library and the museum containing Roman antiquities, sculptures, and a picture gallery are housed in the old ecclesiastical seminary.|$|E
25|$|The small Church of England parish church, {{adjacent}} to the manor house, is dedicated to All Saints and has a chancel, a nave, a vestry, a south chapel, a bell-cote crowned by a short octagonal spire, and a porch on its west side. Of the original 14th-century church only part of its nave survives, a new chancel having been built about 1480, when <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> south chapel were added. The present vestry {{was added to the}} east of the chapel in 1775. There are traces of wall paintings and of panels depicting the life of St Katherine, which were described in 1760 before being whitewashed over. The vestry screen may date from the late 15th century, and an oak pulpit is late 17th century. The organ case is richly decorated and looks medieval but is modern. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1962.|$|E
25|$|These {{two parts}} of the church {{represent}} the zenith of the Late Gothic craft of masonry and are perhaps the best examples of the late Flamboyant style in northern France (c. 1480-1525). Its magisterial and arresting visual presence offered visual proof of Louviers’ stability, power, and wealth. Stylistically, the projecting porch and façade created a visual link between Louviers and Rouen, home to very similar Late Gothic monuments and the seat of the powerful archbishop. A veritable lacework of intricately carved stone, the completion of the façade and south porch in 1510 effectively reoriented the entire church. Subsequently, the south porch and portal became the main point of entry and, ultimately, {{the focal point of the}} entire town. Indeed, upon entering Louviers from the south, one witnesses the impressive effect of the alignment of <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> portal with the “Grand-Rue.” The architecture draws viewers closer, overwhelming them with its visual complexity. Sinuous Flamboyant window tracery, tall ogee gables, an openwork balustrade, spiky pinnacles, and countless sculptures nestled in richly-carved nodding niches give the façade an unmatched quality of richness, visual complexity, and dynamism that was never replicated. Within decades of its completion, the great era of medieval Gothic construction in France drew to a close.|$|E

These foxes were all handsomely dressed, the girl-foxes and women-foxes wearing gowns of feathers woven together effectively and colored in bright hues which Dorothy thought were quite artistic and decidedly attractive.|$|R
