", ISBN 978 - 0 - 7844 - 7854 - 7 In this paper, the Eurocode 2 (EC 2) approach for strength and stiffness prediction of concrete is adapted to soil-cement laboratory formulations for Jet Grouting (JG) and Cutter Soil Mixing (CSM) technologies. In particularly, EC 2 approach performance using laboratory test data at early ages (e. g. 3, 7 or 14 days) is compared with the conventional 28 days <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure.</b> As expected, the achieved results show a decrease in EC 2 approach performance when test data at early ages are used. However, it is also observed just a slightly difference in EC 2 approach performance when test data at 14 days or 28 days are used. This observation allows us to balance the model prediction accuracy and time consuming in the final project and construction work costs...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} different post cure parameters to a polymer matrix particulate reinforced composite material. The goal is to evaluate the importance of different factors and to suggest a well-balanced post cure mode that supports {{the application of the}} material. Polymer matrix composites are post cured at elevated temperature {{to increase the amount of}} cross linking to achieve better chemical and heat resistance and mechanical properties. Every material has an individual post cure process that depends from the raw materials. Post curing variables include temperature, duration of cure, the time between initial curing and post curing and temperature profile gradient. There are several ways to determine the cure state of a polymer. It can be evaluated based on the mechanical and physical properties, residual styrene content, glass transition temperature, residual exotherm or solvent swelling test. For the determination of the suitable post cure parameters test slabs were casted and post cured with varying time and temperature. Glass transition temperature, residual exotherm, softening in ethanol, surface hardness, flexural strength and flexural modulus were determined. It is shown that the material should be cured at 60 °C – 80 °C. With higher temperature and extended <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> the glass transition temperature raises but the material becomes too brittle. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|Two polyacid-modified {{composite}} resins, Dyract and Compoglass, {{have been}} studied for water-uptake on storage in three aqueous media, namely pure water, 0. 9 % NaCl and 1 M NaCl at 37 degrees C, and the results {{compared with those of}} a conventional composite resin, Pekafill. The equilibrium water-uptake of Dyract and Compoglass varied depending on <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> and ionic strength of the storage medium. This latter finding contrasted with that for Pekafill, where equilibrium water content showed almost no variation with ionic strength of the storage medium. Uptake of water was always greater in Dyract and Compoglass than in Pekafill, reflecting the role of water in promoting the later neutralization reaction in these materials and its further role in hydrating the ionic products of that reaction. Despite this and other evidence of neutralization, specimens of Dyract and Compoglass stored in wet conditions (0. 9 % NaCl) showed no change in compressive strength on storage from 24 h to 30 days, a result similar to that reported previously for Dyract alone for flexural strength for times up to 1 year. By contrast, specimens of Dyract and Compoglass stored in dry air at 37 degrees C, and therefore unable to undergo any neutralization, showed an increase in compressive strength of between 40 and 70 MPa by 30 days that was significant at P < 0. 01.

The analysis was performed by an optical fiber (OF) bioanalyzer; which was constituted by two main components: a miniaturized chromatographic system and a detection system based on an OF coated with an enzymatic matrix. In this study some working conditions such as, number of fibers in the miniaturized chromatographic column, number of dips for sensitive coating deposition, temperature and <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> of the sensitive matrix, were optimized {{in order to achieve}} higher analytical performance. After tested for calibration the bioanalyzer was applied to urine samples analysis of catecholamines and their metabolites, comparing the results with those obtained by both, a classical analytical method, namely high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ED), and an OF biosensor based on a sensitive cladding of laccase (LacOF biosensor). The results of catecholamines in patients with DS revealed that 15 % and 22. 5 % of the analyzed subjects showed DA and AD concentrations, respectively, above the pathological levels.

In a limited vaccination trial, four rhesus monkeys were immunized four consecutive times with the Mr 74, 000 protein and Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants. Two monkeys were injected with adjuvant only. Upon challenge with 10 (4) viable P. knowlesi schizonts of the heterologous W strain, the control monkeys developed fatal parasitemias after 7 d. In contrast, the vaccinated monkeys exhibited a delayed onset of patent parasitemias and underwent self-cure on days 14 to 16 after peak parasitemias of between 7 and 11 %. The protective immunity that was induced crossed different strains of P. knowlesi. Blood smears at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> demonstrated limited reinfection, {{as indicated by the}} presence of normally appearing ring and trophozoite stages. The absence of schizont stages in the peripheral blood suggested a specific interruption of the erythrocytic schizogony at that stage.

In a prospective randomised controlled trial, 35 women with history of pain were, upon confirmation of minimal to moderate endometriosis at diagnostic laparoscopy, randomised to immediate surgical or medical treatment. They {{were asked to complete}} analogue pain score sheets, and their symptoms were reviewed before treatment and at 3, 6, and 12  months after treatment. The cost of the medical or surgical treatment was evaluated from the time of diagnosis to the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> or symptom relief. The average cost per Helica probe is £ 111.81 with the machine on free loan, and the total cost of a 6 -month course of injectable Zoladex with add-back therapy is £ 811.92. The costs involved in the two treatment modalities were analysed using the Mann–Whitney test; a p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. In the medical group, three women out of 18 were symptom-free, 11 required surgical treatment of endometriosis, one had a laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, and three became pregnant before their final reviews. In the surgical group, nine women were symptom-free at the end of 12  months, four required Zoladex therapy, one required oral contraceptive pills, and three required repeat surgical treatment. The average cost per patient in the surgical arm was £ 323.29 and in the medical arm was £ 918.12 (p< 0.0001). Mean operating times in the surgical and medical arms were 32.35 min and 20.83  min, respectively. This suggests that when facilities and expertise are available, it is better to see and treat mild to moderate endometriosis. There were no surgical complications in our series. Surgical treatment with HTC therapy is safe and is a cheaper and more effective therapy. This is the first study that has looked at the cost-effectiveness of HTC therapy in managing mild to moderate endometriosis.|$|E

Total RNA was extracted from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) stimulated in vitro with L. braziliensis antigens. The extracted RNA was used to quantify specific gene expression by Real Time PCR using customized assay kits. The experiments showed that there is no change in transcription for TBET, GATA 3 or FOXP 3 at studied CCL groups, however SH patients have significantly higher gene copy number for all analyzed TF. LCC> 2 a patients showed reduced expression of IL 12 A in comparison with LCC 2 a in comparison with LCC< 2 a patients, but this difference was not statistically relevant. Besides increased expression of transcriptional regulators, CE patients showed significant increase in gene copy numbers for IFNG, IL 12 A, IL 4, IL 5, e IL 10.

40|$|AbstractIn EN 13670 : 2009 standard: Execution of {{concrete}} structures there are general rules <b>of</b> moisture <b>curing</b> <b>of</b> concrete in structures. In the standard 4 classes <b>of</b> concrete <b>curing</b> are described. Determination <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> class depends on required level of compressive strength immediately after <b>curing</b> (percentage <b>of</b> required characteristic strength after 28 days). <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> depends on rate of strength development and concrete surface temperature. In the standard {{there is a}} lack of information about influence <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> class on concrete durability characteristics. The main condition to obtain durable concrete is proper curing regime. Not cured on improperly cured concrete has weakened surface layer. Extremely faults in curing process could lead to defects visible on the concrete surface. More often defects are latent inside the concrete and could be revealed during exploitation, leading to durability reduction. The main effect is increase of surface layer porosity (reinforcement cover) and decrease of its protective properties and tightness. Consequently worsening of mechanical properties could be observed as well as water-tightness, frost resistance, chemical aggression resistance, carbonation resistance and diffusivity of chloride. The analysis shown in the paper are the result of 3 -yers long investigation conducted by authors, which main goal was to determine appropriateness and way to include durability requirements in designing <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> class according to EN 13670 : 2009. Thawing-freezing resistance, scaling with salts resistance, depth of water penetration under pressure and absorptivity were adopted as the basic durability factors.

In cementing operation, the annulus between the casing and the adjacent rock formation is filled with a certain compound of cement grout and allowed to set, usually after a few hours or a few days, and solidify strongly to join the casing to the formation. This compound could be made from different ingredients with different percentage of weight with respect to the weight of cement in the grout mixture (Labibzadeh et al. 2010). Compressive strength is one of the properties used to test the reliability of cementing and is the ability of a material to withstand deformation when load is applied.

The investigation revealed that use of waste materials like fly ash, microsilica, rice husk ash, and ground granulated blast furnace slag which are otherwise hazardous to the environment {{may be used as}} a partial replacement of cement, which leads to economy and in addition by utilizing the industrial wastes in the useful manner the environment pollution is also reduced to great extent and which leads to sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{resistivity}} {{measurement of}} freshly prepared uncured and cured soil-cement materials {{is done and}} {{the correlations between the}} factors controlling the performance of soil-cement and electrical resistivity are discussed in this paper. Conventional quality control of soil-cement quite often involves wastage of a lot of material, if it does not meet the strength criteria. In this study, it is observed that, in soil-cement, resistivity follows a similar trend as unconfined compressive strength, with increase in cement content and <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing.</b> Quantitative relations developed for predicting 7 -day strength of soil-cement mix, using resistivity of the soil-cement samples at freshly prepared state, after 1 -hour curing help to decide whether the soil-cement mix meets the desired strength and performance criteria. This offers the option of the soil-cement mix to be upgraded (possibly with additional cement) in its fresh state itself, if it does not fulfil the performance criteria, rather than wasting the material after hardening...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{kinetics}} of tissue adhesives used for supporting the hemostasis and wound closure during surgical intervention. There are several types of adhesives of different composition which is closely related with their application. The <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> {{plays an important role}} because some applications may require very fast glue for prompt vessel or wound closure; conversely some situations need slower solidification because of longer manipulation with the glue during surgery. Here, the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy is used for studying the kinetics of the glues. To slow the reaction rate, an oily substance is added to the glue samples. The technique of attenuated total reflection is used in this application; the defined amount of glue sample or its mixture is applied on the silicon crystal and the terahertz response is measured in time. This time dependences are analyzed to find time constants for mathematical description of the glue kinetics. © 2015 COPYRIGHT SPIE...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies are}} carried out on two {{different}} glass-epoxy composites (one room temperature curing epoxy-amine system and the other, an elevated temperature curing epoxy-amine system) subjected to two different curing techniques (thermal and microwave), in order to investigate the effects on their thermomechanical properties. Microwave (MW) curing is carried out using a laboratory scale, custom-built, multi-mode microwave cure chambery operating at a frequency of 2450 MHz. Tensile and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) properties <b>of</b> the MW <b>cured</b> composites either compared well, or were superior, to those <b>of</b> their thermally <b>cured</b> counterparts, offering the added advantages <b>of</b> reduced <b>cure</b> cycle <b>time,</b> uniformity <b>of</b> <b>cure,</b> and substantial energy savings. Further, the glass transition temperature (Tlt;subgt;glt;/subgt;) values <b>of</b> MW <b>cured</b> composite laminates are slightly superior to those <b>of</b> thermally <b>cured</b> laminates. amp;copy; 2006 SAGE Publications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe mix between 4 M to 12 M NaOH {{solution}} and aluminosilicate material forms a thick paste {{that can be}} compacted in a mold in order to manufacture bricks at relatively low temperatures (< 100 °C). Starting materials available in Senegal consist of soils that primarily contain kaolin. In this study, we compare the performance of clay from the Niemenike deposit and clay pre-treated at 700 °C. The performance of the two clays depends on the temperature <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> and on the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing.</b> In long-term tests (1 week to 3 months), for bricks kept at 40 °C/ 60 % RH, strength did not increase with time for both clays (natural and calcined) activated with sodium hydroxide but this depends on the NaOH concentration. The maximum strength is obtained after 14 days for all concentrations. For all concentrations and periods, strength obtained with natural clay is greater. For short-term tests (6 h, 12 h, 24 h), with bricks kept at 120 °C/ 0 % RH, the situation changed. The calcined clay gave the best mechanical performances. For all cases, long-term or short term, calcined or not, strength increased with concentration. The bricks produced in this fashion are durable and relatively inexpensive to make...|$|R
