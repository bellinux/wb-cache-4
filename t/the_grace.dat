5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} Tudor monarchs, {{including}} Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, by <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of God alone.

These included acts of diplomacy (including royal marriages), declarations of war, management of the coinage, the issue of royal pardons {{and the power to}} summon and dissolve parliament as and when required. Nevertheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, the monarch worked within established limits, whether legal or financial, that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and parliament (representing the gentry).|$|E

5|$|At {{some time}} between his {{coronation}} and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun, {{which was written}} in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius wrote down {{the sequence of events}} that occurred after the death of Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several times that he is the rightful king by <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as a clay tablet containing an Old Persian cuneiform of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Gilbert faced {{financial}} difficulty {{as an amateur}} cricketer. Most amateurs were from privileged backgrounds, whereas professionals mainly came from the working class. It was almost unthinkable for an amateur to become a professional, although many did receive financial inducements such as generous expenses and sinecure positions within county organisations. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>Grace</b> brothers, Gilbert {{did not have a}} profession outside cricket to provide a supplementary income allowing him to live comfortably. A solution seemed to arrive in 1880, when Fred Grace, the manager of the United South of England XI touring side and one of W. G. Grace's brothers, died and Gilbert took over his paid job as secretary. But the popularity of professional touring teams was already in decline, and the increasing number of matches between county teams attracted more interest. An indication of trouble came in 1882 when a professional cricketer took Gilbert to court over unpaid fees for an appearance in a match.|$|E

"The Boeotians {{say that}} Eteocles {{was the first}} man to {{sacrifice}} to <b>the</b> <b>Graces.</b> Moreover, they are aware that he established three as the number of <b>the</b> <b>Graces,</b> but they have no tradition of the names he gave them. The Lacedaemonians, however, say that <b>the</b> <b>Graces</b> are two, and that they were instituted by Lacedaemon, son of Taygete, who gave them the names of Cleta ("Sound" [...] or [...] "Renowned") and Phaenna (“Light” or “Bright”). These are appropriate names for Graces, as are those given by the Athenians, who from of old have worshipped two Graces, Auxo ("Increase" [...] or [...] "Growth") and Hegemone ("Leader" [...] or [...] "Queen"), until Hermesianax added Peitho ("Persuasion") as a third. It was from Eteocles of Orchomenus that we learned the custom of praying to three Graces.
