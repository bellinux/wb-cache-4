30|$|These are {{well-known}} <b>thermal</b> <b>anemometers</b> {{and measure}} a fluid velocity by noting the heat convected {{away by the}} fluid. The core of the anemometer is an exposed hot wire/film either heated up by a constant current or maintained at a constant temperature. In either case, the heat lost to fluid convection {{is a function of}} the fluid velocity. The average cost of this instrument is in the range of 10, 000 – 20, 000 rupees and marked as low-cost velocity-measuring instrument compared to acoustic Doppler velocimeter (around 10 – 20 lakhs), particle image velocimeter (30 – 50 lakhs) and laser Doppler velocimeter (1 – 1.5 crore rupees). HWA/HFA has high spatial resolution (Hutchins et al. 2009) and high frequency response > 10  kHz (up to 400  kHz). HWA/HFA has turned into a standard instrument for turbulent research in low-speed flow (Kovasznay 2012). Time constant of the instrument is in the order of 10 − 4 – 10 − 6  s, which shows its good dynamic characteristics. For the measurement of velocities, the chance of error is ± 0.1  % and for turbulence ± 2  % (Nakra and Chaudhry 2004). It was demonstrated that hot wire anemometer is intrinsically inappropriate for measuring turbulent temperature correlations; the major reason is the non-linearity of the temperature sensitivity at low overheat ratios. The instrument is therefore restricted to measurements of the mass flow fluctuations (Smits et al. 1983). HWA/HFA requires to be recalibrated frequently due to dust accumulation, so it is used only for very clean environments.|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic {{anemometer}} (UA) is a {{core application}} in natural environment measurement. As well known, mechanical anemometer works well in good weather {{but it is}} not suitable to be applied in bad environment such as polar region and upper air. On the other hand, ultrasonic anemometer works well in most situations. Moreover, ultrasonic anemometer has wider detectable wind speed range. It can be said that ultrasonic anemometer is a more advanced instrument to measure wind velocity. In this paper, the theory of ultrasonic anemometer is first discussed. Using the theory, a test bed is then designed and constructed to measure one-dimensional wind speed. Active Butterworth filter is introduced into the circuit in order to increase the stability and accuracy.

The designed features of such a sensor include low thermal conduction via substrate, wide dynamic range (0 ~ 180 L/Min) to cover high peak flow rate and possible low cost mass production. To meet these requirements, we used both surface and bulk micromachining techniques to fabricate the sensor for optimal performance. Testing of constructed prototype showed that it can be used under low operating voltage of 3 volts.

40|$|Aeolian sand {{transport}} models, widely {{employed by}} coastal scientists and managers, assume {{temporal and spatial}} homogeneity within the saltation field. This research questions that assumption by demonstrating that the saltation field is event-driven, therefore indicating that the saltation field is not temporally steady. The findings from this research may explain {{a portion of the}} conclusions from previous studies that indicated inequalities between model-estimated and field-measured aeolian sand transport. The relationship between unsteadiness in a turbulent wind field and pulses in a sand transport field was investigated on a beach near Shoalhaven Heads, New South Wales, Australia. Microphone-based saltation sensors, ?miniphones,? and <b>thermal</b> <b>anemometers</b> (both instruments constructed exclusively for this field experiment) were co-located (0. 02 m separation on center) and deployed between 0. 01 and 0. 0225 m above the bed, and sampled at 6000 Hz. Average grain size at the field site was 0. 30 mm. Five runs totaling 2050 seconds of wind and saltation data were analyzed. The continuous wavelet transform, using the Morlet wavelet base, was the principle method for analyzing the wind and saltation records. The cross continuous wavelet transform was used to analyze the wind and saltation time series concurrently. Wind, saltation, and cross events were discerned by selecting wavelet power coefficients between wavelet scales of 0. 4 and 3. 0 seconds and with coefficients exceeding the 95 % confidence interval. Average event spacing was 6. 10, 6. 50, and 6. 73 seconds for the wind, saltation, and cross events, respectively. The average event spacing measured in this research was compared to the empirical-based model presented by Rao, Narashimha, and Narayanan (1971). The correspondence between the model and this research strongly suggests that bursting-type coherent structures were present. The durations of average wind, saltation, and cross events were 1. 87, 2. 10, and 1. 73 seconds, respectively. Integral time scales, calculated using normalized auto correlation and power spectral density analysis, were approximately two seconds for the wind and saltation systems. The temporal coincidence of the integral time scale estimations and the event durations for the wind and saltation system strongly suggests that wind events are driving sand transport events...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{recognize}} {{the problems associated with}} the transport mechanism of containment during the ventilation process of a laboratory fume hood, a transparent, full scale chemical fume hood is constructed for experimental studies. Distributions of mean velocity and velocity fluctuation in the sash plane are measured using a <b>thermal</b> <b>anemometer.</b> Flow patterns and tracer-gas concentration leakages are respectively diagnosed via the laser-assisted flow visualization method and the EN 14175 - 3 test protocol. The magnitudes of measured velocity fluctuations exhibit a sharp peak along the perimeter of the sash opening. The results of flow visualization verify that the elevated turbulence fluctuations are induced by the boundary-layer separation when the flow passes over the edges of sash perimeter. The tracer gas experiment shows that the regions where high degree containment leakages detected are located along the perimeter of hood aperture. Eleven commercial hoods which are claimed with fine aerodynamic design are further tested for confirmation of these observations. The results show similar correlations. Conclusions thus are made that large-scale vortex structures occurring around the perimeters of hood aperture due to the boundary-layer separation could induce strong turbulence, and therefore enhance dispersion of the hood containment...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Thermal</b> Transient <b>Anemometer</b> (TTA) is a fluid {{mass flow}} {{measuring}} device which utilizes a thermocouple as a probe. The probe is periodically heated by an electric current pulse through the thermocouple junction, and the measured {{rate of cooling}} between pulses {{is related to the}} local mean flow velocity. The standard thermocouple sensor provides an inexpensive flow probe which is durable, rugged, and capable of satisfactory operation in hostile environments. The TTA was developed and patented in prototype form by Instrument Development for Applied Physics (IDAP), a small US company. IDAP has tested the TTA and shown that the measurement principle is valid. However, {{there is a need to}} refine the prototype so that the TTA becomes a commercially viable instrument. The main concern is to reduce the heating current to the TTA so that battery-powered operation is possible. To do this, a probe needs to be developed such that only the region local to the thermocouple junction is heated, rather than the entire length of the wire. There area number of ways that this might be done, and IDAP has worked with ARi Industries, a thermocouple manufacturer, to develop probe designs that would have this characteristic, and at the same time would retain the ruggedness and ease of manufacture of a standard thermocouple. The purpose of this CRADA was to investigate these designs with a view to their possible commercial development. The starting point was to develop a computer model of the TTA as it currently exists, i. e., the prototype configuration, and to compare the results with experimental data.

40|$|In July 1995, National Science Foundation Award # 9551869 {{funded the}} {{development}} of a new inter-disciplinary microfabrication course under the primary leadership of Dr. Kevin Walsh at the University of Louisville. Along with this award, the completed construction of a new building in 1996 that contained a class 1000 / 100 cleanroom laboratory facilitated {{the development of}} the course. Moreover, curricula had to be completed to provide students with practical, hands-on experience in building Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices using processes and methodologies introduced in the course. Dr. Walsh wanted to include a mass airflow sensor in his portfolio of total possible devices students could build in the cleanroom lab for the course. This document describes the design of a bulk-micromachined, monolithic, mass airflow sensor with a thermally-isolated, thin-film, dielectric, microbridge/diaphragm design. In addition, several fabrication methodologies were explored, as well as a means to test and evaluate the sensors for this undergraduate class laboratory. The mass airflow sensor architecture chosen was based upon a closed-loop-control,microelectronic <b>thermal</b> (hot-wire) <b>anemometer</b> design, which was first developed and presented by Johnson, Higashi, et. al. at Honeywell in the mid 1980 s [2]. Two separate photomask sets were developed using L-Edit™ software (by Tanner Research), with each set including multiple geometric variations of a dual/triple microbridge/cantilever flow sensor structure to be suspended over a precision, anisotropically-etched pit, integrated onto a (100) silicon substrate. Four primary structural fabrication strategies were explored to produce the thin-film material for the flow sensors: (1) RF planar magnetron sputter-deposited 1 m m -thick silicon nitride microbridges/cantilevers; (2) anodically-bonded-and-machined 20 - 30 m m -thick borosilicate glass diaphragms; (3) spin-on-glass microbridges/cantilevers; and (4) low-stress, 0. 5 m m -thick, LPCVD silicon nitride microbridges/cantilevers. Four resistor metallizations were separately evaluated: permalloy (Ni 81 Fe 19), chromium, titanium, and platinum. A process was developed and documented to successfully fabricate flow sensors with low stress LPCVD silicon nitride microbridges/cantilevers. DC planar magnetron sputterdeposited platinum thin-film resistors (with a ~ 120 nm-thick RF planar magnetron sputterdeposited chromium adhesion layer), with nominal thicknesses of ~ 56 – 70 nm, were delineated by photolithographic imaging techniques. The resistors had measured Temperature Coefficients of Resistance (TCR) in the range of 1. 93 – 2. 25 x 10 - 3 W /W /°C at 25 - 125 °C. Anisotropic KOH etching of the (100) -oriented silicon substrate was utilized to release the flow sensor microbridge/cantilever microstructures. After designing and building a flow sensor test machine capable of controlled volumetric air flow rates of up to ~ 15 SLPM (0. 54 m/s), nominal sensor sensitivities (SV) of up to 0. 67 mV/SLPM (20. 4 mV/(m/s)) were measured.

40|$|Thermal flow {{measuring}} {{technology has}} come a long way since the introduction of thermocouple technology and early hot wire <b>anemometers.</b> <b>Thermal</b> technologies depend on heat transfer and traditionally operate on differential temperature measurements between two temperature sensitive materials to generate a signal directly proportional to the temperature differential and mass flow rate. In this thesis, the development of an open-loop Fuzzy Temperature Compensation Scheme (FTCS) for Hot Wire Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor is presented. The FTCS for Hot Wire MAF Sensor is used in automotive application to measure the volume and density of air entering the engine at any given time. The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) uses this information in conjunction with input from other sensors to calculate the correct amount of fuel to deliver to the engine and also used indirectly to help calculate desired ignition timing and transmission operating strategies. This FTCS used to compensate the error occurred for the Hot Wire MAF Sensor measurement caused by the temperature variation in the air. The data collection for Hot Wire MAF Sensor inaccuracy analysis is done using NI PCI 6251 DAQ, NI Elvis Board and LABVIEW software. Based on the collected data, the absolute error and percentage error for the sensor output voltage have been calculated compared to the output voltage for the standard temperature value. Then, based on the offset error, six rules for Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) have been developed. The Sugeno type FIS is used for the FTCS design. In order to verify the performance of the proposed Hot Wire MAF Sensor temperature compensation scheme, first a simulation model is developed using Matlab/Simulink. The effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy compensation scheme is verified at different temperature variations compared with Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) Temperature Compensation Scheme. Then, based on the Matlab/Simulink simulation, the FTCS has been implemented in real-time using Digital Signal Controllers, dsPIC 30 F 4013 with the Programming C Language. In this regard, a performance comparison of the output voltage of the Hot Wire MAF Sensor after compensated using FTCS, RBFNN Temperature Compensation Scheme and without compensates is provided. These comparison results demonstrate the better improvement for the Hot Wire MAF Sensor measurement accuracy with the estimation percentage error after compensation is only within 0. 8451 % of full-scale value...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{different}} existing methods to characterise the aerodynamic sealing effect provided by an air curtain device {{placed over the}} opening between two contiguous compartments, infrared thermography has revealed {{to be a very}} useful tool. Besides allowing the capture, in an expedite way, of instantaneous images of the temperature ﬁeld in the neighbourhood of the door, the technique hereon described has other advantages, in terms of quick and easy setup, low intrusive character and liability of obtained results. To apply this method, a large sheet of paper was stretched in the direction perpendicular to the opening where the air curtain device has placed to allow the registration of pictures or video sequences with an infrared camera setup in its maximum sensitivity. Good concordance between the thermographs obtained with this technique and the temperature ﬁelds measured for the same plane with a rack of 16 low velocity omni-directional <b>thermal</b> <b>anemometer</b> probes allowed its validation. Various elucidative examples of the use of this technique as a complementary tool for analysis and visualization of the complex physical phenomena occurring for the studied ﬂow are presented in this article...|$|E
40|$|Exothermic or heated {{processes}} create potentially unsafe {{work environments}} {{for an estimated}} 5 – 10 million American workers each year. Excessive heat and process contaminants {{have the potential to}} cause adverse health effects in exposed workers. Owing to the potential hazards, engineering controls are recommended for these processes. Our understanding of heat transfer and meteorological theories, and their applications for engineering controls have evolved since seminal work was published by Hemeon in 1955. These refined theories were reviewed and used to develop a proposed equation to estimate buoyant plumemean velocity. Mean velocity is a key parameter used to estimate the plume volumetric flow required for controlling effluents from exothermic processes. Subsequent to developing the proposed equation, plume velocity data were collected with a <b>thermal</b> <b>anemometer</b> for a model exothermic process in the laboratory, and an actual exothermic process in the field. Laboratory and field results were then compared to solutions provided by the proposed, American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and Hemeon mean velocity equations. To determine which equation most closely matched the laboratory and field data, either t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were conducted (based on examination of data normality) to determine the differenc...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a study that}} forms part of a measurement assurance program (MAP) in place at Ford Motor Company. The purpose of a MAP is to assure {{on an ongoing basis}} that the total uncertainty associated with a measurement process meets the requirements of the customer. The gage repeatability and reproducibility study and statistical control chart are two traditional parts of the Ford MAP. This paper presents a new tool, the Youden plot, which combines features of both of these traditional techniques. This paper is divided into two parts: First, the test part, measurement process and traditional MAP program are described. Second, the new technique is described and applied to historical data. 1. TEST PART AND MEASUREMENT PROCESS To meet the requirements set forth by the Clean Air Act for vehicle tail pipe emissions and fuel economy requirements set by the CAFE Standards, Ford Motor Company has chosen a mass air flow sensor (MAFS) based powertrain control system. The sensor and calibration process are described in this section.

40|$|The {{novelty of}} this 2 D <b>thermal</b> <b>anemometer</b> is the spherical compact and robust design with {{improved}} sensitivity {{in the range}} of 600 - 900 Pa of carbon dioxide pressure and 0. 25 to 10 m/s wind speed. The small size (11. 2 mm diameter) and unprecedented 3 D printing fabrication of a low emissivity silver shell allows to place inside of the sphere the platinum heating and sensing resistors. It improves the performances of the Viking, Pathfinder and Curiosity wind sensors for the surface of Mars. The conduction losses to the support are largely suppressed by also heating the insertion point at the same temperature than the shell Overall, the convection power to the ambient is {{in the range of}} 30 mW per 10 K of overheat respect to the ambient, which is about the 68 % of the total power. Splitting the spherical shell into two hemispheres provides angular sensitivity and the wind direction is found from the convection power differences between them. The concept can be easily extended to three-dimensional sensing by using three of these sensors in different planes. It can also be applied to aeronautical engines such as stratospheric balloons.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the factors}} {{influencing}} on indoor air quality of the buildings is performance of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. These systems supply clean and odorless air, with temperature, humidity, and air velocity within comfort ranges for the residents. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate performance HVAC system in an administrative building in Tehran.. Material and Method: A questionnaire, developed in their research was used to assess the building occupants’ perception about the performance of HVAC system. To evaluate the performance of HVAC systems, air velocities were measured in the diffusers using a <b>thermal</b> <b>anemometer.</b> Moreover, CO 2 concentration, air temperature and relative humidity were measured in the whole floors of the building. Air distribution inside the building was evaluated using smoke test.. Results: Most of the studied people complained about the direction of airflow, thermal conditions and cigarette odor. The highest level of carbon dioxide was measured at 930 ppm inside the restaurant. The maximum and minimum air temperatures and relative humidity were measured 28. 3 - 13. 8 ° C and 28. 4 - 23 % respectively. Smoke test showed that the air distribution/direction wasn’t suitable in one third of air diffusers.. Conclusion: Improper air distribution / direction was the main problem with the studied HVAC system which could be corrected by adjusting and balancing of the system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} components for integrated microliquid handling {{systems such as}} fluid injection analysis, and first results of planar integration of components. The components discussed are channels, passive and active valves, actuators for micropumps, micromixers, microflow sensors, optical detectors, pumps and dosage systems. The dosage system described comprises a flow sensor and a pump micromachined on a single silicon wafer sandwiched between Pyrex wafers. The liquid pump is of the reciprocating type with a thermo-pneumatic actuator. The microliquid flow sensor {{is based on the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>anemometer</b> type. Both pump and flow sensor are realized in a 3 inch (100) - Si wafer using a KOH bulk etch {{from both sides of the}} wafer. The dosing system allows accurate dosing of liquid in the wl regime and can easily be integrated with components as mixers and detectors to microliquid handling systems. A new concept for micromixing of liquids is introduced and its feasibility is demonstrated. The mixer allows fast mixing of small amounts of two liquids and it is applicable to microliquid handling systems. The,mixer has a channel for the liquid, an inlet port for t h e reagent, and a mixing area, the bottom of which has 400 micronozzles (15 p m x i 5 Nm). Through these nozzles, a reagent is injected into the sample liquid, making many microplumes. These plumes speed up mixing by diffusion over a short distance. 1...|$|E
