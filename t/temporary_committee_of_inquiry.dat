50|$|The President of the Board of Trade {{is head of}} the Board of Trade. This is a {{committee}} of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, first established as a <b>temporary</b> <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> in the 17th century, that evolved gradually into a government department with a diverse range of functions. The current holder is Liam Fox who is also the Secretary of State for International Trade.|$|E

50|$|The {{international}} experience {{shows that}} giving such powers to inquiry committees {{is a common}} thing. Point 7 of rule 176 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament states that “A <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> may contact the institutions or persons referred to in Article 3 of the Decision referred to in paragraph 2 {{with a view to}} holding a hearing or obtaining documents.”Even though it was prescribed neither by the Constitution nor the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly that <b>temporary</b> <b>committees</b> have the power to hold a hearing with the presence of state and local self-government body officials, there was such a case when the committee held a closed-door hearing. On October 23 of 2008 with the order of the President <b>of</b> Armenia, a <b>temporary</b> <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> experts was formed on obtaining facts and evidence on the incidents of March 1, 2008. So as to gain the necessary information the committee was given the tools typical to a real parliamentarian inquiry committee.|$|R
50|$|Roth {{served as}} a member <b>of</b> the new <b>Committee</b> on Civic Liberties and Internal Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Sub-Committee on Human Rights. In addition, {{she was a member}} <b>of</b> two <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> in the European Parliament, namely the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> into Racism and Xenophobia and the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> into Links between Organized Crime and Drugs, {{as well as of the}} EC-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee.|$|R
40|$|What was {{important}} about the Treaty on European Union {{from the point}} of view of the European Parliament (EP) ? What were the most significant new powers that the Parliament acquired? Most observers have concentrated their attention on the new power of co-decision under Article 189 b or the expanded role in the appointment of the President and members of the European Commission; more esoteric commentaries may also mention the autonomous right of the EP to appoint a European Ombudsman, but very few have so far given much attention to Article 138 c and the right to set up a <b>temporary</b> <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> to investigate "alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law. " It is not the intention of this paper to compare the new power of inquiry directly with the reinforced legislative role of the EP or its more salient position in the appointment of the Commission. Rather it will be argued that the first two committees of inquiry set up by the Parliament in 1996 showed how the EP can operate within a relatively constraining institutional framework to make an original contribution to the scrutiny of Community policies and to bring the work of the EP to the attention of larger public than its traditional activity in relation to legislation or the appointment of the Commission normally does...|$|E
