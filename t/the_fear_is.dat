25|$|In January 2006, Weyandt, Mellinger, Lunn & Gretz {{traveled}} to Chicago {{to record their}} new album with one of their collective heroes, Steve Albini. The making of <b>The</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>Is</b> What Keeps Us Here was documented for a limited edition DVD.|$|E
25|$|Political parties universally tend {{to attract}} those {{addicted}} to fame and careerism.... Clearly, the biggest barrier to green electoral victory {{is the lack}} of proportional representation. Greens have been elected around the world in countries with PR.... <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that a leader will shift the party to the right, cutting the Greens' radical edge....|$|E
25|$|The {{call for}} a single leader would {{compromise}} the party's commitment to radical democracy. It also suggests a failure to think about strategy in any real sense. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> {{that it could be}} part of a more extensive shift towards a new green politics of shallow environmentalism, rather than a thorough critique of an unequal, profit-motivated society.|$|E

25|$|Parents {{involved}} in polyamorous relationships often {{keep it a}} secret because of the risk that it will be used by an ex-spouse, or other family member, as grounds to deprive them of custody of or access to their children. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that it will be used in family disputes much as homosexuality has been used in the past.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{treating}} the mental aspect of paruresis, such treatment {{can be achieved}} by graduated exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. In graduated exposure therapy, the subject has a trusted person stand outside the restroom at first, and once <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> overcome the observer is brought closer in, until step by step the phobia is vanquished. The International Paruresis Association provides a detailed discussion of this method on its website.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, {{the problem}} of {{wastewater}} management arose during a controversy over a planned arena for the Brooklyn Nets in nearby downtown Brooklyn. The project at that point, now called Pacific Park, was to include a basketball arena and 17 skyscrapers, with the resulting sewage would flow into antiquated combined sewers that can overflow when it rains. The Gowanus Canal has 14 combined sewer overflow points, so <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that the additional wastewater from the arena would lead to more frequent overflows in the canal.|$|E
50|$|I love Really Red. Teaching You <b>The</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>was</b> a mind-bending eye-opening album for lil' Mark Arm. It was punk rock. It was hardcore. It {{was so much}} more. It didn't easily {{fit into}} this new, {{increasingly}} inflexible, form. Teaching You <b>The</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>was</b> a litmus test for punks. If you dug Really Red, chances are you were smart and cool. If you didn't, you were sheep, a chump or a chump sheep.|$|R

5000|$|In 1995, an {{independent}} horror film called <b>The</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>was</b> released, {{which included a}} soundtrack that consisted entirely of horrorcore songs, including Insane Clown Posse's biggest radio hit, [...] "Dead Body Man".|$|R
25|$|Many of the world's countries, {{including}} many in Sub-saharan Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia, {{have seen a}} sharp rise in population {{since the end of}} the Cold War. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc.; in some of the less fortunate countries. The population of Chad has, for example, ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009, further straining its resources. Nigeria is witnessing a similar growth in population, strained resources and a possible over-population problem in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Fear may be {{politically}} and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which {{would otherwise be}} widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be wildly supported. In contexts of disasters, nation-states manage the fear not only to provide their citizens with an explanation about the event or blaming some minorities, but also to adjust their previous beliefs. The manipulation of fear is done by means of symbolic instruments as terror movies and the administration ideologies that lead to nationalism. After a disaster, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> re-channeled in a climate of euphoria based on patriotism.|$|E
25|$|To {{promote the}} album, Fear Factory {{embarked}} on extensive U.S. tours with Biohazard, Sepultura, and Sick Of It All. During this period, sampler-keyboardist Reynor Diego joined the group. An album tour of Europe with Brutal Truth, then Cannibal Corpse, Cathedral, and Sleep, followed. The following year, they hired Front Line Assembly member Rhys Fulber to remix some {{songs from the}} album, demonstrating the band's willingness to experiment with their music. The results took on a predominantly industrial guise, and were released as <b>the</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>Is</b> the Mindkiller EP (1993). Soul of a New Machine and Fear is the Mindkiller were released (2004) as a package in a new re-mastered reissue by Roadrunner Records.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} an {{offender}} who flees in fear, for example, {{perhaps because he}} heard a noise, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Jurisprudence generally seems to lean towards impunity when <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> spontaneous.|$|R
50|$|This {{configuration}} drastically limited both {{range and}} flight duration, but was used because of fears that ionised {{particles in the}} hot, rocket motor exhaust stream would interfere with the guidance radar signals; further development showed <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> unfounded.|$|R

500|$|A phobia is [...] "a {{dread of}} an object or {{situation}} that does not in reality pose any threat", and is distinct from a delusion in that the patient is aware that <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> irrational. A phobia is usually highly specific to certain situations and will usually be reported by the patient rather than being observed by the clinician in the assessment interview.|$|E

2500|$|Intense Western {{diplomatic}} {{pressure was}} also being exerted on Abdullah Abdullah {{to cut a}} deal. According to The Telegraph, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that if Karzai defies Washington and appoints his own choice of allies to key ministerial roles, he would be more [...] "difficult for the West to influence".|$|E
2500|$|The {{appropriate}} description was debated by Jewish Agency officials, {{who were}} keen {{not to give}} a negative impression of Palestine to prospective immigrants. In private, however, David Ben-Gurion was unequivocal: the Arabs, he said, were [...] "fighting dispossession... <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> not of losing land, but of losing the homeland of the Arab people, which others want to turn into the homeland of the Jewish people." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the pain}} of a {{procedure}} {{may or may not}} be affected, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> visibly reduced. This works to [...] the negative effects of fear in health care situations. It is, therefore, considered good practice to involve parents or care-givers directly, having them present and in contact with the baby whenever possible before a minor painful procedure, such as the drawing of blood, or prior to giving a local anaesthetic injection.|$|E
60|$|She <b>was</b> afraid; and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> all <b>the</b> more terrible as {{she could}} not yet give it a name. But the sense of an awful {{catastrophe}} was upon her, impending, not yet materialized, but which would overwhelm her inevitably when it came.|$|R
5000|$|Aron quoted Montesquieu's {{words about}} despotism: [...] " [...] <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> seizes {{all people in}} society imperceptibly, except one tyrant". In this regard Aron quotes Khrushchev writing that at a meeting with Stalin, Khrushchev knew never whether Stalin wanted to consult him or arrest him. Aron {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> part of <b>the</b> Communist experiment.|$|R

2500|$|In his Decretum, Burchard of Worms {{asserts that}} [...] "we know that unclean spirits (spiritus immundi) who {{fell from the}} heavens wander about between the sky and earth," [...] drawing on the view {{expressed}} in the Moralia in Job of Gregory I. In his penitential, Burchard says that some people wait until cock's crow — that is, dawn — to go outdoors because they feared spiritus immundi. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> not treated as groundless; rather, Burchard recommends Christ and {{the sign of the}} cross as protection, rather than reliance on the cock's crow. The exact nature of these immundi is unclear: they may have been demons, woodland beings such as imps, or ghosts of the unhallowed dead.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: I {{mean it was}} a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Fear {{could easily}} be argued as another {{character}} in Albee’s play. It is an unnamed fear that moves Harry and Edna out of their house and {{into the middle of}} the chaos in the home of Agnes and Tobias. As Harry and Edna explain it: “WE GOT [...] [...] [...] FRIGHTENED.” “We got scared.” We [...] [...] [...] were [...] [...] [...] terrified.” <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> described as darkness, as when Agnes says: “I wonder if that’s why we sleep at night, because the darkness still [...] [...] [...] frightens us?” Agnes also labels fear as “the terror. Or the plague”, and she states that Harry and Edna have brought the plague with them. And she claims that the only solution is isolation.|$|E

50|$|The first pair was {{the need}} to be an {{individual}} vs {{the need to be}} part of a group. <b>The</b> corresponding <b>fears</b> <b>were</b> <b>fear</b> of love and commitment and fear of loneliness and self-actualisation.
