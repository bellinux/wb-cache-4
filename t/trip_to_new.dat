5|$|During high school, Barbera {{worked as}} a tailor's {{delivery}} boy. During the Great Depression, he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a magazine called The NY Hits Magazine. He supported himself with {{a job at a}} bank, and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in Redbook, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier's—the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry.

Manning passed for 400 yards against the Texans in a 43–24 victory, which earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors (he also won the award for his 345 yards and four touchdown passes against the Redskins in Week 7). A second <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Jersey, this time to play the Jets, produced another Colts win.

5|$|Oppenheimer {{recruited}} McMillan to {{join the}} Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to create atomic bombs, in September 1942. Initially, he commuted {{back and forth between}} San Diego, where his family was, and Berkeley. In November he accompanied Oppenheimer on a <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Mexico on which the Los Alamos Ranch School was selected as the site of the project's weapons research laboratory, which became the Los Alamos Laboratory. With Oppenheimer and John H. Manley, he drew up the specifications for the new laboratory's technical buildings. He recruited personnel for the laboratory, including Richard Feynman and Robert R.

5|$|Thomas first {{travelled}} to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there {{brought him}} a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented his legend, however, {{and he went on}} to record to vinyl such works as A Child's Christmas in Wales. During his fourth <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the village churchyard in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, {{coupled with the}} fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route. Pennsylvanian, on the west side of the canal when it opened, was one of the first two eastbound steamers to traverse the canal during her <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York. In late August, American-Hawaiian announced that Pennsylvanian would sail on a San Francisco– Panama Canal– Boston route, sailing opposite of , Honolulan, and sister ship Washingtonian. When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including Pennsylvanian, returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, McNicoll was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} planning committee for the British nuclear tests on the Montebello Islands, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia.

As commander of Australia, McNicoll also served as Chief Staff Officer to the Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. HMAS Australia was near the end of its naval service and had been relegated to training duties from 1950. As such, the cruiser was primarily consigned to Australian waters, though a brief <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Zealand did occur in October 1953. McNicoll {{was appointed}} a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year Honours List for his involvement in the British atomic program; he was presented with the decoration three months later by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony at Government House, Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the attempt to relocate the Timberwolves, the New Orleans Regional Basketball Alliance sought to lure an existing franchise to the city. After completion of the New Orleans Arena, the Alliance led efforts to relocate the Vancouver Grizzlies to the city. The New Orleans bid ultimately lost out to Memphis, and by early 2002 the city looked to the Charlotte Hornets to potentially relocate to the city. The Hornets became attractive to relocate following a failed referendum for a new arena in Charlotte. On May 10, 2002, the NBA {{voted in favor of}} the relocation of the Hornets to New Orleans marking the return of the NBA to the city since the relocation of the New Orleans Jazz to Salt Lake City in 1979. In November 2002, the Timberwolves made their first <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Orleans since the failed relocation efforts of the Top Rank group in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Very {{was born}} on August 28, 1813, in Salem, Massachusetts and {{spent much of his}} {{childhood}} at sea. He was the oldest of six children, born out of wedlock to two first cousins; his sister Lydia also became a writer. His mother, Lydia Very, was known for being an aggressive freethinker who made her atheistic beliefs known to all. She believed that marriage was only a moral arrangement and not a legal one. His father, also named Jones Very, was a captain during the War of 1812 and was held in Nova Scotia for a time by the British as a prisoner of war. When the younger Jones Very was ten, his father, by then a shipmaster, took him on a sailing voyage to Russia. A year later, his father had Very serve as a cabin boy on a <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Orleans, Louisiana. His father died on the return trip, apparently due to a lung disease he contracted while in Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{was an avid}} reader even in his youth. He {{completed}} Clinton Grammar School {{from about}} 1823 to 1825, in those years reading many books from the nearby library at Hamilton College. In 1825 he enrolled at Fairfield Academy, switching to its Fairfield Medical College, {{also known as the}} Medical College of the Western District of Fairfield, in autumn 1826. It was during this time that Gray began to mount botanical specimens. On a <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York City, he attempted to meet with John Torrey to get assistance in identifying specimens, but Torrey was not home, so Gray left the specimens at Torrey's house. Torrey was so impressed with Gray's specimens that he began a correspondence with him. Gray graduated and became an M.D. in February 1831, even though he was not yet 21 years of age, which was a requirement at the time. Although Gray did open a medical office in Bridgewater, New York, where he had served an apprenticeship with Doctor John Foote Trowbridge while he was in medical school, he never truly practiced medicine as he enjoyed botany more. It was around this time that he began making explorations in New York and New Jersey. By autumn 1831 he had essentially given up his medical practice to devote more time to botany.|$|E
