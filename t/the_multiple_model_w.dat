40|$|For {{improving}} the tracking accuracy and model switching speed of maneuvering target tracking in nonlinear systems, a new algorithm named <b>the</b> interacting <b>multiple</b> <b>model</b> fifth-degree spherical simplex-radial cubature Kalman filter (IMM 5 thSSRCKF) is proposed in this paper. The new algorithm {{is a combination}} of <b>the</b> interacting <b>multiple</b> <b>model</b> (IMM) filter and the fifth-degree spherical simplex-radial cubature Kalman filter (5 thSSRCKF). The proposed algorithm makes use of Markov process to describe the switching probability among the models, and uses 5 thSSRCKF to deal with the state estimation of each model. The 5 thSSRCKF is an improved filter algorithm, which utilizes the fifth-degree spherical simplex-radial rule to improve the filtering accuracy. Finally, the tracking performance of the IMM 5 thSSRCKF is evaluated by simulation in a typical maneuvering target tracking scenario.

40|$|Abstract- Variability {{integration}} is basically {{concentrating on the}} mapping between different abstraction levels. The mapping is basically at requirements to architecture levels as it can reap benefits as suggested by several researchers. However it is insufficient in mapping between different abstraction levels by only concentrating on one type of model {{to assist in the}} mapping process. In this paper we concentrate on <b>multiple</b> <b>models</b> at requirements level in order to map essential information at the architectural level. These <b>multiple</b> <b>model</b> is implemented in Software Product Line (SPL) where the models itself needs to be extended to explicitly show the commonality and variability in the models. Therefore, profile extension with the use of appropriate stereotypes has been used as an extension for the models. Given the different notations and stereotypes of each model, the mapping is based at the metamodel level which represented using one uniform notation. <b>The</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>model</b> approach is implemented to Autonomous Mobile Robot Product Line (AMRPL) case study to show the applicability of <b>the</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>model</b> approach. <b>The</b> applicability of the mapping established between <b>the</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>models</b> facilitate <b>the</b> possibility of representing functional and non functional requirements and its mapping to architectural level.
