You laugh harder <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> in a long time. It’s a film with a one-point agenda – to entertain you while you’re in your seat. It achieves that, no two ways about it." [...] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu noted [...] that Dostana [...] "largely reflects a society in transition and begins to address the issues of acceptance within the Indian framework of marriage": [...] "Dostana is great mass entertainment manipulating the inherent homophobia of a country {{on the threshold of}} change, but what’s significant is that it will bring parents and children together to share laughs over alternative sexuality and related issues that will no longer remain in the closet." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Carey Wilber pitched [...] "Space Seed" [...] to Star Trek {{producers}} Roddenberry, Gene Coon, and Robert Justman with an 18-page outline dated August 29, 1966. In the outline, Wilber {{envisioned the}} crew of Botany Bay as criminals sent on a 1,500-year journey to make room on Earth for others. Khan was represented as a Nordic criminal with a [...] "magnificent" [...] body, Harald Ericsson. The producers suggested changes to the outline {{in a series of}} memos; in memos dated September 7 and 9, Coon suggested significant changes to Ericsson. [...] "I want to rather do more with him <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> indicated in the story outline,” he wrote. Believing that Ericsson (misspelled as Erickson in the memo) could be a worthy adversary for Kirk, Coon suggested that the character be “in fact very similar to James Kirk, our captain, except that our captain has made an adjustment to this world and this culture [...] In other words, Carey, build us a giant of a man." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{returning}} to England in October 1655 he was arrested, and on refusing {{to submit to}} the government was allowed to retire to Essex. [...] When examined by Cromwell, he was asked: [...] "Pray then,' said he, 'what is it that you would have? [...] May not every man be as good as he will? [...] What can you desire more <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>have?</b> [...] It were easy,' said I, 'to tell what we would have.' [...] 'What is that, I pray? said he. [...] 'That which we fought for," [...] said I, 'that the nation might be governed by its own consent." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{while he}} enjoyed the {{confidence}} of Queen Mary of Modena, {{it was clear that}} he was growing uncomfortable under the recently enthroned James: the violently hostile reception he got from the public when he gave evidence at the Trial of the Seven Bishops left him badly shaken. When he urged James to put away his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, James said that he had not realised Sunderland was his confessor, and told him to mind his own business for the future. Sunderland's unpopularity was now almost universal: Burnet wrote that it was [...] "the wonder of all mankind" [...] that James continued to employ him. He was summarily dismissed at last in October 1688, with the remark, [...] "You have your pardon; much good doe it you. I hope you will be more faithful to your next master <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another of Abu Bakr's grandsons, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, {{was very}} close to Husayn bin Ali. After Hussein ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and killed by the army of Yazid I, the Umayyad ruler, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr confronted Yazid and {{expelled}} him from Iraq, southern Arabia and the greater part of Syria, and parts of Egypt. Following a lengthy campaign, on his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother Asma' bint Abu Bakr, the daughter of the first caliph, for advice. Asma' bint Abu Bakr replied to her son: [...] "You know better in your own self, that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say, that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free". Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Army now {{under the control of the}} Umayyads.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} from a year of study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence (cut short by the First World War), Schmitt returned to Warren, where he received a number of commissions from prominent local citizens including Joseph G. Butler, Jr. and Henry K. Wick. In 1916 Schmitt returned to New York, where he established a studio in the Stuyvesant Square neighborhood. Hart Crane, then an unknown poet and newly arrived in New York, was a frequent visitor to Schmitt’s studio apartment {{in the early part}} of 1917. Crane and Schmitt had met in Warren the previous year through Crane’s aunt and Schmitt’s patron Zell Hart Deming. Just before moving to New York, Crane wrote to Schmitt about his life in Cleveland, Ohio. In one of his first letters to his mother from New York, Crane wrote, “Carl is a more wonderful man <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any idea. A tremendous thinker!” A little later he wrote to his father: “Nearly every evening since my advent has been spent in the companionship of Carl. Last night... we talked until twelve, or after, behind our pipes. He has some splendid ideas.” Crane got to know some of the poets and writers in Schmitt's circle, including Conrad Aiken. Although they would each pursue their own interests and friends in later years, Schmitt and Crane carried on an extensive correspondence, Crane sending drafts of his poems to Schmitt for his review. They saw each other for the last time in 1925 in New York with Zell Hart Deming. Crane described his friend at this meeting: [...] "He was as always, looked and acted exactly the same as we remember him." [...] A portrait of Crane by Schmitt, done almost 50 years later, is now in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
