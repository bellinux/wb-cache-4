5|$|Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the {{undercover}} agent who was accompanying <b>the</b> <b>activists,</b> was not indicted {{for his part}} in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage's life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from <b>the</b> <b>activists.</b> These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{conclusion}} of the final investigations, there has been heated debate about the Cerro Maravilla incident in Puerto Rico, with some groups arguing that there are still others responsible for planning and/or ordering the plot to kill <b>the</b> <b>activists</b> as well as the subsequent cover-up, while others have argued that the incident was exaggerated by rival politicians and the media, maintaining that no conspiracy ever took place and that some of the officers incarcerated, though not all, are actually innocent.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} method to {{evaluate}} shareholder activism when an activist targets firms whose shareholders are diversified portfolio holders of possibly correlated firms. Our method of evaluation takes the portfolios {{of all of the}} shareholders, including <b>the</b> <b>activist,</b> as its basis of analysis. We model <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> from <b>the</b> time of the acquisition of a foothold in the target firm through the moment when <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> divests <b>the</b> newly acquired shares. We assume that during this period, all exchanges of securities, and their corresponding prices, are achieved in Walrasian markets in which all participants, including <b>the</b> <b>activist,</b> are risk-averse price-takers. Using the derived series of price changes of all the firms in the market, as well as the derived series of changes in all the portfolio holdings over this period, we evaluate the impact of activism on <b>the</b> <b>activist,</b> on <b>the</b> group of other shareholders, and on the combined group. We show that when activism is beneficial to <b>the</b> <b>activist,</b> <b>the</b> group of other investors may not benefit; furthermore, even when <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> benefits from activism, the value of the market may decrease. When <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> benefits from activism, an increase {{in the value of the}} market is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the group of other investors to benefit also from activism. In addition, we show that the combined group, <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> plus <b>the</b> group of other investors, benefits if and only if the value of the market increases and, under this condition, either <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> or <b>the</b> group of other investors, but not necessarily both, benefits. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{audience}} {{at a large}} county level Communist Party meeting is told by an outside official that their county, home to four notables that he names, has an unacceptably low literacy rate in its villages and towns. He urges <b>the</b> young <b>activists</b> to spare no effort to remedy this disgrace. One such activist is next seen being driven out to a remote village until the washed out road forces him to complete the journey on foot over difficult territory. The first person he meets is a shepherd. He wastes no time establishing himself as a know-it-all, informing the shepherd that his cooking method is dangerous. He heads into town to meet the mayor, who offers various excuses, such as lack of electricity {{and the demands of}} farm work, for the poor attendance at the local school and other problems. <b>The</b> <b>activist</b> will accept no excuse insisting that all illiterate locals old and young must come in for class. Only a few children attend the first session when <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> insists that <b>the</b> mayor round up the adults. Some come, others, including the shepherd, send food items instead. A boy who has learned to read starts reading labels and warning signs to the shepherd, who ignores the information doing what he pleases as always. <b>The</b> <b>activist,</b> fed up with the shepherd's resistance goes out in the rain to get the shepherd to class. <b>The</b> <b>activist</b> stops to work on his shoe leaning against a power line tower. The shepherd, fed up with <b>the</b> <b>activist's</b> meddling, uses <b>the</b> pretext that <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> is being electrocuted by the tower to strike him with his crook. Next we see <b>the</b> <b>activist,</b> arm in sling, sitting on a cart loaded with food stuffs and chickens, while the mayor reads an appreciative farewell praising <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> and feigning sorrow at his early departure. On the way out <b>the</b> <b>activist</b> offers his hand to the shepherd who does not accept the gesture but hands him a bag of cheese to say goodbye and good riddance. Legend tells us that the next year the village reported a literacy rate of 99%.|$|R
5|$|Gary {{uses the}} novel {{as a vehicle to}} {{denounce}} both racism and <b>the</b> <b>activists</b> supporting African-American rights, including his own ex-wife and Marlon Brando. He also examines whether human responses to situations, including racism, are learned social behavior and whether they can be unlearned. In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story to focus more on the dog and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became {{the director of the}} lab. He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists to shut down the lab. Rather than directly oppose <b>the</b> <b>activists,</b> Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|E
5|$|Other {{inquiries}} obtained similar {{testimony from}} witnesses, including {{the taxi driver}} who now stated that <b>the</b> <b>activists</b> were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated {{that there was a}} short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview.|$|E

Though he recollected his immediate surroundings from his childhood explorations, he eventually passed into less familiar territory; he later told his supporters that he fell more than 200 times during his escape. Communicating with a network of activists via a cell phone, he reached a pre-determined rendezvous point where He Peirong, an English teacher and activist, was waiting for him. A chain of human rights activists then escorted him to Beijing. Several of <b>the</b> <b>activists</b> reported to be involved were detained or disappeared in the days following the announcement of Chen's escape.|$|E
5|$|Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, {{formed an}} action group, later {{to be called}} the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of {{progress}} in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman. Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and Boys' Brigade officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the interview was cancelled. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama and the ensuing Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States in 1955, <b>the</b> <b>activists</b> decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.|$|E
5|$|The strikes {{reached the}} {{politically}} sensitive Baltic Sea coast, with a sit-down {{strike at the}} Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk beginning on 14 August. Among the leaders of this strike were Anna Walentynowicz and Lech Wałęsa, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of 21 demands was formulated by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With the assistance of <b>the</b> <b>activists</b> from the KOR, {{and the support of}} many intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of trade unions independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.|$|E

5|$|Mumbai was lashed by torrential rains on 26–27 July 2005, {{during which}} the city was brought to a {{complete}} standstill. The city received 37inches (940 millimeters) of rain in 24 hours— the most any Indian city has ever received in a single day. Around 83 people were killed. On 11 July 2006, a series of seven bomb blasts took place {{over a period of}} 11 minutes on the Suburban Railway in Mumbai at Khar, Mahim, Matunga, Jogeshwari, Borivali, and one between Khar and Santa Cruz. 209 people were killed and over 700 were injured. According to Mumbai Police, the bombings were carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). In 2008, the city experienced xenophobic attacks by <b>the</b> <b>activists</b> of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) under Raj Thackeray on the North Indian migrants in Mumbai. Attacks included assault on North Indian taxi drivers and damage of their vehicles. There were a series of ten coordinated terrorist attacks by 10 armed Pakistani men using automatic weapons and grenades which began on 26 November 2008 and ended on 29 November 2008. The attacks resulted in 164 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several important buildings. The city again saw a series of three coordinated bomb explosions at different locations on 13 July 2011 between 18:54 and 19:06 IST. The blasts occurred at the Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar, and Dadar, which left 26 killed, and 130 injured.

25|$|Recruitment of {{the local}} Communist Party activists by partorgs was the last step.

Since these were locals, they were often familiar to the deportees and these activists, not the unknown soldiers, became the face and name of the deportations creating social tensions.|$|E
