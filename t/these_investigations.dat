5|$|Directly {{assessing}} nerve conduction {{of electrical}} impulses can exclude other causes of acute muscle weakness, {{as well as}} distinguish {{the different types of}} Guillain–Barré syndrome. Needle electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies may be performed. In the first two weeks, <b>these</b> <b>investigations</b> may not show any abnormality.

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{literature}} of antiquity and {{the form of the}} ancient book reciprocally conditioned each other. The context of publication enveloped and modified literary creativity.

5|$|Both of <b>these</b> <b>investigations</b> began almost immediately. In {{the days}} {{following}} the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping {{to be able to}} identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it would be difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E
5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of <b>these</b> <b>investigations.</b> As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more {{difficult}} than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|In September 1995 the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel, {{chaired by}} Bob Dornan, {{requested}} that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct its own investigation into the shootdown incident.

5|$|The Office of the Special Prosecutor {{was founded}} {{with the passage}} of a bill in the Icelandic {{parliament}} 10 December 2008. The aim was to investigate suspected criminal conduct leading up to, in connection with or {{in the wake of the}} banking crisis, whether these relate to the activities of financial undertakings, other legal entities or individuals, and, as appropriate, to follow up <b>these</b> <b>investigations</b> by bringing charges in court against those concerned.|$|E
5|$|A Neo-Assyrian chamber tomb {{was found}} {{at the foot of}} the citadel mound during {{construction}} activities in 2009. It was subsequently excavated by the local Antiquities Service and archaeologists from the German Archaeological Institute (DAI). The tomb was plundered in antiquity but still contained pottery dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. The cooperation between the Antiquities Service and the DAI was continued later that year with a further investigation of the tomb and with a small excavation nearby and geophysical survey of the surrounding area, in which also students from Salahaddin University participated. <b>These</b> <b>investigations</b> revealed the presence of architecture probably dating to the Neo-Assyrian period, as well as more burials belonging to subsequent centuries.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{research}} {{increased at}} the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, government spending on <b>these</b> <b>investigations</b> began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper.|$|E

5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to <b>these</b> <b>investigations</b> is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
