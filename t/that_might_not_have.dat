5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

25|$|Article Seven {{describes}} {{the process for}} establishing the proposed new frame of government. Anticipating that the influence of many state politicians would be Antifederalist, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention provided for ratification of the Constitution by popularly elected ratifying conventions in each state. The convention method also made it possible that judges, ministers and others ineligible to serve in state legislatures, could be elected to a convention. Suspecting that Rhode Island, at least, might not ratify, delegates decided that the Constitution would go into effect as soon as nine states (two-thirds rounded up) ratified. Once ratified by this minimum number of states, it was anticipated that the proposed Constitution would become this Constitution between the nine or more that signed. It would not cover the four or fewer states <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> signed.|$|E

500|$|Several {{problems}} were encountered during the project. Because the team comprised two software companies, tension emerged regarding job assignments and some developers left the project. Additionally, many employees were largely inexperienced, but in retrospect project manager Jonathan Chey felt this was advantageous, stating [...] "inexperience also bred enthusiasm and commitment <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been present {{with a more}} jaded set of developers." [...] The Dark Engine posed problems of its own. It was unfinished, forcing the programmers to fix software bugs when encountered. In contrast, {{working closely with the}} engine code allowed them to write additional features. Not all setbacks were localized; a demonstration build at E3 was hindered when it was requested all guns be removed from the presentation due to then-recent Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
500|$|Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran) orders Voyager {{to follow}} the Dauntless into the slipstream, aware that the system has not been fully tested yet. The Dauntless is {{revealed}} to be Arturis' own ship, masked as a Starfleet vessel. He explains that his homeworld had been recently assimilated by the Borg, an event <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> happened if the Borg were still at war with Species 8472. He directly blames Janeway and her crew for interfering in that war and vows to bring as many of Voyagers crew {{as possible to the}} Borg for assimilation; Arturis sets the navigation for his homeworld, now a point deep in Borg space, and then destroys the controls. Suddenly Voyager appears and targets the shields on Arturis' ship, allowing them to transport Janeway and Seven off the ship. Voyager breaks off pursuit and alters slipstream trajectory away from Borg space, while Arturis finds himself deep among an array of Borg cubes approaching his position and quietly accepts his fate. [...] Though the slipstream technology is deemed unusable for the immediate future, Voyagers brief use of it has shaved 300 light years off their journey home.|$|E
500|$|Science fiction {{historian}} and critic Mike Ashley regards Galaxys success {{as the main}} reason for the subsequent boom in science fiction magazines, commenting that it [...] "revolutionized the field overnight". [...] Under Gold Galaxy provided a market for social science fiction stories <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been accepted by Astounding and Fantasy & Science Fiction, the other leading magazines. [...] Pohl regards Galaxy as the place where [...] "the stunning new kinds of science fiction ... flowered, and changed everything in science fiction". [...] In his opinion, Gold's innovation was to ask writers to consider not just new technology, but the subsequent impact of that technology on society. [...] He adds, [...] "What Galaxy brought to magazine science fiction was a kind of sophisticated intellectual subtlety. ... After Galaxy it was impossible to go on being naive." [...] Science fiction author Brian Stableford argues that Galaxy quickly usurped Astoundings position as [...] "pioneer of hardcore sf's progress" [...] because it [...] "embraced and gleefully pursued a new series of challenges to moral orthodoxy." [...] Isaac Asimov, in his memoirs, recalled being deeply impressed by the first issue, adding that many fans, including himself, felt that Galaxy became the field's leader almost immediately. [...] In critic John Clute's assessment, Galaxy indeed swiftly supplanted Astounding and remained the leading magazine in the field until Pohl resigned as editor in 1969.|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} story, Uchikoshi {{made use of}} what he calls the [...] "inductive {{composition}} method", where a setting is created first, after which one thinks about a core to the story {{that can be used to}} make the setting work. He did not recommend this way of writing, as he saw it as gamble <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> resulted in an interesting story. This is in contrast to the deductive composition method, where a core story is thought of first, after which a setting is [...] "deduced", that matches the core. As an example of inductive composition used, Uchikoshi did not initially think up the story's [...] "main trick", and instead created two protagonists only because he thought it was getting stale with single-protagonist stories in visual novels, after which he thought about how to make two protagonists interesting. The writers only put little effort into hiding the 17-year gap between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes, writing each day of the story casually without a particular plan in mind. Rather, it took special effort to make it seem convincing when the game's secrets were revealed, with hints toward the truth added throughout the story, such as Tsugumi acting more suspicious when playing as the Kid due to having already experienced the events of Takeshi's route, or slight differences between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes due to the characters not being able to perfectly recreate events. While Coco was planned from the beginning as the character who knew the truth, Uchikoshi did not come up with the idea of leaving her on the bottom of the ocean until during the writing of the script.|$|E
500|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, {{to present to}} video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows {{are going to be the}} same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|No {{reliable}} figures currently {{exist for}} the size and ethnic makeup of New Orleans’s current population. [...] It is widely recognized, however, that the current demographics of New Orleans are on average more white and more affluent {{than they were before}} Katrina. [...] This made it very hard to predict the outcome of the election. [...] This new demographic reality encouraged many candidates <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> considered entering the race before the storm. [...] New Orleans has not had a white mayor since 1978, but a large number of candidates - including every candidate considered to have a 'serious' chance of winning other than incumbent Nagin - were white.|$|E
2500|$|It can be {{said that}} an adjoint functor is a way of giving the most {{efficient}} solution to some problem via a method which is formulaic. [...] For example, an elementary problem in ring theory is how to turn a rng (which is like a ring <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a multiplicative identity) into a ring. [...] The most efficient way is to adjoin an element '1' to the rng, adjoin all (and only) the elements which are necessary for satisfying the ring axioms (e.g. r+1 for each r in the ring), and impose no relations in the newly formed ring that are not forced by axioms. [...] Moreover, this construction is formulaic {{in the sense that it}} works in essentially the same way for any rng.|$|E

2500|$|In their {{introduction}} to The Reader's Companion to Military History Robert Cowley and Geoffrey Parker summarise {{this side of}} the modern view of the Battle of Tours by saying [...] "The study of military history has undergone drastic changes in recent years. The old drums-and-bugles approach will no longer do. Factors such as economics, logistics, intelligence, and technology receive the attention once accorded solely to battles and campaigns and casualty counts. Words like [...] "strategy" [...] and [...] "operations" [...] have acquired meanings <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been recognizable a generation ago. Changing attitudes and new research have altered our views of what once seemed to matter most. For example, several of the battles that Edward Shepherd Creasy listed in his famous 1851 book The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World rate hardly a mention here, and the confrontation between Muslims and Christians at Poitiers-Tours in 732, once considered a watershed event, has been downgraded to a raid in force." ...|$|E
