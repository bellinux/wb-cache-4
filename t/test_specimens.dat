2500|$|Tensile {{strength}} {{represents the}} ability for a geomembrane to resist tensile stress. [...] Geomembranes are most commonly tested for tensile strength using one of three methods; the uniaxial tensile test described in ASTM D639-94, the wide-strip tensile test described in ASTM D4885-88, and the multiaxial tension test described in ASTM D5617-94. [...] The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the <b>test</b> <b>specimens.</b> [...] Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under uniaxial stress conditions. [...] During the wide-strip test the sample is restrained laterally while the middle portion is unrestrained. [...] The multiaxial tensile test provides a plane stress boundary condition {{at the edges of}} the sample. [...] A typical range of tensile strengths in the machine direction are from 225 to 245lb/in for 60-mil HDPE to 280 to 325lb/in for 80-mil HDPE.|$|E
