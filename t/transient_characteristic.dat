40|$|AbstractThe {{monitored}} resonant {{behavior of}} fatigue specimens of metastable {{austenitic stainless steel}} (AISI 304) is correlated with its damage accumulation in the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime. The resonant behavior is studied experimentally and shows a distinct <b>transient</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Microscopic examinations indicate that during VHCF a localized plastic deformation in shear bands arises on the specimen surface. Hence, this work focuses {{on the effect of}} damage accumulation in shear bands on the resonant behavior of AISI 304 in the VHCF regime. A microstructural simulation model is proposed that takes into account specific mechanisms in shear bands proven by experimental results.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of correction {{of the dynamic}} characteristics of gas temperature sensors in automatic control systems for the operation of aircraft gas turbine engines depends on {{the accuracy of the}} time constants of the sensors used from heat exchange conditions. The aim of this work was to develop a new method for determining the characteristic curves of the thermal inertia of gas temperature sensors. The new technique does not require finding the time constants of gas temperature sensors on the experimental <b>transient</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Characteristic curves for each time constant are defined as hyperbolic dependencies on the heat transfer coefficient of the gas temperature sensors sensing element with the gas flow. Parameters of hyperbolic dependencies are proposed to be established using two-dimensional regression analysis. For this purpose, special software has been developed in the Mathcad 14 and Mathcad 15. The software allows inputting the original data from the <b>transient</b> <b>characteristics</b> to the corresponding vectors or from tables in Excel format. It is shown that the <b>transient</b> <b>characteristics</b> in three-dimensional coordinates «time – heat transfer coefficient – the value of the transition characteristic» form a surface whose parameters are parameters of the desired hyperbolic dependencies. For a specific application of the technique, the regression functions for the dynamic characteristics of gas temperature sensors corresponding to the first and second orders are given. Analysis of the characteristic dependencies suggests that the proposed method more accurately establishes the dependence of the dynamic characteristics of aircraft gas temperature sensors on heat exchange conditions. It is shown that the algorithm of two-dimensional regression analysis realizes finding more accurate values of the parameters of the characteristic dependencies. The found parameters of the characteristic dependencies in a best way reach the surface of the chosen regression function {{at the same time to}} all the experimental <b>transient</b> <b>characteristics.</b> </p...|$|R
