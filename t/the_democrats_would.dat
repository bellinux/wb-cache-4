5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently {{opposed to}} annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E
5|$|The fusion effort {{failed and}} Grant was easily reelected. Liberal Republicans {{were unable to}} deliver many votes, and Greeley was only {{successful}} in areas <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> have carried without him. Federal prosecution of the Klan, a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, repeal of the income tax, and civil service reforms helped Grant defeat Greeley. Grant won 56 {{percent of the popular}} vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction. In 1873 Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875. With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance more than ever.|$|E

25|$|In the Victorian state {{by-election}} in Albert Park District the Australian Democrats stood candidate Paul Kavanagh, who polled 5.75 {{per cent}} of the primary vote, despite {{a large number of}} candidates, and media attention focusing on the battle between Labor and Greens candidates. Psephologist Psephos remarked that ten years earlier <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> have got at least ten per{{cent of the}} vote.|$|E
25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the deal, the two filibustered nominees not {{mentioned}} in it (David W. McKeague and Richard Allen Griffin) were confirmed. Despite these agreements, however, some observers noted that the chances were still high that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> filibuster any of the ten originally filibustered nominees if he or she were later nominated to the Supreme Court, especially Owen, Pryor or Brown.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly all polls {{conducted}} in the {{months prior to the}} election showed that <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party <b>would</b> gain fewer parliamentary seats than the Pheu Thai Party, and even Democrat Party Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij admitted that, [...] "we're doing terribly in the polls" [...] and that, [...] "it was obvious from the beginning" [...] that they would not win a majority. [...] Newin Chidchob, de facto leader of coalition partner Bhum Jai Thai Party, predicted that <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party <b>would</b> win only 160 out of 500 seats. [...] Abhisit dismissed the polls, and days before the election exuded confidence that <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party <b>would</b> certainly win the election and form the next government. [...] He promised to [...] "evaluate his own performance" [...] if <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party won fewer than 170 seats.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the third}} time New Jersey voted Democratic {{since the end of}} World War II.

25|$|In Rove's analysis, 10 of the 28 House seats Republicans lost were sacrificed {{because of}} various scandals. Another six, he said, were lost because incumbents did not {{recognize}} and react quickly enough to the threat. Rove argued that, without corruption and complacency, <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> have gained around a dozen seats and Republicans could have kept narrow control of the House regardless of Bush's troubles and the war.|$|E
25|$|Meier told Donald that he {{was sure}} <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> win the {{election}} because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes {{that had never been}} released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien. According to Fred Emery, O'Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign {{was too much of a}} danger for Nixon to ignore.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, {{it was assumed that}} <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> {{filibuster}} any Supreme Court nominee who would change the ideological composition of the court. Initially, this conjecture seemed to be borne out when conservative jurist John Roberts was renominated to replace conservative Chief Justice Rehnquist. The confirmation process went relatively smoothly with no threat of a filibuster. Later, however, the hypothesis was disproved. When Bush chose another conservative appellate judge, Samuel Alito, to replace moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, opponents of Alito could not generate enough votes to prevent cloture from being invoked on his nomination. Very soon afterward, he was successfully confirmed.|$|E
5000|$|Treen and a Republican [...] "search committee" [...] {{had offered}} to support Bauer for the House seat in 1972 if <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> switch parties, but Bauer {{remained}} Democrat and instead expected to face Treen in the general election. Bauer's father, Ralph Norman Bauer, and Cecil Morgan of Shreveport had in 1929 as freshman state representatives led the impeachment for abuses of power against Governor Huey Pierce Long Jr.|$|R

25|$|Meier, in {{collaboration}} with former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and others, wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign. Meier told Donald that he was sure <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> win the election because Larry O'Brien {{had a great deal}} of information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released; O'Brien did not actually have any such information, but Meier wanted Nixon to think he did. Donald told his brother that O'Brien was in possession of damaging Hughes information that could destroy his campaign. Terry Lenzner, who was the chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, speculates that it was Nixon's desire to know what O'Brien knew about Nixon's dealings with Hughes that may have partially motivated the Watergate break-in.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{took to the}} Senate floor {{after the}} election, giving a speech well {{received}} in the North, [...] "I will not give up this government... No; I intend to stand by it... and I invite every man who is a patriot to... rally around the altar of our common country... and swear by our God, and all that is sacred and holy, that the Constitution shall be saved, and the Union preserved." [...] As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded, he reminded Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis that if Southerners would only hold to their seats, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> control the Senate, and could defend the South's interests against any infringement by Lincoln. Gordon-Reed points out that while Johnson's belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere, he had alienated Southern leaders, including Davis, who would soon {{be the president of}} the Confederate States of America, formed by the seceding states. If the Tennessean had backed the Confederacy, he would have had small influence in its government.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2006, {{with an eye}} on the {{upcoming}} congressional elections–which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House {{for the first time since}} 1994–Pelosi told colleagues that, while <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was [...] "off the table". (A week earlier, she had told the Washington Post that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, [...] "you never know where" [...] investigations might lead.) ...|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after he}} won the 2014 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, Charlie Baker {{announced}} that Ash would serve as his Secretary of Housing and Economic Development.

2500|$|On May 23, 2005, Warner {{was one of}} 14 centrist {{senators}} (Gang of 14) {{to forge}} a compromise on the Democrats' proposed use of the judicial filibuster, thus blocking the Republican leadership's attempt to implement the so-called nuclear option. Under the agreement, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> retain the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an [...] "extraordinary circumstance", and three Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a measure}} of the county's strong Republican bent, it has only gone Democratic once since James Buchanan, a {{resident}} of Lancaster city, won it in 1856. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson carried it as part of his 44-state landslide, but only did so by 793 votes. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> not come close to carrying the county again until 2008, when Barack Obama tallied 43 percent of the vote.

2500|$|In Washington, Barnett lobbied Congress {{and presidents}} to end China's isolation. In an {{interview}} with the New York Times shortly before his death, Barnett recalled a private meeting he attended between Richard Nixon and China scholars in 1969: [...] "I always felt that Nixon was the guy, because of his background...I am not sure <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> have been capable of taking a major step toward China because of the fear of being clobbered". He coined the formula [...] "containment without isolation" [...] to describe a diplomatic opening that would still recognize China as a danger. In 1974 Barnett noted that Americans tended to shape their views of China “to fit their own preconceptions and mood of the moment, with minimal understanding of the realities of the situation.” [...] In the late 1970s, he supported President Jimmy Carter 's drive to follow Nixon's 1972 breakthrough with formal diplomatic recognition of China. In the early 1980s he advised against the sale of modernized jet fighters to the Republic of China on Taiwan, a position that was followed in the presidency of Ronald Reagan.|$|E
50|$|Altmann was {{strongly}} opposed to Brexit {{prior to the}} 2016 EU membership referendum. In 2017, she publicly endorsed James Chapman's call for a new centrist party, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> which <b>would</b> have <b>the</b> explicit aim of overturning Brexit.|$|R

2500|$|On May 23, 2005, McCain led {{fourteen}} Senators {{to forge}} a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial filibuster, thus {{eliminating the need for}} the Republican leadership's attempt to implement the so-called [...] "nuclear option" [...] (also known as the [...] "constitutional option"). Under the agreement, Senators would retain the power to filibuster a judicial nominee, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> agree to use this power against Bush nominees only in an [...] "extraordinary circumstance", the Republicans involved would agree to vote against the nuclear option if implemented, and three of the most contested Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate. The agreement may have affected the likelihood that a Senate minority would defeat subsequent nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court (e.g., the nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito). Such a defeat by a filibustering Senate minority could have become less likely if the so-called [...] "nuclear option" [...] had been successful, but such a defeat could have become more likely if the nuclear option had been voted down.|$|E
2500|$|Hoover {{had been}} little-known among the American public before 1914, but emerged {{as perhaps the}} second-most famous person in the United States after President Wilson. In the lead-up to the 1920 presidential election, Hoover was often {{mentioned}} as a potential candidate, but his partisan affiliation was unclear. Hoover particularly appealed to progressives of both parties, who commended his war-time push for higher taxes, criticism of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, and advocacy for measures such as the minimum wage, forty-eight-hour workweek, and elimination of child labor. Yet Hoover's [...] "rags to riches" [...] story and war-time leadership made him appealing to many others as well. In March 1920, Hoover publicly declared his allegiance with the GOP, stating {{that he would not}} run for but would not refuse the 1920 Republican nomination. Hoover had various reasons for choosing the Republican Party, including a split with Wilson over the Versailles Treaty (Hoover had come to accept the Lodge Reservations to the treaty), and his view that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> likely lose the 1920 election. However, the conservative Old Guard of the GOP viewed Hoover warily, and his time as Food Czar had also made him numerous enemies among farmers, an important bloc in the GOP. Hoover's candidacy for the GOP nomination fizzled out after his defeat in the California primary by favorite son Hiram Johnson. In the general election, Hoover supported the Republican nominee, Warren G. Harding, who emerged victorious.|$|E
2500|$|On May 23, 2005, Lieberman {{was one of}} {{fourteen}} senators, dubbed the [...] "Gang of 14," [...] who forged a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial filibuster, thus avoiding the Republican leadership's implementation of the so-called [...] "nuclear option". [...] Under the agreement, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> exercise the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an [...] "extraordinary circumstance," [...] {{and three of the}} filibustered Bush appellate court nominees [...] (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) [...] would receive a vote by the full Senate, which resulted in their confirmation. Lieberman refused to support a filibuster against Supreme Court Justice nominee Samuel Alito. Alito was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 31, 2006 by a vote of 58-42, becoming the Court's 110th Justice. Lieberman voted against the Alito confirmation in the final Senate vote. On the John Roberts nomination as the Chief Justice of the United States, Lieberman believed that Roberts {{did not seem to be}} the kind of right-wing candidate the [...] "Gang of 14" [...] feared the president would select. Lieberman said he thought Roberts was a [...] "decent guy." [...] But he also said it was too early to draw further conclusions. Roberts was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 29, 2005 by a vote of 7822, becoming the Court's 17th Chief Justice. Lieberman voted for the Roberts confirmation.|$|E
