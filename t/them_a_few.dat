Examples include the critically endangered Sri Lankan relict ant (Aneuretus simoni) and Adetomyrma venatrix of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Devika Rani {{was sent}} to {{boarding}} school in England {{at the age of}} nine, and grew up there. After completing her schooling in the mid-1920s, she enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and the Royal Academy of Music in London to study acting and music. She also enrolled for courses in architecture, textile and decor design, and even apprenticed under Elizabeth Arden. All of these courses, each of <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months long, were completed by 1927, and Devika Rani then took up a job in textile design.|$|E
5|$|She had {{formerly}} had {{the same}} symptoms of arsenical poison herself, and it was some time before she discovered {{it to be the}} mesmeric work of an enemy. Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> weeks ago she observed that he did not look well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E
5|$|Mitch caused such {{massive and}} {{widespread}} damage that Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores claimed it destroyed {{fifty years of}} progress in the country. Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending 700tons of food, 11tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country. The U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days after the storm. They also at first offered only $2million (1998USD) in aid, which {{came as a shock}} to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70million (1998USD). The Honduran government distributed food, water, and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than 4million without water. In addition, the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the following years. In Costa Rica, reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.|$|E

5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better at running <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E

Garcilaso de la Vega reported how the Indians built the mounds and placed temples on top of <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> French expeditions reported staying with Indian societies who built mounds.|$|E

GM never responded to the EV drivers' offer to pay the residual lease value; $1.9 million was offered for the remaining 78 cars in Burbank, California before they were crushed. Several activists, including actresses Alexandra Paul and Colette Divine, were arrested in the protest that attempted to block the GM car carriers taking the remaining EV1s off to be crushed.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} on the Narva front was turning into a catastrophe for the German Army Group North. The Leningrad Front had formed bridgeheads both {{north and south of}} Narva, the closest of <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred meters away from Narva–Tallinn Highway. The Sponheimer Group was in direct danger of getting besieged. The defence of the highway was held only by small infantry units formed of the 9th and 10th Luftwaffe Field Divisions, supported by Panther tanks after every few hundred metres along the highway. They obscured direct observation of the highway by placing branches of spruce trees along it, however, this did not distract the Soviet artillery from keeping the highway under constant bombardment. The faith of the Sponheimer Group, that the defence could go on like this, started to diminish.|$|E
25|$|The British {{had sent}} Corsican irregulars {{to probe the}} French defences, but the commander, David Dundas withdrew <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later due to the {{freezing}} conditions in the mountains. Hood's strategy to seize Corsica relied on speed, and rumours were spreading of a French relief force of 12,000 soldiers being prepared at Nice. The admiral felt that a demonstration of British naval strength might be sufficient to intimidate the French, and on 23 February took the Mediterranean Fleet on an extended cruise off Bastia, sailing around Cap Corse, reconnoitering the town and then returning to San Fiorenzo Bay on 5 March. There he found that Dundas had made no preparations for the coming siege. During this operation, Nelson had taken a squadron close inshore to study the seaward defences and exchanged fire with the shore batteries for two hours without a single shot striking his force.|$|E
25|$|The Englishmen also capture Gagool, who reluctantly {{leads them}} to King Solomon's Mines. She shows them a {{treasure}} room inside a mountain, carved deep within the living rock and full of gold, diamonds, and ivory. She then treacherously sneaks out while they are admiring the hoard and triggers a secret mechanism that closes the mine's vast stone door. Unfortunately for Gagool, a brief scuffle with a beautiful native named Foulata—who had become attached to Good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battle—causes her to be crushed under the stone door, though not before fatally stabbing Foulata. Their scant store {{of food and water}} rapidly dwindling, the trapped men prepare to die also. After a few despairing days sealed in the dark chamber, they find an escape route, bringing with <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pocketfuls of diamonds from the immense trove, enough to make them rich.|$|E
