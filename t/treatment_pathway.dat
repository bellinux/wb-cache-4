40|$|Introduction: The ailments afflicting {{the elderly}} {{population}} is a well-defined specialty of medicine. It {{calls for an}} immaculately designed health-care plan to treat diseases in geriatrics. For chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary heart disease, and hypertension (HTN), they require proper management {{throughout the rest of}} patient's life. An integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> helps in treatment decision-making and improving standards of health care for the patient. Case Presentation: This case describes an exclusive clinical pharmacist-driven designing of an integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> for a post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) geriatric male patient with DM type I and HTN for the treatment of hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance. Intervention: The treatment begins addressing the chief complaints which were vomiting and unconsciousness. Biochemical screening is essential to establish a diagnosis of electrolyte imbalance along with blood glucose level after which the integrated pathway defines the treatment course. Conclusion: This individualized <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> provides an outline of the course of treatment of acute hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance as well as some unconfirmed diagnosis, namely, acute coronary syndrome and respiratory tract infection for a post-CABG geriatric patient with HTN and type 1 DM.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: While much {{emphasis}} on safety in the radiation oncology clinic is placed on process, there remains considerable opportunity to increase safety, enhance outcomes and avoid ad-hoc care by instituting detailed <b>treatment</b> <b>pathways.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to review the process of developing evidence and consensus-based, outcomes-oriented <b>treatment</b> <b>pathways</b> that standardize <b>treatment</b> and patient management in a large multicenter radiation oncology practice. Further, we reviewed our compliance in incorporating these directives into our day-to-day clinical practice. METHODS: Using the Institute of Medicine guideline for developing <b>treatment</b> <b>pathways,</b> 87 disease specific pathways were developed and incorporated into the electronic medical system in our multi-facility radiation oncology department. Compliance in incorporating <b>treatment</b> <b>pathways</b> was assessed by mining our EMR data from January 1, 2010 through February 2012 for patients with breast and prostate cancer. RESULTS: This retrospective analysis of data from electronic medical records found overall compliance to breast and prostate cancer <b>treatment</b> <b>pathways</b> to be 97 % and 99 %, respectively. The reason for non-compliance proved to be either a failure to complete the prescribed care based on grade II or III toxicity (n= 1 breast, 3 prostate) or patient elected discontinuance of care (n= 1 prostate) or the physician chose a higher dose for positive/close margins (n= 3 breast). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that consensus and evidence-based <b>treatment</b> <b>pathways</b> can be developed and implemented in a multi-center department of radiation oncology. And that for prostate and breast cancer there was a high degree of compliance using these directives. The development and implementation of these pathways serve as a key component of our safety program, most notably in our effort to facilitate consistent decision-making and reducing variation between physicians...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Currently {{less than}} 15 % of {{children}} under five with fever receive recommended artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT), {{far short of}} the Roll Back Malaria target of 80 %. To understand why coverage remains low, it is necessary to examine the <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> from a child getting fever to receiving appropriate treatment and to identify critical blockages. This paper presents the application of such a diagnostic approach to the coverage of prompt and effective treatment of children with fever in rural Senegal. Methods A two-stage cluster sample household survey was conducted in August 2008 in Tambacounda, Senegal, to investigate treatment behaviour for children under five with fever in the previous two weeks. The <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> was divided in to five key steps; the proportion of all febrile children reaching each step was calculated. Results were stratified by sector of provider (public, community, and retail). Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of treatment seeking. Results Overall 61. 6 % (188) of caretakers sought any advice or treatment and 40. 3 % (123) sought any treatment promptly within 48 hours. Over 70 % of children taken to any provider with fever did not receive an anti-malarial. The proportion of febrile children receiving ACT within 48 hours was 6. 2 % (19) from any source; inclusion of correct dose and duration reduced this to 1. 3 %. The proportion of febrile children receiving ACT within 48 hours (not including dose & duration) was 3. 0 % (9) from a public provider, 3. 0 % (9) from a community source and 0. 3 % (1) from the retail sector. Inclusion of confirmed diagnosis within the public sector <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> as per national policy increases the proportion of children receiving appropriate treatment with ACT in this sector from 9. 4 % (9 / 96) to an estimated 20. 0 % (9 / 45). Conclusions Process analysis of the <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> for febrile children must be stratified by sector of treatment-seeking. In Tambacounda, Senegal, interventions are needed to increase prompt care-seeking for fever, improve uptake of rapid diagnostic tests at the public and community levels and increase correct treatment of parasite-positive patients with ACT. Limited impact will be achieved if interventions to improve prompt and effective treatment target only one step in the <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> in any sector. </p...|$|E

There is little quantitative information on <b>treatment</b> <b>pathways,</b> costs and outcomes. The aims of this New Zealand study were to determine from which healthcare practitioners patients with insomnia sought <b>treatment,</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>pathways</b> followed, the net costs of treatment and the quality of life improvements obtained. Methods: The study was retrospective and prevalence based, and was both cost effectiveness (CEA) and a cost utility (CUA) analysis. Micro costing techniques were used and a societal analytic perspective was adopted. A deterministic decision tree model was used to estimate base case values, and a stochastic version, with Monte Carlo simulation, was used to perform sensitivity analysis. A probability and cost were attached to each event which enabled the costs for the <b>treatment</b> <b>pathways</b> and average <b>treatment</b> cost to be calculated.

40|$|Psoriasis is an immune-mediated {{inflammatory}} disease (IMID) {{which may have}} a major impact on a patient's life, especially when the disease is moderate to severe. There is evidence that treatment of psoriasis during the first years is conservative and frequently based on topical agents which rarely clear lesions. Treatment with systemic agents including biologics is often undertaken only when topical agents have proved unsuitable, even in patients with moderate to severe disease. However, there is evidence that in other IMIDs (rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease), targeted systemic treatment given early in the <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> may improve long-term patient outcomes. We hypothesize that a patient-centered therapeutic approach, undertaken early in the psoriasis <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> ("early intervention") with the goal of complete clearance, may improve control of cutaneous symptoms and may also modify disease course and burden.

Guidance from local advisory bodies is emerging on the most appropriate place for liraglutide in the <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway.</b> It is apparent from its phase 3 clinical trial programme that liraglutide provides superior glycaemic control compared with that achieved with other antidiabetic agents used early in the <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> (e. g. glimepiride and sitagliptin). Key additional benefits include a low incidence of hypoglycaemia and clinically relevant weight loss, although these benefits may be ameliorated by concomitant sulphonylurea (SU) treatment and, in the case of hypoglycaemia, reduction of the SU dose may be necessary. Overall, the profile of liraglutide is similar and, in some aspects, superior to twice-daily exenatide. The implementation of liraglutide therapy is straightforward, with simple dose titration from the starting dose of 0. 6 to 1. 2 mg/day after 1 week; some patients may benefit from additional titration to 1. 8 mg/day. Treatment is self-administered by subcutaneous injection. This contrasts with other agents used early in the <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway,</b> but clinical data suggest patients' overall treatment satisfaction with liraglutide is similar (1. 2 mg) or better (1. 8 mg) than that with sitagliptin despite differing administration methods.

Methods: This is a prospective cohort observational study following the implementation of a <b>treatment</b> <b>pathway</b> for OH, defined by ScvO 2 2 m Mol /L with systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg. Initial treatment included volume resuscitation and/or blood transfusion, followed by additional interventions when ScvO 2 remained hours postoperatively. Primary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) /hospital LOS and complications. Results: Comparing 53 patients managed by the OH pathway against 21 historical controls, median ICU LOS was 40. 4 vs. 49. 2 hours (p = 0. 122), median hospital LOS 9. 2 vs. 11. 0 days (p = 0. 0093), ICU readmission rate 7. 5 % vs. 28. 6 % (p = 0. 026), and complication rate 26. 4 % vs. 47. 6 % (p = 0. 101). Repeat lactate was checked 18 hours postoperatively in 47 of the 53 patients. Comparing 33 patients with repeat lactate at goal (2 mMoL/L) with 14 patients not at goal, median ICU LOS was 35. 3 vs. 68. 4 hours (p = 0. 061), median hospital LOS 8. 9 vs. 11. 2 days (p = 0. 058), median length of mechanical ventilation (LOMV) 13. 3 vs. 28. 4 hours (p = 0. 0038), and complication rate 15. 2 % vs. 50. 0 % (p = 0. 025).
