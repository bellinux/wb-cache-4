The rat LH ELISA used rLH-I- 9 <b>coated</b> <b>plates,</b> an antiserum against rLH and an antibody against rabbit IgG labeled with peroxidase. Using rLH-RP- 3 as a standard, rat LH {{was determined by}} binding of the anti-LH antibody to rLH-I- 9 <b>coated</b> <b>plates.</b> The sensitivity of the assay was 0. 8 ng/mL. Similarly, the rat FSH-ELISA used rFSH-I- 8 <b>coated</b> <b>plates,</b> an antiserum against rFSH and an antibody against rabbit IgG labeled with peroxidase. Using rFSH-RP- 3 as a standard, the FSH-ELISA was also determined by binding of the anti-FSH antibody to rFSH-I- 8 <b>coated</b> <b>plates.</b> The sensitivity of this assay was 1. 25 ng/mL. Both rat LH and FSH ELISA assays are highly specific and provide accurate determination of gonadotrophins in buffers, sera, cell culture media, and anterior pituitary extracts. These assays were used for monitoring the gonadotrophin surge-attenuating factor (GnSAF) and inhibin activities present in human follicular fluid (hFF). The 2 new ELISA procedures have practical advantages (safety, convenience, economy) over the RIA methods, and they perform {{as well as the}} RIA techniques at the same range of concentrations.

40|$|Inspection of coated {{material}} is vital {{in order to}} ensure the integrity of the protective barrier. In some cases, the inspection process is {{complicated by the fact that}} the surface of the protective coating may not be accessible, thus the inspection must proceed with only access to the surface of the opposite side (this will be referred to as the inner surface). One method which can be applied in such a situation is the excitation of guided waves or Lamb waves in the {{coated material}}. Lamb waves excited from the inner surface will sense the variation in the coating conditions as well as flaws in the steel plate. Therefore for a correct and unambiguous interpretation of Lamb wave data for corrosion-related flaws, the effects of the coating and how they differ from the effects of corrosion-related flaws must be understood. To this end this paper will concentrate on the effects of the coating and its influence on dispersive characteristics of a soft layer bonded to a steel plate. By calculating the dispersion relations for a bare and <b>coated</b> steel <b>plate</b> and comparing the calculated results, unique new modes are seen to emerge in the <b>coated</b> <b>plate.</b> In addition, the <b>coated</b> <b>plate</b> is also modeled as a thin layer on a halfspace allowing a comparison between the problem of a coated halfspace and a <b>coated</b> <b>plate.</b> The comparison demonstrates that only limited information can be obtained by treating the problem as a layered halfspace.

The hydrogen content of former DLC was 14. 5 % and that of latter was 14. 7 %.
