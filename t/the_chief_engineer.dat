5|$|The New York Legislature {{passed a}} law in 1869 authorizing the {{creation}} of a large public park on the spot and the creation of the Board of Trustees of the Washington Park of the City of Albany (later Commissioners). John Bogart and John Cuyler drew the plans for Washington Park in 1870. Bogart had worked for Olmsted and Vaux on Central Park in New York and later Bogart was <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> for the New York City Department of Parks from 1872 to 1877. From 1869 to 1872 R.H. Bingham was <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> in charge of the drafting of the plans and the supervision of construction, after 1872 his assistant William S. Egerton took charge. It was under Egerton that the formal garden settings were planted.|$|E
5|$|According to Paul D. Colford, {{a former}} writer for Long Island Newsday, Howard Stern listened to tapes of Steve and Garry sent from Chicago {{by a friend}} of <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> at WCCC Hartford. Colford claims Stern {{eventually}} developed his on-air style {{as a result of}} these tapes. Later, Stern was hired at WWWW Detroit (which Dahl had left when he moved to Chicago).|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of the secession of {{his home state of}} Georgia, Alexander resigned his U.S. Army commission on May 1, 1861, to join the Confederate Army as a captain of engineers. While organizing and training new recruits to form a Confederate signal service, he was ordered to report to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard at Manassas Junction, Virginia. He became <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> and signal officer of the Confederate Army of the Potomac on June 3.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, a {{plan for}} the city railways, and an Eastern Suburbs {{extension}} was drawn up by <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Engineer</b> of the Melbourne Railway Construction, John Bradfield. It was given subsequent approval by Parliament. Bradfield's plan entailed building a City Circle loop, with an extension through to the Eastern Suburbs by means of a viaduct over Woolloomooloo. The line was to extend to Rosebery and Waterloo, with ten stations, linking with the Illawarra Line near Erskineville station.|$|E
5|$|Most recent {{attention}} {{arises from}} King's interaction with Akira Tsurukame and Katja Boonstra-Blom – {{the subject of}} print media articles, an exhibition, and video interviews. Tsurukame, son of <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> who perished with I-166, in 2004 sought out King. King, Tsurukame, and Katja Boonstra, whose father was killed when I-166 sank the Dutch submarine K XVI, together planted a tree at Oranmore Castle to honour the fathers of the latter two.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> of the Corinth Canal, Béla Gerster, {{conducted}} {{extensive research}} on the topography of the Isthmus, but did not discover the Diolkos. Remains of the ship trackway were probably first identified by the German archaeologist Habbo Gerhard Lolling in the 1883 Baedeker edition. In 1913, James George Frazer reported in his commentary on Pausanias on traces of an ancient trackway across the Isthmus, while parts of the western quay were discovered by Harold North Fowler in 1932.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Greene {{served on}} court-martial duty {{for a year}} and then {{returned}} to civil engineering in New York and Washington, D.C. From 1867 to 1871 he was <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> commissioner of the Croton Aqueduct Department in New York.

5|$|Apart from Captain Kirk, {{the episode}} {{introduced}} two other regular characters to the show: James Doohan, {{a friend of}} director James Goldstone, was cast as <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Engineer</b> Montgomery Scott (the name chosen after Doohan had tried various accents, and had decided that an engineer ought to be Scottish) and George Takei was cast as Ship's Physicist Sulu, who would become the helmsman in the regular series. Lieutenant Uhura and Dr. Leonard McCoy do not feature; the ship's doctor is instead Mark Piper (Paul Fix). Piper {{was intended as a}} regular; DeForest Kelley, who played McCoy in the series proper, had been considered for the role.|$|E

60|$|Such is <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer's</b> {{testimony}} to <b>the</b> {{continuity of the}} old tradition of the sea, which made {{by the work of}} men has in its turn created for them their simple ideal of conduct.|$|R

5|$|Later that day, Lt. Milton R. Rubb and his {{electronics}} technician team {{returned the}} fathometer to operational status, and <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Engineer</b> Donald D. Fears, Reactor Officer Lt. Cmdr. Robert P. McDonald, and Tritons engineering crew repaired the malfunctioning reactor. Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, Triton continued south, {{although there was}} a detour to the Golfo Nuevo region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary news accounts reported the Argentine Navy had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but Tritons contact {{turned out to be a}} school of fish.|$|E
5|$|Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, double-deck, fixed counterweight, {{trunnion}} bascule bridge. It was {{engineered by}} the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> of construction. At {{the time of}} construction it {{was believed to be}} the first double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the lower deck.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{made his}} {{television}} debut in January 1939, reprising his 1936 stage role of <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> in Bees on the Boatdeck. His last stage {{part in the}} 1930s was Robert Johnson, an Everyman figure, in Priestley's Johnson Over Jordan directed by Basil Dean. It was an experimental piece, using music (by Benjamin Britten) and dance as well as dialogue, and was another production in which Richardson was widely praised but which did not prosper at the box-office. After it closed, in May 1939, he did not act on stage {{for more than five}} years.|$|E
50|$|It was {{designed}} by Arup Associates and constructed 1968 - 70 with Ove Arup as <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineers.</b> <b>The</b> university's development plan at the time called for two other similar towers, but these were never built.|$|R
50|$|From 1900 to 1910, {{he served}} as the {{assistant}} to <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> of <b>Engineers</b> in <b>the</b> United States Army. Later, he was simultaneously principal assistant to <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> of <b>Engineers,</b> commandant of the Army Engineer School, and commandant of Washington Barracks. On August 5, 1917, Abbott was promoted to brigadier general in the national army. During the absence of <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> of <b>Engineers</b> to France, Abbott became acting Chief and commanded thirty-five thousand engineer troops in the Washington, D.C. area.|$|R

5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed {{around to}} see if we could not get a line from <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer,</b> and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew was}} ordered to abandon ship after about forty minutes of the {{bombardment}} using the only remaining operable motor lifeboat of the three stowed on board. One officer and four enlisted men were injured, {{but no one was}} killed. The Turks continued their bombardment for five hours until Ben-my-Chree listed to starboard and sank in shallow water. Later in the day, the captain and <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> returned to the wreck to rescue the ship's mascots, a cat and dog which had both survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|West Gates engines {{were shut}} down while American {{backed out of the}} tangle. West Gate quickly began to settle and the order to abandon ship was issued. <b>The</b> <b>chief</b> <b>engineer</b> and his assistant, Spencer and Hillery, {{remained}} belowdecks long enough to extinguish the boilers and open safety valves to prevent the explosion of the boilers. They finished the task just before the aft bulkhead gave way to the inrushing seawater. Both arrived on deck in time to board lifeboat number 2, which had been held as long as possible for men in the after part of the ship.|$|E
