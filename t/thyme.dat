5|$|On {{the hill}} summits {{that dot the}} {{headlands}} are heather and gorse, shaped by the prevailing wind; thrift and wild <b>thyme</b> thrive on the acidic soil. The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E

5|$|Today {{herbs are}} {{typically}} {{thought of as}} culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they {{were considered to be}} any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics. Traditional cottage garden herbs included sage, <b>thyme,</b> southernwood, wormwood, catmint, feverfew, lungwort, soapwort, hyssop, sweet woodruff, and lavender.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Grayson {{constructed}} Grayson's Tavern in Danville {{sometime around}} 1785. The asymmetrical, ell-shaped building faces south onto Walnut Street with a front entrance {{on the south}} and a side entrance on the west, which opens onto Constitution Square. The Mary Akin Memorial Herb Garden, located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly cultivated in the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, fennel, honeysuckle, lavender, rosemary, sage, and <b>thyme.</b> The garden is maintained by the Garden Club of Danville and named for one of its long-time members.|$|E
5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild <b>thyme,</b> horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E

5000|$|The genus Thymus ( [...] ; <b>thymes)</b> {{contains}} about 350species of aromatic perennial herbaceous plants and subshrubs to 40 cm tall {{in the family}} Lamiaceae, native to temperate regions in Europe, North Africa and Asia.|$|R
5|$|The {{headland}} {{is primarily}} covered with grass, {{as well as}} heather (Calluna vulgaris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), <b>thyme</b> (Thymus polytrichus) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover (Trifolium occidentale) were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north-, seaward-side of the headland. The parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta epithymum) is found growing on gorse. There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sea campion (Silene uniflora), and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} nine drama CD adaptations were {{released}} by Lantis for Shuffle! between 2004 and 2007. Five CDs were released monthly between May 26, 2004 and September 23, 2004, with each focused upon {{one of the}} five heroines of PC version of Shuffle!. Each drama CD contains between four to five tracks. For the PlayStation 2 version, an additional two CDs were released on February 22, 2006 and May 24, 2006, respectively, each focusing on Mayumi <b>Thyme</b> and Kareha, the two new heroines. For the second anime adaptation, Shuffle! Memories, two additional drama CDs were released on July 25, 2007 and October 24, 2007, focusing on Kaede Fuyou and Lisianthus, respectively. Three drama CDs appeared on the weekly Oricon albums chart of which the drama CD released for Shuffle! On the Stage focused on Kareha ranked the highest, peaking at #216 and remaining on the chart for one week.|$|E
5|$|English tastes evolved {{during the}} sixteenth century {{in at least three}} ways. Firstly, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Secondly, butter becomes an {{important}} ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Thirdly, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. In A. W.'s Book of Cookrye, 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly <b>thyme.</b> On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar and dried fruit, together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: The Good Huswifes Jewell introduced sweet potatoes alongside familiar Medieval recipes.|$|E

5|$|The PlayStation 2 version {{varies from}} the PC version {{as all the}} sex scenes are removed and the player may follow two new storylines: Mayumi <b>Thyme's</b> and Kareha's. Additionally, Kareha's younger sister Tsubomi makes her first {{appearance}} in the PS2 version during Kareha's path.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum appenninum) is a common species at the site, occurring in abundance on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing here, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae). Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild <b>thyme,</b> horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), <b>thyme</b> (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium <b>thyme</b> and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers {{were made to the}} goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{design for}} the {{memorial}} was produced by Philip Hepworth, the Principal Architect for France for the Imperial War Graves Commission (later the Commonwealth War Graves Commission), while the glass engraving was by New Zealand-born engraver John Hutton.

Definition of cellu-lar contents of the <b>thyme’s</b> parenchyma spent with the help of computer system of the digital analysis of image VIDAS- 386 (Kontron Elektronik, Germany). Studied standard morphologies and functional zones of particles: subcapillary, internal corti-cal and medullar. Under conditions of the micromerculialism in various morphologies and functional comportments of the thymus compensatory and adaptable changes are observed both displays of an intoxication, and. Preventative use of “Thiotri-azolinum” and “Mildronatum” improved morphometrical parameters of thymus lymphoid population.
