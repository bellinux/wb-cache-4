40|$|In Climate Change Justice, Eric A. Posner and David Weisbach argue {{not only}} that a climate treaty with {{significant}} North-to-South redistribution of wealth is infeasible, but also that to support such a treaty is counterproductive. They ague instead that all countries should support an 2 ̆ 2 optimal 2 ̆ 2 climate <b>treaty,</b> <b>balancing</b> marginal costs and benefits, and that side payments should go {{to ensure that no}} countries-even wealthy, high-polluting countries that are externalizing huge costs and risks-are worse off than the status quo. They justify this seeming contradiction to their welfarist moral theory by arguing that North-South redistribution is better handled in a separate foreign aid treaty. But their theory of International Paretanism (IP) -which essentially holds that countries will not join treaties with significant net economic costs-implies that no such foreign aid treaty will be forthcoming. Furthermore, {{at least one of them}} has argued elsewhere that it is effectively impossible to estimate climate damages (due to both scientific uncertainty and normative controversy), and thus their 2 ̆ 2 optimal 2 ̆ 2 treaty may itself be infeasible. Finally, they accept the possible need for sanctions on free riders, which suggests that International Paretianism and its assumption that treaties must be 2 ̆ 2 self- enforcing 2 ̆ 2 is not an insuperable constraint. For all of these reasons and more, this Article argues that their case against advocating a redistributive treaty is unconvincing...|$|R
60|$|The {{whole of}} the enemy's plan was known when Lord Malmesbury was sent with his scrap of {{equivalents}} to Paris. Yet, in this unfortunate attempt at negotiation, instead of fixing these points, and assuming {{the balance of power}} and the peace of Europe as the basis to which all cessions on all sides were to be subservient, our solicitor for peace was directed to reverse that order. He was directed to make mutual concessions, on a mere comparison of their marketable value, the base of <b>treaty.</b> The <b>balance</b> of power was to be thrown in as an inducement, and a sort of make-weight to supply the manifest deficiency, which must stare him and the world in the face, between those objects which he was to require the enemy to surrender and those which he had to offer as a fair equivalent.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to these concerns, the Home Secretary Theresa May appointed The Rt Hon. Lord Justice Scott Baker to conduct an official review of the UK's extradition treaties, {{with the assistance of}} two independent extradition experts. The review was directed to address evidence standards and whether the US-UK Extradition Treaty is unbalanced. Sir Scott Baker's report was presented to the Home Secretary on September 30, 2011, and concluded that there is no substantial difference in evidence standards, that the <b>treaty</b> is <b>balanced</b> and that there is not [...] "any basis to conclude that extradition from the United Kingdom to the US operates unfairly or oppressively" [...] The review contradicts the findings of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR), which was intended to form part of the Government's full extradition review and which called for the Government to renegotiate the UK's extradition treaty with the United States to ensure British citizens get the same protection as Americans.|$|R
40|$|I {{show that}} there is a {{trade-off}} in the design of international agreements between depth and rigidity. Increasing the depth of required cooperation both lowers the likelihood of compliance with the treaty and decreases the stability of the regime. In contrast, as the rigidity of an agreement increases (and there is less opportunity for tolerated defection from treaty obligations), the likelihood of compliance with the treaty increases while the stability of the regime decreases. <b>Treaty</b> designers must <b>balance</b> short-term compliance against the long-run stability of a cooperative regime. I argue that this implies a negative relationship between depth and rigidity in observed treaties. In international trade, agreements that mandate deep tariff reductions {{will be more likely to}} include flexibility mechanisms—such as formal dispute settlement mechanisms, escape clauses, and antidumping procedures—while agreements that require shallow cooperation will be more rigid. I find strong support for this argument by conducting empirical tests on a dataset of 57 Asian trade agreements...|$|R
500|$|Prior to the American {{entry into}} the war, Woodrow Wilson called for a [...] "peace of {{reconciliation}} with Germany", what he dubbed a [...] "peace without victory". His wartime speeches, however, rejected these earlier notions and he took an increasingly belligerent stance towards Germany. Following the war, on 4 September 1919, during his public campaign to rally American support for the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson commented that the treaty [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization, and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for the attempt." [...] Regardless of the rhetoric, the American position was to create a <b>balanced</b> <b>treaty</b> that would appease everyone. Gordon Auchincloss, secretary to Edward M. House (one of Wilson's advisers), sent a copy of the clause to the State Department and stated [...] "you will note that the President's principles have been protected in this clause".|$|R
50|$|On 30 January 1648, the {{war ended}} with the Treaty of Münster between Spain and the Netherlands. In Münster on 15 May 1648, the parties {{exchanged}} ratified copies of the treaty. This treaty {{was part of the}} European-scale Peace of Westphalia that also ended the Thirty Years' War. In the <b>treaty,</b> the power <b>balance</b> in Western Europe was readjusted to the actual geopolitical reality. This meant that de jure the Dutch Republic was recognized as an independent state and retained control over the territories that were conquered in the later stages of the war. The new republic consisted of seven provinces: Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel, Friesland, and Groningen. Each province was governed by its local Provincial States and by a stadtholder. In theory, each stadtholder was elected and subordinate to the States-General. However, the princes of Orange-Nassau, beginning with William I of Orange, became de facto hereditary stadtholders in Holland and Zeeland. In practice they usually became stadtholder of the other provinces as well. A constant power struggle, which already had shown its precursor during the Twelve Years' Truce, emerged between the Orangists, who supported the stadtholders, and the Regent's supporters.|$|R
5000|$|Member states {{bound by}} the Fiscal Compact have to {{transpose}} into national legal order {{the provisions of the}} Fiscal Compact. In particular, national budget has to be in balance or surplus under the treaty's definition. An automatic correction mechanism has to be established to correct potential significant deviations. A national independent monitoring institution should be mandated to provide fiscal surveillance. The <b>treaty</b> defines a <b>balanced</b> budget as a general budget deficit not exceeding 3.0% {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP), and a structural deficit not exceeding a country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO) which at most can be set to 0.5% of GDP for states with a debt&#8209;to&#8209;GDP ratio exceeding 60% - or at most 1.0% of GDP for states with debt levels within the 60%-limit. The country-specific MTOs are recalculated every third year and might be set at stricter levels compared to what the treaty allows at most. The treaty also contains a direct copy of the [...] "debt brake" [...] criteria outlined in the Stability and Growth Pact, which defines the rate at which debt levels above the limit of 60% of GDP shall decrease.|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a {{conceptual}} and historical {{analysis of the}} social structure of premodern East Asian international societies from the theoretical lens of the English School. The English School is most useful in providing the ‘big picture’ of international society with theoretical depth and historical breadth. This picture, from the dawn of imperial China (221 B. C.) {{to the beginning of}} Western intrusion (mid-nineteenth century), may be conceptualized as the evolution and interaction of two international societies: the sinocentric society of Chinese hegemony (fanshu) and the more equal society of rival equality (diguo), ordered through the unique institution of the tribute system in the former case and those of heqin (peace and kinship), <b>treaties,</b> and the <b>balance</b> of power in the latter case, as well as through their common institutions of traveling embassy, trade, and war. In addition, although these two were the primary international societies in East Asian history, we should also note the existence of nested ones—the various fanshu-style hegemonic relationships between powerful states other than China (the Xiongnu, Turks, Korea, Vietnam, etc.) and the lesser states they dominated. Historical East Asian politics, characterized by the coexistence, overlap, interaction, and interpenetration of different kinds and levels of international societies, were therefore considerably more complicated and interesting than the tribute system paradigm suggests...|$|R
40|$|The {{founding}} of the World Trade Organization in 1995, was hailed as {{a new era in}} resolving global trade disputes, with many academicians espousing a constitutionalised vision of world trade law. The constitutional evolution of WTO law is founded, not only on the text of the WTO Covered Agreements, but is also buttressed exceedingly by precedence and norms that are generated through adjudication by the panels and the standing WTO Appellate Body. Today, as is with most mature legal systems, international lawyers and academics avidly critique WTO jurisprudence and the interpretive methodology of its adjudicators. However, there is a dearth of scholarship on the implications of WTO law interpretation on developing nations. This thesis fills this void in research by constructing a framework for analysing the jurisprudence of the WTO from the perspective of developing nations. Subsequently, it proceeds to evaluate three agreements which are important for developing nations, i. e., the DSU and due process rights, the TRIPS Agreement, and the Antidumping Agreement. To this end, the framework for analysis is termed "the development approach" to fair adjudication, which is grounded on established legal concepts of legitimacy, justice and ultimately fairness. The thesis demonstrates that a fair trading regime entails more than seemingly <b>balanced</b> <b>treaty</b> texts, but rather that adjudication of the treaties must include an approach, which recognises and accounts for the effects of interpretation on development. To this end, the adjudicators have to go beyond merely finding the literal meaning of the treaty text, but embrace an approach, which is guided by the context and purpose of WTO provisions. The analysis reveals that the adjudicators of the WTO have failed to recognise the nexus between interpretation and development and as such, have created a body of case law that harms the development ambitions of third world countries...|$|R
5000|$|Balanced budget rule: General {{government}} budgets {{shall be}} [...] "balanced" [...] or in surplus. The <b>treaty</b> defines a <b>balanced</b> budget {{as a general}} budget deficit not exceeding 3.0% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP), and a structural deficit not exceeding a country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO) which at most can be set to 0.5% of GDP for states with a debt&#8209;to&#8209;GDP ratio exceeding 60% - or at most 1.0% of GDP for states with debt levels within the 60%-limit. The country-specific MTOs are recalculated every third year, and might be set at stricter levels compared to what the treaty allows at most. The rule is based upon the existing Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) deficit rule, where the concept of country-specific MTOs was integrated into the preventive arm of the pact in 2005, with an upper limit for structural deficits at 1.0% of GDP applying to all eurozone and ERM-II member states. The novelty of the Fiscal Compact, was to introduce a varying upper limit which depends on the debt-level of the state. When comparing the Fiscal Compact's new MTO rule with the applying country-specific SGP MTOs in 2012, it can be concluded that if the fiscal provisions of the treaty had applied immediately towards all EU member states, then only Hungary and the UK would have been required to introduce a stricter MTO (revising it down to 0.5% of GDP) - as a consequence. As per the already applying Stability and Growth Pact, Member States with a fiscal balance not yet at their MTO, are required to ensure rapid convergence towards it, with the time-frame for this [...] "adjustment path" [...] being outlined by the Council on basis of a European Commission proposal taking the country-specific sustainability risks into consideration.|$|R
