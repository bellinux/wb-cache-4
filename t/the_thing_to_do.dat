Ward considered quitting football, even {{writing a letter}} to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team. He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will. [...] "It {{was the fact that}} I couldn't play in the Georgia Tech game. That all of a sudden, the practice that you just did because it was <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that was good—a tremendous amount of burnt up energy—all of a sudden becomes drudgery." [...] His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60-yard dash and 65 high hurdles. Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging me to go out in '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. I frankly felt they would not let black athletes compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy thing for them to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'" [...] Interviewed about the incident in 1976, Ward said: “It was like any bad experience—you can’t forget it, but you don’t talk about it. It hurts.” ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Smochină's own {{rendition}} of the encounter, {{when asked about his}} vision on the Moldavian question, Lenin began by stating: [...] "You Moldavians have no interest in fighting on the side of Russia, who for centuries now has been enslaving your kind. Culturally, Moldavians are far more advanced than Russians." [...] <b>The</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Lenin said, was for Moldavians to take up arms and fight against the two [...] "oppressors": Russia and [...] "landowners' Romania". According to Smochină, Lenin openly agreed that Moldavians, Bessarabians and Romanians were in essence the same demonym: [...] "Take inspiration from your Romanian blood brothers, but, again, beware of falling into the paws of Romanian boyar exploiters. [...] all Moldavians are Romanians".|$|E
2500|$|Some women became picture brides in {{an attempt}} to escape {{familial}} duties. They thought that by leaving Japan or Korea they could get out of responsibilities such as filial piety that came along with traditional marriage. Some women thought that they would gain freedoms denied to them in Japan and Korea. A quote from a Korean picture bride named Mrs. K embodies the mindset of many picture brides traveling to Hawaii, [...] "Hawaii's a free place, everybody living well. Hawaii had freedom, so if you like talk, you can talk, if you like work, you can work." [...] With the influx of women becoming picture brides, some women followed the trend as <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> As one Japanese picture bride, Motome Yoshimura, explained, [...] "I wanted to come to the United States because everyone else was coming.

50|$|These {{views in}} moral {{psychology}} have various implications. In particular, if motivational internalism is true, then an amoralist is unintelligible (and metaphysically impossible). An amoralist {{is not simply}} someone who is immoral, rather it is someone who knows what <b>the</b> moral <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> are, yet is not motivated <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them. Such an agent is unintelligible to the motivational internalist, because moral judgments about <b>the</b> right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> have built into them corresponding motivations <b>to</b> <b>do</b> those <b>things</b> that are judged by the agent <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> moral <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, an amoralist is entirely intelligible to the motivational externalist, because the motivational externalist thinks that moral judgments about <b>the</b> right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> not necessitate some motivation <b>to</b> <b>do</b> those <b>things</b> that are judged <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do; rather, an independent desire—such as the desire <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the right thing—is required (Brink, 2003),(Rosati, 2006).|$|R
