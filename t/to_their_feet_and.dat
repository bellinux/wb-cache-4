5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades {{similar to the}} Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> significantly encumbered them.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} scrambled <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> rushed forward {{while the}} sappers hurried {{to break down}} the sides of the antitank ditch with picks and shovels. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E

Nisia raises the flap and faces the enemy. Two of her assailants endeavour to capture the Queen, but Gyges cuts them down. Other soldiers attack Gyges, who is almost overcome when a party of Candaule's men come to the rescue, led by the King.|$|E
25|$|At {{the inauguration}} of the UN in 1945, no {{delegation}} from Poland had been invited. The Polish pianist Artur Rubinstein, who was to perform the opening concert at the inauguration, began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference {{did not have a}} delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He then sat down to the piano and played Poland Is Not Yet Lost loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous forte. When he had finished, the public rose <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> gave him a great ovation.|$|E
500|$|Cui {{performed}} the song {{live at the}} Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The performances by Cui and other rock artists during the protests {{have been described as}} [...] "a revolutionary few days that rocked a nation," [...] and many protesters sang [...] "Nothing to My Name" [...] to give voice to their rebellion against the government, and their desire for personal freedom and self-expression. Brace describes how, during Cui's Tiananmen performance, students [...] "jumped <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> began to sing," [...] a practice that had rarely happened at music performances in China before then. Not long after Tiananmen, Cui was restricted to playing in small venues; he did not play before a large audience in Beijing again until 2005.|$|E

500|$|Trauma or illness {{may also}} {{result in a}} cow unable to rise to its feet. [...] Such animals are {{sometimes}} called [...] "downers." [...] Sometimes this {{occurs as a result}} of muscle and nerve damage from calving or a disease such as mastitis. [...] Leg injuries, muscle tears, or a massive infection of some sort may also be causes. Downer cows are encouraged to get <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> have a much greater chance of recovery if they do. If unable to rise, some have survived—with medical care—as long as 14 days and were ultimately able to get back on their feet. Appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling {{from one side to the}} other every three hours, careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of fodder, and access to clean water.|$|E
500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
500|$|Stop 2 landed, formed {{up into a}} sweep {{line and}} marched {{carefully}} to the north alongside a dry riverbed. As darkness fell, just as {{they came to a}} widening in the riverbed, they were suddenly fired upon by an unseen foe. All four men dropped to the ground to avoid being hit. The Canadian lance-corporal called for covering fire from Soares, which he provided as Lamb and Rok rose <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> cautiously moved forward. A dark figure suddenly ran across the soldiers' line of sight, between Lamb and the riverbed, and from a distance of about 16 paces Olivier reflexively swung his rifle around and let off a frenzied, imprecise burst of fire. Mortally wounded by two errant shots through the chest, Lamb stumbled, slumped to the ground and lay face-down in a heap. One of the bullets exited through the back of his body, smashing the radio he had been carrying. He died almost instantly. Meanwhile, the cadres ahead ran headlong into Stop 1, led by Sergeant Derrick Taylor, and were all killed in the ensuing fire fight. Taylor's stick sustained no casualties. When the battle was over, Stops 1 and 3 joined Olivier, Rok and Soares and waited beside Lamb's lifeless body all night until it could be evacuated by helicopter to the local hospital at Chipinga. The death was officially recorded as [...] "killed in action", with no reference to friendly fire.|$|E

2500|$|In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese {{writes that}} Cardiff Arms Park is [...] "Certainly the venue I have fondest {{memories}} of after {{a standing ovation}} the crowd there gave me in 1988. It was during a Barbarians match, and my attacking game was about as finely-tuned as it had ever been. I had {{made a couple of}} really good runs and, after setting up one try and scoring another, the crowd got <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> clapped me back to halfway.

2500|$|Vaublanc, at {{the head}} of his ministry, engaged {{immediately}} in Counter-Revolutionary activity that was so frenetic that even the King was to be describe it as [...] "breathless devotion". On the tabling by the Keeper of the Seals of a law that would reestablish cours prévôtales or [...] "special courts" [...] before the Chamber of Deputies (nicknamed the Chambre introuvable), Vaublanc shouted out: [...] "France wants its King!" [...] To great applause, both the deputies and the public gallery rose <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> repeated [...] "Yes, France wants its King!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Bull and Peel, {{by early}} 1867, had moved their {{operations}} on to Belmont, Nevada, {{and then to}} Salt Lake City, Utah. While in Salt Lake City, the two argued, {{and for a time}} separated. [...] However, by the summer of 1867 the two were working together again, by this time in Helena, Montana. On the night of July 22, 1867, Peel and Bull were seated {{at a table in the}} [...] "Greer Brothers Exchange Saloon", and for some reason the argument they had previously had was rekindled. Both men jumped <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> became arguing loudly.|$|E
2500|$|When the attacking wave {{was twenty}} metres from the dyke the bugles sounded the charge, {{and the two}} marine {{infantry}} companies stormed the embankment. [...] Taccoën's company, leading the way, lost 5 men killed and 10 wounded in its approach. [...] Guérin de Fontjoyeux's men suffered almost as heavily, and two lieutenants were also killed during the assault. [...] But the attack was so rapid that around fifty Black Flags, who had been lying on their backs asleep, {{did not have time}} to get <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> were pinned to the ground with bayonet thrusts. [...] The surviving Chinese fled across the rice paddies. [...] The French killed many of them with rifle fire as they fled.|$|E
2500|$|After {{suffering}} a stroke at 36 in 1977, Taihō used a wheelchair {{in the last}} stage of his life. He died of heart failure in a Tokyo hospital on January 19, 2013 {{at the age of}} 72. His death was announced by the Japan Sumo Association. In its obituary, the Nikkan Sports named him [...] "the strongest yokozuna in history." [...] After winning the March 2013 championship, Hakuhō urged the crowd to get <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> honour Taihō's memory with a moment of silence. He said that Taihō gave him regular advice, and told him that records are meant to be broken. Hakuhō would indeed surpass Taihō's all-time championship record by winning his 33rd yushō in January 2015, two years after Taihō's death.|$|E

The nation's {{newspapers}} praised {{the boys and girls}} for their [...] "intelligent faces and dignified bearing." [...] "But the one that caught the crowd was the Indian band that had the delegation from Carlisle. With the smoothest harmony and in most perfect time, this band played a marching anthem as it passed the reviewing stand. Both the melody and spectacle or so when usual that the people rose <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> cheered again and again. The Indian boys marched with perfect step, and they came opposite President Benjamin Harrison's stand with the military precision that no pale faced organization equaled." ...|$|E
2500|$|The French press {{immediately}} {{protested the}} prospect of a Hohenzollern on the Spanish throne, and on 6 July the new Foreign Minister, the Duc de Gramont [...] told the Chamber that France would not permit Prince Leopold to become King of Spain. [...] Ollivier added that he had no doubt that Prussia would yield in the face of French firmness, but that 'if war be necessary, the government will not enter upon it without the consent of the Legislative Body.' Gramont's statement and Ollivier's mention of war were greeted with great enthusiasm by the deputies, and in the public galleries the ladies rose <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> waved their handkerchiefs as they joined in the wild applause. Next day the Paris press called for war with Prussia, and on 8 July their language was even more violent. The government instructed [...] Benedetti, the French ambassador to Prussia, to demand that King William should publicly refuse his consent to Prince Leopold's acceptance of the throne of Spain.|$|E

Both men then fired several times at Schultz's gang members: Otto Berman, Schultz's accountant; Abe Landau, Schultz's chief henchman; and Schultz's bodyguard, Bernard [...] "Lulu" [...] Rosencrantz. Berman collapsed immediately after being shot. Landau's carotid artery was severed by a bullet passing through his neck, while Rosencrantz was hit repeatedly at point blank range with 00 lead buckshot. Nevertheless, both men rose <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> returned fire, driving the assassins out of the restaurant. Weiss jumped into the getaway car and ordered the driver to abandon Workman. Landau chased Workman out of the bar and emptied his pistol at him, though he missed. Workman fled on foot, and Landau finally collapsed onto a nearby trash can.|$|E
