5|$|L'Olympiade de la RÃ©publique, a {{national}} Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in Revolutionary France also attempted <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> ancient Olympic Games. The competition included several disciplines {{from the ancient}} Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games also marked {{the introduction of the}} metric system into sport.|$|E
5|$|The Roland VK-7, {{introduced}} in 1997, attempted <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of a}} Hammond using digital signal processing technology. An updated version, the VK-8, which appeared in 2002, also provided emulations of other vintage keyboards and provided a connector for a Leslie. Clavia introduced the Nord Electro in 2001; this used buttons <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> physical action of pulling or pushing a drawbar, with an LED graph indicating its current state. Clavia has released several updated versions of the Electro since then, and introduced the Nord Stage with the same technology. The Nord C2D was Clavia's first organ with real drawbars. Diversi, founded by former Hammond-Suzuki sales rep Tom Tuson in 2003, has specialised in Hammond clones, and featured a notable endorsement from Joey DeFrancesco.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, Glenn Seaborg transmuted several {{thousand}} atoms of bismuth into gold at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. His experimental technique, using nuclear physics, {{was able to}} remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atoms. Seaborg's technique was far too expensive to enable the routine manufacture of gold but his work is <b>the</b> closest yet <b>to</b> <b>emulating</b> <b>the</b> mythical Philosopher's Stone.|$|R
5000|$|... wxWidgets is best {{described}} as a native mode toolkit as it provides a thin abstraction to a platform's native widgets, contrary <b>to</b> <b>emulating</b> <b>the</b> display of widgets using graphic primitives. Calling a native widget on the target platform results in a more native looking interface than toolkits such as Swing (for Java), as well as offering performance and other benefits.|$|R
5|$|Alto's Adventure is a 2015 endless runner snowboarding {{video game}} by Snowman. The player-character {{automatically}} {{moves to the}} right of the screen through procedurally generated landscapes. The player taps the screen to jump and perform tricks, and works towards goals, competitive high scores, and upgrades. Snowman, a Toronto-based, three-person indie development team, previously worked on productivity apps before Alto's Adventure. The game was made <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> ethereal atmosphere of snowboarding, and was inspired by Journey (2012), Monument Valley (2014), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000), and Windosill (2009).|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues (or R) was a musical {{movement}} that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was distinct from, the broader British beat and more purist British blues scenes, attempting <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> music of African American blues and rock and roll pioneers, such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. It often placed greater emphasis on guitars and was often played with greater energy.|$|E
5|$|FPGAs can be {{programmed}} with hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog. However, programming in these languages can be tedious. Several vendors have created C to HDL languages that attempt <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> syntax and semantics of the C programming language, with which most programmers are familiar. The best known C to HDL languages are Mitrion-C, Impulse C, DIME-C, and Handel-C. Specific subsets of SystemC based on C++ {{can also be}} used for this purpose.|$|E

50|$|In May 1948, Arbar won the Prix Jean Prat over 3,000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Later {{that month}} {{defeated}} the Belgian champion Bayeux in the 4,000 metre Prix du Cadran {{at the same}} venue. In winning the race, which {{is regarded as the}} French counterpart of the Ascot Gold Cup, he went some way <b>to</b> <b>emulating</b> <b>the</b> achievements of his half-brother Marsyas, who won the race on four occasions.|$|R
5|$|Kyle is {{animated}} by computer {{in a way}} <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film , as well as South Park-related media and merchandise. While Parker and Stone portray Kyle as having common childlike tendencies, his dialogue is often intended to reflect stances and views on more adult-oriented issues, and has been cited in numerous publications by experts {{in the fields of}} politics, religion, popular culture, and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Lowell {{believed}} that the poet {{played an important role}} as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his characters, particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as his many satires, was an inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E

500|$|The first {{attempts}} to electronically copy a Hammond {{appeared in the}} 1970s, including the Roland VK-1 and VK-9, the Yamaha YP45D, and the Crumar Organiser. The Korg CX-3 (single manual) and BX-3 (dual manual) were the first lightweight organs to produce a comparable sound to the original. Sound on Sound Gordon Reid said that the CX-3 [...] "came close <b>to</b> <b>emulating</b> <b>the</b> true depth and passion of a vintage Hammond," [...] particularly when played through a Leslie speaker.|$|R
5|$|The General Douglas MacArthur Foundation {{presents}} the MacArthur Cadet Awards {{in recognition of}} outstanding cadets within the Association of Military Colleges and Schools of the United States. The MacArthur Award is presented annually to seniors at these military schools. The award is designed to encourage cadets <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> leadership qualities shown by General Douglas MacArthur, {{as a student at}} West Texas Military Institute and the U.S. Military Academy. Approximately 40 schools are authorized to provide the award to its top cadet each year.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn Rovers {{were seeking}} <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> success of rivals Blackburn Olympic, {{who were the}} current holders of the trophy, and the team that Queen's Park {{defeated}} in the semi-final. Rovers had previously reached the FA Cup final, in 1882, where they were defeated by Old Etonians. Blackburn trained during the week prior to the game by conducting practise games and going for walks. They departed for the London area by train {{on the day before}} the final; a large crowd of local supporters gathered at the train station in Blackburn to wish them well as they left. The team stayed in Richmond the night before the match and made their way into the city at lunchtime on the Saturday.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{received}} a bye {{to the third}} round of the tournament, and then progressed through five rounds before reaching the final. Arsenal were in a successful phase, with this final following recent First Division titles, while Sheffield United were attempting <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> success of their rivals Sheffield Wednesday in the tournament the year before. A closely fought first half was followed by a dominant second half by Arsenal, who won by a single goal, scored by Ted Drake in the 74th minute. A media ban by the stadium's bosses caused reporters to fly above the stadium in autogyros to see the match and the BBC experimented with sports commentators for the first time during its live broadcast of the final.|$|E
50|$|Many Android tablets have 16:10 {{aspect ratio}}, because 16:10 aspect ratio is {{suitable}} for reading books, and many papers have an aspect ratio close to 16:10 (e.g. ISO 216 papers use the 1:1.414 aspect ratio). The iPad uses a 4:3 aspect ratio for similar reasons. Both formats come significantly closer <b>to</b> <b>emulating</b> <b>the</b> aspect ratio of A4 paper (210 Ã 297 millimeters or 8.27 Ã 11.69 inches) and {{has been attributed to}} the success of 16:10 and 4:3 tablets.|$|R

2500|$|Admiration of Byron {{continued}} to be fervent {{in the years following}} his death. Notable fans included Alfred Lord Tennyson. He was fourteen at the time of Byron's death, and so grieved at the poet's passing he carved the words [...] "Byron is dead" [...] on a rock near his home in Somerby, declaring the [...] "world had darkened for him" [...] (McCarthy, 555). However, the admiration of Byron as a character led some fans <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> characteristics of <b>the</b> Byronic hero. Foremost was Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, who took the Byron cult to remarkable extremes. His marriage to Byron's granddaughter (McCarthy, 562), taking a [...] "Byron pilgrimage" [...] around the Continent and his anti-imperialist stance that saw him become an outcast just like his hero (McCarthy, 564) cemented his commitment [...] <b>to</b> <b>emulating</b> <b>the</b> Byronic character.|$|R
5|$|Edin's Hall Broch in Berwickshire is {{the best}} {{preserved}} southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar {{to some of the}} larger Orcadian broch villages {{it is unlikely that the}} tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, perhaps even the Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{earliest}} recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. <b>To</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{software}} programs of its kind, AveDesk is heavily community driven. A dedicated {{section of the}} forums on Aqua-Soft, an online community of skinning enthusiasts dedicated <b>to</b> <b>emulating</b> <b>the</b> {{look and feel of}} Mac OS X Leopard, is used by users of the software to report bugs or request for new software features directly to the programmer, cutting any red tape in the way. New features are also better discussed among the users of the software program and the programmer himself.|$|R
5|$|Henry {{believed}} that kings should rule England in a dignified manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual. He thought that his predecessors had allowed {{the status of}} the Crown to decline, and sought to correct this during his reign. The events of the civil war in Henry's youth deeply affected the King, and he adopted Edward the Confessor as his patron saint, hoping <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> way in which the Anglo-Saxon King had brought peace to England and reunited his people in order and harmony. Henry tried to use his royal authority leniently, hoping to appease the more hostile barons and maintain peace in England.|$|E
5|$|The Chartered Company's native commissioners {{began to}} fear a {{possible}} tribal rebellion during early 1915. Herbert Taylor, the chief native commissioner, believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> Chilembwe revolt in Nyasaland, {{and telling them}} (falsely) that the British were exterminating the natives there. There were few actual attempts to topple the administration in Southern Rhodesia, but the Company still took precautions. Aware that Mashona svikiro (spirit mediums) had been instrumental in inciting and leading insurgencies against Company rule during the late 1890s, the native commissioners enacted new legislation designed to imprison any svikiro who gained significant popularity.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda is {{considered}} a spiritual forerunner of the modern role-playing video game (RPG) genre. Though it is often not {{considered part of the}} genre since it lacked key RPG mechanics such as experience points, it had many features in common with RPGs and served as the template for the action role-playing game genre. The game's fantasy setting, musical style and action-adventure gameplay were adopted by many RPGs. Its commercial success helped lay the groundwork for involved, non-linear games in fantasy settings, such as those found in successful RPGs, including Crystalis, Soul Blazer, Square's Seiken Densetsu series, Alundra, and Brave Fencer Musashi. The popularity of the game also spawned several clones trying <b>to</b> <b>emulate</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
