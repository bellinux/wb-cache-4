5|$|In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began {{studies and}} tests on low {{visibility}} camouflage for ships. Some measures were deceptive, like a false painted bow wave <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of high speed at all times. Measures making cruisers resemble destroyers were discontinued after causing station-keeping confusion among ships operating in formation.|$|E
5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials. Wooden {{fences and}} gates, paths covered with locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look and feel to a cottage garden. Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes—everything is chosen <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of an old-fashioned country garden.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> {{that it did not}} have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E
50|$|Pasties are {{sometimes}} worn by erotic dancers or burlesque entertainers <b>to</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of toplessness while avoiding prosecution under local public indecency laws which prohibit {{exposure of the}} nipple and areola. To stay within the law, liquid latex pasties may be used. Pasties may be worn by neo-burlesque performers and are also found in night clubs, fetish parties and parades, such as Pride Parades.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual -- 1983" [...] <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> {{suggestion}} that interrogators show the prisoner letters from home <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> prisoner <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that <b>the</b> prisoner's relatives {{are in danger}} or suffering.|$|R
5000|$|See-through {{clothing}} is any garment of clothing made with lace, mesh or sheer fabric {{that allows the}} wearer's body or undergarments to be seen through its fabric. See-through fabrics were fashionable in Europe in the eighteenth century. There was a [...] "sheer fashion trend" [...] starting with designer clothing from 2008. See-through or sheer fabric, particularly in skintone (called [...] "nude") colours, is sometimes called illusion, as in 'illusion bodice' (or sleeve) due <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of exposed flesh.|$|R
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the building is clad in multi-coloured slate collected from Welsh slate quarries. Narrow windows are built into the layers of slate <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of rock; strata they depict the different stone layers in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the Penrhyn Quarry, the blue from Cwt y Bugail Quarry, the green from the Nantlle Valley, the grey from Llechwedd quarry, and the black from the Corris Quarry.|$|E
5|$|The missile silo {{used for}} the episode's climactic scene was {{incomplete}} when the scene was filmed, as the crew {{did not have enough}} time or money left to complete the set. The crew built the incomplete silo on a sound stage around a completed spacecraft prop, and were able to digitally extend the set with computer generated interiors <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a much larger silo. Exterior shots of the silo building were also enhanced digitally, with various buildings and machinery created with computer generated imagery and composited into the exterior shots.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: sleigh bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a fast winter's journey {{by means of the}} troika, a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close with a slow repetition of its final phrase.|$|E
50|$|The Xianfa Hua (线法画) was {{a display}} of {{perspective}} paintings of European landscapes. The paintings were arranged on seven pairs of symmetric walls <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> viewer <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> {{that he was actually}} looking out onto a European landscape. The display marks the eastern end of the Xiyang Lou complex.|$|R
50|$|On the ARD's Harald Schmidt show, Kerkeling {{explained}} his methods. Before a Schlämmer interview, he said, he pours {{a few drops}} of strong liquor over his coat, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> interviewee <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> he or she is being interviewed by a real reporter, but with an alcohol problem, prompting a real response.|$|R
50|$|There are {{historical}} {{reports of}} fleas {{glued to the}} base of the flea circus enclosure. Miniature musical instruments were then glued to the flea performers and the enclosure was heated. The fleas fought <b>to</b> escape, <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of playing instruments.|$|R
5|$|This new {{constructional}} technique allowed Gaudí {{to achieve}} his greatest architectural goal; to perfect and go beyond Gothic style. The hyperboloid vaults have their centre where Gothic vaults had their keystone, and the hyperboloid allows for a hole in this space to let natural light in. In the intersection between vaults, where Gothic vaults have ribs, the hyperboloid allows for holes as well, which Gaudí employed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a starry sky.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, Hitler {{returned}} to Munich. Without formal education or career prospects, {{he remained in}} the army. In July 1919 he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP). At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman Anton Drexler was impressed with Hitler's oratorical skills. He gave him {{a copy of his}} pamphlet My Political Awakening, which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party, and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> they were a much larger party).|$|E
5000|$|It {{is built}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> theatergoers <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> {{that they are}} sitting outside in the plaza of a colonial Spanish town, each wall {{features}} houses, staircases, and balconies, not painted on but built out from the walls.|$|R
50|$|In {{games and}} {{various kinds of}} {{adversarial}} settings, the term sandbagging refers {{to the practice of}} purposely placing oneself in a weaker position so as <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> deceptive <b>impression</b> that one is less skilled than one truly is.|$|R
25|$|The film Phantom of the Rue Morgue (1954) has {{an early}} scene {{featuring}} a knife throwing act. The movie was shot using a 3-D system, {{which was used}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> audiences <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that knives were flying at them.|$|R
5|$|After {{the attack}} on Yokosuka, the Nagatos crew removed all {{casualties}} from the ship and conducted limited repairs. Some of the ship's ballast tanks were also flooded <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> {{that she had been}} sunk. During the early hours of 2August Nagato was ordered to put to sea to intercept an Allied force. However, this sortie was canceled before she had completed preparations to leave port as the report of Allied ships was determined to be false. On 30August the ship was surrendered to the U.S.Navy. She was one of the target ships for the two atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll on 1 and 28July 1946 during Operation Crossroads, and sank there during the night of 29–30July.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him is a first-person narrative-based {{video game}} set around {{the death of}} a {{bisexual}} man named Will. The player controls four characters, each of whom was connected to Will during his lifetime. The characters consist of: Will, who dies in a car crash early in the game; Sarah, Will's ex-girlfriend; Harry, Will's boyfriend {{at the time of his}} death; and Mary, Will's grandmother. The gameplay has the player character walk around the world, with the player triggering snippets of narration by clicking on highlighted objects. When interacting with non-player characters, clicking on them will sometimes result in them disappearing and reappearing in a different location <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of them walking.|$|E
5|$|Freda {{felt that}} I Vampiri {{did not succeed}} financially in Italy due to the country's {{audience}} reluctance to an Italian interpretation of the horror genre. For Freda's next film, Caltiki – The Immortal Monster, he used an English pseudonym of Robert Hampton <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the film was not Italian. Freda attempted a gothic horror film again five years later with his film The Horrible Dr. Hichcock. Other crew members {{would go on to}} direct horror films following I Vampiri, such as screenwriter Piero Regnoli who directed The Playgirls and the Vampire (1960) and Bava who became the cinematographer on Freda's Caltiki as well as directing Black Sunday (1960).|$|E
50|$|Also, the GameKing II has a fixed color {{background}} picture for its LCD screen, only visible when the backlighting is switched on. This is probably <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> false <b>impression</b> {{of having a}} colour LCD screen, as implied on its box.|$|R
50|$|Pop's {{attractive}} daughter Lettie is {{attracted to}} Steve Atterbury, the piano player. Pop is leery {{and finds a}} letter indicating that Steve is already married with children. Steve is ambushed {{and put on a}} boat <b>to</b> Nome, <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that he has coldly left Lettie behind.|$|R
5000|$|An online video {{created by}} Ryan Steinhardt in 1998 {{combines}} clips from Barney and Friends with the 2Pac single [...] "Hit 'Em Up", designed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> viewer <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that Barney {{and the other}} characters from the show are rapping. The humor {{is based on the}} juxtaposition of the actual song's heavy use of profanity and violent content, as opposed to the regular lessons and content on Barney and Friends.|$|R
5|$|In August {{the brigade}} formed the divisional reserve located around Jericho. In September they moved forward {{to form the}} left (northern) flank of the Jordan Valley defences. At the same time, the brigade took command of the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment and the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers, which {{were part of a}} larger {{deception}} force commanded by the divisional commander, Chaytor. They were tasked with convincing the Turks that the next British attack would be from the Jordan Valley, while the forces were actually being realigned to attack in the west. The regiment was heavily involved in the deception, carrying out offensive patrolling, constructing dummy camps, and moving back and forwards behind the lines <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a much larger force than was actually present.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie {{would give}} him a global brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his way onto the ship, many in the crowd at the dock reached out to touch him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{it was not}} an easy {{introduction}} to the front for the New Zealanders. On arriving in their sector, they found the defensive arrangements to be poor and immediately set about improving the trenches and wire emplacements. Although the bulk of the division's personnel manned secondary defences rearward of the front line to avoid the German artillery, the forward areas had to be constantly patrolled as a deterrent to an attack and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> they were fully manned. The static nature of the war meant that the Divisional Mounted Troops, intended to be used as scouts, were redundant and, along with two Light Horse squadrons from the Australian infantry divisions, were soon transferred to a new formation designated 1st ANZAC Light Horse Regiment. In July, the New Zealand Division was transferred to the newly arrived II ANZAC Corps while I ANZAC moved south to the Somme.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Asian Forest, the African Savanna is also {{a result}} of the zoo's Master Plan of 1980. [...] Completed in 1987, this section of the zoo is modeled <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> viewer <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> {{that he or she is}} walking along a river in an African savanna. This section of the zoo {{contains}} lions, African bush elephants, giraffes, zebras, black rhinos, flamingos, ostrich, dama gazelle, and nyala.|$|R
50|$|However, since version {{numbers are}} human-generated, not computer-generated, {{there is nothing}} that {{prevents}} arbitrary changes that violate such guidelines: for example, the first sequence could be incremented between versions that differ by not even a single line of code, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> (false) <b>impression</b> that very significant changes were made.|$|R
5000|$|The bride {{price is}} often {{subject to the}} groom's family {{economic}} status. Most brides' families try <b>to</b> avoid <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of [...] "selling the daughter" [...] by not demanding a high bride price. In many southern wedding traditions, the bride price {{can be in the}} form of gold jewelry, fine fabric or money.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church was richly decorated. The walls were plastered and painted in white and maroon with geometric patterns and lines designed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of ashlar masonry. Architectural detail was also picked out in maroon. The floors were covered in polychrome encaustic tiles featuring foliage, heraldic beasts, and coats of arms including those of England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Eleanor of Castile, Richard of Cornwall and many powerful noble families. The chapels in the south transept had tiles with symbols of Edward the Confessor and the Virgin Mary. The windows of the church were filled with painted glass, six panels {{of which have been}} recovered. They show scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, the Crucifixion, monks, monsters and humorous animals.|$|E
5|$|The next {{months were}} spent {{training}} and refitting, until August when the brigade formed the divisional reserve located around Jericho. In September they moved forward {{to form the}} left (northern) flank of the Jordan Valley defences. At the same time, the regiment took command of the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment and the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers, which {{were part of a}} larger deception force commanded by the divisional commander, Chaytor. They were tasked with convincing the Turks that the next British attack would be from the Jordan Valley, while the forces were actually being realigned to attack in the west.

5|$|The opening scene, set at {{the closing}} {{ceremony}} of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, was filmed on location at Elland Road, home of Leeds United, and Odsal Stadium, home of Bradford RLFC. Elland Road {{was used for the}} speech elements of the prince stammering his way through his first public address, and Odsal Stadium was selected because of the resemblance of its curved ends to Wembley Stadium in 1925. The crew had access to the stadium only at 10pm, after a football game. They filled the terraces with inflatable dummies and over 250 extras dressed in period costumes. Live actors were interspersed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a crowd. Additional people, as well as more ranks of soldiers on the pitch, were added in post-production with visual effects.|$|E
5000|$|From 1 February 2013, {{the club}} has adopted the new name as [...] "Thespakusatsu Gunma", <b>to</b> <b>give</b> out <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of <b>the</b> club as {{representative}} of entire Gunma Prefecture, while still leaving the name of [...] "Kusatsu" [...] in it, {{as well as the}} logo of the club as is.|$|R
50|$|The {{best known}} fictional {{representation}} of the Emperor Claudius were the books I, Claudius and Claudius the God (published in 1934 and 1935) by Robert Graves, both written in <b>the</b> first-person <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> reader <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that they are Claudius' autobiography. Graves employed a fictive artifice {{to suggest that they}} were recently discovered, genuine translations of Claudius' writings. Claudius' extant letters, speeches, and sayings were incorporated into the text (mostly in the second book, Claudius the God), to add authenticity.|$|R
5000|$|Aropaoanui is a Māori word which roughly {{translates}} to 'big smoke'. In local myth, {{the area was}} named when the local tribe were roasting their captives on a fire after a victory in battle. The fatty pulp around the kidneys of their victims began <b>to</b> bubble, <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that <b>the</b> victims were still alive, which terrified the tribespeople.|$|R
