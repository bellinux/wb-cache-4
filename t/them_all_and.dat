Eric arrives, and Sigmund greets him, tells him that he is welcome to come into the hall, and asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name of <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> that he, himself, is the sixth.|$|E
5|$|While Shakespeare's {{daffodil}} is {{the wild}} or true English daffodil (N. pseudonarcissus), many other species were introduced, {{some of which}} escaped and naturalised, particularly N. biflorus (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England. Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated ("bastard daffodils") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597), ("we have <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> {{every one of them}} in our London gardens, in great abundance", p.114).|$|E
5|$|Yerkes' final {{purchase}} was the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS) in March 1902 for £360,000 (£ today). The BS had {{permission to}} construct a line from Paddington to Elephant & Castle and, unlike his other tube railway purchases, construction work had started in 1898. Substantial progress had been made before it was stopped following {{the collapse of the}} BS's parent company, the London & Globe Finance Corporation, due to the fraud of its managing director Whitaker Wright in 1900. With a varied collection of companies under his control, Yerkes established the UERL in April 1902 to take control of <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> manage the planned works, and took the position of chairman. On 8 June 1902, the UERL took over the MDETC and paid off the company's shareholders with cash and UERL shares.|$|E

5|$|At 8:30am on 24 August, Milne Bay GHQ was alerted by an RAAF Hudson bomber near Kitava Island, off the Trobriand Islands, and coastwatchers that a Japanese convoy was {{approaching}} the Milne Bay area. – escorting the transport SS Tasman– left the Milne Bay area and sailed for Port Moresby after {{learning of the}} invasion force. Reports of the second Japanese convoy, consisting of seven barges, which had sailed from Buna carrying the force that would land at Taupota were also received at this time. In response to this sighting, after the initially poor weather had cleared, 12 RAAF Kittyhawks were scrambled at midday. The barges were spotted beached near Goodenough Island where the 350 troops of the 5th Sasebo SNLF, led by Commander Tsukioka, had gone ashore to rest. The Australian pilots then proceeded to strafe the barges and, {{over the course of}} two hours, destroyed <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> stranded their former occupants.|$|E
5|$|Still {{carrying}} a grudge against Robbit, Aloha seeks Kabuki and convinces him {{to form an}} alliance {{so that they can}} destroy Robbit together. In exchange, Aloha will pay Kabuki a large amount of money, and Kabuki, also desiring revenge against Robbit, agrees. Aloha and Kabuki attack Little Muu together, prompting Robbit to take action again. Eventually, Robbit and Kabuki battle each other one last time, and Robbit manages to destroy Kabuki once and for all while Aloha flees for his life once again. At the end of the game, Aloha returns to Little Muu, but is disowned by all the Muu Muus, who now resent him for teaming with Kabuki (who had tried to destroy <b>them</b> <b>all)</b> <b>and</b> trying to destroy Robbit, who had saved their lives. They throw him out of the bar and tell him to never come back.|$|E

Castellari's Kill <b>Them</b> <b>All</b> <b>and</b> Come Back Alone and One Dollar Too Many, Sergio Sollima's Run, Man, Run and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, to be showcased in Patrick Morin's made-for-television documentary Western, Italian Style. During the making of the film, Corbucci and Trintignant were interviewed; Corbucci discussed the nature of violence in his films and Spaghetti Westerns in general (comparing the use of violence in such films to the James Bond franchise), while Trintignant spoke of the unusual nature of his role and how he would practice drawing his gun – by pulling a sock (substituting for the gloves Silence wears in the film) off his hand and reaching for a long-steamed artichoke in his pocket.|$|E

Doom's origin was also a feature in Astonishing Tales when his ties to the villain Mephisto were revealed.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 1920s the Lavra was a {{peaceful}} place and repaired many of its damaged buildings. It was the first complete monastery to have its own electricity. In 1929 after the Polish Republican decree on the protection of Ruthenians ceased the Roman Catholic Church immediately began to exploit this. The Lavra received more than a hundred accusations against it and demanding the Orthodox to transfer the cloister. Despite numerous allegations, the Lavra survived <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> in process once again became the most visible Orthodox centre in the Second Polish Republic.|$|E

25|$|Sechele was no {{different}} from any other man of his tribe in believing in polygamy. He had five wives, and when Livingstone told him to get rid of four of them, it shook the foundations of the Kwena tribe. After he finally divorced the women, Livingstone baptised <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> everything went well. However, one year later one of his ex-wives became pregnant and Sechele was the father. Sechele begged Livingstone to not give up on him because his faith was still strong, but Livingstone left the country and went north to continue his Christianizing attempts.|$|E
25|$|Montoya got the {{opportunity}} to advance in his motor racing career when {{he was hired by}} the RSM Marko team to compete alongside Craig Lowndes in the 1997 International Formula 3000 season.

He finished his rookie season second in the championship points standings, just 1.5 points shy of taking the overall season title. During this time, Williams noticed his potential and invited him to test with the team at Jerez, Spain along with three other drivers. Montoya was the fastest of <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> he and Max Wilson were signed by WilliamsF1 to be test drivers for the following season.|$|E
25|$|Sennacherib {{was assassinated}} in obscure {{circumstances}} in 681BCE. An inscription by Sennacherib's successor, Esarhaddon, describes how Esarhaddon heard that his brothers were fighting {{in the streets of}} Nineveh, hurried back from the Western provinces with an army, defeated <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> took the throne. The inscription does not mention that the brothers were fighting because one of them had just murdered Sennacherib, but this is indicated in the Babylonian chronicles, the Bible (Isaiah 37:36-38, Tobit 1:21), and in later Assyrian records. Esarhaddon's silence {{on the subject of the}} name of his father's murderer may have been to avoid perpetuating any perceptions of instability. To one Babylonian historian, it was divine punishment for what the king had done to Babylon.|$|E
