5|$|In March and April 1991, Serbs in Croatia {{began to}} make moves to secede from that territory. It {{is a matter of}} debate to what extent <b>this</b> <b>move</b> was locally {{motivated}} and to what degree the Milošević-led Serbian government was involved. In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed <b>this</b> <b>move</b> as a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{reports that}} Jack Warner had banned {{the use of}} the German {{language}} throughout the company's studios were denied by studio representatives who indicated that <b>this</b> <b>move</b> would have prevented scores of studio employees from communicating with each other.|$|E
5|$|After it {{was clear}} that Austria-Hungary had lost World War I, the Austrian {{government}} decided to give Viribus Unitis, along with much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, to Yugoslavia, the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. <b>This</b> <b>move</b> would have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies, since the new state had declared neutrality. Following the transfer, she was renamed Yugoslavia.|$|E

5|$|After it {{was clear}} that Austria-Hungary had lost World War I, the Austrian {{government}} decided to give the ship, along with much of the fleet, to the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. <b>This</b> <b>move</b> would have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies, since the new state had declared neutrality. Following the transfer of Viribus Unitis to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, she was renamed Jugoslavija.|$|E
5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. <b>This</b> <b>move</b> would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had butter in a week.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it {{differed from the}} rest of the Eastern Bloc because it was established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of <b>this</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E
50|$|In modern times, Wolfratshausen was {{formerly}} {{the seat of}} the district government, but <b>this</b> <b>moved</b> to Bad Tölz in 1972.|$|R

50|$|When a {{nerve impulse}} arrives, Ca2+ ions cause {{troponin}} to change shape; <b>this</b> <b>moves</b> the troponin + tropomyosin complex away, leaving the myosin binding sites open.|$|R
5|$|After the {{successful}} {{invasion of the}} Sassanid Persian province of Iraq, Caliph Abu Bakr sent an expedition to invade the Levant (Roman Syria). The invasion was {{to be carried out}} by four corps, each with its own assigned targets. The Byzantines responded to this threat by concentrating their units at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. <b>This</b> <b>move</b> tied down the Muslim troops at border regions, as with this large force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E
5|$|Akizzi {{contacted}} Egypt {{and declared}} himself a servant to the pharaoh. An anti-Hittite coalition, probably organized by Akizzi, was established. Šuppiluliuma tried diplomatic means {{to solve the}} conflict but Akizzi rejected them. Hittite military intervention soon followed and Akizzi asked Egypt for troops, but received none. Šuppiluliuma himself came to Qatna, aided by Aziru of Amurru. The Hittite monarch took with him a statue of the sun deity, which {{had been given to}} Qatna by an ancestor of Akhenaten. <b>This</b> <b>move</b> symbolized the final capitulation of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While <b>this</b> <b>move</b> protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was {{not so long ago}} that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E

5|$|As {{his term}} neared expiration, Laffoon removed Ben Johnson {{from his post}} as highway commissioner, {{replacing}} him with Tom Rhea. <b>This</b> <b>move</b> was made in order to groom Rhea {{to be the next}} governor. Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea, the Democratic Party again chose a nominating convention in lieu of a primary to choose their gubernatorial candidate. Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county political organizations, a convention would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee. The convention was scheduled for May 14, 1935 in Lexington.|$|E
5|$|Brazil revoked its {{neutrality}} in the {{war between}} the United States and Germany on 1 June 1917, but did not declare war. At the same time, all German merchant ships interned in Brazilian harbors, 45 in all, were boarded and seized; most were unusable due to neglect or sabotage. On 28 June, Brazil revoked its neutrality between all of the Allied and Central Powers but again stopped short of declaring war; <b>this</b> <b>move</b> allowed Brazilian merchantmen to travel in Allied convoys.|$|E
5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, {{that is to}} say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where the river was the easiest to ford, and at one moment, Tigranes believed that <b>this</b> <b>move</b> meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.|$|E
50|$|The {{workers were}} interviewed on The Late Late Show on 6 January 2012. Christy Moore later said that {{watching}} <b>this</b> <b>moved</b> him {{to perform a}} show in solidarity with the workers.|$|R

5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a destabiliser of regimes, Houphouët-Boigny granted refuge to Jean-Bédel Bokassa, after the exiled Central African Republic dictator had been overthrown by French paratroopers in September 1979. <b>This</b> <b>move</b> was met with international criticism, and thus, having become a political and financial burden to Houphouët-Boigny, Bokassa was expelled from Côte d'Ivoire in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>this</b> <b>move,</b> {{disputes}} {{regarding the}} shape of land reform continued inside the Government. On July 21, 1848, Nicolae Bălcescu obtained the issuing of a decree to create Comisia proprietății (the Commission on Property), comprising 34 delegates, two for each Wallachian county, representing respectively peasants and landlords. The new institution was presided over by the landowner Alexandru Racoviță, and had the Moldavian-born Ion Ionescu de la Brad for its vice president.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has {{an eccentric}} option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must {{decide whether or not}} to play 6.e4. Although <b>this</b> <b>move</b> gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target for the time being by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E
50|$|Woolmanhill Hospital was the {{original}} Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, before <b>this</b> <b>moved</b> to the Foresterhill site. The original hospital building on the site was begun in 1740. Designed by William Christall, it opened in 1749.|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} these changes was to combine the {{southern}} part of the old Central, with the former Balham and Tooting. <b>This</b> <b>moved</b> the boundaries of this constituency south and east from those in the previous distribution.|$|R
5|$|For this thirteenth season, Seven {{chose to}} move Blue Heelers from its Wednesday-night, primetime timeslot, {{which it had}} {{occupied}} for 10 years, to the lower-rated Saturday-night timeslot, which also saw it up against popular British police programme The Bill; <b>this</b> <b>move</b> was slammed by cast member John Wood. Ratings for this season were generally low; no episode ranked in OzTAM's top 20 programme list for the week.|$|E
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are generally {{conducted on the}} second and fourth Mondays of the month. In {{the case of a}} tie, the mayor has the casting vote. Mayors of Lincolnshire can veto propositions set forth by the board of trustees, although <b>this</b> <b>move</b> may be overridden by a two-thirds opposition vote from the board.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against <b>this</b> <b>move,</b> but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E
50|$|After {{the race}} was over, Jef Demuysere {{received}} 25 minutes penalty time in the general classification because he had taken drinks where this was not allowed. <b>This</b> <b>moved</b> him from the {{second place in the}} general classification to the third place.|$|R
50|$|Mid-Michigan won the PDL Regular Season {{title and}} a bye to the National Semi-Finals. <b>This</b> <b>moved</b> Dayton {{up to the}} Great Lakes Division first place spot and allowed West Michigan into the playoffs, taking the second place spot for the division.|$|R
