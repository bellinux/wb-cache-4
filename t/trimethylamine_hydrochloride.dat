30|$|Brown {{composite}} spheres (2  g) were dispersed in 250 -ml {{mixture of}} ethanol and water (volume ratio[*]=[*] 2 : 1). Then, 2  g of <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and 1  g of sodium hydroxide {{were added to}} the mixture solution. After the resulting mixture was stirred in water bath at 50 °C for 24  h, the resulting TMA-treated magnetic P(GMA-EGDMA) composite microspheres were filtrated and washed repeatedly with distilled water. The brown functionalized magnetic polymer composite microspheres were dried at 50 °C under vacuum.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{synthetic}} food attractant lures for Tephritid fruit fly trapping is presently being incorporated into U. S. {{state and federal}} detection programs. These lures consist of ammonium acetate, <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and putrescine contained in individual packages that {{are attached to the}} inside (top) of plastic McPhail-type traps. Two chemical packets are placed in the traps for Anastrepha spp., where as three are attached for Ceratitis capitata. This report presents data on trap captures of the above species comparing the current (individually packaged) baits with a novel dispenser containing either two or three components into a single matrix. Tests were conducted in Florida and Hawaii using hand release of sterile Caribbean fruit fly (Caribfly), Anastrepha suspensa and the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (medfly) / aerially released medfly/ and wild caribfly populations (Florida) and wild medfly (Hawaii). Observations in the Florida study indicated that minor formulation adjustment should increase the efficacy of the Anastrepha attractant, whereas less of an adjustment may be required to capture Ceratitis capitata. Results in open field tests in Hawaii indicated that the three-component synthetic food attractant in a single cone unit was just as effective in capturing wild male and female Medflies as the same food attractants in individual packets. The single matrix has some advantages in handling and ease-of-use, especially with the Multilure trap...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (TMA) {{injected}} intravenously accelerated {{flow of the}} thoracic-duct lymph in a dog in doses above 25 mg. /kg. The {{effect of}} 50 mg. /kg. of TMA was comparable to that produced by about 0. 05 mg. /kg. of adrenaline. The thoracic-duct lymph increased by TMA was rich in protein concentration and showed tendency for facile coagulation, as lymph accelerated by adrenaline. A small amount of TMA decreased arterial blood pressure but in a dose effective to lymph flow, the blood pressure increased markedly after a transitory fall, with an attendant rise of portal blood pressure. In such a dose, decrease in {{the volume of the}} liver and intestines was observed. Except for the initial fall of arterial blood pressure, these actions were the same as those caused by adrenaline. Atropine suppressed not only the lymphagogic action but also the rise of arterial and portal blood pressure by TMA. Similar suppressive action was also observed under the action of TEA or hexamethonium. Dibenamine strongly suppressed the rise of arterial blood pressure by adrenaline and by TMA but its suppression was incomplete against the rise of portal blood pressure and lymphagogic action. In adrenalectomized dog, the lymphagogic action and rise of arterial and portal blood pressure by TMA did not appear at all. These observations indicate that the acceleration of thoracic-duct lymph flow by TMA is mediated by the liberation of epinephrine from the adrenals in the dog...|$|E
50|$|Campylobacter lari (formerly Campylobacter laridis) is {{a species}} of nalidixic acid-resistant, thermophilic, microaerophilic {{bacteria}} first isolated from human faeces. It shows anaerobic growth {{in the presence of}} <b>trimethylamine</b> N-oxide <b>hydrochloride.</b> Its type strain is NCTC 11352. It is commonly found in sea gulls. In humans, it has been involved in cases of enteritis, severe abdominal pain and terminal bacteremia.|$|R

The template polymer microspheres are a polymer of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) cross-linked with {{ethylene glycol dimethacrylate}} (EGDMA) supplied by Nano-Micro Technology Company (Jiangsu, China). Ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl 3 [*]·[*] 6 H 2 O), sodium oleate, <b>trimethylamine</b> (TMA) <b>hydrochloride,</b> sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide (28 % aqueous solution), and ethanol were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Corp. (Shanghai, China). Hexanes, chloroform, sodium borohydride (NaBH 4), 4 -nitrophenol (4 -NP), and 1 -octadecene were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Anhydrous alcohol and chloroauric acid tetrahydrate (HAuCl 4 [*]·[*] 4 H 2 O) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) Water was purified by distillation followed by deionization using ion exchange resins. Other chemicals were of analytical grade and used without any further purification.|$|R
40|$|The name "Campylobacter hyointestinalis" sp. nov. is {{proposed}} for a Campylobacter species that was {{isolated from the}} intestines of pigs with proliferative enteritis. "C. hyointestinalis" {{is also found in}} the feces of cattle and has been isolated from the intestine of a hamster. "C. hyointestinalis" is distinguished from previously described catalase-positive Campylobacter species by colony morphology, ability to produce H 2 S in triple sugar iron agar, ability to grow anaerobically in 0. 1 % <b>trimethylamine</b> N-oxide <b>hydrochloride,</b> resistance to nalidixic acid, susceptibility to cephalothin and metronidazole, and hydrogenase activity. Sixteen "C. hyointestinalis" strains were highly related (greater than or equal to 76 %) by DNA-DNA hybridization (hydroxyapatite method, 50 and 65 degrees C). Other Campylobacter species were {{less than or equal to}} 30 % related to "C. hyointestinalis. " The type strain of "C. hyointestinalis" is designated 80 - 4577 - 4 (= ATCC 35217), and its DNA has a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 36 mol%...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to create a bi-layered packed bed {{chromatography}} support for the purification of nano-sized bioproducts. The effect of three different chemistry approaches, different solvent conditions, and microwave heating were investigated on construction of a bi-layered support. Sepharose CL- 6 B was activated with allyl glycidyl ether (routes 1 & 2). The inert outer layer was created in route 1 by reacting bromine with the allyl groups at the surface, followed by the addition of sodium hydroxide. Creation of the outer layer in route 2 was achieved by oxidation of surface groups with potassium permanganate. In both synthesises the allyl groups remaining were reacted with bromine and a charged amine ligand was coupled to the inner core. The activation step of route 3 resulted in the introduction of three membered epoxide groups throughout the support. Surface groups were reacted with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Finally a charged amine ligand was coupled to the support by reacting <b>trimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> with the remaining epoxide groups. Supports created by route 1 eliminated 91 % of plasmid DNA binding whilst maintaining a high protein binding capacity. This was achieved by using DMS 0 as the solvent in the bromination step and employing microwave heating. Route 2 proved to be the least successful in creating a bi-layered support. The beads created under hydrochloric acid-methanol conditions (route 3) reduced 91 % of the plasmid DNA binding whilst maintaining a high protein binding capacity. This study revealed that microwave heating was a useful tool in the synthesis of chromatography supports. Subsequently, a comprehensive study was untaken investigating the effects of microwaves on numerous chromatography matrices. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
