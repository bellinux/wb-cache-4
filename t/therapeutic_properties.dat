5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The <b>therapeutic</b> <b>properties</b> of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} {{is caused by}} the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Here we show that administration of a human monoclonal antibody (b 96 · 11) specific to the 65 -kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD 65) to prediabetic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice significantly delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes. We found this effect to be epitope-specific, as only b 96 · 11 showed this <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property,</b> while a GAD 65 -specific human monoclonal control antibody (b 78) derived from the same patient, but specific to a different determinant of GAD 65, had no significant effect on the progression of disease. Administration of b 96 · 11 or b 78 to NOD mice was accompanied by the generation of anti-idiotypic antibodies. Importantly, the induced anti-idiotypic antibodies were specific for the immunizing antibody and blocked the binding of GAD 65 by the respective antibody. These findings suggest a potential role for the internal image of the GAD 65 determinant recognized by b 96 · 11 in the anti-idiotypic antibody, supporting an immunomodulatory role for GAD 65 -specific autoantibodies, as originally postulated by Jerne...|$|R
40|$|The {{platelet}} inhibitory {{effects of}} the nitric oxide (NO) donor drug MAHMA NONOate ((Z- 1 -{N-methyl-N-[6 -(N-methylammoniohexyl) amino] diazen- 1 -ium- 1, 2 -diolate) were examined in anaesthetised rats and {{compared with those of}} S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO; an S-nitrosothiol). Bolus administration of the aggregating agent ADP dose-dependently reduced the number of circulating free platelets. Intravenous infusions of MAHMA NONOate (3 - 30 nmol/kg/min) dose-dependently inhibited the effect of 0. 3 mumol/kg ADP. MAHMA NONOate was approximately 10 -fold more potent than GSNO. MAHMA NONOate (0. 3 - 10 nmol/kg/min) also reduced systemic artery pressure and was again 10 -fold more potent than GSNO. Thus MAHMA NONOate has both platelet inhibitory and vasodepressor effects in vivo. The dose ranges for these two effects overlapped, although blood pressure was affected at slightly lower doses. The platelet inhibitory effects compared favourably with those of GSNO, even though NONOates generate free radical NO which, in theory, could have been scavenged by haemoglobin. Therefore platelet inhibition may be a useful <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property</b> of NONOates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The study {{aimed to}} explore the {{antioxidant}} activity of ethanolic leaf extract of Manihot esculenta Crantz leaves (MEC) in wistar rats. Materials and Methods: Ethanolic extract of MEC leaves in the doses of 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg were used in wistar rats of either sex. The oxidative stress was produced by overdose of acetaminophen and estimation of serum concentration of various enzymes such as malonaldehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT) were measured by standard biochemical methods. Silymarin (100 mg/kg) {{was used as a}} standard drug for assessment of antioxidant status. Statistical Analysis Used: Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's unpaired t-test. Results: When compared with the standard antioxidant silymarin, MEC extract did not exhibit antioxidant activity in terms of MDA level reduction. However, it significantly increased serum levels of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH, and CAT) exerting a potent antioxidant effect in a graded manner. Conclusions: The observed results suggest that MEC could be a potential source of antioxidants.

Unlike certain lower animals such as amphibians, fishes, and birds, in humans, hair cells cannot be regenerated once they are killed or damaged; thus, there are no therapeutic options to cure NIHL.

In this study, we report the protective effect of Yang Mi Ryung extract (YMRE) against NIHL; this novel <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property</b> of YMRE has not been reported previously. Our data demonstrates that the hearing ability damaged by noise is markedly restored in mice preadministrated with YMRE before noise exposure, to the level of normal control group. Our study also provides the molecular mechanism underlying the protective effect of YMRE against NIHL by showing that YMRE significantly blocks noise-induced apoptotic cell death and reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cochleae. Moreover, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis demonstrates that YMRE has anti-inflammatory properties, suppressing the mRNA levels of TNFα and IL- 1 β induced by noise exposure. In conclusion, YMRE could be a useful preventive intervention to prevent hearing impairment induced by the exposure to excessive noise...|$|R
