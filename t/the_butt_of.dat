5|$|Janet Slatt (Geraldine Fitzgerald) is Eric's {{wife and}} the school's secretary. She has an {{antagonistic}} relationship with Eric, with each regularly <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> the other's jokes. For instance, Eric suggests one morning {{that she had not}} shaved, and that she should rest her hind legs.|$|E
5|$|Stela 2 {{was found}} in centre of the West Plaza. <b>The</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> this stela {{was found in}} its {{original}} location, although the shaft has broken and fallen backwards. Stela 2 {{does not appear to}} have had any sculpted designs or text. It was associated with Altar 1.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
60|$|Still {{the canoe}} lingered. The dandy's toe strayed privily to feel out <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sniders under the green leaves, and Ishikola was loth to depart.|$|R

6000|$|They cheered, and {{hammered}} on {{the table}} with <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> their knife-handles. Lindau remained seated. The tears came into his eyes; he said, [...] "I thank you, chendlemen," [...] and hiccoughed.|$|R
5|$|By 1899, Waterloo had 16 {{platforms}} {{but only}} 10 numbers allocated in different {{sections of the}} station or on different levels; some numbers were duplicated. This complexity and confusion became <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> jokes by writers and music hall comics {{for many years in}} the late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men in a Boat. It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E
5|$|The {{archipelago}} {{is exposed}} to wind and tide, and lighthouses are sited {{as an aid to}} navigation at locations from Barra Head in the south to <b>the</b> <b>Butt</b> <b>of</b> Lewis in the north. There are numerous sites of wrecked ships, and the Flannan Isles are the location of an enduring mystery that occurred in December 1900, when all three lighthouse keepers vanished without trace.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{initially}} {{estimated that}} they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees. Orde-Lees was not a popular man, and his presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> their jokes.|$|E
60|$|Thundering with <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> three clubbed handspikes on the {{forecastle}} deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers {{with such}} judgment claps {{that they seemed}} to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands.|$|R
6000|$|... “I half {{expected}} it,” the mate went on, after examining her; “the shock has started <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> three planks on one side, and {{two on the}} other. We will get the sand out first and turn her over, bottom upwards.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Salter {{pointed to}} the foot of the rock they stood upon. [...] "I {{reckoned}} if we could put a shot in yonder, we might cut out stone enough to clear <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger logs that are keying up the jamb." ...|$|R
5|$|On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day {{celebrating the}} end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with {{supplies}} for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past {{the end of}} their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. One man was hit about the head with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> a pistol and the dissenters were dispersed into small groups and reassigned to various units in the infantry division; the 52nd (Lowland) Division.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} skilled nature {{required}} for playing the agung, {{it is not uncommon}} to see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance, using tricks in an attempt to throw others off-beat. For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals has a hard time ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed, becoming <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> jokes. Normally agung players switch off after each piece, but during instances like this where one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody, employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.|$|E
5|$|By 8:30 am {{a request}} went out {{summoning}} all available tugs {{to the site}} of the grounding with the hope that they would be able to free the leviathan before any further damage occurred. An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the grounding met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats. Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound her problem she had run aground during an unusually high tide. To add insult to injury, she had become <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's grounding as material for the naval publication Red Fleet.|$|E
60|$|Striking with {{clubs and}} <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> guns, Smoke's party drove back the attacking dogs, while his own dogs, {{snapping}} and snarling, awed {{by so many}} enemies, shrank in among the legs of their human protectors, and bristled along stiff-legged in menacing prance.|$|R
5000|$|The Telegraph {{called it}} [...] "vigorous, grimly {{absorbing}} tale", while The Observer′s reviewer concluded: [...] "Roffeys writing is raw and visceral and she thrusts her readers headlong {{into the very}} middle of the action, her pen as powerful as <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guns shoved in her hostages backs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ali Muamar, {{father of}} the two men detained, Osama Muamar and Mustafa Muamar, stated [...] "They blindfolded and handcuffed me and started beating me up with <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> their rifles and kicking me". He stated that a {{computer}} was taken and that the whole incident lasted for about an hour.|$|R
5|$|The {{effect of}} the mirror flaw on {{scientific}} observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out of focus halo severely reduced {{the usefulness of the}} telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during {{the first three years of}} the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E
5|$|Traction trebuchet: The {{earliest}} type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed {{first in}} China by the 5th or 4th century BC, {{the beginning of}} the Warring States period (403–221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> the shorter segment of a long wooden beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and counterweight trebuchet, employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Northern Europe; by the 12th century, the full-fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the Ayyubid dynasty of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi) and used in the Third Crusade; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet found its way into Song Dynasty (960–1279) China via the Mongol invaders under Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) who used it in the Siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273).|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some of the}} {{existing}} teams, Forti was able to test its chassis extensively {{prior to the start}} of the season. However, Diniz proved to be around seven seconds per lap off the pace of the leading runners in group testing at the Estoril circuit in March, indicating that the team was likely to be mired at the back of the field. Diniz finished 10th in the season-opening Brazilian GP, but was seven laps down on winner Michael Schumacher. In Argentina, this situation became worse, as, although both drivers finished, they were both nine laps down on winner Damon Hill at the end of the race (with Diniz ahead) and neither were classified, as they had failed to complete 90% of the race distance. The drivers' similar fastest laps during the race were over ten seconds slower than Schumacher's fastest race lap, and almost five seconds slower than the next slowest runner's fastest lap (Domenico Schiattarella in the Simtek). Imola was similarly poor, as both drivers finished seven laps down (with Diniz again ahead) and again failed to reach the 90% threshold for classification. Forti was already <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> paddock jokes, and were far slower than the other (and financially poorer) backmarkers: Pacific, Simtek, and Minardi. However, the budget enabled improvements to be made to the car. During the season, its weight was reduced by a significant 60 kilograms (approximately 10% of the F1 minimum weight limit of 595kg), and a semi-automatic gearbox, an airbox and redesigns of the front wing, sidepods and monocoque were introduced. The personnel count also doubled during the course of the season. This resulted in a gradual improvement in pace throughout the year, and there were no more non-classified finishes.|$|E
60|$|A {{crowd of}} castle people, all {{very serious and}} quiet, were {{gathered}} in the hall, where a number of strange men-at-arms lounged upon the benches, while two billmen in steel caps and leathern jacks stood guarding the great door, <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> their weapons resting upon the ground, and the staves crossed, barring the door-way.|$|R
60|$|I waited {{till they}} came on board, and then {{turning to the}} men on the forecastle, I told them they should go on board the boats immediately, as soon as <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> water were hoisted in. They still said, One and all, they were ready, desired they might go and fetch their clothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Smooth as a whetstone, {{straight}} as an arrow," [...] meaning the cliff. Perhaps {{because of their}} pictorial descent, the characters did not shock one. Unlike the usual branding of nature, they seemed not out of keeping with the spot. Not far beyond, <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> winter's neve, buried in dirt, banked the path.|$|R
25|$|Also, {{the melee}} attack {{is not a}} knife slash or stab like in the PS3/Xbox 360 versions, but simply a hit from <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> the gun.|$|E
25|$|Louis C.K. had Gervais play Dr. Ben, {{his doctor}} on two episodes of his series Louie. Gervais would break into his {{trademark}} hysterical laugh every time his character made Louie <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> a joke.|$|E
25|$|Convoy ON 19 {{departed}} from Liverpool on 21 September 1941 and from Loch Ewe on 23 September. It dispersed at sea on 7 October. Empire Cabot was in ballast and was bound for Tampa, Florida. She {{lost contact with}} the convoy at around 01:00 on 24 September off <b>the</b> <b>Butt</b> <b>of</b> Lewis. She returned to Loch Ewe to await the next convoy.|$|E
50|$|At the Battle of Inkerman, the 33rd {{were again}} {{involved}} in some bitter fighting, in which the British infantry advanced despite heavy losses and a strong defence by the Russians. The fighting was fierce, at times some soldiers resorting to attacking their enemy with <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> their guns. <b>The</b> 33rd suffered further casualties: 3 officers and 61 men.|$|R
60|$|Mildred pushed again, {{straining}} every muscle. Then {{she bent}} {{and examined the}} wall. It was easy to see, from this side, where the series of three blocks were firmly joined together. Also <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> three huge iron hinges protruded slightly into the passage. There could be no mistake. The closing of the door had made them prisoners.|$|R
60|$|Jack Morris nervously struck Harry a blow in {{the side}} with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> end <b>of</b> his whip. Lord March laughed.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of his political career, Estrada has been <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> many jokes in the Philippines. The majority of the jokes about him center around his limited English vocabulary, while others focus on his corruption scandals. During his presidential campaign in 1998, Estrada authorized the distribution of the joke compilation book ERAPtion: How to Speak English Without Really Trial.|$|E
25|$|The {{profile of}} African-Caribbean actors on television, such as Lennie James, Judith Jacob and Diane Parish, has widened {{substantially}} since 1970s {{shows such as}} Love Thy Neighbour (Rudolph Walker) and Rising Damp (Don Warrington) when their role was often to act simply as either <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of,</b> or foil to, racist jokes by white characters. The most influential programme in moving away from this formula was the 1989–94 Channel Four barbershop sitcom Desmond's, starring Norman Beaton and Carmen Munroe.|$|E
25|$|Although burlesque on the surface, the novel, {{especially}} {{in its second}} half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works by Pablo Picasso and Richard Strauss. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat, squat, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.|$|E
60|$|The cabman, {{knocking}} with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> end <b>of</b> his whip {{upon the}} window, reminded {{her that he}} was in a similar predicament.|$|R
60|$|But {{the hogs}} {{were not to}} be managed as easily as the goats and fowls had been. With native obstinacy and amazing energy they refused to do what they were bid, and shrieked {{defiance}} when force was attempted. The noise was further increased by <b>the</b> <b>butting</b> <b>of</b> a few goats and the cackling of some poultry, which had got mixed up with them.|$|R
60|$|With {{magnificent}} bound Stewart {{was upon}} him. The guerrilla's cry was throttled in his throat. A fierce wrestling ensued, too swift to see clearly; then heavy, sodden blows, and Don Carlos was beaten to the ground. Stewart leaped back. Then, crouching {{with his hands}} on <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> guns at his hips, he yelled, he thundered at the guerrillas. He had been quicker than a panther, and now his voice was so terrible that it curdled Madeline's blood, and the menace of deadly violence in his crouching position made her shut her eyes. But she had to open them. In that single instant Nels and Monty had leaped to Stewart's side. Both were bent down, with hands on <b>the</b> <b>butts</b> <b>of</b> guns at their hips. Nels's piercing yell seemed to divide Monty's roar of rage. Then they ceased, and echoes clapped from the crags. The silence of those three men crouching like tigers about to leap was more menacing than the nerve-racking yells.|$|R
