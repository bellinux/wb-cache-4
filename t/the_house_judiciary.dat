5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious.

He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>Judiciary</b> committee, chaired by Emanuel Cellerâ€”who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision.

Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E
