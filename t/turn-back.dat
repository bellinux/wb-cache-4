25|$|Snap waist/back : Two-piece {{sleepers}} sometimes fasten {{around the}} waist with snap fasteners. This is most often seen on so-called grow sleepers, made mainly in toddler sizes, with features designed to extend the useful life of the garment by compensating for growth in the wearer. These are usually made in lighter material than one-piece sleepers, with an especially high waist, two rows of snaps on the top piece, a back opening on the top piece also closing with snaps, and <b>turn-back</b> cuffs.|$|E

50|$|Around 1450, {{the dress}} of {{northern}} Europe developed a low V-neck {{that showed a}} glimpse of the square-necked kirtle. The neckline could be filled in with a sheer linen partlet. Wide <b>turn-backs</b> like revers displayed a contrasting lining, frequently of fur or black velvet, and the sleeves might be cuffed to match. Sleeves were very long, covering half of the hand, and often highly decorated with embroidery. Fine sleeves were often transferred from one dress to another. The term robe déguisée was coined in the mid-1400s to describe garments reflecting the very latest fashions, a term which endured into the 16th century.|$|R
25|$|During the mid 17th century, {{the older}} doublets, ruffs, paned hose, and jerkins were {{replaced}} by the precursor to the three piece suit comprising waistcoat, tight breeches, powdered wig, tricorne hat, and a long coat called a justacorps. This coat, popularised by Louis XIII of France and Charles II of England, was knee length and looser fitting than the later frock coat, with <b>turn-back</b> cuffs and two rows of buttons. English and French noblemen often wore expensive brocade coats decorated with velvet, gold braid, embroidery, and gold buttons to demonstrate their wealth.|$|E

The other {{connection}} to Seven Kings West Junction was goods only and survived until 19 March 1956. The whole triangular junction disappeared under expansion of Ilford carriage sheds in 1959. Goods trains operated by British Rail continued using the loop via Woodford {{as far as}} Newbury Park until 4 October 1965. A short <b>turn-back</b> siding was provided on the former track-bed south of Newbury Park: after goods trains were withdrawn it was used by engineers' trains until 1992.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea {{was pushing}} for an {{additional}} station {{in the north of}} the borough, east of Old Oak Common, at Kensal off Ladbroke Grove and Canal Way. A <b>turn-back</b> facility, now built west of Paddington, could have been sited at Kensal to provide a frequent service to a new station to regenerate that area. Former Mayor Boris Johnson agreed that a station would be added if it met three tests: it must not delay construction of Crossrail, it did not compromise performance of Crossrail or any other railway, and it must not increase Crossrail's overall cost. So the council agreed to underwrite the projected £33million cost, and a consultancy study that then concluded a Kensal station would not compromise Crossrail.|$|E

25|$|At a site just to {{the east}} of the Old Oak Common site, Kensington and Chelsea Council has been pushing for a station at North Kensington / Kensal off Ladbroke Grove & Canal Way, as a <b>turn-back</b> {{facility}} will have to be built in the area anyway. Siting it at Kensal Rise, rather than next to Paddington itself, would provide a new station to regenerate the area. Amongst the general public there is a huge amount of support for the project and Mayor Boris Johnson stated that a station would be added if it did not increase Crossrail's overall cost; in response, Kensington and Chelsea Council agreed to underwrite the projected £33million cost of a Crossrail station, which was received very well by the residents of the Borough.

40|$|A Y-type urban {{rail transit}} is {{composed}} of a trunk and a branch, and the passenger demand has the characteristics of multidirectional and unbalanced. It is important to design routing planning of Y-type urban rail transit and provide reasonable service for passengers with acceptable operational cost. In this study, a routing planning design model was proposed for Y-type urban rail transit aimed at minimizing the passenger travel time and train operating distance. The decision variables of the model were the locations of <b>turn-backs</b> and the departure frequencies of the train routings in the multi-routing planning. The constraints of passenger demand and line condition were considered. The multi-objective model {{was turned into a}} single-objective model by giving weight values to the objectives. Then a genetic algorithm was applied to obtain optimal solutions of the proposed model. Finally, a case study was conducted, and the optimal solutions under different forms of multi-routing planning with different weight values were analyzed. The results showed that when the weight of the passenger travel time increased to a certain level, the optimal solution changed from a two-routing planning to a three-routing planning, and the latter one could better meet the characteristics of the passenger...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} people seeking asylum {{worldwide}} is at crisis levels as war and persecution force more people {{to leave their homes}} than ever before. The current approach by the Australian government, including turning boats back to Indonesia and detaining people in cruel camps on Nauru and Manus Island is at a stalemate with people continuing to languish in detention with no meaningful prospects of resettlement. The Australian Labor Party offers no genuine alternative to the government as they are committed to maintaining offshore processing and boat <b>turn-backs.</b> The Australian Greens offer a unique proactive alternative for the fair and efficient assessment and resettlement of people seeking asylum which ensures they are treated with respect and dignity and integrated into our community. Importantly, the Australian Greens policy will ensure that people’s safety is paramount. By increasing our humanitarian intake and adequately funding organisations in the region, the Australian Greens will create a fair system whereby people’s claims are processed efficiently and they are flown to Australia from Malaysia and Indonesia. People will no longer face the impossible choice of getting on a leaky boat...|$|R
500|$|Thus, {{throughout}} the Napoleonic wars, the 52nd foot continued to wear red uniforms with buff facings. The officers had silver lace, {{while the other}} ranks' lace was worn in pairs, red with orange stripes (according to 1802 regulations); in 1812 a commentator described the lace as red with two blue stripes. Light infantry officers wore short jackets, rather than the tailed coats of the other line regiments, with white piping, silver buttons, and silver and scarlet shoulder wings. The uniform was completed with a crimson sash; to match the buff facings and <b>turn-backs,</b> the officers generally wore buff breeches, or grey overalls. Field officers of the 52nd wore silver epaulettes, with regimental badge, overtop the light infantry wings, to designate rank. An 1810 order stipulated these be badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels). Light infantry also commonly wore a narrow waist belt instead of the customary shoulder belt. The 52nd did not adopt the [...] "Belgic cap" [...] but retained the stovepipe shako {{throughout the}} Napoleonic period; it was adorned with the brass bugle badge and green plumes of the light infantry. In the 52nd, officers' plumes were made from horsehair. Officers generally carried a stirrup-hilted sabre.|$|R

5000|$|Jessica M. Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at Center for Immigration Studies {{reported}} in March 2012 that the Obama administration {{is trying to}} move away from using detention centers that are currently housing thousands of illegal immigrants each day. These facilities are very costly. The 608-bed Karnes facility cost the private operator, GEO Group, $32 million to build. This works out to $52,632 per bed. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is expected to pay GEO Group about $15 million a year to run the center. [...] Some apprehended near the border especially native Mexicans, stay less than one day in detention while are under quick processing for departure. Their stay in detention is about 12 hours. ICE detention centers in the southwest border areas handle groups of 100 of these illegal entrants twice a day. These quick <b>turn-backs</b> numbered about 75,000 last year, or nearly 20 percent of ICE's total reported removals. Some of these who had to stay more than 12 hours are released under bonds until their court hearing because of lack of space in detention centers. As of 2010 715,000 of these failed to appear for their hearings in court or who have ignored orders to depart. The US spending on enforcement activities is already very high. Center of Immigration Studies reported that in 2007-2008 enforcement resources like spending on border and interior enforcement cost far more than the tax savings they generated from reduced illegal presence in the United States.|$|R
