500|$|The series {{sought out}} {{a bowling alley}} for the opening scenes, but many were {{reluctant}} to yield over two-thirds of their space as well as close down for three days. Eventually, the Thunderbird Bowling Centre was chosen. The series was allowed to film at the location {{under the condition that}} the bowling surfaces were preserved. Due to this, the production staff was forced to either wear bowling shoes or wear makeshift [...] "paper booties" [...] on their feet. In between camera set ups, Duchovny and director Charleston bowled several games. Duchovny later joked that after the episode, he [...] "realized how old" [...] he was because he felt sore from all the bowling. He joked, [...] "when you get sore from bowling, it's time to start <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> life and where it's going." ...|$|E
500|$|Cohn and Levithan {{had written}} the novel in {{alternating}} chapters: Cohn writing from Norah's perspective and Levithan writing from Nick's perspective. Cera and Dennings recorded voice-over narration to mimic the first-person perspective from which the novel is written, but the voice-overs {{were not included in}} the final cut of the film. Scafaria says that the differences between the novel and the film were [...] "to make it a little more cinematic". She said that Nick and Norah's parents were written out of the script [...] "to absorb what it's like to be young, [...] you're not <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> parents when you're out all night". In addition to searching for Where's Fluffy?, Sollett felt that the film needed a second MacGuffin to propel the story forwards, so Norah's best friend Caroline got drunk and then lost, giving Nick and Norah an additional objective.|$|E
2500|$|Early episodes {{told the}} story of student Kenneth Barlow (William Roache), who had won a place at university, and thus found his working-class {{background}} something of an embarrassment. The character {{was one of the few}} to have experienced life 'outside' of Coronation Street. In some ways this predicts the growth of globalisation, and the decline of similar communities. In an episode from 1961, Barlow declares: [...] "You can't go on just <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than Elsie Tanner and her boyfriends." [...] Roache is the only remaining member of the original cast, which makes him the longest-serving actor in Coronation Street, and in British and global soap history.|$|E

2500|$|The Formula of Autonomy takes {{something}} important {{from both the}} Formula for the Universal Law of Nature and the Formula of Humanity. The Formula for the Universal Law of Nature involves <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> maxim {{as if it were}} an objective law, while the Formula of Humanity is more subjective and is concerned with how you are treating the person with whom you are interacting. The Formula of Autonomy combines the objectivity of the former with the subjectivity of the latter and suggests that the agent ask what she would accept as a universal law. To do this, she would test her maxims against the moral law that she has legislated. The Principle of Autonomy is, “the principle of every human will as a will universally legislating through all its maxims.” (4:432) Kant thinks that the Formula of Autonomy yields another “fruitful concept,” the kingdom of ends. The kingdom of ends is the “systematic union” of all ends in themselves (rational agents) and the ends that they set. All ends that rational agents set have a price and can be exchanged for one another. Ends in themselves, however, have dignity and have no equivalent. In addition to being the basis for the Formula of Autonomy and the kingdom of ends, autonomy itself plays an important role in Kant’s moral philosophy. Autonomy is the capacity to be the legislator of the moral law, in other words, to give the moral law to oneself. Autonomy is opposed to heteronomy, which consists of having one’s will determined by forces alien to it. Because alien forces could only determine our actions contingently, Kant believes that autonomy is the only basis for a non-contingent moral law. It is in failing to see this distinction that Kant believes his predecessors have failed: their theories have all been heteronomous. [...] At this point Kant has given us a picture of what a universal and necessary law would look like should it exist. However, he has yet to prove that it does exist, or, in other words, that it applies to us. That is the task of Section III.|$|E

They are usually required to perform long surgical procedures wearing heavy lead vests underneath their surgical gowns {{in order to protect}} them from the x-ray sources used for image-guided surgery. The project is to develop a cooling system for these lead vests allowing for temperature control, giving comfort to the neurosurgeons. The system needs to be light-weight and able to maintain uniform body temperature. The project has many potential applications beyond the operating room. The military has investigated this concept extensively for combat soldiers’ clothing.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{tradition of}} biological research analyzes biological systems using reduced descriptions {{much as an}} engineer uses a 'black box' description of an amplifier. Simple models {{have been used by}} physiologists for a very long time. Physiologists have successfully analyzed a broad range of biological systems using a 'device-oriented' approach similar to the approach an engineer would use to investigate her devices. The present generation views biology through the powerful lenses of structural and (molecular) dynamic analysis, understandably enough because of the beauty and power of the analysis, and the ease of using these structures with present freely available software. The problem is that these powerful lenses offer such magnification that the engineering approach cannot be seen. High magnification means limited field of view, because the (spatial) dynamic range cannot cover everything. The function of the structures and molecular dynamics cannot be seen in the work of many biologists, probably because function cannot be immediately seen in the structures and molecular dynamics they compute. It is just as important for biologists to measure the inputs and outputs of their systems as it is to measure their structures. It seems clear, at least to one physiologist, that this research will be catalyzed by assuming that most biological systems are devices that can be analyzed with the same strategies one would use to analyze engineering devices. <b>Thinking</b> today <b>about</b> <b>your</b> biological preparation as a device tells you what experiments to do tomorrow. An important task for many of us is to transmit the physiological tradition to the next generation of biophysicists to help them adapt traditional questions to the new length scales and techniques of molecular and atomic biology.
