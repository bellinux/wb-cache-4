5|$|The {{earliest}} model {{proposed for}} the evolution of circular permutations is the permutation by duplication mechanism. In this model, a precursor gene first undergoes a duplication and fusion to form a large <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat.</b> Next, start and stop codons are introduced at corresponding locations in the duplicated gene, removing redundant sections of the protein.|$|E
5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication occurs when a gene undergoes duplication to form a <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat,</b> before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide, such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: <b>Tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> {{occur in}} regions of various {{functions}} in genomes. Highly divergent <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> {{are difficult to}} separate from random background without focused statistical tests. Thus, the majority of tools designed to identify <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats,</b> which do not includes statistical evaluations of the results are not suitable for identification of divergent <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats.</b> Results: We developed an effective algorithm for searching for highly divergent <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> with evaluation of their statistical significance and implemented it in the SWAN software. In addition to identification of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> in a sequence, SWAN {{can be used to}} compute statistical significance of repeated structures identified by other popular tools designed for repeat finding. A number of biological examples of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> identified with SWAN are presented. Availability: tool is available upon request from the authors...|$|R

25|$|This gene has a {{variable}} number <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat</b> (VNTR) at the 3â€™ end (rs28363170) {{and another in}} the intron 8 region. Differences in the VNTR {{have been shown to}} affect the basal level of expression of the transporter; consequently, researchers have looked for associations with dopamine related disorders.|$|E
25|$|Most {{common is}} STRs (short <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat).</b> A certain section of DNA is {{examined}} for {{a pattern that}} repeats (e.g. ATCG). The number of times it repeats {{is the value of}} the marker. Typical tests test between 30 and 120 STR markers. STRs mutate fairly frequently. The results of two individuals are then compared {{to see if there is}} a match. Close matches may often join a surname project. DNA companies will usually provide information about how closely related two matches are, based on the difference between their results.|$|E
25|$|The {{separated}} fragments {{are then}} transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon filter; this procedure is called a Southern blot. The DNA fragments within the blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are denatured. Radiolabeled probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences in the genome that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called variable number <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat</b> sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules hybridize to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film. Fragments of DNA that have bound to the probe molecules appear as fluoresent bands on the film.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> (TRs) are {{associated}} with dis-ease genes, {{play an important role}} in evolution and are important in genomic organization and function. Much research has been done on de-scriptions of properties of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats,</b> such as copy-number, period, etc, and correlation be-tween mutations within <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> and dis-ease. This project aims to detect some differ-ences which may exist within the features of dif-ferent <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> associated with disease in human whole-genome.

25|$|Another technique, AmpFLP, or amplified {{fragment}} length polymorphism {{was also}} {{put into practice}} during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used PCR to amplify DNA samples. It relied on variable number <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat</b> (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a polyacrylamide gel using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by silver staining the gel. One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together {{at the top of}} the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of phylogenetic trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.|$|E

The male lineages of the Samaritans, on the other hand, seem to have considerable afinity with those of the five non-Ethiopian Jewish populations examined here.

40|$|Using the {{compiled}} {{human genome}} sequence, we systematically cataloged all <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> with periods between 20 and 2000 bp and defined two subsets whose consensus sequences {{were found at}} either single-locus <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> (slTRs) or multilocus <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> (mlTRs).

Despite the integral role of recombination in the biology of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats,</b> recombination hotspots colocalized only with shorter microsatellites and not the longer repeats examined here. An increased frequency of slTRs was observed near imprinted genes, consistent with a functional role, while both slTRs and mlTRs were found more frequently near genes implicated in triplet expansion diseases, suggesting a general instability of these regions. Using our collated parameters, we identified 2230 slTRs as candidates for highly informative molecular markers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> are {{repetitive}} elements in DNA sequences, which {{are assumed to}} be an important cause of genomic instability in biological science. Many algorithmic techniques exist to detect the <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> from a DNA sequence, which can be broadly classified to be either exact or heuristic. Exact methods use mathematical techniques like Fourier transform, wavelet transform, K-tuples based method, etc. Heuristic methods use tools like combinational methods, suffix trees, statistical models, Hamming distance, and such others to identify approximate <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats.</b> Most of the available software tools for identification are designed to be data intensive due to the huge size of genomic data and variable number of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> in genome sequence.

2500|$|Once {{the proper}} {{specimens}} are collected, {{a series of}} DNA sequencing tests can be initiated. [...] Several methods of DNA sequencing exist to further analyze the gut material of the insect and eventually track down human microsatellite DNA. [...] The sequencing methods currently utilized by forensic labs include STR or short <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat</b> profiling and HVR or the hyper variable regions of DNA. The current DNA analysis on forensic cases and forensic research indicates that STR profiling is generally successful, whereas HVR sequencing proved to a better choice in DNA testing, as its results had a higher success rate. In new research on the DNA analysis; [...] "STR typing of human DNA from fly larvae fed on decomposing bodies" [...] STR profiling created a complete profile in seven of the thirteen cases, and two cases displayed an incomplete set of alleles whereas four of the cases showed incomplete profiling. [...] On the other hand, HVR sequencing was successful in all cases except one, So there is a slight margin of error when utilizing the STR profiling method of DNA typing in forensic analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The human enzyme cystathionine Î²-synthase is a tetramer and {{comprises}} 551 {{amino acids}} with a subunit molecular weight of 61 kDa. It displays a modular organization of three modules with the N-terminal heme domain {{followed by a}} core that contains the PLP cofactor. The cofactor is deep in the heme domain and is linked by a Schiff base. A Schiff base is a functional group containing a C=N bond with the nitrogen atom connected to an aryl or alkyl group. The heme domain is composed of 70 amino acids {{and it appears that}} the heme only exists in mammalian CBS and is absent in yeast and protozoan CBS. [...] At the C-terminus, the regulatory domain of CBS contains a <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat</b> of two CBS domains of Î²-Î±-Î²-Î²-Î±, a secondary structure motif found in other proteins. [...] CBS has a C-terminal inhibitory domain. The C-terminal domain of cystathionine Î²-synthase regulates its activity via both intrasteric and allosteric effects and is important for maintaining the tetrameric state of the protein. This inhibition is alleviated by binding of the allosteric effector, adoMet, or by deletion of the regulatory domain; however, the magnitude of the effects differ. Mutations in this domain are correlated with hereditary diseases.|$|E

40|$|Background: Ancestral reconstructions of {{mammalian}} genomes {{have revealed}} that evolutionary breakpoint regions are clustered in regions that {{are more prone to}} break and reorganize. What is still unclear to evolutionary biologists is whether these regions are physically unstable due solely to sequence composition and/or genome organization, or do they represent genomic areas where the selection against breakpoints is minimal. Methodology and Principal Findings: Here we present a comprehensive study of the distribution of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> in great apes. We analyzed the distribution of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> in relation to the localization of evolutionary breakpoint regions in the human, chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque genomes. We observed an accumulation of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> in the genomic regions implicated in chromosomal reorganizations. In the case of the human genome our analyses revealed that evolutionary breakpoint regions contained more base pairs implicated in <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> compared to synteny blocks, being the AAAT motif the most frequently involved in evolutionary regions. We found that those AAAT repeats located in evolutionary regions were preferentially associated with Alu elements. Significance: Our observations provide evidence for the role of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> in shaping mammalian genome architecture.
