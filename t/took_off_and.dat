5|$|On 1 November 1940—one {{day after}} the {{official}} end of the Battle of Britain—he was killed in action.

5|$|On 25 June 1944 he {{collected}} a Mosquito from 21 Squadron and the Australian navigator Don Walsh and then flew to Norfolk to refuel at West Raynham. They <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> {{headed to the}} Danish coast. Out-to-sea he spotted, and was likely seen, by German coastal ships. As they neared land Braham and Walsh noticed a slight whine in the aircraft's radio speakers meaning the Mosquito was being tracked by radar.|$|E

5|$|The first {{official}} sortie of No.410 Squadron was from RAF Drem, East Lothian, Scotland, {{on the night}} of 4 June 1942, when twelve Beaufighter crews <b>took</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> it {{went on to become the}} top-scoring night fighter squadron in the RAF Second Tactical Air Force during the period between D-Day and VE-Day.|$|E

5|$|By noon of 7 August, {{the early}} morning fog had dispersed, and large numbers of Allied {{aircraft}} appeared over the battlefield. With the advance knowledge of the attack provided by Ultra, the U.S. 9th Air Force had been reinforced by the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Despite assurances by the Luftwaffe that German forces would have adequate air support, the Allied aircraft quickly achieved complete control of the airspace over Mortain. The Luftwaffe reported that its fighters were engaged by Allied aircraft {{from the moment they}} <b>took</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> were unable even to reach the battlefield. In the open ground east of Mortain, the German Panzers became exposed targets, especially for rocket-firing Hawker Typhoon fighter bombers of the RAF.|$|E

50|$|Aircraft {{can have}} {{different}} ways to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> land. Conventional airplanes accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process to land. Some airplanes can <b>take</b> <b>off</b> at low speed, this being a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier Jump Jets can <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> land vertically. Rockets also usually <b>take</b> <b>off</b> vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.|$|R
50|$|Number of <b>take</b> <b>offs</b> <b>and</b> lands (estimated for 1974) were 64,934.|$|R
5|$|Each Staffel was {{expected}} to make at least three firing passes. I./JG 3 <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> joined the lead Gruppe, IV Sturm./JG 3, with III./JG 3 following in the rear. The Bf 109s and Fw 190s of the Geschwader reached the area at about 09:20. Geschwaderkommodore Heinrich Bär led the attack. Some pilots made four passes, destroying AAA emplacements, fuel storage stations and vehicles. Nearly 300 aircraft were on the field, along with huge stores of equipment and fuel. The attack caused fires all over the airfield.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} accident sequence {{began when the}} check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the throttle lever for No. 4 engine past the idle position, and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanismsand increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the mid 2000s, Southdale began {{struggling}} with maintaining a low vacancy rate.

After the closure of Mervyn's in 2004, several tenants followed and ended their leases as well; national retailers like The Bombay Company, Crate & Barrel, Ritz Camera, and Select Comfort all announced closures of their Southdale locations. Talks of a Dick's Sporting Goods filling the space formerly leased by Mervyn's occurred, but those plans never <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> eventually dissolved.|$|E

5|$|By August 1940 the Battle of Britain was intensifying. Most of {{the battles}} thus far were in daylight, leaving night-fighter crews frustrated. Now based at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire and {{operating}} from the satellite airfield at Wellingore the unit formed part of No. 12 Group RAF defending British air space north of London. On {{the night of}} 24 August 1940 Braham <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> patrolled the Humberside area. The Blenheim was piloted by Braham, and contained air gunner Sergeant Wilsdon and aircraftman and trained radar operator N. Jacobson. Braham was directed to an aircraft held in searchlights but he closed too fast and overshot. His gunner succeeded in damaging the aircraft sufficiently and a searchlight crew saw it crash into the sea. It {{was identified as a}} Heinkel He 111. Braham's only other interaction with the enemy occurred at Ternhill, when a Junkers Ju 88 dropped bombs on the airfield destroying 13 Avro Ansons and damaged 20 more. Braham survived the attack uninjured.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February 1944 he <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> {{claimed a}} German lorry {{destroyed}} south of Paris in a daylight sortie. The Mosquitoes did not carry radar but were fitted with Gee navigational aids. It allowed for accurate navigation but night sorties {{would not be}} fruitful since the location of enemy aircraft would be exceptionally difficult. For Braham, hunting in daylight was a strange experience. On 5 March 1944 he flew with Bill Gregory on a 900-mile trip around northern France. The weather impeded his attempts to shoot up airfields at Orleans and Bourges, so he proceeded to the aerodrome at Châteaudun. He spotted a Heinkel He 177 flying in the landing circuit at 800 feet. He closed rapidly and dispatched it for his 20th air victory. Braham was denied the chance to operate as a night fighter pilot at this time when there was intense activity. In January 1944 the Luftwaffe initiated Operation Steinbock, a series of strikes against British cities {{in response to the}} British offensive over Germany. The German air arm met with severe losses during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} phase of the {{operation}} had been scheduled for 8 May, no word was received from the 'Heralds' and so Doomsday was postponed by twenty-four hours. Contact was successfully established on 9 May and the first units of Force 134 arrived in Norway to begin their occupation, including the first elements of 1st Airborne Division and the Norwegian Parachute Company. All but one of the transport aircraft belonging to {{the first phase}} <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> landed in Norway without incident. Phase II was accelerated to compensate for the delay, with aircraft scheduled to leave Britain between 02:00 and 13:30. Unfortunately, after approximately 07:00 poor weather over Oslo caused many transport aircraft heading for the airfield there to return to Britain, although all of those destined for Stavanger landed successfully. Several crash-landed, and one was reported missing. The remaining aircraft took off again on 11 May, with one crashing on takeoff and another going missing; of the two missing aircraft, one landed at another airfield in Norway, but the other had crashed killing all of its occupants, including Air Vice-Marshal Scarlett-Streatfeild. The aircraft belonging to the next two phases suffered no more casualties, although a number of them were again delayed by inclement weather over the Norwegian airfields. 1st Airborne Division suffered one officer and thirty-three other ranks killed, and one other rank wounded, and the Royal Air Force six killed and seven injured. All of these losses had occurred after the general surrender had been declared.|$|E

5|$|By dawn of 26 August, {{advancing}} west {{along the}} coast with armoured support, the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company, 61st Infantry Battalion, around KB Mission. The Japanese force moved through the jungle {{at the edge of}} the coastal track, and was headed by two light tanks. Although they lacked anti-armour weapons, the Australians were able to turn back the Japanese attack. At this stage, the Japanese suffered a serious setback when their base area was heavily attacked at daylight by RAAF Kittyhawks and a Hudson aircraft, along with B-25s, B-26s and B-17s from the US Fifth Air Force. As a result of the attack, a number of Japanese troops were killed, while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed, as were a number of the landing barges which were beached near the KB Mission. Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system, the destruction of the landing barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions. The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced to turn back due to bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Finucane claimed {{three more}} successes in the spring, one Fw 190 on 26 March escorting 24 Douglas A-20 Havocs from 88 and 107 squadrons to attack Le Havre docks; another on 28 March and one Bf 109 and another Fw 190 on 17 May 1942. Four {{aircraft}} were claimed as shared, two probably destroyed and four damaged. Life magazine filmed the squadron's sortie on 26 March, as the fighters <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> landed. This operation was significant as Finucane's unit was also {{making use of}} gun camera footage to help verify combat claims. Finucane used footage to verify two claims on 2 April. Despite two clear images of two Fw 190s being hit he was credited only with one damaged. 602 was prompted to use the cameras because the Command thought the squadron's claims were excessive and the pilots were over stating their success. The Air Ministry also accelerated a plan to introduce the Spitfire IX to restore qualitative parity with the Fw 190 which was inflicting heavy losses on British fighter formations; primarily through German pilots taking full advantage of its superior performance over the Spitfire V. Finucane took at least one flight in the Spitfire IX. He flew the personal aircraft of commanding officer W. G. G. Duncan Smith, 64 Squadron, on 26 June 1942.|$|E
5|$|Just after Cole's C-130 left Khâm Đức, a C-123 {{flown by}} Major Ray D. Shelton landed {{and took out}} 44 U.S. {{engineers}} and 21 South Vietnamese civilians. Shortly after Shelton had landed his aircraft, he reported that enemy fire was coming in from all quadrants, but {{he was able to}} take off safely after just three minutes on the ground. By 11:10, just 145 people had been evacuated by Shelton's aircraft, and a handful of helicopters. After that, another three C-130s also arrived in the vicinity of Khâm Đức, but the pilots were told not to try landings. In the afternoon, the C-130 Hercules resumed their operations; at 15:25, Major Bernard L. Bucher's C-130 approached Khâm Đức's airfield from the south and landed despite taking numerous hits. Some 150 Vietnamese women and children rushed onto the aircraft; as soon as the aircraft was full, Bucher made his takeoff in the north direction, unaware that opposing forces were concentrated in that area. At 15:30 Bucher <b>took</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> his aircraft was quickly riddled by ground fire; it crashed {{less than a mile from}} the end of the runway. All the South Vietnamese civilians and the U.S. aircrew died in the crash.|$|E

5|$|On 15 April Cunningham was to {{have his}} most {{successful}} night, shooting down three bombers (victories no. 8–10). On patrol near the south coast he engaged a He 111 over Monmouthshire which he shot down with only 40 rounds. He returned to Middle Wallop only to be sent on patrol for a second sortie. He <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> headed south, towards Southampton. GCI {{was too busy to}} employ him and he was granted a request to investigate a searchlight cone towards Marlborough. Rawnsley directed him to attack and he duly shot down the He 111 which crashed into derelict houses in Southampton. He was sent by GCI after another enemy but lost the contact, appearing over Southampton again he spotted yet another He 111 in the moonlight. He closed to 80 yards and shot it down. It crashed in the area of Lymington. Cunningham's 9th victory was Werknummer 2857, code G1+ES, belonging to 8./KG 55. The Heinkel, piloted by Oberleutnant Günther von Seidlitz, crashed onto No. 10-12 Padwell Road, Southampton at 02:00. Seidlitz and Feldwebel Franz Hümmer were killed in action and Unteroffizier Horst Rosenberg and Herbert Sauer were taken prisoner of war. In April, having downed at least 10 enemy aircraft in night-fighting operations, Cunningham was decorated with his first Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1942 Finucane flew a two-Spitfire sortie to Dunkirk, France. The {{last few}} days had been {{monotonous}} and Finucane was eager to fly and asked Dick Lewis—a 29-year old Australian who had put his age down so he was accepted for pilot training—to fly as his wingman. At 10:55 GMT Finucane <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> headed over Manston toward France. Off the coast, they strafed a small ship and turned north to return home. Finucane spotted two aircraft taking off from Mardyck but lost sight of them. Both Spitfires dropped to sea level. Minutes later two enemy fighters came towards them. They were identified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. The Fw 190 had a higher performance than the Spitfire V in all departments other than turning circle and was more heavily armed. Finucane scored hits on the first Fw 190's wing but the enemy quickly gained the advantage and Finucane's Spitfire was hit with six machine gun rounds which blew a piece of fuselage into the cockpit and into his leg. Blood loss induced dizziness and Lewis protected his leader from six more astern attacks. In the last attack the two Fw 190s came from opposite directions. Lewis was able to claim one shot down and the other gave up over the mid-Channel. They taxied to 452's dispersal where Finucane passed out after shutting down the engine. On 2 March Finucane went on leave after spending over a week in hospital. No claim or loss was recorded by JG 26, the resident German fighter unit.|$|E
