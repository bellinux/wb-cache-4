In the case <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.|$|E
5|$|In QFT, {{the demand}} for {{relativistic}} invariance enters, among other ways in that the S-matrix necessarily must be Poincaré invariant. This has the implication <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> or more infinite-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group acting on Fock space. One way to guarantee {{the existence of such}} representations is the existence of a Lagrangian description (with modest requirements imposed, see the reference) of the system using the canonical formalism, from which a realization of the generators of the Lorentz group may be deduced.|$|E

Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field.

This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} relative state formulation, Everett proposed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> universal wavefunction {{that describes the}} objective reality of the whole universe. He stated that when multiple subsystems interact, the total system becomes a superposition of these subsystems. This includes observers and measurement systems, which become part of one universal state (the wavefunction) that is always described via the Schrödinger Equation (or its relativistic alternative). That is, they become entangled such that one cannot define one without the other. Thus, each subsystems state {{can only be described}} relative to each subsystem with which it interacts (hence the name relative state).|$|E
25|$|Orthodox Judaism {{stresses}} {{a number}} of core principles in its educational programs, most importantly a belief <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> single, omniscient, transcendent, non-compound God, who created the universe, {{and continues to be}} concerned with its governance. Traditional Judaism maintains that God established a covenant with the Jewish people at Mount Sinai, and revealed his laws and 613 commandments to them {{in the form of the}} Written and Oral Torah. In Rabbinic Judaism, the Torah consists of both the written Torah (Pentateuch) and a tradition of oral law, much of it later codified in sacred writings (see: Mishna, Talmud).|$|E

However, she said Taiwan doesn't oppose <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> China in the world, but Taiwan {{is not part of}} China. She criticized ROC President Ma Ying-jeou for making Taiwan becomes more and more dependent on China. She even reiterated her 1996 Consensus to oppose Kuomintang's 1992 Consensus in dealing with the PRC, in which she said Taiwan has been an independent sovereign country after the 1996 ROC presidential election.|$|E

25|$|The Jewish–Christian Gospels were gospels of a Jewish Christian {{character}} {{quoted by}} Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius, Epiphanius, Jerome and probably Didymus the Blind.

25|$|The {{thesis of}} the {{singularity}} {{of the world}} states <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> real world. Such a thesis stands {{in stark contrast to}} contemporary theoretical physics and cosmology, which speculate about multiple universes out of the dilemma of how to have law like explanations if the universe is unique—laws will be universal because they don't just apply to this unique universe but to all universes. However, there is no empirical evidence for multiple worlds. Unger's singularity thesis can better address our empirical observations and set the conceptual platform to address the four main puzzles in cosmology today: big bang, initial conditions, horizon problem, and the precise value of constants, such as gravity, speed of light, and Planck's constant.|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
25|$|When {{the group}} of flags of the European Union are flown, the {{sequence}} is alphabetical, based on the first letter of the country's name. The flags should be flown {{from left to right}} with the European Union flag flown from the first flagstaff before the group. An alternative order of flags is to begin on the left with the national flag and place the European Union flag on the far right of the group, as seen by an observer. With regard to international flags; where either an even or an odd number of flags are flown in line on staffs of equal height, the national flag should be first on the right of the line— that is on the observer's left as he or she faces the flags. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown on the immediate left of the national flag, or as seen by an observer, on the immediate right of the national flag. Where, however, an odd number of flags are displayed from staffs grouped so <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> staff in the centre and higher than the others, the national flag should be displayed from the staff so placed. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown from the first flagstaff on the right, or as seen by an observer, on the first flagstaff on the left. Only one national flag should be displayed in each group of flags or at each location. In all cases, the national flag should be in the place of honour. When the national flag is displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall or other background, the green should be on the right (an observer's left) in the horizontal position or uppermost in the vertical position. When displayed on a platform, the national flag should be above and behind the speaker's desk. While being carried, the flag should not be dipped by way of salute or compliment except to the dead during memorial ceremonies.|$|E
