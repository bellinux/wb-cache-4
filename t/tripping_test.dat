40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis of thermal stratification {{in the upper}} plenum of the MONJU fast breeder reactor was performed. Calculations were performed for a 1 / 6 simplified model of the MONJU reactor using the commercial code, CFX- 13. To better resolve the geometrically complex upper core structure of the MONJU reactor, the porous media approach was adopted for the simulation. First, a steady state solution was obtained and the transient solutions were then obtained for the turbine <b>trip</b> <b>test</b> conducted in December 1995. The time dependent inlet conditions for the mass flow rate and temperature were provided by JAEA. Good agreement with the experimental data was observed for steady state solution. The numerical solution of the transient analysis shows the formation of thermal stratification within the upper plenum of the reactor vessel during the turbine <b>trip</b> <b>test.</b> The temporal variations of temperature were predicted accurately by the present method in the initial rapid coastdown period (∼ 300 seconds). However, transient numerical solutions show a faster thermal mixing than that observed in the experiment after the initial coastdown period. A nearly homogenization of the temperature field in the upper plenum is predicted after about 900 seconds, which is a much shorter-term thermal stratification than the experimental data indicates. This discrepancy {{may be due to}} the shortcoming of the turbulence models available in the CFX- 13 code for a natural convection flow with thermal stratification...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper centers on the {{condition}} assessment of 11 kV- 33 kV distribution circuit breakers from the analysis of their trip coil current signatures captured using an innovative condition monitoring technology developed by others. Using available expert knowledge {{in conjunction with a}} structured process of data mining, thresholds associated with features representing each stage of a circuit breaker's operation may be defined and used to characterize varying states of circuit breaker condition. Knowledge and understanding of satisfactory and unsatisfactory breaker condition can be gained and made explicit from the analysis of captured trip signature data and subsequently used to form the basis of condition assessment and diagnostic rules implemented in a decision support system, used to inform condition-based decisions affecting circuit breaker maintenance. This paper proposes a data mining method for the analysis of condition monitoring data, and demonstrates this method in its discovery of useful knowledge from trip coil data captured from a population of SP Power System's in-service circuit breakers.

40|$|Thanks to {{continuous}} {{progress in}} computer technology, {{it is now}} possible to perform best-estimate simulations of complex scenarios in nuclear power plants. This method is carried out through the coupling of three-dimensional (3 -D) neutron modeling of a reactor core into system codes. It is particularly appropriate for transients that involve strong interactions between core neutronics and reactor loop thermal hydraulics. For this purpose, the Peach Bottom boiling water reactor turbine <b>trip</b> <b>test</b> was selected to challenge the capability of such coupled codes. The test is characterized by a power excursion induced by rapid core pressurization and a self-limiting course behavior. In order to perform the closest simulation, the coupled thermal-hydraulic system code RELAP 5 and 3 -D neutron kinetic code PARCS were used. The obtained results are compared to those available from experimental data. Overall, the coupled code calculations globally predict the most significant observed aspects of the transient, such as the pressure wave amplitude across the core and the power course, with an acceptable agreement. However, sensitivity studies revealed that more-accurate code models should be considered in order to better match the void dynamic and the cross-section variations during transient conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of complex transients in Nuclear Power Plants remain a challenging topics for Best Estimate computational tools. Nowadays, such calculations are performed through {{the so called}} coupled code method, which consists in incorporating three-dimensional (3 D) neutron {{modeling of}} reactor core into system codes. This technique is extensively used for simulating transients that involve core spatial asymmetric phenomena and strong feedback effects between core neutronics and reactor loop thermal-hydraulics. In this framework the Peach Bottom BWR 2 Turbine <b>Trip</b> <b>test</b> is considered since it involves a rapid (water hammer transient) pressure wave induced positive reactivity addition into the core. To perform a numerical simulation of such phenomenon a reference code case was run and an overall data comparison was carried out. The results show good agreements between the calculations {{and most of the}} significant global aspects observed experimentally. However, the test was revealed very sensitive to the feedback modeling and requires a tightly accurate simulation of the thermal-hydraulic and the cross sections parameters. For this purpose, sensitivity studies have been carried out in order to identify the most influent parameters that govern the transient behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of complex transients in {{nuclear power plants}} (NPP) remains a challenging topic for best estimate three-dimensional coupled code computational tools. This technique is, nowadays, extensively used since it allows decreasing conservatism in the calculation models and performs more realistic simulation and more precise consideration of multidimensional effects under complex transients in NPPs. Therefore, large international activities are in progress aiming to assess the capabilities of coupled codes and the new frontiers for the nuclear technology that could be opened by this technique. In the current paper, {{a contribution to the}} assessment and validation of coupled code technique through the Kozloduy VVER 100 pump <b>trip</b> <b>test</b> is performed.

Further investigations through the use of two “antagonist” uncertainty GRS and the CIAU methods, were considered in order to evaluate and quantify the origin of the observed discrepancies.
