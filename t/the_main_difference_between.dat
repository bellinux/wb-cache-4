5|$|Three {{additional}} HC Mk2 Chinooks {{were ordered}} with delivery beginning in 1995. Another six were ordered in 1995 under the Chinook HC Mk2A designation; <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> these {{and the standard}} Mk2 was the strengthening of the front fuselage to allow the fitting of an aerial refuelling probe in future.|$|E
5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> Argentina {{and other}} settler {{societies}} such as Australia and Canada was {{its failure to}} seek adequate alternatives {{to compensate for the}} end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Monaco {{consists of}} up to four players who each control different characters while they partake in s and robberies in many different locations. Players can control one of eight characters, each of whom have their own characteristics, such as the Hacker who can put viruses onto security systems, or the Cleaner who can put guards to sleep. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> single-player and multiplayer modes is that in multiplayer, when a player dies they must be revived before the level can be completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the teams' passing {{remained}} <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> them; however, in the 16thminute, Barcelona lost the ball and Ryan Giggs sent a long ball forward to Ronaldo. Ronaldo's first touch took him inside Piqué before going back outside the former Manchester United defender, who cynically blocked Ronaldo's run, earning himself the first yellow card of the match. Ronaldo shaped to take the free kick himself, but it was Giggs who shot for goal, only to curl the ball just over the bar.|$|E
5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the justification of Heracles's divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E

5|$|England {{had four}} captains in Gatting, John Emburey, Chris Cowdrey and Graham Gooch, but each Test ended in West Indian dominance. They won each match except the first Test, which was drawn because of rain, and the series {{finished}} 4–0. The West Indies pace attack was <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> teams with Marshall {{being the most}} dangerous bowler, taking 35 wickets {{at an average of}} 12.65. This included a 7/22 in the third Test which he bowled with a broken left hand. Marshall was supported by Ambrose's bowling which yielded 22 wickets. After this series both teams would go into decline. Many of the great West Indian players such as Richards and Marshall would soon retire, and their dominance of the Test stage was nearing its end.|$|E
5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> {{eukaryotic}} and prokaryotic {{oxidative phosphorylation}} is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary sources do {{not give}} {{reliable}} data on the size and composition of Harold's army, although two Norman sources give figures of 1.2million or 400,000 men. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, but most agree {{on a range of}} between 7000 and 8000 English troops. These men would have comprised a mix of the fyrd (militia mainly composed of foot soldiers) and the housecarls, or nobleman's personal troops, who usually also fought on foot. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two types was in their armour; the housecarls used better protecting armour than that of the fyrd. The English army {{does not appear to have}} had many archers, although some were present. The identities of few of the Englishmen at Hastings are known; the most important were Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine. About 18 other named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including two other relatives.|$|E
5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German Leopard 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. The Leopard was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight Leopard 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five Leopard 1 bridge layer tanks were ordered. The Australian tanks were designated the Leopard AS1, and were based on the Leopard 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the Australian and German tanks was the inclusion of a SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the tank to better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved trunnion bearings and combustion cleaners. These tanks were delivered to Australia in batches between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service very little in the way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov's Plan and The 500 Days Programme were broadly similar, {{with both}} {{supporting}} price liberalisation, decentralisation and privatisation. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two was Ryzhkov's desire to retain {{much of the}} social security system, free education for all and the continuance of a strong central government apparatus. The 500 Days Programme did not mention political union with the other Soviet republics, but instead weakened the authority of the central government by establishing a market economy. In other words, they left the question of continuing or dissolving the Soviet Union open. On 17 September in a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev openly supported the 500 Days Programme, claiming it would not lead to the reestablishment of capitalism, but instead to a mixed economy where private enterprise played an important role.|$|E

5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either the pointer machine or random access machine models of computing. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> these two models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register {{to be used as}} the address of memory read and write operations, with unit cost per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E
5|$|The first Quatermass film {{had been}} a major success for Hammer and, eager for a sequel, they {{purchased}} the rights to Nigel Kneale's follow-up before the BBC had even begun transmission of the new serial. For this adaptation, Nigel Kneale himself was allowed to write {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, although subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest. The plot is a condensed but largely faithful retelling of the original television serial. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two versions is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass blasts off in a rocket to confront the aliens in outer space, whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, to destroy the aliens' asteroid base. Returning director Val Guest once again employed many cinema vérité techniques to present the fantastic elements of the plot with the greatest degree of realism. Nigel Kneale was critical of the final film, mainly on account of the return of Brian Donlevy in the lead role. Kneale was unhappy with Donlevy's interpretation of the character and also claimed the actor's performance was marred by his alcoholism, a claim denied by Val Guest.|$|E
