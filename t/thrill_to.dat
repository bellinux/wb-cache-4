This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I both love it and hate it for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable <b>thrill</b> <b>to</b> the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory {{makes you feel like}} you’re winning with a capital FU." [...] Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.|$|E

Charlotte O'Sullivan from the London Evening Standard gave a more negative assessment of Elsa, {{saying that she}} [...] "resembles one of those brittle mentors on The X Factor. Purple eyeshadow, tiny waist, kitten heels". Anna Smith of The Guardian disliked that both Elsa and Anna were drawn with slender figures and large eyes as is typical of Disney princesses. Slate's Dana Stevens wrote that [...] "it's impossible not to <b>thrill</b> <b>to</b> Elsa's surging sense of power" [...] but criticized the choice to illustrate her growing confidence by changing her appearance; Stevens further {{expressed concern that the}} switch from the character's modest coronation gown to [...] "a slinky, slit-to-the-thigh dress with a transparent snowflake-patterned train and a pair of silver-white high heels" [...] and a hairstyle that suggested [...] "come-hither bad-girl seduction" [...] was overly sexual. [...] Christy Lemire compared Elsa to Carrie White, another well-known fictional female who unleashes magical powers when agitated.|$|E
500|$|After {{the tour}} was confirmed, Mars {{and his band}} started {{preparing}} for it. His manager at the time, Brandon Creed, said that Mars was more focused and excited than nervous. He furthered that the singer {{spent most of his}} time rehearsing, preparing, directing and choreographing everything. Commenting on the development, Creed said [...] "We're going into rehearsals now, so I don't have much to share, but it's going to be ... incredible ... it's hectic, but it's amazing ... It's a <b>thrill</b> <b>to</b> work with an artist so talented". After evaluating the American Express and Citibank suggestions regarding a presale, WME decided not to pursue the idea, to which Mars' management agreed upon, a decision which ending up further promoting the Moonshine Jungle Tour. The idea was received with some skepticism within the team; some believed it was a good idea but most were reluctant and thought it was an awful idea, as buyers find presale a crucial element of tours. Cameron Duddy was chosen as the music director for the first leg of the North American tour.|$|E

Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters [...] "I was very excited for this role.

In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] <b>thrill</b> <b>to</b> Walter.

500|$|Peter Brown at GameSpot {{reflected}} on Aloy's character development with amazement, {{adding that the}} process matured Aloy and grew her confidence. One constant <b>thrill</b> <b>to</b> Brown came from combating the machines, which he said took the spotlight and never lost its flair. He appreciated also that the main quests encouraged one to explore the environment. Zoe Delahunty-Light, writing for GamesRadar, was fascinated with {{the intricacies of the}} game world and found integral value in the lore scattered among the ruins. She echoed Brown's view that fighting machines maintained excitement throughout. Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann declared Horizon Zero Dawn as [...] "a near-perfect story" [...] with a satisfying conclusion, and emphasised that it contained substantial depth. Lucy O'Brien at IGN admired its weight in meaning, while welcoming the charm of the protagonist's personality. A considerable impression was made with the combat, which was stated as the game's most compelling accomplishment. Writing for Polygon, Philip Kollar applauded the game as what he dubbed the [...] "refutation" [...] of Guerrilla Games' past work, a change of pace he described as [...] "refreshing". Aloy was observed to be perfectly coupled with the story in that she offered the curiosity to seek out its many mysteries. Kollar perceived the Focus as [...] "key to combat" [...] and the machines as engaging foes in battle. Colm Ahern of VideoGamer.com wrote in his verdict, [...] "Destroying large robot beasts while frantically switching between weapons is intoxicating, but the strength of Horizon Zero Dawn is in Aloy's engaging quest to find out who she really is".|$|E

500|$|On August 4, Yankovic began {{recording}} parodies {{starting with}} [...] "Living With a Hernia". The song, a spoof of [...] "Living in America" [...] by James Brown—which {{was also the}} theme to the 1985 film [...] Rocky IV—is about hernias. When {{it came time to}} pick a song to parody as the lead single for Polka Party! Scotti Brothers Records [...] "had some very strong ideas" [...] and wished to have Yankovic parody a musician who was signed on the same label. After [...] "Living in America" [...] became a hit, the record label insisted that Yankovic parody the song, to which Yankovic obliged. In order to accurately write the song, Yankovic researched the various types of hernias. Yankovic noted that [...] "it was a real <b>thrill</b> <b>to</b> do James Brown. I'm a total non-dancer, never went to any dances in high school, but if I analytically dissect a dance routine I can figure it out." [...] A choreographer named Chester Whitmore was hired to accurately create the dance scenes featured in the video, which was shot on the concert set actually used in the movie Rocky IV. The second parody recorded was [...] "Addicted to Spuds", a pastiche of [...] "Addicted to Love" [...] by Robert Palmer, about a man's obsession for potatoes and potato-based dishes. A music video for the song was never made to the song because there was a strict budget for videos for the album, and Yankovic felt that the video would be one big joke and not really worth its own video. A parody of Palmer's video, however, was later inserted into Al's [...] "UHF" [...] video.|$|E
500|$|David Denby of The New Yorker {{asserted}} that the austere, but captivating installment presented a [...] "glancing, chilled view" [...] of a world where succinct moments of loyalty coexisted with constant trials of betrayal. To USA Today columnist Claudia Puig, Fincher captures the [...] "menace and grim despair in the frosty Scandinavian landscape" [...] by carefully approaching its most gruesome features. Puig noted a surfeit of [...] "stylistic flourishes" [...] and [...] "intriguing" [...] changes in the narrative, compared to the original film. In his three-and-a-half star review, Chris Knight of the National Post argued that it epitomized a so-called [...] "paradoxical position" [...] that was both [...] "immensely enjoyable and completely unnecessary". Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald said that the [...] "fabulously sinister entertainment" [...] surpassed the original film [...] "in every way". The film took two-and-a-half stars from Rolling Stone commentator Peter Travers, who concluded: [...] "Fincher's Girl is gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, admired the moments of [...] "brilliantly orchestrated" [...] anxiety and confusion, but felt that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was vulnerable to the [...] "lumbering proceduralism" [...] that he saw in its literary counterpart, as evident with the [...] "long stretches of drab, hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere". The Wall Street Journal Joe Morgenstern praised Cronenweth's cinematography, which he thought provided for glossy alterations in the film's darkness; [...] "Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors, and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer professed that despite its occasional incomprehensibility, the movie was [...] "technically superb" [...] and [...] "superbly acted". In contrast, Kyle Smith of New York Post censured the film, calling it [...] "rubbish" [...] and further commenting that it [...] "demonstrates merely that masses will <b>thrill</b> <b>to</b> an unaffecting, badly written, psychologically shallow and deeply unlikely pulp story {{so long as you}} allow them to feel sanctified by the occasional meaningless reference to feminism or Nazis." ...|$|E
500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a <b>thrill</b> <b>to</b> throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing {{when one considers that}} he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But my folks and I decided that I'd make up my mind about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E
