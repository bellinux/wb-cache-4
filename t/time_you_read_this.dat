In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and Before I Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By the <b>Time</b> <b>You</b> <b>Read</b> <b>This,</b> I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments." ...|$|E

You will find also that the flower has five petals; and being held down by the bent stalk, two of them bend back and up, as if resisting it; two expand at the sides; and one, the principal, grows downwards, with its attached spur behind. So that the front view of the flower must be some modification of this typical arrangement, Fig. M, (for middle form). Now the statement above quoted from Figuier, § 16, means, if {{he had been able to}} express himself, that the two lateral petals in the violet are directed downwards, Fig. II. A, and in the pansy upwards, Fig. II. C. And that, in the main, is true, and to be fixed well and clearly in your mind.

5000|$|In a 1996 Lecture in Sydney, {{referring}} to the work Zhuan Falun, Li stated: [...] "Although Qigong has been spread {{for quite a long}} period of time, several decades already, no one knows its real implications. Therefore, I have written in the book, Zhuan Falun, everything about certain phenomena in the Qigong community, why Qigong is spread in ordinary human society, and what the ultimate goal of Qigong is. Therefore, this book is a systematic work that enables one to practice cultivation. Through reading it repeatedly, many people feel that there is something unique about the book: no matter how many <b>times</b> <b>you</b> have <b>read</b> <b>this</b> book, <b>you</b> always seem to feel a sense of freshness, and no matter how many <b>times</b> <b>you</b> have <b>read</b> it, <b>you</b> always attain a different understanding from the same sentence, and no matter how many <b>times</b> <b>you</b> have <b>read</b> it, <b>you</b> always feel that there is still a great deal of content in it that is yet to be found. Why is it this way, then? It is because that I have systematically compiled many things that are considered heavenly secrets within this book, such as that people are able to practice cultivation, how cultivation should be practiced, and the characteristics of this universe, etc. For a practitioner, it can enable him to complete his cultivation practice successfully. Because no one has ever done such a thing in the past, when <b>reading</b> <b>this</b> book, many people find {{that a lot of the}} contents are heavenly secrets." ...|$|R

But this Masters tournament {{will be remembered for}} more than Woods’s ongoing athletic dominance. No sports story in 2002 produced more intense media coverage than the contro-versy surrounding the Augusta National Golf Club, the host of the presti-gious Masters Golf Tournament and its all-male membership. The dispute began with National Council of Women’s Organization Chairwoman Mar-tha Burk’s private letter to Augusta Chairman Hootie Johnson, calling for the admission of a woman member. Customarily, Augusta’s policies are set by the chairman, who operates the club like a “benevolent autocracy” (Chambers, 1995, p. 30). Johnson, in true autocratic fashion, responded with an obstinate and public refusal to comply. In his statement, published widely in newspapers and on the Internet, Johnson emphatically defended the rights of private clubs to regulate their membership, shamed women’s organizations for taking on such a “trivial ” matter, and stated the club’s refusal to be “bullied [...] . at the point of a bayonet. ” When Burk began lobby...|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. The {{exponential}} {{growth of the}} Internet contributes to risks and threats which materialize without our knowledge. The more computer and Internet use becomes {{a part of our}} daily lives, the more we expose ourselves and our personal information on the World Wide Web and hence, the more opportunities arise for fraudsters to get hold of this information. Internet use can be associated with Internet banking, online shopping, online transactions, Internet Relay Chat, newsgroups, search engines, online blogs and e-mail. The source behind online activities carried on over the Internet may be different from what we are led to believe. Communication lines may be intercepted, compromising sensitive information of the user. It is a risk to make digital payments and reveal sensitive information about ourselves to an unknown source. If the risk materializes, it may result in undesired circumstances. Using the Internet securely should be a prerequisite to every user before conducting online transactions and activities over the World Wide Web. Owing to the versatility and ease of the electronic medium, electronic databases and vast amounts of sensitive information are readily accumulated. This is cause for concern regarding the main issues, namely privacy, identity theft and monetary fraud. Major countermeasures to mitigate the main forms of security and Internet-related issues are awareness of these risks and how they may materialize as well as relevant protection mechanisms. A discussion about why the Internet is a popular medium for criminal behaviour, what risks are involved, what can be done about them and some technical as well as non-technical preventative measures are covered in this dissertation. The purpose of this dissertation is to create an overall awareness of Internet banking and the process of Internet transactions. The end result is the development of an information security awareness portal (ISAP) aimed at the general public and potential Internet users who may be subject to identity and credit fraud. The aim of the ISAP is to sensitize users and minimize the growing numbers of individuals who are victimized through online crimes. Individuals using the Internet {{need to be aware of}} privacy concerns governing the Internet and how searchers are able to find out almost anything about them. The false sense of security and anonymity we as users think we have when innocently connecting to the World Wide Web outlines threats lurking in the background where we would never imagine. By the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> are finished <b>reading</b> <b>this</b> dissertation, it may put you off transacting and revealing sensitive information about yourself online ever again...|$|R
