40|$|International audienceLeaching of {{nitrogen}} fertilizers such as nitrates from agricultural systems causes watershed eutrophication {{and is an}} economic loss for the farmer. This issue may be solved by including a catch crop in a crop rotation. For instance, winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> is a potential N catch crop for cold climates. Here, we studied winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> as a catch crop from 2009 to 2011 in Finland. Winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> was either undersown with barley in May or sown after harvesting barley in late July. In two reference treatments, the barley stubble was either left over the winter or ploughed into the soil in autumn. We collected samples from topsoil, 0 - 20  cm, and subsoil, 30 - 50  cm, in early autumn, before snowfall and in the following spring. We measured soil ammonium-N and nitrate-N, and the N content of winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> plants. Results show that undersown winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> did not change the yield and quality of barley. Winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> decreased nitrate-N in the subsoil by 83  % in 2009 and by 61  % in 2010, compared to ploughed barley. By the end of October 2009, winter <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> undersown in May took up 74  kg N/ha, whereas the crop sown after barley in July took up 57  kg N/ha.

The trait was, however, unstable in subsequent generations. The physical localization of the radish chromosomal region carrying the Rfk 1 gene was investigated using 8 GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) and BAC-FISH (bacterial artificial chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization) methods. The metaphase chromosomes were hybridized using radish DNA as the genomic probe and BAC 64 probe, which is linked with Rfo gene. Both probes showed a signal in the chromosome spreads of the restorer line 4021 - 2 Rfk of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> {{but not in the}} negative control line 4021 B.

The aim {{of the project was}} to extract the 1801 crop returns for England from the National Archives, Home Office Papers, reference PRO, HO 67. The objective was to produce a transcript of the returns for subsequent publication. This was achieved in 1982 / 3 as Michael Turner (transcriber and editor), Home Office Acreage Returns (HO 67) : List and Analysis, (PRO, List and Index Society, in 4 volumes, 189 and 190 in 1982, and volumes 195 and 196 in 1983), 827 pp. Main Topics : The resource arises from a full transcript of the 1801 Crop Returns. The originals are contained in the National Archives, Home Office Papers, under the reference PRO, HO 67. The 1801 Crop Returns were collected by the Home Office in a period of concern about two issues: the recurrence of poor harvest {{in the second half of}} the 1790 s; and the suspected impending invasion by the French at the time of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The 1801 returns took the form of a census or audit of standing crop resources. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs devolved the enquiry to the bishops of the 26 dioceses of England and Wales that existed at the time. The bishops in turn organised their parish clergy to list the acreages of growing crops. The printed pro-forma employed for the purpose listed eight crops: wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, peas, beans, <b>turnips</b> or <b>rape,</b> and rye. Sometimes the clergy also volunteered the details of other crops and of other agricultural matters. The published collation of these details on a county by county basis, and within counties on a parish by parish basis, formed the printed version of the returns in 1982 - 3 and now also the digital version. Not all parish clergy were able to collect the required details, and some of the original pro-forma must have gone astray. However, something like 47 per cent by area of the parishes of England are covered ranging from over 80 per cent of Worcestershire, the Lindsey Division of Lincolnshire, and the Isle of Wight, to less than one per cent of Suffolk and zero per cent for Nottinghamshire. The omission of Nottinghamshire is a mystery since at the time it was mainly in the Diocese of York, and other counties associated with that diocese have on or over 70 per cent by parish area accounted for.

40|$|The {{presence}} of three B. rapa {{forms in the}} UK {{provides an opportunity for}} a unique study of the relationships between cultivated B. rapa, and weedy and wild derived from them - the escape from cultivation. A range of morphological characters have been studied along with the DNA markers, AFLP and microsatellites, using the same plant material. Morphological characters discriminated between wild, weedy and cultivated forms of B. rapa. Within the cultivated group, the morphological analysis separates B. rapa var oleifera winter and spring <b>turnip</b> oil seed <b>rape</b> varieties. B. rapa var rapa stubble turnip varieties are separated from root turnip. Based on morphological analysis wild and weedy groups are differentiated, but this is not supported by AFLP analysis. AFLPs, as neutral markers, reflect the agricultural histories of B. rapa cultivars. All B. rapa var. rapa and var. oleifera cultivars clustered together in principal co-ordinate plots, although two accessions of vars. rapa clustered with wild and weedy forms (traditional cultivars, ‘Hardy Green Round’ and ‘Lincolnshire Red Globe’). Significant levels of genetic variation was observed in all B. rapa accessions. Genetic evidence indicates that weedy B. rapa is derived from wild plants not directly from cultivars. The microsatellite analysis indicated significant distinctions in allele frequency between wild, weedy and cultivated forms. The population structure of cultivated and weedy B. rapa was distinct from the wild group, with much enhanced homozygosity. Inbreeding and founder effects may be important factors here. Some plants of wild B. rapa growing adjacent to B. napus show intermediate DNA and morphological phenotypes. This indicates natural hybridisation and backcrossing.

40|$|Bulb {{brassicas}} {{are used}} as supplementary feed in intensive pastures systems. However, {{there is a lack}} of quantitative data to define their growth and development. This has limited the creation and use of prediction models and decision support systems. Thus a series of experiments were used to clarify the growth and development of bulb turnips. Thermal time requirements for developmental phases of bulb brassicas were quantified and relationships to describe the time to bulb initiation were obtained in field and controlled environments. In the first controlled environment experiment cardinal temperatures were determined from germination of nine cultivars of forage brassicas and daily thermal time accumulation models were developed for three groups of forage brassicas and ‘Aparima Gold’ swede (Brassica napus spp. napobrassica). These models allowed the calculation of thermal time accumulation in two field experiments. The first field experiment evaluated ‘Aparima Gold’ swede and ‘Barkant’ and ‘Green Globe’ turnips sown on five dates from November 2008 to March 2009. A second field experiment evaluated ‘Green Globe’ turnip sown on four dates from December 2009 to March 2010 under two soil temperature regimes (covered with plastic sheets and uncovered). A second controlled environment experiment evaluated phyllochron and hypocotyl thickening of swede, <b>turnips</b> and <b>rape</b> cultivars sown on four dates and in three temperature regimes using two glasshouses and an outside environment from December 2011 to March 2012. ‘Aparima Gold’ swede had a thermal time requirement to 50 % emergence of 83 oCd (Tb = 0 oC) whereas the turnip cultivars averaged 56 oCd (Tb = 3. 6 oC). Total dry matter production of bulb brassicas was described by logistic curves where leaf production was the main component of yield until bulb development started. From this point, leaf production stabilized until leaf senescence became predominant and bulbs became the main component of yield. Dry matter yields decreased as sowing date was delayed and that was related to the total amount of radiation intercepted. Radiation use efficiency of ‘Green Globe’ turnips increased with mean temperature at a rate of 0. 07 g DM/MJ total/oC, from 10 to 20 oC. Bulb initiation was botanically defined as when hypocotyl was 10 mm thick and occurred at ~ 760 oCd for ‘Aparima Gold’ and at ~ 390 oCd for turnips. Until bulb initiation of ‘Green Globe’, increases in LAI (0. 4 m 2 /m 2 /oCd) and in leaf production (0. 3 kg DM/ha/oCd) were observed. From this point on, the relationship between the ratio leaf:root dry matter production and accumulated thermal time followed an exponential decline (R 2 = 0. 99) with a base parameter of 0. 995. Phyllochron of brassicas was not constant across sowing dates. The phyllochron of ‘Aparima Gold’ swede ranged from 52 to 106 oCd/leaf, ‘Goliath’ rape from 42 to 92 oCd/leaf (Tb = 3. 9 oC) and for turnips from 20 to 67 oCd/leaf across field and controlled environment experiments. Phyllochron increased with mean temperature at a rate of 3. 4 oCd/leaf/oC for ‘Green Globe’ and 3. 7 oCd/leaf/oC for ‘Barkant’ turnips from 7 to 21 oC. ‘Aparima Gold’ and ‘Goliath’ also increased phyllochron with mean temperature (2. 0 and 2. 8 oCd/leaf/oC, respectively) but further studies are recommended to uncouple the effects of temperature and photoperiod...|$|R
40|$|National audienceOver {{the past}} few years, {{research}} programs involving genetic, genomic and post-genomic sequencing of various living organisms have become fast growing areas of biology. Once the computational challenges of processing datasets have been dealt with; large and complex biological data still remain {{in the hands of}} biologists for interpretation. Projects such as Biomart and Intermine have been developed for the international community to facilitate exchange and comparison of complex biological data. However for non-model organisms, large heterogeneous biological datasets can be difficult to associate in order to obtain a comprehensive view. Overall, access and interrogation remain time consuming for biologists and integrating publicly available data is still an open challenge. Linked data and Semantic Web technologies benefit to biologists. Using RDF (Reference Description Framework); biological data can be described using triples that associate an entity (called subject), a relation (called property) and a value for the relation (called object). Data from different datasets can be integrated and the SPARQL query language support their analysis. Nevertheless; understanding and acquiring the query language can be a daunting task for biologists. Here we present AskOmics, a tool supporting both intuitive data integration and querying while shielding the user from most of the technical difficulties underlying RDF and SPARQL. The virtualization-based deployment of AskOmics makes the tool easy to manage, reliable and simple to install. For data integration, the user loads his data as tabulation-separated files structured according to simple principles. This structure allows AskOmics to generate automatically the corresponding RDF triples, and to store them into a triplestore such as Fuseki or Virtuoso. At this point, the user’s data are available just like in any SPARQL endpoint. AskOmics automatically generates an abstract representation of the dataset based on the types of the subject and object of its triples. For data querying, AskOmics provides a visually intuitive interface compatible with any SPARQL endpoint (that is one generated by AskOmics data generation function, or any regular triplestore). The user can then select a sequence of nodes in this simplified view, and AskOmics generates the corresponding SPARQL query that can be executed on the original dataset. For example; it could be difficult for biologists to identify features such as genes underlying localised genomic regions limited by genetic markers as it requires the users to combine different files. Tabulation-separated files containing genes and genetic markers could be uploaded in AskOmics with the following criteria: genetic markers and genes identified as entity, each entity is related to a chromosome and a position start and end with numerical values. AskOmics interface allows the user, without knowledge in SPARQL language, to either select genomic regions with distinct markers or simply provide numerical values as the lower and upper position. The intersection with additional features could be computed for producing lists of features such as genes underlying specific genomic regions. The result can then be downloaded as a tabulation-separated file. Currently under development, AskOmics will also support the integration of external databases to compare or complete new findings. AskOmics’ principle is generic. It has been applied successfully to the analysis of large scale datasets including genetic, epigenomic, transcriptomic profiles and orthologous relationships to identify genomic regions that are involved in the variability of Brassicaceae (Arabidopsis, cabbage, <b>turnip</b> and oilseed <b>rape)</b> in response to clubroot disease. About 2. 6 millions of triples were stored from 370   000 uploaded entities corresponding to genomic positions of genes amongst the four species of the Brassicaeae family as well as relationship data (orthology and transcriptomics).

40|$|Factors {{limiting}} barley yield {{have been}} reduced since the Green Revolution globally. Nevertheless, higher yields are pursued with the pressure to feed the increasing human population and domestic animals. However, sustainability can be impaired by the cereal monocultures, in particular, cereal-specific pathogen inocula can increase {{at the cost of}} diversity of soil microfauna. Use of pesticides has selected for resistance in weeds and pathogens. Use of mineral fertilizers has resulted in waste of resources and pollution. In Finland, about half of the arable land is used for continuous cereal production, and barley (Hordeum vulgare), as an important source for food and feed, is the most cultivated cereal crop. In this dissertation, research focused on evaluating the effects of various rotation crops on weeds, pathogenic fungi, soil fertility and yield of subsequent barley. The competitive ability of six crops, namely buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), caraway (Carum carvi), faba bean (Vicia faba), hemp (Cannabis sativa), common vetch (Vicia sativa) and white lupin (Lupinus albus) with weeds was evaluated in glasshouse and field experiments. In the glasshouse experiment, couch grass (Elymus repens) grown with buckwheat accumulated the least dry matter. Activated charcoal was used to exclude the effect of root exudates from donor crops. The results indicated that activated charcoal incorporated in the soil deactivated buckwheat root exudates that apparently inhibited the growth of couch grass. In the field experiment, buckwheat s fast growth and formation of effective leaf area inhibited growth of weeds most effectively among the crops tested. The effect of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> [Brassica rapa L. ssp. oleifera (DC.) Metzg. ] on several soil pathogenic fungi was evaluated in a field trial in two growing seasons involving five different cultivation regimes: mixed culture of barley and <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> sown after barley, and <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> incorporated as green manure either in autumn or in spring, with continuous barley monoculture as a control. Soil fungal community structure was monitored with capillary-based LH PCR of the ITS region using primers ITS 1 F/ITS 4. The mixed culture and sowing <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> after barley did not significantly decrease the relative abundance of Fusarium spp. Incorporation of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> plants into the soil, as a source of organic matter and nutrients, was associated with a low relative abundance of Fusarium spp. Fungal diversity was the lowest and the relative abundance of Fusarium spp. the highest in continuous barley. Higher fertilizer application and organic matter incorporation, leading to high fungal diversity, seemed more important in affecting Fusarium spp. than the allelochemicals of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> as <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> extracts did not detectably inhibit the growth of F. culmorum in an in vitro test. In growth media of different nutrient levels, 10 g soil were suspended in 100 mL sterile water, then 400 μL of the suspended solution was spread on the media of each nutrient level with four replicates. The number of fungal colonies was counted. The soil Fusarium CFU count was higher on nutrient-poor growth medium than on rich medium, supporting the results of field experiments. Results of sequencing indicated that Penicillium spp. might also tolerate low nutrient availability. In two experiments that ran 2010 - 2012 and 2011 - 2013, faba bean, <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> and barley were sown as first crops and their residues were tilled into the soil after harvest in blocks in the first year. In the following year, barley, buckwheat, caraway, faba bean, hemp and white lupin were sown in each block and incorporated either at flowering stage (except barley) or after harvest. Barley yield and grain protein concentration were determined. Mineral N concentrations in the plough layer two months after incorporation of crops and before sowing barley in the following spring were determined. In the third year, all the plots were sown with barley. The beneficial effect of faba bean and <b>turnip</b> <b>rape,</b> as first crops, on yields and grain protein concentration of barley was still detectable in the third year. Barley yields after white lupin, faba bean and hemp, as second crops, were higher than in continuous barley. Barley grain protein concentration was increased after faba bean. In contrast, barley yield and grain protein concentration were not improved after buckwheat and caraway. Incorporation of plants at flowering stage posed a risk of increased N leaching, suggesting that incorporation of plants should be delayed or catch crops should be used during winter to reduce N leaching. The response of barley yields to increased mineralized N from green manure or residues after harvest of rotation crops was significant only in the first experiment conducted in 2010 - 2012 suggesting that increased mineral N in the plough layer has minor influence on barley yield. Thus, rotation with faba bean, white lupin and hemp was beneficial to barley grain yield. In addition, barley grain protein concentration was increased after rotation with faba bean. Weed growth was most strongly suppressed by buckwheat as a complement to current weed management regime, but, rotation with buckwheat and incorporation of its residues did not improve the yield of the successive barley. The effect of glucosinolates of <b>turnip</b> <b>rape</b> on soil-borne pathogens was outweighed by high fungal bio-diversity suggesting that allelochemicals released from plants sown at a realizable density in the field are unlikely to control pathogens. Maintaining high microbial diversity through sufficient nutrient input is crucial to control pathogenic Fusarium spp. populations.

40|$|Summary Seed is {{the basic}} and most {{critical}} input for seed propagated agricultural crops: seed quality and seedling vigour determine plant establishment, growth and development in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Seed quality and seedling vigour are mainly determined by the interactions of the following three components: genetic background, physiological quality and the environmental conditions during seed set, seed ripening, storage, seed germination and early seedling development. In the past, many efforts {{have been made to}} improve seed germination and seedling vigour by optimizing physiological and environmental factors (non-genetic factors); however, the paradigm has shifted to investigate genetic factors and to use these to improve crop performance by plant breeding. The aim of this thesis is to unravel the genetics of seed germination and seedling vigour under different conditions in Brassica rapa, using a systems genetics approach. Studies in many crop species have reported that seed germination and seedling vigour traits are governed by many genes and are strongly affected by environmental conditions. As salinity stress is becoming {{one of the most important}} abiotic stresses affecting crop growth and yield, we studied the genetics of seed germination and seedling vigour under neutral and salt stress conditions. For a number of crops, it has been established that larger seed size and higher seed weight indicate more reserve food and contribute positively to seedling establishment. Therefore, our hypothesis for this thesis is that transcriptional regulation of genes during seed development determines the composition and content of seed reserves, and that these seed reserves play a major role in seed germination and seedling growth, especially at the heterotrophic stage under optimal and sub-optimal conditions.  B. rapa is an extremely diverse Brassica species which includes, besides many diverse leafy vegetable types and turnips, also oilseed crops. Brassica seeds are of high economic importance for several reasons. They are the starting point of the life cycle of the crop, but also they are directly used as sources of vegetable oil or condiments. At present, B. napus is the most important source of vegetable oil worldwide, but B. rapa is often used for introgression breeding to broaden its narrow genetic base resulting in genetic improvements. Therefore, the acquired knowledge is also useful for the scientific community and plant breeders working in B. napus and other Brassica species. In Chapter 2 we evaluated the genetic diversity of a B. rapa core collection of 168 accessions representing different crop types and geographic origins. Using the Bayesian cluster analysis software STRUCTURE, we identified four subpopulations: subpopulation 1 with accessions of Indian origin, spring oil, yellow sarson and rapid cycling; subpopulation 2 consisting of several types from Asian origins: pak choi, winter oil, mizuna, mibuna, komasuna, <b>turnip</b> green, oil <b>rape</b> and Asian turnip; subpopulation 3, which included mainly accessions of Chinese cabbage and subpopulation 4 with mostly vegetable turnip, fodder turnip and brocoletto accessions from European origin. The geographical distribution of the accessions was very much congruent with genetic, metabolic and morphological diversity. This initial study was followed by association studies for secondary metabolites from the tocopherol and carotenoids pathways, using the population structure of these four subpopulations as a correction term to control for spurious marker-trait associations (Chapter 2). Additionally, we used a machine learning approach, Random Forest (RF) regression, to find marker-trait associations. We chose the RF approach as it can handle large numbers of variables (markers, metabolites, transcript abundance) in combination with relatively small sample sets of accessions, to show its perspectives for application to the increasing amounts of data available through the different ~omics technologies. In our analysis, the markers showing significant association with metabolites identified by the RF approach overlapped with markers obtained from association mapping. Those markers could potentially be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding for these secondary metabolites in different morphotypes or sub-populations. Knowledge of genetic distance as evaluated in this chapter allowed the choice of parents to create a segregating population for QTL analyses by maximizing genetic variation between the parents. In Chapter 4, a doubled haploid (DH) population from a cross of genetically diverse morphotypes of B. rapa, an oil-type yellow sarson (YS 143) and a vegetable pak choi (PC 175) (Chapter 2), was used to evaluate the genetic basis of seed germination and seedling vigour traits under both non-stress and salt stress conditions. The yellow sarson parent had larger seed size and higher thousand-seed weight than the pak choi parent, and displayed earlier onset, higher uniformity in germination, faster germination and maximum germination, and higher root- and shoot- lengths and biomass under both non-stress and salt stress conditions. Positive correlations of thousand-seed weight with earliness, speed and uniformity of germination and maximum germination percentage, supports that larger seeds germinate earlier, faster, more uniformly and to a higher maximum germination percentage than smaller seeds. Thus, we conclude that yellow sarson had higher seed quality and seedling vigour than pak choi. However yellow sarson also contributed negative alleles to seed germination, as illustrated by its allele of the QTL at A 05 which decreases the uniformity of seed germination. In addition we also observed that yellow sarson seedling growth was more affected by salt stress than pak choi. All traits were scored over the DH population, and this clearly showed transgressive variation for most traits. Eight QTL hotspots were identified for seed weight, seed germination, and root and shoot lengths. A QTL hotspot for seed germination on A 02 co-located with a homologue of the FLOWERING LOCUS C (BrFLC 2) genes and its cis-acting expression QTL (cis-eQTL). FLC 2 (BrFLC 2 in B. rapa) is an important repressor of flowering time in both A. thaliana and B. rapa and recently, FLC 2 was reported for its pleiotropic effect on seed germination in A. thaliana. A QTL hotspot on A 05 with salt stress specific QTL co-located with the FATTY ACID DESATURASE 2 (BrFAD 2) gene and its cis-eQTL. Besides the role of FAD 2 in fatty acid desaturation, the up-regulation of this gene was associated with enhanced seed germination and hypocotyl elongation under salinity in B. napus (BnFAD 2) and A. thaliana (FAD 2). We observed epistatic interactions between the QTL hotspots at the BrFLC 2 and BrFAD 2 loci, and between other QTL hotspots. Seed development is regulated by many dynamic metabolic processes controlled by complex networks of spatially and temporally expressed genes. Therefore, morphological characteristics and the transcriptional signatures of developing seeds from yellow- and brown/black-seeded genotypes were studied to get to know the timing of key metabolic processes, to explore the major transcriptional differences and to identify the optimum stage for a genetical genomics study for B. rapa seed traits (Chapter 3). This is the first study of genome-wide profiling of transcript abundance during seed development in B. rapa. Most transcriptional changes occurred between 25 and 35 days after pollination (between the bent-cotyledon stage and the stage when the embryo fully fills the seed), which is later than in the related species B. napus. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified 47 gene modules with different co-expression patterns, of which 17 showed a genotype effect, 4 modules a time effect during seed development and 6 modules both genotype and time effects. Based on the number of genes in gene modules, the predominant variation in gene expression was according to developmental stages rather than morphotype differences. We identified 17 putative cis-regulatory elements (motifs) for four co-regulated gene clusters of genes related to lipid metabolism. The identification of key physiological events, major expression patterns, and putative cis-regulatory elements provides useful information to construct gene regulatory networks in B. rapa developing seeds and provides a starting point for a genetical genomics study of fatty acid composition and additional seed traits in Chapter 5. Since Brassica seeds are sources of vegetable oil, genetic studies of the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism is of high importance, not only in relation to seed and seedling vigour, but also for Brassica oilseed breeding. In Chapter 5, an integrative approach of QTL mapping for fatty acids composition and for transcript abundance (eQTL) of genes related to lipid metabolism, together with gene co-expression networks was used to unravel the genetic regulation of seed fatty acid composition in the DH population of B. rapa. In this study, a confounding effect of flowering time variation was observed on fatty acid QTLs (metabolite level) at linkage group A 02 and of seed colour variation on eQTLs (transcript level) at linkage group A 09. At A 02, fatty acid QTLs from 2009 seeds co-locate with the genetic position of a gene-targeted marker for BrFLC 2, its cis-QTL, and a major flowering time QTL. Flowering time variation is very obvious in this DH population and the BrFLC 2 gene at A 02 (16. 7 cM) is the major regulator of flowering time, with a non-functional allele in the yellow sarson parent. When QTL analysis was performed on seeds from 2011, from DH lines that flowered synchronously due to staggered sowing, this fatty acid QTL hotspot disappeared. The 2011 seed lot was used for further analysis combining fatty acid QTLs with eQTLs in this study. On A 09, a large trans-eQTL hotspot was co-localized with a major seed colour QTL, in the region where the causal gene, the bHLH transcription factor BrTT 8, was cloned. The role of this gene in seed colour development was functionally proven in B. rapa. As the yellow sarson and pak choi parents of this population have contrasting seed coat colour (Chapter 3) the DH lines segregated for seed colour. When seed colour variation was used as a co-variate in our statistical model, we could exclude its confounding effect on eQTL mapping. We compared the fatty acid QTL and eQTL results from the analyses before and after seed colour correction and later discuss the results from the analysis after correction. The distribution of major QTLs for fatty acids showed a relationship with the types of fatty acids: linkage group A 03 contained major QTLs for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), A 04 for saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and A 05 for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Using a genetical genomics approach, eQTL hotspots were found at major fatty acid QTLs on A 03, A 04 and A 05 and on A 09. Finally, an eQTL-guided gene co-expression network of lipid metabolism related genes showed major hubs at the genes BrPLA 2 -ALPHA, BrWD- 40, a number of seed storage protein genes and a transcription factor BrMD- 2, suggesting essential roles of these genes in lipid metabolism. Several genes, such as BrFAE 1, BrTAG 1, BrFAD 2, BrFAD 5, BrFAD 7, which were reported as important genes for fatty acid composition in seeds in other studies of related species, had relatively lower degrees of connection in the networks. However their cis-eQTLs co-localized with specific fatty acid QTLs, making them candidate genes for the observed variation. We hypothesize that these play a role in modifying fatty acid content or composition across genotypes, rather than playing essential roles in the pathway itself. These results suggest the need of a global study of lipid metabolism rather than a strict focus on the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway per se. This study gives a starting point for understanding the genetic regulation of lipid metabolism, by identification of a number of key regulatory genes, identified as major hub genes, and candidate genes for fatty acid QTLs. In the final chapter (Chapter 6) we summarize and critically discuss the relationships among phenotypic traits, metabolites and expression variation as well as the co-localization of QTLs from these different levels. In this thesis, we developed methodology to integrate transcriptomics and metabolomics data sets and to construct gene regulatory networks related to major fatty acids, and found a set of (possible) candidate genes involved in lipid metabolism. In the future, we recommend to integrate the genome-wide transcriptome data set with all major seed metabolites and phenotypic data on seed and seedling vigour to directly link all three components: transcriptome, metabolome and phenotypic traits, and ultimately expand the knowledge on the genetic regulation of seed metabolites, seed quality and seedling vigour in B. rapa to other Brassica species...|$|R
