Greil Marcus said Rakoff's stories are not as funny as those he read on the radio.|$|E

[...] Pistor said, [...] "The trouble is that you can't go out with animated films without a fast-food tie-in People don't take you seriously." [...] Hillenburg replied, [...] "Yeah, well, my take on <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't do that We didn't want to suddenly become the people serving up food that's not that good for you - especially kids.

LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I think the most important thing was something I didn't recommend; and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't become involved in Vietnam to the point where we would have to commit combat forces.

We did find a common voice, though we had different strengths. As an artist, Michael brought a great visual sense to the process. I was a people person who loved the characters and the dialogue. Through the collaboration, we learned a lot from each other and about each other. But the time came when I felt as if we were together 48 hours a day.

The valley is so narrow, and the banks are so steep, that there is no other possible place for the road except through the lower castle. The road has to twist and twine about, too, just before it comes to the castle gates, and after it goes away from them on the other side, so that every thing that passes along has some guns or other pointing at them from the castle for more than a mile.

40|$|A {{realistic}} {{analysis of}} antitrust must deal in positive terms with political influences. Political influences are especially {{strong in the}} antitrust arena, where decisions and policy measures often significantly affect the profitability of market players. It is thus important, in designing an antitrust regime, to acknowledge such influences and to design institutions and methods that will harness political aspirations to the achievement of antitrust goals. Accordingly, {{the goal of this}} article is to analyze the different effects political motivations might have on antitrust, and to suggest tools that may minimize such effects. A short theoretical analysis of the political economy of antitrust enforcement is followed by some recent and interesting examples of cases in which political influences shaped antitrust decisions. The conclusion <b>that</b> <b>is</b> reached <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should wisely recognize <b>that</b> politics cannot <b>be</b> simply ignored. Building upon this conclusion, the article then introduces and analyzes some institutional design mechanisms <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> applied in order to reduce political pressures and even harness them for the goals of antitrust...|$|R
