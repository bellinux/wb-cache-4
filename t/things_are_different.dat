Brewer said that her character would be torn when Mark returns, as she had moved on with Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) and Mark's reappearance [...] "just throws it all out of whack". When asked whether Kate and Mark's reunion would be bittersweet, McGregor explained [...] "Brennan and Kate definitely have chemistry and their parting was not because they {{had fallen out of}} love. But <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> now and Kate has a new boyfriend. When Brennan tells her he still loves her it's hard because she thought he was dead and had let go of him." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{is widely}} {{agreed that the}} mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the {{ancestor}} of all breeds of domestic duck (with {{the exception of the}} Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), which is not closely related to other ducks). Ducks are farmed mainly for their meat, eggs, and down. As is the case with chickens, various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth, and a well-covered carcase. The most common commercial breed in the United Kingdom and the United States is the Pekin duck, which can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of [...] in 44 days. In the Western world, ducks are not as popular as chickens, because the latter produce larger quantities of white, lean meat and are easier to keep intensively, making the price of chicken meat lower than that of duck meat. While popular in haute cuisine, duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry. However, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> in the East. Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments.|$|E

2500|$|However at 30MHz, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>different.</b> The {{oscillator}} {{would be}} set to 30.455MHz to produce a 455kHz IF, but a station on 30.910 would also produce a 455kHz beat, so both stations would be heard at the same time. But {{it is virtually impossible}} to design an RF tuned circuit that can adequately discriminate between 30MHz and 30.91MHz, so one approach is to [...] "bulk downconvert" [...] whole sections of the shortwave bands to a lower frequency, where adequate front-end tuning is easier to arrange.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> {{throughout}} the game if the player is playing as a neutral character. For example, {{the letter from}} Blackmore is to Cory, not Torque, telling him Torque doesn't really love him. During the scene when Torque sees Killjoy on his TV, Killjoy reminds Torque that Blackmore had manipulated Cory. When the helicopter attacks, it is piloted by Jordan, and in the drowning pool, Torque fights Copperfield. Later, Blackmore reveals that he gave Cory spiked drugs prior to Cory's murder of Malcolm and subsequent suicide. In the final battle, neither Blackmore nor Torque is able to win, and when they approach one another they are repelled away from touching. Blackmore points out [...] "Looks like we're going {{to play this game}} a while longer. I couldn't change you, and you couldn't get rid of me. The ties that bind, they'll keep us connected, but apart. And I'll be right here, standing over your shoulder." ...|$|E

2500|$|Numerous <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> {{throughout}} the game if the player is playing as an evil character. For example, {{the letter from}} Blackmore is to Carmen, not Torque, warning that Torque can't be trusted with {{the safety of their}} children. During the scene when Torque sees Killjoy on his TV, Killjoy reminds him that even though he killed his own family, Blackmore had convinced him that Carmen was planning on taking the children away. Later in the game, Jordan meets Torque prior to his arrival in the drowning pool and joins him on his way there. When the helicopter attacks, it is piloted by Blackmore, and Jordan helps Torque fight the Foundation soldiers. In the drowning pool, instead of fighting Copperfield, Torque fights and defeats The Creeper. In the final battle, Blackmore defeats Torque, and absorbs Torque into him. If the player has kept Jordan alive {{throughout the}} game, she then approaches Blackmore, asking if Torque is gone. Blackmore says he is gone [...] "for good," [...] and they kiss.|$|E
