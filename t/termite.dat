5|$|Various woods {{differ in}} their {{susceptibility}} to <b>termite</b> attack; the differences are attributed to such factors as moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content. In one study, the drywood <b>termite</b> Cryptotermes brevis strongly preferred poplar and maple woods to other woods that were generally rejected by the <b>termite</b> colony. These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica. The {{diversity}} of <b>termite</b> species {{is low in}} North America and Europe (10 species known in Europe and 50 in North America), but is high in South America, where over 400 species are known. Of the 3,000 <b>termite</b> species currently classified, 1,000 are found in Africa, where mounds are extremely abundant in certain regions. Approximately 1.1million active <b>termite</b> mounds {{can be found in}} the northern Kruger National Park alone. In Asia, there are 435 species of termites, which are mainly distributed in China. Within China, <b>termite</b> species are restricted to mild tropical and subtropical habitats south of the Yangtze River. In Australia, all ecological groups of termites (dampwood, drywood, subterranean) are endemic to the country, with over 360 classified species.|$|E
5|$|The king grows only {{slightly}} larger after initial mating {{and continues to}} mate with the queen for life (a <b>termite</b> queen can live between 30 to 50years); this {{is very different from}} ant colonies, in which a queen mates once with the male(s) and stores the gametes for life, as the male ants die shortly after mating. If a queen is absent, a <b>termite</b> king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement <b>termite</b> queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, sperm competition does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, <b>termites</b> are placed into two groups: the lower <b>termites</b> and higher <b>termites.</b> The lower <b>termites</b> predominately feed on wood. As wood is {{difficult}} to digest, <b>termites</b> prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because {{it is easier to}} digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher <b>termites</b> consume a wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower <b>termites</b> contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher <b>termites</b> only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|R
50|$|<b>Termites</b> eat one another's feces as a {{means of}} obtaining their hindgut protists. <b>Termites</b> and protists have a {{symbiotic}} relationship (e.g. with the protozoan that allows the <b>termites</b> to digest the cellulose in their diet). For example, in one group of <b>termites,</b> there is a three-way symbiotic relationship: <b>termites</b> of the family Rhinotermitidae, cellulolytic protists of the genus Pseudotrichonympha in the guts of these <b>termites,</b> and intracellular bacterial symbionts of the protists.|$|R
25|$|Numerous {{species of}} ants cohabit the nests of N. corniger or {{colonise}} them once the <b>termites</b> have abandoned them. Some species prey on the <b>termites</b> but others do not. Studies with radioactive tracers {{have shown that}} when cohabiting nutrients flow both ways between the ants and the <b>termites.</b> Monacis bispinosa, also known as Dolichoderus bispinosus {{is one of the}} most common ant species to cohabit with the <b>termites</b> but is susceptible to their chemical defences and cannot prey on live <b>termites.</b> Camponotus abdominalis associates with <b>termites</b> less often but is an aggressive predator of the <b>termites.</b> Camponotus species and Dolichoderus diversus have been found to inhabit N. corniger nests that have been abandoned.|$|R
5|$|The <b>termite</b> gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the <b>termite</b> hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the <b>termite</b> gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the <b>termite</b> hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E
5|$|When {{termites}} {{construct their}} nests, they use predominantly indirect communication. No single <b>termite</b> {{would be in}} charge of any particular construction project. Individual termites react rather than think, but at a group level, they exhibit a sort of collective cognition. Specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to start building. The <b>termite</b> adds these objects onto existing structures, and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers. The result is a self-organised process whereby the information that directs <b>termite</b> activity results from changes in the environment rather than from direct contact among individuals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Termite</b> populations can be {{substantially}} impacted by environmental changes including those caused by human intervention. A Brazilian {{study investigated the}} <b>termite</b> assemblages of three sites of Caatinga under different levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects. A total of 26 species of termites {{were present in the}} three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The <b>termite</b> assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory assays using animals require {{strategies}} to avoid stress and keep animals alive {{as long as the}} test demands. <b>Termites</b> live in a constant dark environment in their nests, but in studies that demand video recording, <b>termites</b> are exposed to light. Since light is a condition opposed to what <b>termites</b> naturally live, it is possible that this condition might stress <b>termites.</b> To find how suitable are lights in video recording <b>termites,</b> we evaluated the effect of infrared lights and cold white light in the survival of workers of Cornitermes cumulans (Termitidae: Syntermitinae) confined in Petri dishes. We compared the survival of <b>termites</b> in the light treatments and <b>termites</b> kept in the dark. As our null hypothesis, time until death would not differ between <b>termites</b> exposed to cold white lights, infrared lights, and <b>termites</b> kept in the dark. We found that the survival of C. cumulans workers was not affected by light since there was no statistical difference in the mortality between the three treatments. Here we show that both infrared lights and cold white lights can be used in lab assays to video record <b>termites,</b> as such lights did not affect workers survival...|$|R
500|$|<b>Termites</b> were {{previously}} {{regarded as a}} separate order Isoptera to cockroaches. However, recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that they evolved directly from 'true' cockroaches, and many authors now place them as an [...] "epifamily" [...] of Blattodea. This evidence supported a hypothesis suggested in 1934 that <b>termites</b> {{are closely related to}} the wood-eating cockroaches (genus Cryptocercus). This hypothesis was originally based on similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in <b>termites</b> regarded as living fossils and wood-eating cockroaches. Additional evidence emerged when F.A. McKittrick (1965) noted similar morphological characteristics between some <b>termites</b> and cockroach nymphs. The similarities among these cockroaches and <b>termites</b> have led some scientists to reclassify <b>termites</b> as a single family, the Termitidae, within the order Blattodea. Other scientists have taken a more conservative approach, proposing to retain the <b>termites</b> as the Termitoidea, an epifamily within the order. Such measure preserves the classification of <b>termites</b> at family level and below.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{directly}} {{killing the}} pests by poisoning {{the food of}} insects with RNAi, there are also other ways on how gene silencing pesticides can kill a pest. For example, a research study by Michael Scharf {{found that it was}} possible to eradicate <b>termites</b> by using RNAi which disables the Hex-2-gene; this transforms worker <b>termites</b> into soldier <b>termites.</b> A colony with too many soldier <b>termites</b> (apparently more than about 10%) does not have enough remaining worker <b>termites</b> to adequately feed the colony.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{unambiguous}} <b>termite</b> fossils date to {{the early}} Cretaceous, but given the diversity of Cretaceous termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects, they likely originated earlier in the Jurassic or Triassic. Further evidence of a Jurassic origin {{is the assumption that}} the extinct Fruitafossor consumed termites, judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite-eating mammals. The oldest <b>termite</b> nest discovered is believed to be from the Upper Cretaceous in West Texas, where the oldest known faecal pellets were also discovered.|$|E
5|$|To {{better control}} the {{population}} of termites, various methods {{have been developed to}} track <b>termite</b> movements. One early method involved distributing <b>termite</b> bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or soy milk proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in ants, the hind-wings and fore-wings are {{of equal}} length. Most of the time, the alates are poor flyers; their {{technique}} is to launch {{themselves in the}} air and fly in a random direction. Studies show that in comparison to larger termites, smaller termites cannot fly long distances. When a <b>termite</b> is in flight, its wings remain at a right angle, and when the <b>termite</b> is at rest, its wings remain parallel to the body.|$|E

40|$|This NebGuide {{provides}} information on biology and control of subterranean <b>termites.</b> <b>Termites</b> feed on wood and serve an important function in nature by converting dead trees into organic matter. Unfortunately, the wood in buildings is equally appetizing to <b>termites</b> and they cause serious damage to residential and commercial buildings. Two species of subterranean <b>termites</b> are found in Nebraska and both species have similar habitats...|$|R
5|$|Among all predators, ants are the {{greatest}} enemy to termites. Some ant genera are specialist predators of termites. For example, Megaponera is a strictly termite-eating (termitophagous) genus that perform raiding activities, some lasting several hours. Paltothyreus tarsatus is another termite-raiding species, with each individual stacking as many termites as possible in its mandibles before returning home, all the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails. The Malaysian basicerotine ants Eurhopalothrix heliscata uses a different strategy of <b>termite</b> hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces, as they hunt through rotting wood housing <b>termite</b> colonies. Once inside, the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles. Tetramorium uelense is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites. A scout recruits 10–30 workers to an area where termites are present, killing them by immobilising them with their stinger. Centromyrmex and Iridomyrmex colonies sometimes nest in <b>termite</b> mounds, and so the termites are preyed on by these ants. No evidence {{for any kind of}} relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Other ants, including Acanthostichus, Camponotus, Crematogaster, Cylindromyrmex, Leptogenys, Odontomachus, Ophthalmopone, Pachycondyla, Rhytidoponera, Solenopsis and Wasmannia, also prey on termites. In contrast to all these ant species, and despite their enormous diversity of prey, Dorylus ants rarely consume termites.|$|E
5|$|Ants are not {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} that perform raids. Many sphecoid wasps and several species including Polybia Lepeletier and Angiopolybia Araujo are known to raid <b>termite</b> mounds during the termites' nuptial flight.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{consumption}} (geophagy) {{has also}} been reported and likely helps with digestion, provides minerals and salts, and helps absorb toxins. Sifakas have been observed eating soil from <b>termite</b> mounds, possibly adding beneficial intestinal flora to aid the digestion of cellulose from their folivorous diet.|$|E
40|$|The diet of Ctenotus xenopleura, {{a species}} found in spinifex grasslands in the {{southern}} Goldfields of Western Australia, consisted primarily of <b>termites.</b> The high proportion of <b>termites</b> was consistent over different sampling periods, and was higher than observed for most other Ctenotus species. It {{is not clear whether}} this high proportion of <b>termites</b> is the result of specialised foraging for <b>termites</b> by C. xenopleura...|$|R
50|$|The {{symbiont}} hypothesis in <b>termites</b> {{is quite}} different from the others. With each molt, <b>termites</b> lose the lining of their hindgut and the subsequent bacteria and protozoa that colonize their guts for cellulose digestion. They depend on interactions with other <b>termites</b> for their gut to be recolonized, thus forcing them to become social. This could be a precursor, or pre-condition for why eusociality evolved in <b>termites.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{damage caused}} by <b>termites</b> costs the southwestern United States {{approximately}} $1.5billion each year in wood structure damage, but {{the true cost of}} damage worldwide cannot be determined. Drywood <b>termites</b> are responsible for {{a large proportion of the}} {{damage caused by}} <b>termites.</b>|$|R
5|$|Soldiers of {{the species}} Globitermes sulphureus commit suicide by autothysis– rupturing a large gland {{just beneath the surface}} of their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, {{entangling}} ants or other insects which are trying to invade the nest. Another <b>termite,</b> Neocapriterme taracua, also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical <b>termite</b> family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, they engage in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.|$|E
5|$|<b>Termite</b> alates only {{leave the}} colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate {{males and females}} pair up {{together}} and then land {{in search of a}} suitable place for a colony. A <b>termite</b> king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never go outside and spend {{the rest of their lives}} in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some <b>termite</b> colonies, including those with large individuals, can number in the millions.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{are among}} the most {{successful}} groups of insects on Earth, colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica. Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals. <b>Termite</b> queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world, with some queens reportedly living up to 30 to 50 years. Unlike ants, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, each individual <b>termite</b> goes through an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages. Colonies are described as superorganisms because the termites form part of a self-regulating entity: the colony itself.|$|E

50|$|Like most tanagers, masked crimson tanagers {{are mainly}} frugivorous, supplementing their fruit diets with small insects such as flying <b>termites.</b> Their insectivorous {{tendency}} {{is driven by}} the periodic cycle of the breeding of <b>termites,</b> which produce winged males and females when sexually active. These <b>termites</b> are richer in nutrients than normal wood <b>termites</b> and therefore it may become more ecologically sound for the masked crimson tanager to feed on these insects to supplement their existing diets.|$|R
50|$|This {{animal is}} an insectivore, feeding mostly on ants or <b>termites.</b> In areas that {{experience}} seasonal flooding, like the grassy plains of the Venezuelan llanos, anteaters mainly feed on ants, because <b>termites</b> are less available. Conversely, anteaters at Emas National Park eat mainly <b>termites,</b> which occur in high density on the grasslands. At Serra da Canastra, anteaters switch between eating mainly ants during the wet season (October to March) and <b>termites</b> {{during the dry}} season (May to September).|$|R
5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of <b>termite,</b> functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while <b>termite</b> queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the <b>termite</b> thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|Drywood {{termites}} {{thrive in}} warm climates, and human activities can {{enable them to}} invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods, containers and ships.

The kingfishers excavate their nest horizontally from the side and can dig {{out most of the}} <b>termite's</b> structure; the <b>termites</b> react by sealing themselves off from the cavity created by the birds. They also sometimes use hanging ant nests.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{compares the}} {{responses}} of <b>termites</b> to the lignin-degrading basidiomycete, Marasmiellus troyanus (Murrill) Singer, grown on different substrates, and examines the tunneling behavior of <b>termites</b> in sand treated with extracts of fungus-infected pure lignin versus solvent-treated sand. <b>Termites</b> showed a significant preference for lignin infected with M. troyanus versus uninfected lignin and sawdust infected with M. troyanus versus uninfected sawdust, but not cellulose infected with M. troyanus versus uninfected cellulose. When <b>termites</b> were presented {{with a choice of}} lignin versus sawdust, {{there were no significant differences}} in the response of <b>termites</b> in the tests where both substrates were uninfected or where both substrates were infected with M. troyanus.
