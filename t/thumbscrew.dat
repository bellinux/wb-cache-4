2500|$|Spotlights {{cast their}} light {{in just one}} {{direction}} and are known to run hot. [...] They attach at any screw-hole on the machine, using a short metal arm with <b>thumbscrew.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 'Singerlights' have an {{elongated}} bulb and shade which casts its light {{over most of}} the bed. [...] They attach to the machine's pillar access port underneath the round cover, sharing its <b>thumbscrew.</b> [...] The Singerlight compatible with 27-series machines is Singer part number B428. [...] It was originally invented by Frederick Diehl in 1921, and a coworker soon followed with additional patented improvements.|$|E

50|$|Bounty jumpers also faced torture. One {{method to}} torture bounty jumpers was {{by use of}} <b>thumbscrews.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Design {{changes to}} make the {{instrument}} more sensitive, simpler to read, and easier to transport resulted in variations such as the basin, siphon, wheel, cistern, Fortin, multiple folded, stereometric, and balance barometers. Fitzroy barometers combine the standard mercury barometer with a thermometer, {{as well as a}} guide of how to interpret pressure changes. [...] Fortin barometers use a variable displacement mercury cistern, usually constructed with a <b>thumbscrew</b> pressing on a leather diaphragm bottom. [...] This compensates for displacement of mercury in the column with varying pressure. [...] To use a Fortin barometer, the level of mercury is set to the zero level before the pressure is read on the column. [...] Some models also employ a valve for closing the cistern, enabling the mercury column to be forced {{to the top of the}} column for transport. [...] This prevents water-hammer damage to the column in transit.|$|E
2500|$|Leavis' uncompromising zeal in {{promoting}} his views of literature drew mockery from {{quarters of the}} literary world involved in imaginative writing. In a letter that Edith Sitwell wrote to Pamela Hansford Johnson in 1959 she described Leavis as a tiresome, whining, pettyfogging little pipsqueak. Leavis (as Simon Lacerous) and Scrutiny (as <b>Thumbscrew)</b> were satirized by Frederick Crews in the chapter Another Book to Cross off your List of his lampoon of literary criticism theory The Pooh Perplex A Student Casebook. In her novel Possession, A. S. Byatt (who was herself taught by Leavis) wrote {{of one of her}} characters (Blackadder) Leavis did to Blackadder what he did to serious students: he showed him the terrible, the magnificent importance and urgency of English literature and simultaneously deprived him of any confidence in his own capacity to contribute to or change it. Tom Sharpe, in his novel The Great Pursuit, depicts a ludicrous series of events ending in the hero teaching Leavisite criticism as a religion in the American Bible Belt. Leavis also appears as [...] "Looseleaf" [...] in Clive James's Peregrine Prykke. In his autobiography The Fry Chronicles, Stephen Fry described Leavis as a sanctimonious prick of only parochial significance and said that Leavis had an intense suspicious propensity to explode in wrath and anathematize anyone who dared disagree with him. Fry notes: ...|$|E
6000|$|Less joyful are the Laws against Refractory Priests; and yet no less needful! Decrees on Priests and Decrees on Emigrants: {{these are}} the two brief Series of Decrees, worked out with endless debate, and then {{cancelled}} by Veto, which mainly concern us here. For an august National Assembly must needs conquer these Refractories, Clerical or Laic, and <b>thumbscrew</b> them into obedience; yet, behold, always as you turn your legislative <b>thumbscrew,</b> and will press and even crush till Refractories give way,--King's Veto steps in, with magical paralysis; and your <b>thumbscrew,</b> hardly squeezing, much less crushing, does not act! ...|$|E
50|$|An AUI {{connector}} is a DA-15 (D-subminiature). It has {{a sliding}} clip {{in place of}} the <b>thumbscrews</b> normally found on a D-connector to hold two connectors together. This clip permits the MAU and MAC to be directly attached to one another even when their size and shape would preclude the use of <b>thumbscrews.</b> This clip is however frequently found to be awkward and/or unreliable.|$|R
5000|$|Dell, Inc. {{refers to}} {{standoffs}} that receive <b>thumbscrews</b> as [...] "hex nut screws" [...] and measures {{them with the}} Metric system.|$|R
50|$|Adjustable {{headrests}}: Round headrests that {{attach to}} seat backs via <b>thumbscrews</b> and brackets. Available for driver side and passenger side (1966 and prior only, without factory headrests).|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} aught of the {{ingenuity}} of Moorish torture?" [...] he asked him. [...] "You {{may have heard}} of the rack and the wheel and the <b>thumbscrew</b> at home. They are instruments of voluptuous delight compared with the contrivances of Barbary to loosen stubborn tongues." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he said deprecatingly, [...] "the cruelty now is {{no longer}} mine. Sir Percy's release is in your hands, Lady Blakeney--in that of his followers. I should only be too willing to end the present {{intolerable}} situation. You and your friends are applying the last turn of the <b>thumbscrew,</b> not I--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Time!" [...] roared Barwell Dawson, and the {{professor}} set the <b>thumbscrew</b> of his instrument. Then, through the magnifying glass, {{he read the}} figures and set to work with pen and pencil, making his computations, with his Nautical Almanac before him. All awaited breathlessly {{what he might have}} to say. Suddenly the aged man threw down the paper and pencil and threw his arms into the air.|$|E
50|$|As {{late as the}} mid-18th century, the ex-slave Olaudah Equiano, in his {{autobiography}} The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, documented the use of <b>thumbscrews</b> to torture slaves. During this period (mid-18th century), Thomas Clarkson carried <b>thumbscrews</b> with him to further his cause for {{the abolition of the}} slave trade and later emancipation of slaves in the British Empire. He hoped to, and did, inspire empathy with the display of this and other torture devices used on slaves. They were used on slave ships, as witnessed and described by Equiano and Ottobah Cugoano.|$|R
50|$|The device {{consists}} of two triangular metal plates connected at their corners by leveling <b>thumbscrews,</b> a bubble level, a locking mechanism and often an optical plummet. The centre of the bottom plate of the tribrach has a 5/8-11 UNC thread bolt hole {{which is used to}} attach the tribrach to the tripod. The top plate of the tribrach has three small holes or slots spaced at 120 degrees above leveling <b>thumbscrews,</b> and a locking mechanism which enables a survey instrument to be placed on the tribrach and locked in place.|$|R
25|$|I {{would be}} a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people {{of the public and}} we have found you wanting. The old Inquisition had its rack and its <b>thumbscrews</b> and its {{instruments}} of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the <b>thumbscrews</b> are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|R
6000|$|Veto after Veto; your <b>thumbscrew</b> paralysed! Gods and men may {{see that}} the Legislative is in a false position. As, alas, {{who is in a}} true one? Voices already murmur for a 'National Convention.' (December 1791 (Hist. Parl. xii. 257).) This poor Legislative, spurred and stung into action by a whole France and a whole Europe, cannot act; can only objurgate and perorate; with stormy 'motions,' and motion in which is no way: with effervescence, with noise and fuliginous fury! ...|$|E
6000|$|Friedrich Wilhelm's praises {{from the}} Protestant public were great, on this occasion. Nor can we, who lie much farther {{from it in}} every sense, refuse him some grin of approval. Act, and manner of doing the act, are creditably {{of a piece with}} Friedrich Wilhelm; physiognomic of the rugged veracious man. It is one of several such acts done by him: for it was a duty apt to recur in Germany, in his day. This duty Friedrich Wilhelm, a solid Protestant after his sort, and {{convinced}} of the [...] "nothingness and nonsensicality (UNGRUND UND ABSURDITAT) of Papistry," [...] was always honorably prompt to do. There is an honest bacon-and-greens conscience in the man; almost the one conscience you can find in any royal man of that day. Promptly, without tremulous counting of costs, he always starts up, solid as oak, on the occurrence of such a thing, and says, [...] "That is unjust; contrary to the Treaty of Westphalia; you will have to put down that!"--And if words avail not, his plan is always the same: Clap a similar <b>thumbscrew,</b> pressure equitably calculated, on the Catholics of Prussia; these can complain to their Popes and Jesuit Dignitaries: these are under <b>thumbscrew</b> till the Protestant pressure be removed. Which always did rectify the matter in a little time. One other of these instances, that of the Salzburg Protestants, the last such instance, as this of Heidelberg was the first, will by and by claim notice from us.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is not {{brave enough}} for that. The {{presence}} of it there would reveal itself by {{the motion of}} his hands. His fingers would always be on the pocket that contained it. I {{do not know what}} to think. And it is because I am in doubt that I have brought him under Mr Cheekey's <b>thumbscrew.</b> It is a case in which I would, if possible, force a man to confess the truth even against himself. And for this reason I have urged him to prosecute you. But as an honest man myself, I am bound to hope that he may succeed if he be the rightful owner of Llanfeare." ...|$|E
50|$|Those {{sentenced to}} forced labor often endured abuse {{at the hands}} of their jailers. They were habitually mistreated while imprisoned, with whippings and the use of <b>thumbscrews</b> as common punishments for minor infractions.|$|R
5000|$|Seat tilt mechanism: This {{will allow}} {{passenger}} to sleep or rest. Adjustable headrests: Round headrests that attach to seat backs via <b>thumbscrews</b> and brackets. Available for driver side & passenger side. [...] Short throw gearshift assembly: Reduces shift travel {{to give a}} sportscar-like feel. Michelin X tires: Exchanged for factory tires.|$|R
25|$|Balfour {{reached her}} breaking-point when Colville {{tortured}} her daughter. He placed the young girl's hands in <b>thumbscrews,</b> also called pinniewinkles, pulverising the child's fingers. Colville assured Balfour {{that she would}} not be executed if she confessed. She relented and finally Colville secured enough of an admission of guilt for the court to be able to sentence her.|$|R
60|$|There was but {{one thing}} quite fixed in his mind. Nothing should induce him to face Mr Cheekey, unless he should have made himself {{comparatively}} safe by destroying the will. In that way he almost {{thought he might be}} safe. The suffering would be great. The rack and the <b>thumbscrew,</b> the boots and the wheel, would, to the delight of all those present, be allowed to do their work upon him for hours. It would be a day to him terrible to anticipate, terrible to endure, terrible afterwards in his memory; but he thought that not even Mr Cheekey himself would be able to extract from him the admission of such a deed as that.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{want to take}} an observation, I {{watch my}} {{chronometer}} and wait until it is exactly twelve o'clock. Then I point the sextant in such a fashion that the rays of the sun, reflected downward, seem to meet or 'kiss' the horizon. As soon as I have {{the light of the}} sun in a direct range with the horizon, I use this <b>thumbscrew,</b> which sets the scale below, which, as you see, is divided into degrees, minutes, and seconds. As soon as I have read the scale by means of this magnifying glass, I consult this book I carry, the Ephemeris, or Nautical Almanac, and knowing the altitude of the sun, I readily calculate just where we are located, in degrees, minutes, and seconds north latitude." ...|$|E
60|$|Kindness still {{sealed the}} lips of Somerset; and he {{suffered}} himself once more to be set down to table with his innocent and criminal acquaintance. Once more the plotter plunged up to the neck in damaging disclosures: now {{it would be the}} name and biography of an individual, now the address of some important centre, that rose, as if by accident, upon his lips; and each word was like another turn of the <b>thumbscrew</b> to his unhappy guest. Finally, the course of Zero's bland monologue led him to the young lady of two days ago; that young lady, who had flashed on Somerset for so brief a while but with so conquering a charm; and whose engaging grace, communicative eyes, and admirable conduct of the sweeping skirt, remained imprinted on his memory.|$|E
60|$|Bell-mouthed flagons round a board; Suits of armor, shield, and sword; Kerchief {{with its}} bloody stain; Ghosts of the {{untimely}} slain; Thunder-clap and clanking chain; Headsman's block and shining axe; <b>Thumbscrews,</b> crucifixes, racks; Midnight-tolling chapel bell, Heard across the gloomy fell,-- These, and other pleasant facts, Are the properties that shine In the Legends of the Rhine.|$|R
50|$|Pairs of #4-40 UNC <b>thumbscrews</b> {{are used}} to fasten certain {{connectors}} to hardware ports. The screws are typically located {{on either side of}} D-subminiature connectors such as on VGA, serial, parallel, and legacy game controller ports. They are also more recently used on DVI connectors. The typical length for a #4-40 screw used in PCs is 3/16 in (0.1875 in).|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{tried the}} <b>thumbscrews</b> on me," [...] said Spence with a pitiful smile, glancing at his injured members. [...] "They wanted to {{force me to}} sign the Bond, which I {{declined}} to do--first, because it required me to perform impossibilities; and, second, because it was such as no Government {{in the world has}} a right to exact or freeman to sign. They were going to put the boot on me at first, but the officer in command ordered them to try the <b>thumbscrews.</b> This was lucky, for a man may get along with damaged thumbs, {{but it would have been}} hard to travel with crippled legs! I held out though, until the pain became so great that I couldn't help giving a tremendous yell. This seemed to touch the officer with pity, for he ordered his men to let me be. Soon afterwards your mother and I managed to give them the slip, and we came on here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} {{occasion}} for that," [...] Von Aert said contemptuously. [...] "A couple of turns with the <b>thumbscrew</b> will suffice {{to get out of}} a boy of that age everything he knows. Well, my friends, we will meet here tomorrow evening. I shall go round to the Market Square with Genet to see the result of this affair, in which I own I am deeply interested; not only because it is most important, but because it is due to the fact that I myself entertained a suspicion of the boy that the discovery of the plot has been made. I will take charge of these letters, which are for the time useless to us, but which are likely to bring ten men's heads to the block." ...|$|E
60|$|Was {{there any}} torment ever so cruel, ever so unjustifiable as this! He {{was asked to}} put himself, by his own act, into the <b>thumbscrew,</b> on the rack, in order that the executioner might twist his limbs and tear out his vitals! He was {{to walk into a}} court of his own accord that he might be torn by the practised skill of a {{professional}} tormentor, that he might be forced to give up the very secrets of his soul in his impotence;--or else to live amidst the obloquy of all men. He asked himself whether he had deserved it, and in that moment of time he assured himself that he had not deserved such punishment as this. If not altogether innocent, if not white as snow, he had done nothing worthy of such cruel usage.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{fifteen years}} I was the ruling power behind old Sancho Benavides, the Royal High <b>Thumbscrew</b> of the republic. You've seen his {{picture in the}} papers--a mushy black man with {{whiskers}} like the notes on a Swiss music-box cylinder, and a scroll {{in his right hand}} like the ones they write births on in the family Bible. Well, that chocolate potentate used to be the biggest item of interest anywhere between the colour line and the parallels of latitude. It was three throws, horses, whether he was to wind up in the Hall of Fame or the Bureau of Combustibles. He'd have been sure called the Roosevelt of the Southern Continent if it hadn't been that Grover Cleveland was President at the time. He'd hold office a couple of terms, then he'd sit out for a hand--always after appointing his own successor for the interims.|$|E
50|$|Other people {{contributed to}} the {{creation}} of these tuners: Walt Pittman, and Keith’s friend Loring Hall. Hall is credited with making the first prototypes, while Pitman created “better looking nuts, washers and <b>thumbscrews</b> to replace the 'off-the-shelf' hardware that Loring and Dan had.” Earl Scruggs also partnered with Keith and Bump as a co-owner until around 1970, and his endorsement greatly helped to market these tuning machines.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, most {{computer}} cases required {{computer case}} screws to hold components and panels in place (i.e. motherboard, PSU, drives, and expansion cards). From the 2000s {{there is a}} trend towards tool-less cases, in which components are held together with snap-in plastic rails, <b>thumbscrews,</b> and other methods {{that do not require}} tools; this facilitates quick assembly and modification of computer hardware, and is also cheaper to manufacture.|$|R
6000|$|During the {{remainder}} of the afternoon I was left to my own reflections, which were anything but agreeable; for I could not banish from my mind the threat about the <b>thumbscrews,</b> of the nature and use of which I had a vague but terrible conception. I was still meditating on my unhappy fate when, just after nightfall, one of the watch on deck called down the hatchway: ...|$|R
