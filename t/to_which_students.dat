25|$|The {{play was}} {{probably}} finished between 1600 and 1601, a period {{suggested by the}} play's referencing of events which happened during that time. A law student, John Manningham, who was studying in the Middle Temple in London, described the performance on 2 February 1602 (Candlemas) {{which took place in}} the hall of the Middle Temple at the formal end of Christmastide in the year's calendar, and <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>students</b> were invited.

25|$|The extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>students</b> {{acquire a}} range of social and {{cognitive}} thinking skills related to the proper usage {{of science and technology}} determines whether they are scientifically literate. Education in the sciences encounters new dimensions with the changing landscape of science and technology, a fast-changing culture, and a knowledge-driven era. A reinvention of the school science curriculum is one that shapes students to contend with its changing influence on human welfare. Scientific literacy, which allows a person to distinguish science from pseudosciences such as astrology, is among the attributes that enable students to adapt to the changing world. Its characteristics are embedded in a curriculum where students are engaged in resolving problems, conducting investigations, or developing projects.|$|E

40|$|As {{a policy}} goal, {{widening}} participation is increasingly associated with retention and completion.

Drawing on a study of undergraduates in the UK, this chapter explores the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>student</b> support services and wider informal support networks feature in students' narratives of retention.
