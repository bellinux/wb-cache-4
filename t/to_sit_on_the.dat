5|$|It is {{no longer}} {{possible}} for active parliamentarians <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee, except for the last half year of parliamentary representation, if they have stated that they will not run for re-election. This allowed Jagland and Valle <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee in 2009, while they were still elected. The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are to be represented in the committee. In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist Left Party, each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are not represented.|$|E

5|$|In early drafts, the elephant's name {{changed from}} Osmer to Bosco to Humphrey. The final choice, Horton, was {{apparently}} after Horton Conrad, one of Geisel's classmates at Dartmouth College. The bird's name changed from Bessie to Saidie and finally Mayzie. In the first draft, the elephant character volunteered <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eggs for the bird, {{who was very}} reluctant.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch.|$|E
5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steps of the Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and {{are not allowed to}} participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E

This would lead to him serving on the ICAEW council from 1948 to 1957.|$|E

5|$|Clarke held a big {{advantage}} in the campaign as he {{was supported by the}} Métis who had been looking for someone to locally represent them in the Legislature since the territory was formed in 1870. Clarke had also built his popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader. On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory. He defeated Moore winning nearly 64% of popular vote. His resounding win would make him the first elected member <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Territories council.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, he was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> University Council of Victoria's third university La Trobe on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a {{move away from the}} English tradition prevalent in Australia towards and American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.|$|E
5|$|To {{recognize}} the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. By tradition, freshmen are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{returned}} to Massillon in 1932, {{when he was}} 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6-2 record. Brown's strategy was {{to build up a}} disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late because he had to work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.|$|E

5|$|Fakih's father {{helped him}} become a trader, {{although}} Fakih continued to study independently. When the modernist Islamic organisation Muhammadiyah opened a branch in Gresik in 1922, Fakih {{was one of}} the first to join. Extremely active in the group, he became the Gresik branch's leader within three years, and under his leadership the group was formally recognised by the central Muhammadiyah administration. Through his work with the Muhammadiyah in Gresik, Fakih became better known. He later transferred to the branch in Surabaya, a much larger city where, in 1929, he was chosen <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city council. He also remained active in commerce, running a construction material trade and shipbuilding shop. During this period he served on the local chamber of commerce.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E
5|$|In London, as the {{amalgamation}} was formalised, Rhodes and Cawston sought public members <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{board of}} their prospective chartered company. They recruited the Duke of Abercorn, an affluent Irish peer and landowner with estates in Donegal and Scotland, to chair the firm, and the Earl of Fife—soon {{to become the}} Duke of Fife, following his marriage to {{the daughter of the}} Prince of Wales—to act as his deputy. The third and final public member added to the board was the nephew and heir apparent of the erstwhile Cabinet minister Earl Grey, Albert Grey, who was a staunch imperialist, already associated with southern Africa. Attempting to ingratiate himself with Lord Salisbury, Rhodes then gave the position of standing counsel in the proposed company to the Prime Minister's son, Lord Robert Cecil. Horace Farquhar, a prominent London financier and friend of the Prince of Wales, was added to the board at Fife's suggestion later in the year.|$|E

5|$|In the 1790s {{the house}} {{was used as a}} {{boarding}} school for young gentlemen run by a Mr William Sewell. From the 1860s until the 1940s {{the house was}} the home of the Revd. and Mrs. Thomas Smith and their large family of maiden daughters, one of whom, Miss Emily Harriet Smith, {{became one of the first}} women <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city council in 1920 and one of the first female Justice of the Peace. A noted horsewoman, the site of her former stables is now occupied, in part, by Sinclair House.She spent much of the winters abroad and her house was let in her absence. One of the many long standing residents was the Revd. Alfred Ainger, biographer of Charles Lamb and friend of Dickens, who resided here each year for the duration of his turn as residentiary canon of Bristol Cathedral, together with his niece and their dog.|$|E
5|$|The US$1 million ($ million today) {{project was}} {{initiated}} by Pittsburgh Pirates' owner Barney Dreyfuss, {{with the goal}} of replacing his franchise's then-current home, Exposition Park. The stadium was made of concrete and steel (one of the first of its kind) in order to increase its lifespan. The Pirates opened Forbes Field on June 30, 1909, against the Chicago Cubs, and would play the final game that was also against the Cubs on June 28, 1970. The field itself featured a large playing surface, with the batting cage placed in the deepest part of center field during games. Seating was altered multiple times throughout the stadium's life; at times fans were permitted <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass in the outfield during overflow crowds. The Pirates won three World Series while at Forbes Field and the other original tenant, the Pittsburgh Panthers football team had five undefeated seasons before moving in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The Kangxi Emperor reverted many of {{the bureaucratic}} reforms of the Oboi faction after 1669, but {{continued}} {{to rely on the}} Deliberative Council as a body of Manchu counselors whom he consulted {{on a wide variety of}} military and civil matters, especially those that were too sensitive or complex to handle through the regular bureaucracy. The emperor allowed the president of the Censorate <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Council, then in 1683, after the rebellion of the Three Feudatories had been suppressed and peace reestablished, he decided that the lieutenant-generals of the Banners would no longer be automatic members. After that, the Deliberative Council became more oriented toward civil administration. Nonetheless during the First Oirat–Manchu War, fought from 1687 to 1697 between the Qing Empire and the Dzungar Khanate, the Kangxi Emperor often consulted the Council on how to deal with Galdan, the khan of the Dzungars, and with the Dzungars' enemies the Khalkha Mongols. During his reign, the Council met on imperial request and transmitted the result of its deliberations to the emperor, who usually followed the Council's advice.|$|E
