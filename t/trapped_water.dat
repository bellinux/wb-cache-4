25|$|The {{base of a}} {{lava flow}} may show {{evidence}} of hydrothermal activity if the lava flowed across moist or wet substrates. The {{lower part of the}} lava may have vesicles, perhaps filled with minerals (amygdules). The substrate upon which the lava has flowed may show signs of scouring, it may be broken or disturbed by the boiling of <b>trapped</b> <b>water,</b> {{and in the case of}} soil profiles, may be baked into a brick-red terracotta.|$|E
25|$|Concrete can {{be damaged}} by many processes, {{such as the}} {{expansion}} of corrosion products of the steel reinforcement bars, freezing of <b>trapped</b> <b>water,</b> fire or radiant heat, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion, leaching, erosion by fast-flowing water, physical damage and chemical damage (from carbonatation, chlorides, sulfates and distillate water). The micro fungi Aspergillus Alternaria and Cladosporium 	were able to grow on samples of concrete used as a radioactive waste barrier in the Chernobyl reactor; leaching aluminium, iron, calcium and silicon.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{floaters}} is shrinkage of the vitreous humour. This gel-like substance consists of 99% water and 1% solid elements. The solid portion consists of a network of collagen and hyaluronic acid, with the latter retaining water molecules. Depolymerization of this network makes the hyaluronic acid release its <b>trapped</b> <b>water,</b> thereby liquefying the gel. The collagen breaks down into fibrils, which ultimately are the floaters that plague the patient. Floaters caused in this way tend to be few in number and of a linear form.|$|E

5000|$|In March 1879, Twyford {{released}} his first sanitaryware catalogue. The 1870s {{proved to be}} a defining period for the sanitary industry and the water closet; the debate between the simple <b>water</b> closet <b>trap</b> basin made entirely of earthenware and the very elaborate, complicated and expensive mechanical water closet would fall under public scrutiny and expert opinion. In 1875, the [...] "wash-out" [...] <b>trap</b> <b>water</b> closet was first sold and was found as the public's preference for basin type water closets. By 1879, Twyford had devised his own type of the [...] "wash out" [...] <b>trap</b> <b>water</b> closet; he titled it the [...] "National". The National met all of the requirements of the quintessential wash-out <b>trap</b> <b>water</b> closets, most defining, the shallow basin water reserve that would be forced through the water-sealed trap when flushed. The National came out as the market place's most popular wash-out water closet.|$|R
30|$|Higher run-up {{values were}} {{observed}} {{at the corners}} of the inner (rhombohedron-shaped) basin. They <b>trap</b> <b>water</b> inside and cause additional water level increase inside the inner basins.|$|R
25|$|The {{volcanic}} {{islands that}} comprise these island arcs {{are thought to}} have been formed from the release of volatiles (steam from <b>trapped</b> <b>water,</b> and other gases) being released from the subducted plate, as it reached sufficient depth for the temperature to cause release of these materials. The associated trenches are formed as the oldest (most western) part of the Pacific plate crust increases in density with age, and because of this process finally reaches its lowest point just as it subducts under the crust to the west of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{islands are}} part of a {{geologic}} structure known as the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc system and range in age from 5 million years old in the north to 30 million years old in the south (Guam). The islands are formed as the highly dense and very old western edge of the Pacific plate plunges downward to form the floor of the Mariana Trench and carries <b>trapped</b> <b>water</b> under the Mariana plate as it does so. This water is heated and boiled as the plate is carried farther downward and results in the volcanic activity which has formed the arc of Mariana Islands above this subduction region.|$|E
25|$|Overlying the Beacon Hill Formation, {{but found}} {{a little further}} down the {{hillside}} to the south, are the Bradgate Formation beds, the most notable {{of which is the}} Sliding Stone Slump Breccia rocks. Forming a line of crags below Old John, these are laminated mudstones, with layers of sandstone, mainly of volcanic origin. The beds are substantially warped, contorted and folded. Many of the more intricate folds and 'sag' patterns are thought to have occurred while the sediments were unconsolidated and water saturated. Suggested causes for these include slumping, earth tremors and fault-movements, <b>trapped</b> <b>water</b> or gases and volcanic bomb impacts. Outcrops of other rocks of the Bradgate Formation are found further down the slope. These are younger than and stratigraphically above the breccia, but the uplift from ancient mountain-building, the dip of the beds and erosion of overlying rocks mean that the younger rocks are encountered at progressively lower altitudes.|$|E

50|$|Most water closets, bidets, {{and many}} urinals have the trap {{integral}} with the fixture itself. The visible water surface in a toilet {{is the top}} of the <b>trap's</b> <b>water</b> seal.|$|R
50|$|The salt {{introduced}} into the cell denatures its proteins. The proteins coagulate, forming a matrix that <b>traps</b> <b>water</b> molecules and holds them during cooking. This prevents the meat from dehydrating.|$|R
500|$|The {{cause of}} the cracks was a rubber washer which had been {{installed}} on the first eight trains—rather than the conventional plastic cover—which was intended to protect the axles from ice and stones. Adtranz had delivered thousands of trains with the conventional method without cracks, but the washers <b>trapped</b> <b>water</b> and this caused them to corrode and crack. Adtranz had applied a coat of paint as the sole means to avoid corrosion to the axle. The DNV inspector had [...] "hardly believed his ears" [...] {{when he heard about}} it. In addition, the axles were undersized, and DNV stated that it was only under duress that they considered it safe to operate the trains at conventional speeds, and that all the axles would have to be replaced. On 30 August, NSB gave Adtranz two weeks to solve the axle issues unless the contract was to be revoked.|$|E
2500|$|Suttle Lake is {{the result}} of {{glaciation}} during the Pleistocene Epoch, when the Cascade Mountains were buried in ice. [...] A glacier carved out a deep valley leaving a lateral moraine where it stopped. [...] Over time, the moraine <b>trapped</b> <b>water</b> creating the lake. [...] Today, Suttle Lake occupies a long, narrow valley with relatively steep slopes to the north and south.|$|E
2500|$|Summer: During {{the summer}} months, rip {{currents}} {{can occur in}} Lake Michigan. This occurs suddenly and can sweep a swimmer far out into the lake. Rip currents are most prevalent on days with a strong north wind. Rip currents are created when masses of water is pushed against the shoreline by a north wind. [...] The mass of water becomes trapped between the beach and the first sandbar. As the wind continues, the volume of water increases until weight of incoming water and {{the mass of the}} sandbar are unable push back the growing volume of water behind the sandbar. [...] Then, the <b>trapped</b> <b>water</b> creates a narrow channel through the sandbar. The water rushes back into the lake forming a river in the lake. [...] Anything or anyone in the current is taken out into the lake.|$|E
5000|$|In 1887, Twyford {{exhibited}} in a catalogue the after flushing reservoir chamber {{in a previous}} basin <b>trap</b> <b>water</b> closet. He included it in his 1879 catalogue, calling the device the [...] "Lillyman"; however, regardless of its finer ingenuity compared to other products in the market, it did not match the success of its counterpart the National. It {{is possible that the}} Lillyman did not find success purely because of its poor placement in Twyford's catalogue, being in the back and sharing its page with the lower and cheaper models of <b>trap</b> <b>water</b> closets intended for the use of clients who were either poor or servants.|$|R
50|$|Another kind of <b>trap</b> is a <b>water</b> <b>trap.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>traps</b> use {{fresh meat}} as bait. In these traps, {{the meat is}} {{suspended}} with string above a pan of water. A bit of detergent {{is added to the}} water to break the surface tension. Yellowjackets coming to retrieve the bait will usually fall into the water after consuming the food and will drown.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the case}} of a wetsuit, the suit is {{designed}} to minimise heat loss. Wetsuits are usually made of foamed neoprene that has small closed bubbles, generally containing nitrogen, trapped in it during the manufacturing process. The poor thermal conductivity of this expanded cell neoprene means that wetsuits reduce loss of body heat by conduction to the surrounding water. The neoprene, and to a larger extent the nitrogen gas, function as an insulator. The effectiveness of the insulation is reduced when the suit is compressed due to depth, as the nitrogen filled bubbles are then smaller and the compressed gas conducts heat better. The second way in which wetsuits can reduce heat loss is to trap the water which leaks into the suit. Body heat then heats the <b>trapped</b> <b>water,</b> and provided the suit is reasonably well-sealed at all openings (neck, wrists, ankles, zippers and overlaps with other suit components), this water remains inside the suit and is not replaced by more cold water, which would also take up body heat, and this helps reduce the rate of heat loss. This principle is applied in the [...] "Semi-Dry" [...] wetsuit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trapped</b> <b>water</b> stagnation. The {{water may}} be trapped in human {{artifacts}} (discarded cans, plant pots, tires, dug-outs, roofs, etc.), {{as well as}} in natural containers, such as hollow tree trunks, leaf sheath etc.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{pioneering}} manufacturer was Thomas William Twyford, {{who invented}} the single piece, ceramic flush toilet.

25|$|Water in fuel {{can damage}} a fuel {{injection}} pump; some diesel fuel filters also <b>trap</b> <b>water.</b> Water contamination in diesel fuel {{can lead to}} freezing while in the fuel tank. The freezing water that saturates the fuel will sometimes clog the fuel injector pump. Once the water inside the fuel tank has started to freeze, gelling {{is more likely to}} occur. When the fuel is gelled it is not effective until the temperature is raised and the fuel returns to a liquid state.|$|R

Coldry PelletsThe {{incoming}} {{brown coal}} {{has now been}} converted into a Black Coal Equivalent (BCE) through the permanent elimination of structural and physical <b>trapped</b> <b>water.</b> These high energy pellets are available for thermal applications, as well as other uses.|$|E
50|$|A {{version with}} a self {{draining}} cockpit, the Mark II SD, {{was introduced in}} 1986. This was especially suitable for boats kept on moorings. However, the buoyancy sealed in the floor increases the inverting tendency and, when righted after a capsize, the <b>trapped</b> <b>water</b> causes instability. To help overcome this drain tubes through the aft tank were later introduced.|$|E
50|$|Suttle Lake is {{the result}} of {{glaciation}} during the Pleistocene Epoch, when the Cascade Mountains were buried in ice.

50|$|Acetalisation is acid catalysed with {{elimination}} of water; acetals do not form under basic conditions. The reaction can be {{driven to the}} acetal when water {{is removed from the}} reaction system either by azeotropic distillation or <b>trapping</b> <b>water</b> with molecular sieves or aluminium oxide.|$|R
50|$|The typical desired {{outcomes}} of these restoration projects are {{the restoration of}} oyster reefs to produce a fully functioning, three-dimensional bed system that provides associated ecosystem services and biological functions, such as marine biodiversity, shoreline protection, sediment <b>trapping,</b> <b>water</b> quality improvement, and recreational fishing opportunities.|$|R
40|$|In a confectionary factory, {{integrated}} pest-management {{techniques were}} used for 12 months. Ephestia cautella is the major pest in this industry. Its presence was monitored using pheromone <b>traps</b> and <b>water</b> <b>traps.</b> The most critical areas were identified and <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> were better at identifying these areas than pheromone traps. Intensive cleaning and structural improvements were carried out when necessary. <b>Water</b> <b>traps</b> {{have been used as}} a mass trapping system because they catch both males and females. Catches in <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> showed a decrease in population density after 8 - 9 months. In a confined area, a mating disruption system was applied to interfere with moth mating. Most females caught with <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> were mated, although in the area where mating disruption was applied, the percentage of unmated females was higher compared with areas where mating disruption was not used...|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Attritioning & ExtrudingA {{small amount}} of water {{is added to the}} mill attritioner, where the coal is sheared to form a coal paste. This {{intensive}} mixing initiates a natural chemical reaction within the coal which ejects both chemically <b>trapped</b> <b>water,</b> as well as physically absorbed water within the coal pore structure. The coal paste is then further masticated, finally being extruded into pellets.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a public}} {{statement}} on 15 February 2007, the EIT again strongly recommended that <b>trapped</b> <b>water</b> should be drained out urgently to minimise the potential spread of cracks. Karun Chandrarangsu, president of EIT, noted, [...] "Suvarnabhumi {{is like a}} patient in a coma who continues to suffer from severe bleeding. Stopping the blood flow now is more urgent and important than debating what caused the injury." ...|$|E

50|$|Hygroscopic {{compounds}} are {{all those}} substances that attract water in vapor or liquid from their environment, thus their use as desiccant. Many of them react chemically with water such as hydrates or alcaline metals. Others <b>trap</b> <b>water</b> as water of hydration in their crystalline structure, such as sodium sulfate.
