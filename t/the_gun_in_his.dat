5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> unstable sister's hands {{to make it look}} like a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} {{inside the}} house lasted for five minutes. A patrol officer nearby, Steve Leonard, heard the shots {{and headed to the}} scene, getting the address from multiple 911 dispatches. When he got to the house, he encountered an injured victim and immediately got between the victim and the house, as Huff was coming down the steps. Before the officer could complete his demand that Huff drop his weapon, Huff placed <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mouth and shot himself through the head.|$|E
50|$|Before the Overland Campaign began, Long divided his corps {{artillery}} {{into two}} divisions. Brown took command of one. It contained the battalions of Nelson, Lieutenant Colonel Robert A. Hardaway and Lieutenant Colonel Carter M. Braxton. On May 6, 1864, while seeking a position for <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> division, Colonel J. Thompson Brown {{was killed by}} a sharpshooter. Brigadier Generals Pendleton and Long praised their fallen lieutenant for his character and skill.|$|R
60|$|His big arm swept down, {{and when}} he threw it up <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> glittered <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand. Simultaneously with the latter action pealed out a shrill, {{penetrating}} whistle.|$|R

2500|$|The {{shipwreck}} {{may have}} been known to one or more local watermen before its discovery by archaeologists. [...] During the 1996 excavations, Texas Historical Commission archaeologists observed direct evidence that one of the four bronze cannons known to have been on La Belle had been removed from the wreckage some time before the 1995 discovery of the wreck, possibly decades earlier. [...] It was surmised that this {{may have been}} the action of a local shrimper who may have accidentally snagged and recovered <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> nets. [...] The whereabouts of this cannon remain a mystery, and no other clear signs of prior artifact recovery were observed at the wreck site.|$|E
2500|$|Daniel’s {{trial was}} held on December 15, 2008 at Lorain County Common Pleas in front of Judge James Burge. No [...] jury {{was present at the}} trial. His defense attorney, James Kersey, claimed that because of the {{enormous}} amount of stress put on him due to his severe infection, Daniel was much more susceptible to being influenced by the game. He argued that Daniel was not in the right state of mind to understand the finality of shooting his parents. He had been playing the game so long that he did not comprehend the fact that death was real and permanent. The prosecuting attorney disagreed, and said that Daniel showed no remorse for his actions and that he had tried to set up the shootings as suicide by placing <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> father’s hand. Daniel was tried for murder.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of November 10, 1912, just {{three days after the}} finish of Eugene V. Debs' 4th — and arguably most {{successful}} — campaign as the Socialist Party's candidate for President of the United States, [...] Wayland retired upstairs to his bedroom. There he opened a drawer and removed a loaded handgun. He carefully wrapped the revolver with a sheet to muffle the sound of the explosion. He drew a breath, placed <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand, raised it to his open mouth, and shot himself in the brain. Wayland never regained consciousness, dying shortly after midnight, November 11, 1912. Harried by the government, despondent over the failure of the Socialist movement to win the support of more than {{a small fraction of the}} laboring classes, tired of life, Wayland left an epitaph tucked into a book on his bedside table: [...] "The struggle under the competitive system is not worth the effort; let it pass." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{the fall}} of Bellegarde, de Flers began arming the local farmers. Ricardos wrote a letter on 3 July protesting this, and {{threatening}} to hang any civilian caught with arms. De Flers replied that all Frenchmen were soldiers and that their only uniform was the tricolor cockade. He also promised to retaliate if the Spanish began shooting civilians. De Flers drilled his troops {{so that they might}} fight the Spanish regulars on more equal terms. He also put his men to work building field fortifications around Perpignan and drafted experienced coastal artillerists to serve <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> redoubts. When <b>the</b> Spanish attacked again his efforts paid off.|$|R
50|$|Thrust and Dirge share a {{great deal}} in common. Thrust {{transforms}} into a stealthy fighter jet just like his partner. He also carries his weapon of choice, <b>the</b> Thrust <b>Gun,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg compartment and can attach a barrel to it for increased power.|$|R
50|$|He {{emerged as}} one of <b>the</b> top <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> high school days as a Red Cub. He was known for his outside {{shooting}} skills, which made collegiate scouts interested to recruit him. San Beda tried to ask him to stay while Ateneo, FEU, and La Salle also made offers.|$|R
2500|$|About {{one week}} after the game was taken away from Daniel, on October 20, 2007, he used his father’s key to unlock the safe and take it back, also taking his father’s handgun. Court reports stated that Daniel came up behind his parents as they were {{relaxing}} on their couch {{in the living room and}} said “Would you close your eyes, I have a surprise for you.” Daniel then proceeded to shoot both of his parents. His father said that “his head went numb and he saw blood pouring down from his skull.” [...] Daniel shot his mother in the head, arms, and chest, killing her. In court his father testified that after Daniel shot both of his parents, he tried to make the event look like a murder-suicide by placing <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> father's hand whilst saying to him “Hey dad, here’s your gun. Take it,”. A few minutes later, his sister and her husband, Heidi and Andrew Archer, came over for their prior plans of watching a baseball game together. Daniel lied to them that they should not come in because their parents had been fighting. Then, they heard groaning and pushed their way through to find the aftermath of the shooting. Heidi called the police, and before they got there Daniel made an escape attempt by driving off in the family’s van with the Halo 3 game in the passenger seat. The police caught up with him and forced him out of the van via road block. While police were handcuffing him, he yelled [...] "My Dad shot my Mom!" ...|$|E

50|$|In the bookstore, Carolina {{tends to}} El Mariachi's wounds. While he rests, she discovers <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> guitar case and realizes who he is. El Mariachi asks {{her to help}} him find Bucho. He goes to the town church and talk to Buscemi. Upset by the {{massacre}} at the bar, Buscemi convinces El Mariachi {{to give up his}} quest for blood. Outside the church, a man armed with throwing knives ambushes them, kills Buscemi and severely wounds El Mariachi. Bucho's men arrive at the scene, mistake the man (who dresses in black) for El Mariachi and kill him. They take the body back to Bucho, who realizes they have killed the wrong person, a hit-man named Navajas sent by the Colombians to kill El Mariachi.|$|R
60|$|At {{the sound}} of this disturbance, another figure, also clad in skins, emerged from <b>the</b> hut, a <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand, and ran towards us. On seeing me he too gave a cry.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Hank Leeson was {{running around the}} corner of <b>the</b> cabin, <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> hand. <b>His</b> call had aroused Joe and Darry, and they were pulling on their {{clothing}} with all speed.|$|R
60|$|The sudden {{end of his}} remark {{was caused}} by Nazinred firing, and {{thereafter}} rising with the shattered fragments of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand, and a little blood trickling {{from one of his}} fingers, while an expression of stern perplexity overspread his visage.|$|E
6000|$|... "The man has <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand. He {{goes down}} on his knees," [...] Pauline continued. [...] "The gun is pointed towards Mr. Rochester.

50|$|The scene changes: Starks {{is found}} {{lying on the}} deserted {{roadside}} near the dead policeman, with a slug from <b>the</b> policeman's <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> body. <b>The</b> murder weapon {{is on the ground}} nearby. Although he testifies there was someone else at the scene, he is not believed because of his amnesia. Starks is found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution.|$|R
5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice tried {{to go to a}} Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.|$|R

The exiles await rescue.|$|R
60|$|As {{luck would}} have it, Chet {{did not have to}} look long for the firearm. The moose had kicked the snow from part of the barrel, and the glare of the torch lit upon this. In a trice the youth had <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand. The moose was disappearing in the snow and darkness, but taking hasty aim, he fired.|$|E
60|$|Here {{they went}} to sleep; but the joiner, a grave and sober man, and not pleased with their lying at this loose rate the first night, could not sleep, and resolved, after trying it to no purpose, {{that he would get}} out, and, taking <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand, stand sentinel, and guard his companions. So, with <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand, he walked to and again before the barn; for that stood in the field near the road, but within the hedge. He had not been long upon the scout, but he heard a noise of people coming on {{as if it had been}} a great number; and they came on, as he thought, {{directly}} towards the barn. He did not presently awake his companions, but in a few minutes more, their noise growing louder and louder, the biscuit baker called to him and asked him what was the matter, and quickly started out too. The other being the lame sailmaker, and most weary, lay still in the tent.|$|E
60|$|He {{snatched}} at his {{gun with}} his other hand and the cowboys scattered a little. The cook stepped back, the gun flashed out, only to be suddenly lowered. Jim looked incredulously towards his left arm, which hung no longer helplessly by his side. He swung it backwards and forwards, and a broad grin slowly lit up his lean, brown face. He thrust <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> holster and held out his hand.|$|E
5000|$|Flow Gun (Hardware #29) - One of Hardware's unique weapons, this handgun is {{constructed}} by specially programmed nano-assemblers {{stored in the}} pods <b>in</b> <b>his</b> armor's shoulder pads. [...] When activated, the nano-assemblers leave their pods, travel down Hardware's arm, and assemble <b>the</b> flow <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand. [...] This process occurs so quickly that the nano-assemblers look like silvery liquid flowing down his arm, hence {{the name of the}} weapon. Hardware loads <b>the</b> flow <b>gun</b> with non-lethal ammunition like stun pellets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, then--it was Riggs!" [...] Roy grew still paler as {{he confessed}} this and his voice, almost a whisper, {{expressed}} shame and hate. [...] "Thet four-flush did it. Shot {{me from behind}} Beasley! I had no chance. I couldn't even see him draw. But when I fell an' lay there an' the others dropped back, then I seen <b>the</b> smokin' <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand. He looked powerful important.

50|$|At the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver Oelsner was {{embroiled in}} another {{controversy}} when {{he claimed that}} the sight on <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> he was using for the Biathlon had been sabotaged, smeared in something he thought might have been chocolate. He soon retracted the accusation and accepted responsibility, stating that whatever happened would have occurred when <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> care. Oelsner announced his retirement from competitive skiing {{at the end of}} the 2010 Games.|$|R
60|$|Kells {{did not see}} <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> madness {{he tried}} to move, to reach her, but he could not; he was sinking. His legs sagged under him, let him down to his knees, and but for the wall he would have fallen. Then a change {{transformed}} him. The black, turgid, convulsed face grew white and ghastly, with beads of clammy sweat and lines of torture. His strange eyes showed swiftly passing thought--wonder, fear, scorn--even admiration.|$|E
6000|$|Mat {{left off}} {{cleaning}} the gun, {{and began to}} fumble awkwardly {{in one of his}} pockets. After some little time, he produced what appeared to Zack to be an inordinately long letter, written in a cramped hand, and superscribed apparently with two long lines of inscription, instead of an ordinary address. Opening this strange-looking document, Mat guided himself a little way down the lines on the first page with a very unsteady forefinger--stopped, and read somewhat anxiously and with evident difficulty--then put the letter back in his pocket, dropped his eyes once more on <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lap, and said with a strong emphasis on the Christian name:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|And the man. Whose shape was that? No, {{this one}} had a golden beard. Ah! He lifted his head, from which the hat had fallen, and--did she dream? Nay, by Heaven, it was her husband, grown older and bearded, but still her husband. In the {{piercing}} agony of that happiness she sank back half-fainting, nor was it till he was almost upon her that she could gain her feet. He saw her, and in the dim light, mistaking her for a Zulu soldier who way-laid him, lifted <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand to fire. Already he was pressing the trigger when--when she found her voice and cried out: ...|$|E
25|$|Investigators said Gelhaus {{feared for}} his safety after Lopez {{turned around and}} {{allegedly}} raised <b>the</b> pellet <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> direction (a replica of an AK-47 that was an air-soft gun that fired plastic pellets). Gelhaus told investigators {{that he could not}} remember if he verbally identified himself as a deputy sheriff, although he was in a deputy sheriff's uniform and marked sheriff's patrol car before firing at Lopez; however, Lopez would not have seen the uniform or patrol car since the officers approached him from behind.|$|R
5000|$|On March 13, 1991, Mobley {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} from the Hall County Sheriff's Department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Mobley made a voluntary oral confession to Collins's murder and dictated a written confession. He made further statements on March 14 and 15, including the statement: [...] "The guy I was robbing {{turned around and looked}} at me. I said 'don't look at me, face the wall.' I pointed <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> direction and turned my head away and fired." ...|$|R
60|$|Inside of half an {{hour after}} breakfast the next day, Walter, {{stripped}} to the waist, was working over <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> <b>in</b> company with <b>his</b> friends and Steve Colton, the second gun-captain, and Carl Stuben, the hose-man. All were supplied with cotton waste, polishing-paste, and rags, and in a short while the bright portions of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> shone like a mirror.|$|R
