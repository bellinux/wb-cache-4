5|$|A christening ewer and basin {{made by the}} Garrard&Co. founder George Wickes in 1735 {{were used}} at the christening of the future GeorgeIII in 1738. His father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, had been banished from the royal court by GeorgeII and was {{forbidden}} to use the CharlesII Font. An inscription {{at the front of}} the ewer records its use at the christening of GeorgeIII's son, Prince Alfred, in 1780. <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ewer is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, symbolising the triumph of virtue over vice.|$|E
5|$|A new bow type, {{in which}} bone {{reinforcements}} cover <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bow {{as well as}} the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal. Fittings from this type of bow appear right across Asia from Korea to the Crimea. Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, {{at the mouth of the}} Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.|$|E
5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E

25|$|During this ceremony, {{the king}} {{also had to}} participate, {{although}} he was a Christian, {{and he had to}} drink of the mead that was offered and consecrated for Odin, Njord and Freyja. The peasants also wanted him to eat of the meat, but he only gaped over <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cauldron and held a linen cloth between his mouth and the meat. The peasants were not at all satisfied with a king who would not participate fully in the blót. The King had however, been seriously humiliated and later he converted to the old faith. The tradition says that he was buried in the old ways.|$|E
25|$|The bolt in {{the bolt}} lock is a {{rectangle}} of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward.

Small knobs extend through <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backwards freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade. The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG {{is similar to the}} Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.|$|E

25|$|After {{breaking}} {{the windows and}} the gas lamps on the outside, a group entered the building and committed various acts of vandalism. According to Perry's account, he, together with Augustus Howard and Alexander Courtney, broke into the building after a first unsuccessful attempt to open the locked doors. Someone ordered a fire truck brought over, and then Perry and a notary, John H. Isaacson, used the truck's 35-foot ladder as a battering ram {{to break down the}} doors. He entered with a few followers and reached the House of Assembly. A certain O'Connor attempted to block their entry, but Perry knocked him down with <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axe he was carrying. The mob took control of the room despite the resistance of a few MPPs (John Sandfield Macdonald, William Hume Blake, Thomas Aylwin, John Price) and sergeant at arms Chrisholm.|$|E
25|$|Bucket : This {{pattern is}} similar to the bowl except that one of the planets is in the {{opposite}} hemisphere to all the others. This lone planet, or Singleton, serves as a handle, thus creating a 'bucket' form. The bucket pattern indicates a desire to become associated with activity in the mainstream of society, so that the person feels they belong. However, what this often means is that the person expects the world to discover their own unique talents, rather than them trying to fit in. They will usually direct their efforts to a single purpose, and strive to achieve objectives rather than act solely for their own self-preservation. The person will probably behave according {{to the nature of the}} Singleton planet that forms <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pattern. This planet will exercise a greater influence than normal in the chart, and will be an important part of the dynamic of the person's activities and basic energy.|$|E
500|$|While {{the hand}} holding the gada changed, {{the design of}} the weapon {{transformed}} too. In late medieval art, especially Pala (8th–12th century CE), the size of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gada is reduced to a flute, while the top takes a highly decorated round form. In Uttar Pradesh, the handle is tapered and expands at the top; sphere on the top also depicted with flutes. The Chalukyan gada is thick and [...] "barrel"-shaped, while the Pallava gada is depicted thick throughout. The Cholas carve Kaumodaki thinner, but is ridged and segmented.|$|E

500|$|The hand cannon has a {{bulbous base}} at the breech called the yaoshi (...) or {{gunpowder}} chamber, where the explosion that propels the projectile occurs. The {{diameter of the}} Heilongjiang hand-gun's powder chamber is 6.6cm (2.6 inches). The walls of the powder chamber are noticeably thicker to better withstand the explosive pressure of the gunpowder. The powder chamber also has a touch hole, a small hole for the fuse that ignites the gunpowder. Behind the gunpowder chamber is a socket shaped like a trumpet where <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand cannon is inserted. The bulbous shape of the base gave the earliest Chinese and Western cannons a vase-like or pear-like appearance, which gradually disappeared when advancements in metallurgical technology made the bulbous base obsolete.|$|E

Bearing the proper name of Yildun, it has around 2.8 times the diameter and 47 times the luminosity of the Sun. A triple star system, Epsilon Ursae Minoris shines with a combined average light of magnitude 4.22. A yellow giant of spectral type G5III, the primary is an RS Canum Venaticorum variable star. It is a spectroscopic binary, with a companion 0.36AU distant, and a [...] third star—an orange main-sequence star of spectral type K0—8100AU distant.|$|E
