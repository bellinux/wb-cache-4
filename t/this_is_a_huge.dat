25|$|Mainstream {{record labels}} in India often ignore rock, {{with a few}} exceptions. Album sales range between a few hundred copies to a few thousand. They are rarely, if at all, {{affiliated}} to the Indian music industry, and sales are not usually monitored. Songs of Bollywood usually gain more popularity {{as compared to the}} songs of bands. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> set back. Bands also fail to sell their songs throughout the country even after making it available to major music stores, this is only due to lack of interest of people in rock bands. There are only a few bands that have become successful in selling their songs throughout the country. People who enjoy rock get the songs of their favorite bands, just by a click from any music website (sometimes their songs are uploaded by website administrators just after the day of release, this is illegal as per copyright law, but even then no action is taken). Hence, overall sales become less than expected. Bands in India mostly perform live shows with low priced tickets (as low as Rs. 100 or even less). Probably, the growing and the upcoming generation will have interest in Indian Rock and Metal. But care has to be taken to retain the copyright of the music.|$|E
500|$|Development of Baldur's Gate II {{began in}} January 1999. From the {{suggestions}} of fans on message boards and newsgroups, reviews of Baldur's Gate, and internal suggestions, {{a list of}} constructive criticism was compiled; from this list, a slightly shorter one of features {{to be added to}} the game was made. Some of the items on this list were: support for higher resolutions, such as 800 by 600 pixels and above; 3D support; non-pausing dialogue in multiplayer; drop off panels in the interface; character kits; dual-wielding of weapons; a streamlined journal and annotable map; deathmatch; and inclusion of famous AD monsters such as the dragon. Not many features had to be cut, and they kept as many as they could. Because of the engine's mature state of development, most features were fairly easy to add. Ben Smedstad, the producer of the game, said, [...] "The engine was up and running since day one, which is a huge morale booster. When a monster is complete, we put it into the 'override' directory and it appears in the game! <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> change from working on the original." [...] Late in the project, deathmatch was removed, while non-pausing dialogue, which proved [...] "the most problematic feature", was removed early on before being reintroduced in early 2000.|$|E

[...] The requirements or conditions may include mandatory programs such as a drug or alcohol treatment seminars, curfews, house arrest, or electronic monitoring. [...] Most offenders who receive conditional sentences are low risk and are usually serving time for impaired driving where no death occurred. When an offender receives a conditional sentence of home confinement in comparison to incarceration, the offender is still able to see family members, maintain a normal job, and attend school. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> advantage to conditional sentencing, since offenders are not completely cut off from the external world. [...] Although the offender is not locked away in a prison cell, the offender is still expected to stay at home during certain times of the day or night. [...] In order to verify that offenders are abiding by the restrictions placed on them, electronic monitoring is often used. The development of GPS, which allows law enforcement agencies to know the exact location of the offender by the use of satellites, has increased the effectiveness of offenders serving home confinement sentences drastically. Offenders can now easily be identified and tracked down through the use of GPS allowing law enforcement officers to quickly move in to make an arrest when an offender is in breach of their conditions.|$|E

Alison Rowat called Magicians [...] "an hour of OK telly trying to pass as a film", and gave it two stars. This assessment was shared by Leslie Felperin of Variety, who saw it as an [...] "attenuated TV episode", with only [...] "mildly amusing results", that was not as funny as Peep Show. Stuart McGurk gave a negative review, citing that [...] "for a much-anticipated film, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> let-down", and that it lacks [...] "the eclectic off-key cruelty and spot-on zingers of the much-revered Peep Show", although {{he did say that}} the film [...] "still has the odd good line", but concluded by saying that anyone [...] "expecting anything else will be sorely disappointed". The Guardians Phelim O'Neill gave Magicians two stars, calling it [...] "Peep Show the sequel", and stated that [...] "O'Connor's direction has absolutely zero visual flair, making the performers' transition from television to film rather pointless." [...] The Times Dominic Maxwell decided that [...] "Magicians doesn't have the brio (or great gags), let alone the marketability, of a Bridget Jones." [...] Caroline Westbrook gave the film three stars, and gave it an even review, stating that [...] "There's a lot to like about Magicians, especially if you're a fan of Mitchell and Webb", although it [...] "ultimately feels as though it's lacking something". She concluded that [...] "It's a perfectly agreeable way to while away {{an hour and a half}} - but don't expect to remember much about it in the morning."

I was determined, if not to camp out, at least to have the means of camping out in my possession; for {{there is nothing more}} harassing to an easy mind than the {{necessity}} of reaching shelter by dusk, and the hospitality of a village inn is not always to be reckoned sure by those who trudge on foot. A tent, above all for a solitary traveller, is troublesome to pitch, and troublesome to strike again; and even on the march it forms a conspicuous feature in your baggage. A sleeping-sack, on the other hand, is always ready--you have only to get into it; it serves a double purpose--a bed by night, a portmanteau by day; and it does not advertise your intention of camping out to every curious passer- by. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> point. If a camp is not secret, it is but a troubled resting-place; you become a public character; the convivial rustic visits your bedside after an early supper; and you must sleep with one eye open, and be up before the day. I decided on a sleeping-sack; and after repeated visits to Le Puy, and a deal of high living for myself and my advisers, a sleeping-sack was designed, constructed, and triumphantly brought home.|$|E

60|$|Men who {{remembered as}} far back as March 1858, when Colonel Bird ruled the land, {{declared}} that Akra had never felt an earthquake; but on the morning of April 14, 1862, there had been a sharp shock followed by sundry lighter movements, and lastly by the most severe. The direction was said to be north-south, and {{it was supposed to be}} the tail of a great earthquake, whose focus was behind Sierra Leone. A rumbling, like the rolling of guns, had been heard under the main square of Akra; the shocks were felt by the ships in the roads, and the disturbance was reported to have been even more severe up-country. When the wave reached Agbóme, Gelelé, King of Dahome, with characteristic filial piety, exclaimed, 'Don't you see that my father is calling for blood, and is angry because we are not sending him more men?'

In African phrase, while 'the metallic veins of Ashanti, Denkira, and Wásá lie twelve cubits deep, those of Gyáman are only five.' The ore dug from pits is of deep colour, and occurs mixed with red gravel and pieces of white granite (quartz). It is held to be rock-gold (nuggets), and more valuable than that of Ashanti, although the latter, passing for current, is mostly pure. This pit-gold appears in lumps embedded in loam and rock, of which 14 to 15 lbs. would yield 1 to 1 1/2 lb. pure metal. Nuggets are also produced, and chiefs wear them slung to hair and wrists; some may weigh 4 lbs. The dust washed from the torrent-beds is higher-coloured, cleaner, and better than what is produced elsewhere. It found its way to the Nigerian basin as well as to the Gold Coast, and was converted into ducats (miskals) and trinkets, chains, bracelets, anklets, and adornments for weapons. The King of Gyáman became immensely rich by the produce of his mines; and, according to Bowdich, his bed had steps of solid gold.|$|E
