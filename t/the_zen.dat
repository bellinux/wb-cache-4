5|$|Influenced by the Chinese Song and Yuan dynasties, Japanese {{monochrome}} ink painting called suibokuga largely replaced polychrome scroll paintings. By {{the end of}} the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (sansuiga) {{became the}} preferred genre for Zen painters, evolving to a unique Japanese style from the Chinese origin. Shūbun, who created Reading in a Bamboo Grove (1446), and his student Sesshū, author of Landscape of the Four Seasons, are the most well known priest-painters of the period. As with most of the early Japanese paintings, these works were created for Buddhist temples. At {{the end of the}} Muromachi period around 1573, ink painting had migrated out of <b>the</b> <b>Zen</b> monasteries, and was practised by artists from the Kanō school.|$|E

5|$|Japan's feudal era was {{characterized}} by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following {{the defeat of the}} Taira clan in the Genpei War, sung in the epic Tale of Heike, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed shogun by Emperor Go-Toba, and Yoritomo established a base of power in Kamakura. After his death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shoguns. <b>The</b> <b>Zen</b> school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Emperor Go-Daigo was himself defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336.|$|E
5|$|The bokuseki style {{developed}} from Song Dynasty calligraphy. It was brought from China to Japan, together with Zen Buddhism, starting with Eisai in 1191. Late-12th century works imported from China were highly regarded in Japan; subsequently Japanese priests began producing their own bokuseki in the 13th and 14th centuries. Later bokuseki {{became part of}} <b>the</b> <b>zen</b> practice and served as meditation help. They were often mounted on hanging scrolls, and displayed in temples and tea rooms. The master of the Japanese tea ceremony Sen no Rikyū considered them crucial to the tea ceremony {{in the sense that}} they put the participants in the right frame-of-mind. Bokuseki gained in importance through the chanoyu in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods. Daitō Kokushi and Musō Soseki, both from the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism, were the most famous bokuseki masters of the time.|$|E
