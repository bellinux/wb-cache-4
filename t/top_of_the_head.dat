5|$|Similarly, {{even when}} blind, house sparrows {{continue}} to be photoperiodic, i.e. show reproductive development when the days are long, but not when the days are short. This response is stronger when the feathers on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> are plucked, and is eliminated when India ink is injected under the skin at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to day length are located inside the brain.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} bony plates {{embedded}} in their skin, a trait {{that appears to}} have evolved independently several times. In certain other species, the skin at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> is compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is co-ossified with the bones of the skull (exostosis).|$|E
5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides {{of the back of the}} head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E

5|$|All true {{caterpillars}} have an upside-down Y-shaped {{line that}} runs from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> downward. In between the Y-shaped line lies the frontal triangle or frons. The clypeus, located below the frons, lies between the two antennae. The labrum is found below the clypeus. There is a small notch in {{the centre of the}} labrum with which the leaf edge engages when the caterpillar eats.|$|E
5|$|Halfbeaks carry several {{adaptations to}} feeding {{at the water}} surface. The eyes and {{nostrils}} are at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar {{to that of a}} pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, and swallow food items very effectively.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{women also}} {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one {{difference is that}} the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small pagri (top hat) worn on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> completes their ensemble.|$|E

3000|$|... (B) Balloon Rub – High Embodied. In {{the high}} {{embodied}} version, the Kinect sensor tracked the participant’s right arm movements. Specifically, at 60 HZ the sensor measured {{how often the}} participant’s right wrist joint moved {{up and down and}} used <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> that movement to map to <b>the</b> velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mannequin moving the virtual balloon up and down. The participants faced the screen and sensor, and were instructed to pretend they were rubbing a balloon on their hair. The mannequin on screen mimicked the participant’s right arm movements, the controlling algorithm for the system was designed using the distance from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participant’s <b>head</b> to <b>the</b> shoulder. Using the distance from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mannequin’s <b>head</b> to its shoulder, we mapped the balloon position to the same ratio, thus when the participant’s hand was 10 % from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>head,</b> <b>the</b> virtual, on-screen balloon was also 10 % from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mannequin’s <b>head.</b> <b>The</b> balloon locations were clamped at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> and bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detected human <b>head</b> so <b>the</b> balloon would move on a vertical axis and never go below the shoulder or above <b>the</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey differs in coloration from South American {{squirrel monkey}}s. While South American squirrel monkeys {{tend to be}} primarily greenish in color, the Central American species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and a black tip {{at the end of}} the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus {{are large}} and are at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> They are similar in {{structure}} to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. The cornea is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms {{a hole in the}} iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a blunt and rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. Across the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which {{there is only one}} pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E

50|$|Colaptes can {{be divided}} into two groups: The typical {{flickers}} (subgenus Colaptes) are slender and more terrestrial species with usually solid-colored <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads.</b> They occur all over the Americas except in polar regions. The forest flickers (subgenus Chrysoptilus) are more arboreal species; almost all of them have a red nape and a different-colored crown. They are found in South America; a group of three species formerly placed in Piculus ranges via the mesoamerican Cordillera north to Mexico.|$|R
5|$|An ant's head {{contains}} many sensory organs. Like most insects, ants have compound eyes made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes {{are good for}} acute movement detection, but do not offer a high resolution image. They also have three small ocelli (simple eyes) on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> that detect light levels and polarization. Compared to vertebrates, most ants have poor-to-mediocre eyesight and a few subterranean species are completely blind. However, some ants, such as Australia's bulldog ant, have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away.|$|E
5|$|As the Tairona of the Colombian Caribbean coast, the Muisca {{made the}} zoomorphic figurines {{based on the}} fauna with their habitat of the area. Main animals used for their figures were the frog and serpents. The serpents were made in zig-zag shapes with eyes on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Many serpentiform objects have the typical forked tongue of the snake {{represented}} {{as well as the}} fawns clearly added. Some of the snakes have beards, moustaches or even a human head. Researcher Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff theorised in his book Orfebrería y chamanismo in 1988 that the basis for the beards and moustaches may have been the abundant fish present on the Altiplano and essential part of the diet of the Muisca and their ancestors, as evidenced in Aguazuque; Eremophilus mutisii.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs or fork-crowned lemurs are strepsirrhine primates; {{the four}} species {{comprise}} the genus Phaner. Like all lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, {{where they are}} found only in the west, north, and east sides of the island. They are named for the two black stripes which run up from the eyes, converge on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and run down the back as a single black stripe. They were originally placed in the genus Lemur in 1839, later moved between the genera Cheirogaleus and Microcebus, and given their own genus in 1870 by John Edward Gray. Only one species (Phaner furcifer) was recognized, until three subspecies described in 1991 were promoted to species status in 2001. New species may yet be identified, particularly in northeast Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} of the various subspecies is uniform, with other races similar in size and plumage to the nominate race with slight variations in degrees of colouration and small differences in {{the length of the}} bill and the tail. Compared with L. i. indistincta, the male L. i. occularis has slightly darker feathers on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with a greater contrast between crown and nape, and a longer bill. L. i. melvillensis has a moderately darker throat and breast than indistincta, and the female has a shorter tail. In L. i. nupta the differences between the sexes are even slighter than in the nominate race.|$|E
5|$|The broad head is {{distinct}} from the neck, and the snout is blunt in profile with {{the rim of the}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> extending forwards slightly further than the mouth. Substantial cranial plates are present, although the parietal plates are often fragmented, especially towards the rear. A loreal scale is absent. Six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials are seen. At midbody, there are 23–27 rows of dorsal scales. All dorsal scale rows have keels, although those on the lowermost scale rows are weak. In males/females, the ventral scales number 130-145/128-144 and the subcaudals 38-54/36-50. Many of the latter may be divided.|$|E
5|$|The sand devil has a flattened, {{moderately}} {{narrow body}} with greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} of the head have smooth margins, without lobes. The large eyes are placed on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and have prominent spiracles behind. The nostrils bear thin, pointed barbels with smooth or slightly fringed margins. The wide mouth is positioned terminally on the head. The jaws contain 10 upper and 9 lower tooth rows on each side, with toothless gaps at the middle. Each tooth has a broad base and a single pointed cusp with smooth edges. There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|E

5|$|To enhance <b>the</b> {{illusion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> puppets, David Lane {{ensured that}} camera shots frequently omitted <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> and <b>the</b> visible control wires, and also incorporated low-angle shots for dramatic effect. Location shooting in Portugal was arranged for Lane, Derek Meddings and camera operator Alan Perry to film overhead landscape shots for the climax in which Alan rescues the Zero-X astronauts during re-entry. However, when the footage was deemed unsatisfactory, it {{was replaced with}} a painted backdrop made by associate producer Reg Hill.|$|R
5|$|Also notable are the spiracles on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs {{as well as}} gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development {{may have led to}} the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E
5|$|Peckham {{was very}} strict in his interpretations of canon law, and once wrote to Queen Eleanor that {{her use of}} loans from Jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was usury and a mortal sin. He also felt that Welsh laws were illogical and {{conflicted}} with Biblical teachings. He also mandated that the clerical tonsure worn by the clergy should not just include the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> but also have the nape and over the ears shaved, which allowed the clergy to be easily distinguished from the laity. To help with this, the archbishop also forbade the clergy from wearing secular clothing, especially military garb. He also forbade an effort by the Benedictine order in England to reform their monastic rule, to allow more time for study and for more education for the monks. Peckham's reason {{was that they were}} against custom, but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from the Franciscans.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E
