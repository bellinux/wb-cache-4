5|$|A German {{victory on}} the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely. It {{could only have}} been {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors and had been caught on the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> loss rates been reversed, Dowding could have replaced those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It {{would have been able to}} meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E
5|$|A {{scholar and}} teacher {{throughout}} his life, Priestley also {{made significant contributions}} to pedagogy, including the publication of a seminal work on English grammar and books on history, and he prepared some of the most influential early timelines. These educational writings were among Priestley's most popular works. It was his metaphysical works, however, <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> most lasting influence: leading philosophers including Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer credit them among the primary sources for utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E

5|$|CAB {{inspectors}} had inspected {{units at}} a Teterboro, New Jersey, Bendix Corporation plant and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of wires, thereby damaging them. The Bendix Corporation issued denials, {{stating that the}} units underwent 61 inspections during manufacturing, in addition to inspections during installation and maintenance work, and insisted <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> insulation on the wires been breached at some point, it would have surely been detected and the unit replaced.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{had arisen}} before the Giro {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that many of 's sponsors in Kazakhstan had not paid their full obligations to the team, and that the riders had therefore not been paid their full salaries to that point in the season.

3000|$|Since J is an (α,δ)-compatible ideal <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> IFP of a ring R, hence by Lemma  3.2, √(J) is an (α,δ)-compatible ideal <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> IFP of a ring R. Thus, √(J) is weak (α,δ)-skew Armendariz ideal.|$|R
30|$|First, {{introducing}} {{series of}} relevant polices about raising the fertility intention of “universal two-child”. The empirical analysis {{shows that the}} higher the fertility willingness of the “universal two-child policy”, the better the financial operation of pension fund. The following policies could be introduced: (1) maternity allowance for <b>the</b> families <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> second child, (2) income tax relief for <b>the</b> families <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> second child, (3) in implementing policies such as “low rent housing”, “affordable housing” give priority to <b>the</b> families <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> second child, (4) providing additional medical insurance benefits for <b>the</b> families <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> second child, (5) education fee, especially the cost at the university, is waivered for these families, (6) some preferential tax policies in domestic service industry are introduced, which reduces some pressure of rearing child.|$|R

5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a blue chip <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E

5|$|In hindsight, Callaghan {{was criticized}} for not putting his five ships <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{superior}} SG radar systems {{at the ends of}} his column, for not using one of them as his flagship, for directing the battle from his flagship's bridge instead of the radar plot, for not issuing his battle plans to his captains, and for issuing confusing orders during the battle. Analysis of the battle led to a rapid improvement in USN techniques for fighting in poor visibility, particularly in the adoption of combat information centers.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 2007, {{a project}} started <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> intent to replace all Westland Sea King {{search and rescue}} {{helicopters}} with new rescue helicopters by 2020. On 19 December 2013, a contract was signed between AgustaWestland and the government, {{for the purchase of}} 16 AW101 helicopters. The agreement came about after fierce competition between different manufacturers to satisfy the Norwegian requirements. Participants were AgustaWestland, Eurocopter, NHIndustries, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Boeing. The government considered that AgustaWestland AW101 met the requirements and specifications in the best possible way.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled {{backward into}} the Woodley Park – Zoo / Adams Morgan station and hit an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backward into the station. Safety officials estimated <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E

5|$|The Tariff Court {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} enclosure {{south of}} the agora and sharing its northern wall with it. Originally, {{the entrance of the}} court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall. However, the entrance was blocked by the construction of a defensive wall and the court was entered through three doors from the Agora. The court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.|$|E

LEPR drops the bundle {{with the lowest}} delivery probability. In other words, LEPR drops <b>the</b> bundle <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> lowest P. Lastly, HOP-COUNT drops <b>the</b> bundle <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> greatest number of hops and forwards <b>the</b> bundle <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> smallest number of hops. We also evaluated QM-EBRP against Optimal Global Knowledge (OGK), a scheme {{that is similar to}} [21] and [33]. In this policy, we assume that nodes are synchronized with a shared global memory to update bundle information such as the number of disseminated replicas. Accordingly, every node is instantly aware of the accurate number of disseminated replicas of each bundle in the network. This policy thus allows us to compare QM-EBRP against a theoretical scheme.|$|R

5|$|These {{additional}} {{revenues were}} expected, {{when combined with}} spending cuts including a reduction of $200 million in higher education spending, to meet the state's balanced-budget requirement. A clause was also inserted into the budget cutting state aid for schools that hold over $1 billion in endowments. The only school in New Jersey that fell into this category was Princeton University, which had an endowment with assets over $11 billion in 2006. The university <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> largest endowment next to Princeton {{at the time was}} Drew University which had a $225 million endowment fund.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E
