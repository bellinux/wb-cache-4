40|$|Basal body {{temperature}} recordings are extensively used to diagnose and treat infertility, but too great {{an emphasis on}} the interpretation of these charts might be counter-productive in managing these patients. Several gynaecologists who use <b>temperature</b> <b>charts</b> clinically were asked to score 60 charts taken from a selection of normal and infertile women, and their results were compared with those obtained by a group of non-experts. Since the full hormonal profiles had been obtained for each of the 60 charts the accuracy of the predictions could be assessed. About 80 % of the <b>temperature</b> <b>charts</b> were correctly interpreted by both groups as being either ovulatory or anovulatory but the day of ovulation was predicted correctly for only about 34 % of the charts. When the charts were examined retrospectively the thermal nadir was found to coincide with the luteinising hormone surge in 43 % of the charts from normal subjects but in only 25 % of those from the infertile patients.

50|$|Meteorology {{extensively}} uses both metric and customary units. The METAR {{reporting system}} {{in use in}} the United States differs from the one used by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in that wind speeds are delivered in knots (instead of meters per second), water-equivalent precipitation in hundredths of an inch, and altimeter setting in the customary inches of mercury (instead of hectopascals). Furthermore, temperatures are reported in whole degrees Fahrenheit but are converted to Celsius when encoded in METAR reports. Most synoptic observation charts are expressed in SI units, except for the aforementioned wind speeds, which must be converted {{for the purposes of}} calculation. Upper-air <b>temperature</b> <b>charts</b> typically use the Celsius scale (the freezing line is of great importance at lower levels of the atmosphere in determining precipitation type) while potential <b>temperature</b> <b>charts</b> use the kelvin; both of these are in line with international usage. Atmospheric vorticity is typically measured in full rotations per 100,000 seconds (a rough metrication of the day) but does not use the SI-recommended radian.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sleeping}} pads's warmth {{is characterized}} by R-value. But unlike sleeping bags' EN 13537 test standard and widely accepted recommendations, sleeping pad R-values lacks a simple mapping and label for 'how much warmth' a consumer should expect. Combining various standards and various authors' research, an approximate R-value to <b>temperature</b> <b>chart</b> follows: Same as EN 13537, a [...] "standard man" [...] {{is assumed to be}} 25 years old, with a height of 1.73 m and a weight of 73 kg; a [...] "standard woman" [...] is assumed to be 25 years old, with a height of 1.60 m and a weight of 60 kg. The sleeping bag and pad system (above, below, and sides) should provide the same insulation value all around a person, but cost, size, weight, comfort, and lack-of-knowledge often lead persons to reduce the R-value to below their personal 'recommended R-value'. Since the pad and bag work together, a 'warmer' bag can compensate the a 'thin' pad and a 'thick pad' for a 'cold' bag. Highly heat-conductive surfaces (e.g. concrete, granite) [...] require more insulation for the same temperature than insulating ground surfaces (e.g.snow, dry moss, loose soil, wood, etc.). More heat is lost downward when sleeping on one's stomach vs sleeping one's side (due to reduced contact area and cooler body parts in contact). Most persons can 'feel the cold ground' at approximately half the 'recommended R-values'.|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, at the Forest of Arden Inn are domiciled John Weems (Steppling), his wife Constance (Greenwood), and Reginald Jay (Reid). At the request of Reginald, John takes a lady customer (Lazzarini) out {{to look at the}} boy's ranch property. John and the woman are held up on the road when their machine breaks down. Meanwhile, Constance, who sees herself as a misunderstood wife, has been devoting her time to writing scenarios for motion pictures. She meets Reginald and insists that he play the part of the lover Orlando in her movie script. Jay then starts for the city in his automobile when he sees John and the lady customer coming out of a notorious roadhouse. Reginald is shocked, but John explains that they had merely entered the place for shelter during a rain storm. John discharges his chauffeur and Jay drives him back to the Inn. To complicate matters for John, the discharged chauffeur tells Constance that John was in the roadhouse with a strange woman, whereupon Constance decides to obtain a divorce. New staying in the city, John, aware that Reginald will be called as a witness since he has been served with a subpoena, induces Reginald to pretend that he is ill, and has hired two quack doctors, Drs. Macklyn (Geldart) and Widner (Littlefield), to carry out the scheme. The beautiful Nurse Durant (Daniels) is also hired, and Reginald quickly falls in love with her. Constance obtains Reginald's <b>temperature</b> <b>chart</b> and obtains an order of the court for his examination by a neutral physician. When he realizes his nurse has been fired, Reginald jumps out of bed in pursuit of her. He finds her and brings her back. Just before the neutral physician examines him, Nurse Durant kisses Reginald, and Dr. Flexner (Bolder) finds that Reginald's heart action registers badly. Constance, realizing that she has lost her Orlando, makes up her mind to retain her husband and asks his forgiveness. The two quack doctors then leave the place while the going is good.|$|E

The methods were compared with a reference method {{which was designed to}} identify all patients and infections in the study population (patients occupying 122 beds of a district general hospital). The selective methods were: - laboratory based ward surveillance - laboratory based telephone surveillance - ward liaison surveillance - laboratory based ward liaison surveillance - risk factor surveillance - <b>temperature</b> <b>chart</b> surveillance - treatment chart surveillance - temperature and treatment chart surveillance. The proportions of community acquired infection (CAI) and hospital acquired infection (HAI) detected by the selective surveillance methods varied; the highest proportion of CAI (70 %) was identified by treatment chart surveillance, and temperature and treatment chart surveillance, and of HAI (71 %), detected by laboratory based ward liaison surveillance. The time for data collection ranged from 1. 5 hours/ 122 beds/week for laboratory based telephone surveillance to almost 8 hours for temperature and treatment chart surveillance. The time for the reference method was 22. 1 hours/ 122 beds/week. Using the proportion of patients with HAI detected and time required for data collection to assess the methods, laboratory based ward liaison surveillance was the most effective and an efficient method. This method was revised minimally and introduced into six district general hospitals by infection control nurses. The time for data collection ranged from 4 to almost 8 hours/ 120 beds/week. The revision did not affect the proportion of HAI detected, however, the proportion of CAI identified was significantly reduced. The reproducibility of laboratory based ward liaison surveillance was good.

The study included 268 acutely febrile children under 5 years, 292 mothers, 75 doctors, 123 nurses. The main objectives were determining causes of fever in children and assessing knowledge, attitude and practices of mothers, doctors and nurses towards management of febrile child. The most common causes of fever in the study group were respiratory tract infections (61. 5 %) and malaria in (15. 7 %). Less common were diarrhoeal diseases (07. 1 %), otitis media (03. 7 %), urinary tract infections (02. 2 %), measles (03. 7 %), urinary tract infections (02. 2 %), measles (02. 6 %) and (07. 1 %) were other causes such as osteomyelitis, meningitis and viral infections. Mothers show poor knowledge about fever. Few mothers (1 %) believe that fever is beneficial. Only (15 %) can define it in terms of degrees. They treat it aggressively, worry about it and utilize harmful practices. It is found that cold sponging is used by two thirds of them (66. 1 %), one third use sponging as the first line of treatment, (12. 4 %) still use aspirin as antipyretic and high proportion used to practice self treatment of fever by drugs. There was significant correlation of mother’s knowledge attitudes and practices with educational level. Highly educated mothers have better knowledge, attitude and practices than low educated mothers. vi Few mothers (3. 1 %) use traditional methods to treat fever at home. The common traditional means were covering the febrile child’s skin surface with sesame oil for which other herbal materials can be added like garad or kammon. Other means lubkha, duckan, cauterization, scarring and uvula removal. There was significant difference in knowledge and attitude between house officers medical officers. and registrars. The later have better knowledge than house officers and medical officers. About fifty four percent of doctors in the study were house officers, (22. 7 %) were medical officers and registrars were also (22. 7 %). Most of them 70. 7 % know the cut-off level of fever, but high proportion (60 %) don’t know the pathophysiology of fever and treat fever to prevent convulsions. Only a small percentage (22. 7 %) is familiar with different antipyretic forms, concentrations and doses.
