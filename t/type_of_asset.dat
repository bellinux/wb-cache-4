2500|$|In the USA, a {{protective}} trust {{is a type}} of trust that was devised for use in estate planning. (In another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> protection trust.) Often a person, A, wishes to leave property to another person B. A, however, [...] fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before A dies, and that therefore B would receive none of it. A could establish a trust with B as the beneficiary, but then A would not be entitled to use of the property before they died. Protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation. A would establish a trust with both A and B as beneficiaries, with the trustee instructed to allow A use of the property until they died, and thereafter to allow its use to B. The property is then safe from being claimed by As creditors, at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trust's establishment. This use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders, and is frequently used as an alternative to them.|$|E

50|$|A {{common system}} is to allow a fixed {{percentage}} {{of the cost of}} depreciable assets to be deducted each year. This {{is often referred to as}} a capital allowance, as it is called in the United Kingdom. Deductions are permitted to individuals and businesses based on assets placed in service during or before the assessment year. Canada's Capital Cost Allowance are fixed percentages of assets within a class or <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset.</b> Fixed percentage rates are specified by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset.</b> The fixed percentage is multiplied by the tax basis of assets in service to determine the capital allowance deduction. The tax law or regulations of the country specifies these percentages. Capital allowance calculations may be based on the total set of assets, on sets or pools by year (vintage pools) or pools by classes of assets...Depreciation has got three methods only.|$|E
