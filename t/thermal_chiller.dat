40|$|Electricity-driven {{air-conditioning}} is energy-intensive {{and puts}} a strain to many grids during hot periods in warm climates. Solar thermal cooling could be an alternative to conventional cooling, using a renewable energy source and supplying the most energy during peak demand periods with insignificant effect to the electric grid. Office buildings in warm climates have high cooling loads, naturally peaking during daytime because of occupancy and ambient temperature. Thus, office buildings have a seemingly advantageous relationship between the possible supply of solar thermal energy and cooling demand. With this background, solar cooling systems for two office buildings with the same dimensions are investigated, placed in a tropical- and a sub-tropical location. There are great differences in the design conditions for solar cooling systems in the tropics and the sub-tropics, between the chosen locations Manila and Abu Dhabi more specifically. Manila has a quite evenly distributed cooling load while Abu Dhabi has a strongly pronounced summer season with very high maximum cooling loads, while the winter temperatures are relatively low. The prior described conditions creates {{a big difference between}} loads throughout the year, making a <b>thermal</b> <b>chiller</b> less effective in this aspect. However Abu Dhabi is expected to have an overall smoother- and ultimately a more high performance solar cooling system due to lower humidity, which facilitates the important cooling of the chiller. Evacuated tube collectors were used at both sites, where the collectors in Manila needs to be larger relative to the chiller cooling capacity, in order to compensate for the irregularity of direct solar radiation. The electricity price in Abu Dhabi is too low for the solar cooling system to be economically feasible compared to a conventional system, where the net values over 20 years are 163   000 € and 127 000 €, respectively. Manila has on its hand a very high price for electricity, making the 20 -year net values for both the solar cooling- and the conventional system approximately 170   000 €...|$|E

40|$|As the air {{conditioning}} system {{is one of the}} largest contributors to electrical peak demand, the role of the cold thermal energy storage (CTES) system has become more significant in the past decade. The present paper has reviewed the studies conducted on the energy and exergy analysis of CTES systems with a special focus on ice <b>thermal</b> and <b>chilled</b> water storage systems as the most common types of CTES. However, choosing a proper CTES technique is mainly dependent on localized parameters such as the ambient temperature profile, electricity rate structure, and user's habit, which makes it quite difficult and complicated as it depends on many individual parameters. Therefore, it was found that energy and exergy analysis can help significantly for a better judgment. The review paper has shown that the exergetic efficiency analysis can show a more realistic picture than energy efficiency analysis. In addition, the environmental impact and the economic feasibility of these systems are also investigated.

40|$|The {{addition}} of solar thermal and heat storage systems {{can improve the}} economic, as well as environmental attraction of micro-generation systems, e. g. fuel cells with or without {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) and contribute to enhanced CO 2 reduction. However, the interactions between solar thermal collection and storage systems and CHP systems can be complex, depending on the tariff structure, load profile, etc. In order to examine the impact of solar thermal and heat storage on CO 2 emissions and annual energy costs, a microgrid's distributed energy resources (DER) adoption problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. The objective is minimization of annual energy costs. This paper focuses on analysis of the optimal interaction of solar thermal systems, which can be used for domestic hot water, space heating and/or cooling, and micro-CHP systems in the California service territory of San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E). Contrary to typical expectations, our results indicate that despite the high solar radiation in southern California, fossil based CHP units are dominant, even with forecast 2020 technology and costs.

The total chemical composition determined by methods: total protein - Kjeldahl, carbohydrates, fats and total ash down in the relevant known methods. Samples have similar protein containing identical anatomical sites, have some differences in the content of fat and minerals. The results show that the water content of the turkey breasts and legs lower than with the chicken at about equal protein content. According to analysis of variance (ANOVA), a statistical difference was observed between the shear forces of refrigerated and frozen chicken legs, but no significant differences in the results of the shear characteristics of the refrigerated and frozen chicken breast samples were detected.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} recent years, {{research}} in thermal comfort during summer has induced {{a significant increase}} in electricity consumption in buildings due to the notable use of mechanical vapor compression air conditioners. Solar cooling systems are an attractive alternative to overcome this problem. The development of these systems requires a fundamental approach with the development of numerical models to predict the behavior of the whole installation. The ultimate goal is to estimate the comfort, the refrigerating power, the power consumption and the overall performance of the facility based on external factors (solar radiation, outside temperature, occupancy in the building). For this, we chose the EnergyPlus environment that is proving to become a reference tool in the field of building simulation.

40|$|Abstract. Energy is very {{important}} in our daily activity especially in commercial and industries sector. These requirements have increased {{from time to time and}} as the result it is significantly end up with high energy demand and high energy cost. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) can be used as an alternative solution to reduce high energy demand and to reduce energy cost. The main reason of using TES system is to shift high energy demand from peak period to off peak period. Meanwhile, for building owner is to reduce energy cost by take opportunity low cost energy during off peak period. The purpose of this study is to develop a split unit air conditioner by substituting the circulation system with chilled water.

40|$|Low lift cooling systems (LLCS) {{hold the}} {{potential}} for significant energy savings relative to conventional cooling systems. An LLCS is a cooling system which leverages existing HVAC technologies to provide low energy cooling by operating a chiller at low pressure ratios more of the time. An LLCS combines variable capacity chillers, hydronic distribution, radiant cooling, thermal energy storage and predictive control to achieve lower condensing temperatures, higher evaporating temperatures, and reductions in instantaneous cooling loads by spreading the daily cooling load over time. The LLCS studied in this research is composed of a variable speed chiller and a concrete-core radiant floor, which acts as thermal energy storage. The operation of the chiller is optimized to minimize daily energy consumption while meeting thermal comfort requirements. This is achieved through predictive pre-cooling of the thermally massive concrete floor. The predictive pre-cooling control optimization uses measured data from a test chamber, forecasts of controlled climate conditions and internal loads, empirical models of chiller performance, and data-driven models of the temperature response of the zone being controlled. These data and models are used to determine a near-optimal operational strategy for the chiller over a 24 -hour horizon. At each hour, this optimization is updated with measured data from the previous hour and new forecasts for the next 24 hours. The novel contributions of this research include the following: experimental validation of the sensible cooling energy savings of the LLCS relative to a high efficiency split system air conditioner - savings measured in a full size test chamber were 25 percent for a typical summer week in Atlanta subject to standard efficiency internal loads; development of a methodology for incorporating real building <b>thermal</b> mass, <b>chiller</b> performance models, and room temperature response models into a predictive pre-cooling control optimization for LLCS; and detailed experimental data {{on the performance of}} a rolling-piston compressor chiller to support this and future research. by Nicholas Thomas Gayeski.

40|$|The {{high energy}} demand on {{buildings}} requires efficient installations and {{the integration of}} renewable energy to achieve the goal of reducing energy consumption using traditional energy sources. Usually, solar energy generation and heating loads have different profiles along a day and their maximums take place at different moments. In addition, in months in which solar production is higher, the heating demands are the minimum (hot water is consumed only domestically in summer). Cooling machines (absorption and adsorption) allow using <b>thermal</b> energy to <b>chill</b> a fluid. This heat flow rate could be recovered from solar collectors or any other heat source. The {{aim of this study}} is to integrate different typologies of solar hybrid (photovoltaic and thermal) collectors with cooling machines getting solar trigeneration and concluding the optimal combination for building applications. The heat recovered from the photovoltaic module is used to provide energy to these cooling machines getting a double effect: to get a better efficiency on PV modules and to cool the building. In this document the authors analyse these installations, their operating conditions, dimensions and parameters, in order to get the optimal installation in three different European cities. This work suggests that in a family house in Madrid, the optimal combination is to use CPVT with azimuthally tracking and absorption machine. In this case, the solar trigeneration system using 55 m 2 of collector area saves the cooling loads and 79 % of the heating load in the house round the year...|$|R
40|$|The {{probability}} of frost damage {{at the time}} of budburst on the lateral shoots of young trees of Picea sitchensis in Scotland, and at Masset on the Queen Charlotte Islands, was determined from (a) the dates of budburst, predicted from past temperature records using a <b>thermal</b> time / <b>chilling</b> model, and (b) the dates of last air frosts of — 2. 5 C. The mean date of budburst occurred between 6 and 13 May at a range of Scottish sites up to about 250 m altitude, but it occurred about 6 days later for each further 100 m increase in altitude up to 550 m. This resulted from an interplay between <b>chilling</b> and <b>thermal</b> time requirements for budburst. In different years, budburst dates ranged from mid-April to early June. From 1920 to 1960 there was a trend towards warmer springs and earlier dates of budburst, which has been reversed since 1960. Potentially damaging frosts have occurred near the date of budburst once every 3 years (on average) at Eskdalemuir and Braemar during the last 66 to 107 years, and once every 3 to 5 years in many upland plantation regions of Scotland. The {{probability of}} damaging frosts was greatest in the period 1930 to 1960 when bud-burst occurred relatively early, and has been relatively small since 1960, because budburst has occurred relatively late. Renewed warming of the climate in future may increase the probability of damaging frosts coinciding with the time of budburst. Masset, on the Queen Charlotte Islands, from where Britain has jmported most P. sitchensis seed, has relatively cool springs so that budburst occurs relatively late (averaging 18 May). Also there are few damaging frosts at Masset after late April. Consequently, potentially damaging spring frosts have occurred there only once in 65 years...|$|R

Therefore, several ex situ clone collections were established throughout Europe for breeding and conservation purposes. This thesis was carried out within the RESGEN CT 96 - 78 project, which launched the EU-coordinated evaluation of these collections. The aim of this thesis was to analyse the variation in bud burst date and to acquire basic knowledge on the environmental control of this adaptive trait with regard to DED susceptibility. Bud burst date variation observed among collections and years in European elms was explained by a phenological model based on an inverse exponential relationship between <b>thermal</b> time and <b>chilling</b> to bud burst. According to the fitted curves, European elms have low dormancy and short chilling requirement for dormancy release. Bud burst date in U. minor was directly related to latitude and elevation. The order of bud burst was stable among years. The observed geographic trends were largely determined by difference in chilling requirement for dormancy release which increased with latitude and elevation. The effects of photoperiod and temperature on dormancy release in clones of European and Asian species were studied in partially controlled conditions in Italy. Dormancy was generally low and short in all clones. There {{was no evidence that}} photoperiod influenced dormancy release in these elms. Susceptibility to DED was assessed in the Italian clone collection. Susceptibility varied greatly among taxonomic groups and within the most represented species, U. minor. In this species, DED susceptibility was directly correlated with geographic origin and date of bud burst, southern and early flushing clones showing the least symptoms. The results suggest that earliness of bud burst represents a mechanism of disease avoidance owing to an asynchrony between the susceptible period in the host and the time of natural infection by Scolytus insects, the main vectors of DED...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were undertaken {{to predict the}} yield of 'Earligold' muskmelon grown with plastic mulches, rowcovers and thermal water tubes. Mulches were either black, photoselective or clear. Rowcover systems included a clear perforated polyethylene, a polypropylene agrotextile, or unperforated polyethylenes (standard or infra-red treated) with a water-filled tube. In all tunnel types, the photoselective mulch had an intermediate effect between clear and black mulch on air and soil temperatures, chilling injury and days to flowering. Plants with a clear mulch and an infrared or standard unperforated tunnel with a <b>thermal</b> tube survived <b>chilling</b> temperatures between 1. 6 - 5. 8 C for seven days, flowered first, had the heaviest biomass at anthesis and had the highest early yields. Plant dry weight from transplanting to anthesis was predicted from a multiple linear regression based on heat unit formulas using air (base temperature of 14 C, maximum threshold of 40 C) and soil temperatures (base temperature of 12 C). The base temperature for predicting developmental time to anthesis of perfect flowers was 6. 8 C. In order to study fruit growth, a rapid and non-destructive method for estimating volume of ovaries was established. Fruit phenology was described as six classes for flower development and seven for fruit development. Flower abortion was studied in relation to each class. Plants displayed either one or two fruit growth cycles. The second cycle was triggered as the absolute growth rate of the first cycle fruits decreased. Developmental time of individual fruits was predicted from a heat unit formula with a base temperature of 15 C when temperatures were recorded from a meteorological station. Another heat unit formula was proposed for air temperature at 7. 5 cm. Fruit growth from the second cycle had a 60 -degree day lag.

40|$|In the {{supermarket}} environment three different groups must be considered: food (food quality), personnel (working conditions) and customers. Customers {{are of particular}} interest since they make up the commercial basis for {{the supermarket}}. Currently, however, there are no recommendations on the indoor environment for this category. To start a discussion on this topic {{and to provide a}} tentative recommendation, this thesis presents a state-of-the-art overview related to different systems and their operation in supermarkets as well as theories for the thermal balance of humans, display cabinets and refrigerated food. Few studies compare the perceived indoor thermal environment in supermarkets based on questionnaires with simultaneous measurements of the thermal environment. In this thesis the findings of such investigations in the cold environment of chilled food display cabinets are discussed. The basic hypothesis is that objective measures can be used in order to estimate the perceived thermal environment sufficiently well, with the following assumptions and limitations: •	the comfort equation in ISO 7730 can be used to estimate the perceived thermal comfort (Predicted Mean Vote, PMV), in a supermarket. •	the comfort equation can be used outside its verified range in terms of thermal gradients and residence time sufficiently well to prescribe suitable thermal environments for customers and personnel in supermarkets. •	the mean temperature at the point of residence is more important for the perceived comfort than the temperature gradient between ankle and head. •	questionnaires can be used to evaluate thermal comfort for customers and personnel in a supermarket environment. This work shows {{that it is possible to}} use objective measurements in order to estimate the perceived thermal environment in supermarkets, with some limitations. Perceived and predicted PMV have shown systematic interdependence. In summer, however, differences between the measures tend to be larger. For customers, the perceived PMV is lower during the summer. The perception, however, is not as low as the predicted PMV would indicate. One reason is probably that in summer customers are wearing light clothes, light indoor shoes and are more exposed to the cold environment than the case would be in winter. However, customers do not stay very long in this environment and it is not necessary to account for a long exposure time in the cold environment. As a result of this work the thesis proposes some guiding principles for an appropriate <b>thermal</b> environment in <b>chilled</b> food aisles and discusses some ideas for future work...|$|R
40|$|Optimization of the {{performance}} of absorption systems during transient operations such as start-up and shut-down is particularly important for small-capacity chillers and heat pumps to minimize lifecycle costs. Dynamic models in the literature have been used to study responses to step changes in a single parameter, but more complex processes such as system start-up have not been studied in detail. A robust system-level model for simulating the transient behavior of an absorption chiller is developed here. Individual heat and mass exchangers are modeled using detailed segmental models. The UA-values and thermal masses of heat exchangers used in the model are representative of a practical operational <b>chiller.</b> <b>Thermal</b> masses of the heat exchangers and energy storage in the heat exchanging fluids are accounted for to achieve realistic transient simulation of the heat transfer processes in the chiller. The pressure drop due to fluid flow across the heat exchangers is considered negligible in comparison to the pressure difference between the high- and low-side components (~ 1. 5 MPa). In components with significant mass transfer effects, reduced-order models are employed to decrease computational costs while also maintaining accurate system response. Mass and species storage in the cycle are modeled using storage devices. The storage devices account for expansion and contraction of the refrigerant and solution in the cycle as the system goes through start-up, shut-down, and other transient events. A counterflow falling film desorber model is employed to account for the heat and mass transfer interactions between the liquid and vapor phases, inside the desorber. The liquid film flows down counter to the rising vapor, thereby exchanging heat with the counterflowing heated coupling fluid. A segmented model is used to account for these processes, and a solver is developed for performing rapid iteration and quick estimation of unknown vapor and liquid states at the outlet of each segment of the desorber. Other components such as the rectifier, expansion valves and solution pump are modeled as quasi-steady devices. System start-up is simulated from ambient conditions, and the coupling fluid temperatures are assumed to start up to their steady-state values within the first 90 s of simulation. It is observed that the system attains steady-state in approximately 550 s. The evaporator cooling duty and COP of the chiller during steady-state are observed to be 3. 41 kW and 0. 60, respectively. Steady-state parameters such as flow rates, heat transfer rates and concentrations are found to match closely with results from simulations using corresponding steady-state models. Several control responses are investigated using this dynamic simulation model. System responses to step changes in the desorber coupling fluid temperature and flow rate, solution pumping rate, and valve setting are used to study the effects of several control strategies on system behavior. Results from this analysis can be used to optimize start-up and steady state performances. The model can also be used for devising and testing control strategies in commercial applications. M.
