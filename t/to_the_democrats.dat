5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Kentuckians {{ratified}} {{their third}} constitution. One of many changes effected by this document {{was that the}} office of superintendent became elective. Though the election belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> Breckinridge, a Whig, was elected over five challengers for the office. His tenure would be a short one, however. Unlike his early reforms, his calls for parental selection of textbooks {{and use of the}} Bible as the primary reading material were not heeded. He also opposed the abolition of tuition charges and unsuccessfully lobbied for a pay increase for his position. (The salary was only $750.) With little prospect of further reform under his leadership, Breckinridge resigned in 1853.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{did not run}} for {{re-election}} as mayor, leaving an open seat to be contested by the Republican nominee, Daniel A. Poling, and the Democrat, Joseph S. Clark, Jr. Clark was a lawyer and United States Army officer who had served in World War II. Raised in an upper-class Republican family, he switched his party affiliation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in 1928. After several unsuccessful attempts at public office in Philadelphia, {{he served as a}} Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. Clark was known as a reformer, having been elected city controller two years earlier in 1949 on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the city. Despite being slandered as a communist for his membership in the Americans for Democratic Action, a left-wing group, Clark was victorious.|$|E
50|$|In 1892 he was Republican {{candidate}} for the 37th State Senate District, but lost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> John H. Matthews, 2,957 to 3,287.|$|R
50|$|Domenici was {{unsuccessful}} in his 1970 attempt in New Mexico's governor's race, losing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat,</b> former state House Speaker Bruce King, 148,835 to 134,640.|$|R
50|$|Switched over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party (DP), he was re-elected in the 1954 general {{election}} as deputy of Istanbul, {{and again in}} the 1957 {{general election}}.|$|R
5|$|The midterm congressional {{elections}} of 1854 and 1855 were devastating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> (as {{well as to}} the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected {{under the auspices of the}} new Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained {{control of the}} House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the House <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, {{and a series of}} scandals among congressional Republicans. The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, White {{was elected}} {{to serve in the}} West Virginia Senate {{representing}} the state's Fifteenth Senatorial District. He served in the 40th and 41st Sessions of the West Virginia Legislature and completed his term in 1934. During the 1932 legislative year, the West Virginia Senate was led by the Republican Party majority. The following legislative year in 1933, White served as the floor leader for the West Virginia Senate's Democratic Party members. The West Virginia Senate's majority had shifted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in 1933, and in January 1933, White was selected by A. G. Mathews, President of the West Virginia Senate, as chairman of the senate's Judiciary Committee. In this position, White introduced twelve bills in 1933 to correct errors and omissions in existing statutes. Also in the 1933 legislative year, White served as a member on the Finance; Roads and Navigation; Counties, Municipal Corporations; Rules; Medicine and Sanitation; Education; Privileges and Elections; and Redistricting committees. In the same year White was also appointed as a member on two special senate committees.|$|E
50|$|Former Chart Thai MP for Ratchaburi, Vijai Wattanaprasit, moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pracharaj Party. Former Chat Thai MP for Chanthaburi Province Khomkhai Pollabutr moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} around 7,500 people {{regularly}} subscribe <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Democrat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Democrat</b> is <b>the</b> primary newspaper in Wilson County, Tennessee with local, {{national and international}} news coverage. It is published 5 days a week — Tuesday through Saturday.|$|R
50|$|Carmichael ran {{again in}} 1975, {{this time for}} governor, but lost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Cliff Finch, known for his old-school oratory and support from former Wallace partisans.|$|R
25|$|Delaware's swing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> is in {{part due}} to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County, home to 55 percent of Delaware's {{population}} (the two smaller counties have only 359,000 people between them to New Castle's 535,000). New Castle has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double-digits each time in New Castle, which was a large enough margin to swing the state <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> New Castle also elects a substantial majority of the legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle.|$|E
25|$|It's {{definitely}} {{worth it}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{to put in}} the effort if only to keep the party energized. Even if Paul Hackett loses, it is very important for the party for him to do well. It could be seen as a sign of opportunities for Democrats in other GOP strongholds.|$|E
25|$|Foreign affairs seldom became {{partisan}} issues (except for {{the annexation}} of Hawaii, which Republicans favored and Democrats opposed). Much more salient were cultural issues. The GOP supported the pietistic Protestants (especially the Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Scandinavian Lutherans) who demanded prohibition. That angered wet Republicans, especially German Americans, who broke ranks in 1890–1892, handing power <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1962, Connor ran as a Republican for {{the congressional}} seat {{representing}} Staten Island {{and part of}} Brooklyn. However, he lost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat,</b> John M. Murphy.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, Anderson won reelection to {{his third}} nonconsecutive term by only 64 votes, 23,720 (50.1 percent) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Terry Meza, who trailed with 23,656 votes (49.9 percent).|$|R
50|$|Between 2006 and 2010 Labour {{lost two}} seats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> through by-elections, in Kentish Town and Haverstock wards. A Labour Councillor in Haverstock ward also {{defected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> in February 2009. The Conservatives also lost two seats, one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> in Hampstead, and one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Green Party, Alexander Goodman, in Highgate, taking {{the total number}} of Green Party Councillors to three.|$|R
25|$|When Sabin's fellow Republicans {{would not}} support her efforts, she went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> who {{switched}} their support of the dry cause to endorse repeal {{under the leadership of}} liberal politicians such as Fiorello La Guardia and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sabin and her supporters emphasized that repeal would generate enormous sums of much-needed tax revenue, and weaken the base of organized crime.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, Governor Paterson {{appointed}} Richard Ravitch as Lieutenant Governor in {{an effort}} to break the deadlock. However, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo argued that the appointment was illegal. The next day, Espada announced that he was returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> giving them a 32–30 majority once more, and effectively ending the crisis. The appointment of Ravitch was eventually upheld by the New York Court of Appeals.|$|E
25|$|Reconstruction {{came to an}} {{end when}} the contested {{election}} of 1876 was awarded by a special electoral commission to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes, who promised through the unofficial Compromise of 1877 to withdraw federal troops from control of the last three southern states. The region then became the Solid South, giving overwhelming majorities of its electoral votes and Congressional seats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> through 1964.|$|E
50|$|On 24 November 2013, a crowd {{estimated}} at 100,000 joined the rally around Bangkok's Democracy Monument in an anti-government protest, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party, as pro-government red shirts gathered at Rajamangala Sports Stadium.|$|R
50|$|Talton lost a race in 2012 {{for county}} {{attorney}} in Harris County <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> incumbent Vince Ryan. The position handles civil ligitgation in the county, while {{the district attorney}} deals with criminal matters.|$|R
50|$|On November 7, 2006, after {{fifteen years}} as a state representative, Nunn lost his bid for {{re-election}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Johnny Bell. Nunn polled 5,572 votes (46.7 percent) to Bell's 6,371 ballots (53.3 percent).|$|R
25|$|As the {{fastest-growing}} demographic group, after Asians, Latinos are hotly contested by both parties. Immigration {{is an important}} political issue for this group. Backlash against illegal aliens led {{to the passage of}} California Proposition 187 in 1994, a ballot initiative which would have denied many public services to illegal aliens. Association of this proposal with California Republicans, especially incumbent governor Pete Wilson, drove many Hispanic voters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evanston {{was heavily}} Republican in voter {{identification}} {{from the time}} of the Civil War up to the 1960s. Nixon carried Evanston in the 1968 presidential election. The city began trending Democratic in the 1960s, though it did not elect a Democratic mayor until 1993. The city swung particularly heavily <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the 1990s, along with many other Chicago suburbs, and now almost exclusively identifies with Democrats in elections on all levels of government.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Obama, Edwards, and Kerry addresses, there were also speeches from former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, former Vice-President and 2000 Presidential nominee Al Gore, New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton, Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, former candidate Al Sharpton, and Presidential Advisory Counsel on HIV/AIDS Denise Stokes. Ron Reagan, son of Republican President Ronald Reagan, also spoke at the Convention, blaming Bush's hijacking of his father's legacy for his switch in support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the event}} an officeholder does not win both the {{majority}} electoral and majority popular vote, the House of Representatives shall choose the winner. Currently, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> hold a large edge (73-46 with three vacancies) in the House, thus ensuring that any contested race will go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> candidate.|$|R
5000|$|During <b>the</b> 2006 Liberal <b>Democrat</b> {{leadership}} campaign, Browne was campaign {{press secretary}} to Menzies Campbell. [...] He was later promoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrat</b> Frontbench Team <b>to</b> become <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrat</b> spokesman for Home Affairs.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, Evers ran as an Independent for {{governor}} of Mississippi but lost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Bill Allain. Republican Leon Bramlett of Clarksdale, {{also known as a}} college All-American football player, finished second with 39 percent of the vote.|$|R
25|$|In March 2010, when Charles Rangel {{was forced}} to resign as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means over ethics charges, Van Hollen {{played a key role in}} having Sander Levin succeed to the Chairmanship over Pete Stark. Stark was the second-most {{experienced}} member of the committee while Levin was third, and party tradition would have made Stark chairman due to seniority. However, Van Hollen and other younger members saw Stark's past intemperate comments as a liability <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in an election year.|$|E
25|$|After being a Republican stronghold in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, Middlesex County leaned Democratic {{for much of the}} 20th century {{beginning}} with Franklin Roosevelt's victory in the county in 1932. Throughout the twentieth century, in close elections the county would always vote Democratic, sometimes by solid margins, but the county was willing to flip Republican in the midst of nationwide Republican landslides in the 1970s and 80s. However, since the 1990s, Middlesex County has become a Democratic stronghold at the national level, mirroring the state's heavy swing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) was {{involved}} in a contentious re-election campaign against Republican Congressman Saxby Chambliss. The race galvanized Democrats across the nation, who said Chambliss had questioned the patriotism of Cleland, a disabled Vietnam veteran. Miller remained true <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in this case, campaigning hard for Cleland despite their ideological differences. But after Chambliss won, Miller formed a close working relationship with him. He also moved even further to the right, presumably because it had become increasingly difficult for a Democrat to win statewide in Georgia.|$|E
50|$|Sheets was {{narrowly}} unseated {{in his bid}} for {{a fourth}} term {{in the general election}} held on November 8, 2016. He polled 27,086 votes (49.2 percent) but lost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Victoria Neave, who led with 27,922 (50.8 percent).|$|R
50|$|Metcalf then {{won with}} ease the general {{election}} on November 4, 2014. He polled 29,132 votes (83.8 percent) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Michael Hayles, Jr., who finished with 4,748 votes (13.7 percent), and the Libertarian nominee, Bob Townsend, 887 (2.6 percent).|$|R
