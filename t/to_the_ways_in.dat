25|$|Broadcast 25 January 1995, {{the next}} {{instalment}} is devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which plants reproduce. Pollen and a stigma {{are the two}} components needed for fertilisation. Most plants carry both these within their flowers and rely on animals to transport the pollen {{from one to the}} stigma of another. To do this, they attract their couriers with colour, scent and nectar. It isn't just birds that help pollination: some mammals and reptiles also do so. However, it is mostly insects that are recruited to carry out the task. To ensure that pollen is not wasted by being delivered to the wrong flower, some species of plant have developed exclusive relationships with their visitors, and the gentian and its attendant carpenter bees is one example. Since pollen can be expensive to produce in terms of calories, some plants, such as orchids, ration it by means of pollinia and a strategically placed landing platform. Other orchids offer no reward for pollination, but instead mislead their guests by mimicking their markings and aroma, thus enticing males to 'mate' with them (Pseudocopulation). The most extreme fertilisation method is one of imprisonment, and one plant that uses it is the dead horse arum. It is often found near gull colonies, and mimics the appearance and smell of rotting flesh. Blow-flies are attracted to it, and are forced to stay the night before being allowed to depart in the morning, laden with pollen. Finally, Attenborough introduces the world's largest inflorescence: that of the titan arum.|$|E
500|$|The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{ultimately}} directed Ford {{to recall}} the Pinto. Initially, the NHTSA did not feel there was sufficient evidence to demand a recall due to incidents of fire. The NHTSA investigation found that 27 deaths {{were found to have}} occurred between 1970 and mid-1977 in rear-impact crashes that resulted in fire. [...] The NHTSA did not indicate if these impacts would have been survivable absent fire or if the impacts were more severe than even a state of the art (for 1977) fuel system could have withstood. [...] In their analysis of the social factors affecting the NHTSA's actions, Lee and Ermann note that 27 is the same number of deaths attributed to a Pinto transmission problem which contributed to collisions after the affected cars stalled. [...] They also note that the NHTSA had two primary incentives in proving a defect existed in the Pinto's fuel system design. [...] The administration was pressured by safety advocates (Center for Auto Safety) as well as the public respose. [...] It was also being forced into action due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which both the courts and executive branch were limiting the ability of the NHTSA to address systematic auto safety issues.|$|E
500|$|The casting of American {{actor and}} comedian Robin Williams as the Genie {{inspired}} {{the studio to}} recruit similarly talented voice actors capable of matching his pace. The filmmakers had originally envisioned Jasmine's voice as {{similar to that of}} actress Lauren Bacall. Jasmine's speaking voice is provided by American actress Linda Larkin. The role was only one of several auditions Larkin had scheduled during the same week in which she auditioned for Aladdin, and she originally underestimated the scope of the project, joking, [...] "I {{thought it was going to}} be something like Duck Tales (sic)". Initially presented with only a few pages of the screenplay, Larkin found that she was particularly drawn to Jasmine's [...] "spirit of activism", in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which character was both similar to and different from previous Disney heroines. Princesses Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora had been childhood favorites of the actress. Larkin's first audition was held in a Burbank, California recording studio, in which she performed solely for the film's casting director. The side used for Larkin's first audition was the scene in which Jasmine meets Aladdin in the marketplace – their first encounter. Jasmine's line [...] "It's all so magical" [...] helped convince Larkin that she was [...] "meant" [...] to voice the character. Although Larkin's voice was significantly different from what the filmmakers had originally envisioned for the character, her interpretation gradually changed their minds.|$|E

Searle did not respond. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to [...] "normality" [...] in the analytical tradition to be problematic.|$|E
2500|$|Haptic {{communication}} is {{a branch of}} nonverbal communication that refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which people and animals communicate, and interact via the sense of touch. Touch or haptics, from the ancient Greek word haptikos is extremely important for communication; it [...] is vital for survival. The sense of touch [...] allows one to experience different sensations such as: pleasure, pain, heat, or cold. [...] One {{of the most significant}} aspects of touch is the ability to convey and enhance physical intimacy. The sense of [...] touch is the fundamental component of haptic communication for interpersonal relationships.Touch can be categorized in many terms such [...] as positive, playful, control, ritualistic, task-related or unintentional. It can be both sexual (kissing is one example that some perceived as sexual), and platonic (such as hugging or a Handshake).|$|E
2500|$|... "Black women's {{relationships}} to their bodies occur within overlapping cultural contexts that offer contradictory messages about their value and function". In a male dominated society, {{it is no}} wonder that women used to work hard to align themselves with male images including how they'd dressed. As women generally gained access to and exposure within the offerings of several sectors of society, for example music, movies and television, we saw more images of what constituted attractiveness emerge. Following this came the perception of freedom to express oneself through several avenues including apparel. Rappers Lil' Kim and Eve are known for resorting to trends surrounding being scantily clad with provocative tattoos and being perceived as attractive in the process. Not all female rappers, or female artists in general have resorted to these methods within their careers. [...] "..the recent appearance of Black women performers, songwriters, and producers in Black popular culture has called attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which young Black women use popular culture to negotiate social existence and attempt to express independence, self-reliance, and agency".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to transforming our workplace and everyday life, Davidson argues that technology allows {{us a great}} opportunity to rethink the way we teach and organize our education system. In {{addition to}} the famous iPod experiment described earlier, Davidson suggests that gaming, blogging, self-grading, and collaborative learning are among the effective and innovative teaching tools and strategies, whose benefits outweigh those offered by the [...] "one-size-fits-all model of standards that evolved {{over the course of the}} twentieth century." [...] In the chapter, [...] "Project Classroom Makeover," [...] Davidson argues that the current education system is blind <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which children learn and solve complex problems today, such as: creating and memorizing names and avatars of online game players, creating and writing simple codes to advance in games, searching internet for new information, and engaging with it in new creative ways. If the education system harnesses these natural curiosities through restructured curricula, it can promote creative and critical thinking and allow students to develop in their own, unique ways, rather than forcing them to fit into the standardized system of skills.|$|E

Like the , {{it takes the}} form of a single narrator in a dialogue, {{offering}} presumable objections from the other side. Its treatment of free will relies on Anselm's earlier works, but goes into greater detail as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which there is no actual incompatibility or paradox created by the divine attributes. In its 5th chapter, Anselm reprises his consideration of eternity from the Monologion. [...] "Although nothing is there except what is present, it is not the temporal present, like ours, but rather the eternal, within which all times altogether are contained. If in a certain way the present time contains every place and all the things that are in any place, likewise, every time is encompassed in the eternal present, and everything that is in any time." [...] It is an overarching present, all beheld at once by God, thus permitting both his [...] "foreknowledge" [...] and genuine free choice on the part of mankind.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Heinze {{published}} Jews and the American Soul: Human Nature in the Twentieth Century.

A truly distinctive work of American history." [...] Jon Butler, Professor of American Studies, History, and Religious Studies at Yale University, said about the book, [...] "Heinze explains how Jewish intellectuals uncovered and explicated the marrow of American identity even as, or precisely because, they sought to secure their place in an America that did not always want them. Heinze uplifts an unexpected, enlightening story with insight, grace, and not infrequent irony--a simply fascinating read." [...] It was {{named one of the}} [...] "Best Books of 2004" [...] by Publishers Weekly, was runner up in the 2005 National Jewish Book Award in the American Jewish History category, and was a Jewish Book Council Finalist for the 2004 Weinberg Judaic Studies Institute Book Award, University of Scranton.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{approach}} is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane. For example, the fold out nets mentioned {{in the previous section}} have higher-dimensional equivalents. Some of these may be viewed at [...] One might even imagine building a model of this fold-out net, as one draws a polyhedron's fold-out net on a piece of paper. Sadly, we could never do the necessary folding of the 3-dimensional structure to obtain the 4-dimensional polytope because of the constraints of the physical universe. Another way to [...] "draw" [...] the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either orthographic or perspective projection. Coxeter's famous book on polytopes (Coxeter, 1948) has some examples of such orthographic projections. Other examples may be found on the web (see for example [...] ). Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are 3-d models of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the Université Libre de Bruxelles).|$|E
2500|$|In Canada itself, the Oakes {{test has}} been {{comparable}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which other {{rights have been}} limited. [...] Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982, which affirms Aboriginal and treaty rights, is technically {{not part of the}} Charter and therefore is not subject to section 1. [...] However, in R. v. Sparrow the Court developed a test to limit section 35 that Hogg has compared to the section 1 Oakes test. [...] After the Sparrow case, provincial legislation can only limit Aboriginal rights if it has given them appropriate priority. [...] The Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms contains a section that has also been compared to section 1. [...] Namely, section 9.1 states that when one invokes rights, it should be in a manner with respecting [...] "democratic values, public order and the general well-being of the citizens of Québec" [...] and that law may limit rights. [...] In Ford v. Quebec, it was found an analysis of limits under section 9.1 should be similar to that under section 1 of the Canadian Charter. [...] In Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem, Justice Michel Bastarache contrasted this with the main difference between the two sections. [...] Namely, the section 9.1 statements about how one should use rights does not mention legislatures, and thus the Quebec Charter has relevance to private law. [...] In Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (1994), the Court also developed a test under the common law modelled after the Oakes test to consider publication bans.|$|E
