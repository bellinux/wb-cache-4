40|$|When young law {{graduates}} {{enter the}} legal profession they will undoubtedly be exposed to difficult situations that will demand of them to make difficult decisions, often having to balance conflicting systems of belief and ideas on what ethical behaviour entails. Legal ethics training in law faculties the world over often neglects teaching aspects of morality to focus on reviews of rules of professional legal conduct. This article argues that if legal education is to adequately prepare law graduates for legal practice, it must offer more than reviews of these codes of conduct. To properly assist law students in avoiding pitfalls which may lead to disciplinary action, they must be taught to appropriately use their moral compasses. <b>This</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>aims</b> {{to show that the}} metaphorical moral compass, with the cardinal virtues as possible main points, may serve as the crucial and underlying guide in the avoidance of the pitfalls which may result in a person being struck from the roll, but more than that, that it may aid in the pursuit of personal dreams or goals.

Extensive literature search included PUBMED and EMBASE databases to identify in human studies and systematic reviews (up to March 2015), which contributed to elucidate this issue. Independently from the type of beverage, meta-analyses considering light drinking (≤ 1 drinks/day or ≤ 12. 5 g/day of ethanol) reported relative risks (RR) for oral, oro-pharyngeal, or upper aero-digestive tract cancers, ranging from 1. 0 to 1. 3. One meta-analysis measured the overall wine-specific RR, which corresponded to 2. 1. Although little evidence exists on light wine intake, phytochemicals seem not to affect oral cancer risk, being probably present below the effective dosages and/or due to their low bioavailability. As expected, the risk of oral cancer, even in light drinking conditions, increases when associated with smoking habit and high-risk genotypes of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases...|$|R

40|$|Plants of {{the genus}} Zingiber (Family Zingiberaceae) are widely used {{throughout}} the world as food and medicinal plants. They represent very popular herbal remedies in various traditional healing systems; in particular, rhizome of Zingiber spp. plants {{has a long history}} of ethnobotanical uses because of a plethora of curative properties. Antimicrobial activity of rhizome essential oil has been extensively confirmed in vitro and attributed to its chemical components, mainly consisting of monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons such as α-​zingiberene, ar-​curcumene, β-​bisabolene and β-​sesquiphellandrene. In addition, gingerols have been identified as the major active components in the fresh rhizome, whereas shogaols, dehydrated gingerol derivatives, are the predominant pungent constituents in dried rhizome.

40|$|The present thesis aims {{to explore}} the role and the {{evolution}} of tax and fiscal integration (and by implication, a central component of economic integration) from a legal perspective. “Integration through fiscality”, as perceived in this dissertation, comprises two components: direct taxation and fiscal policies (the public finance management of the Member States). The present thesis sets out by pointing to the paradox that, despite their central role in the attainment of an “economic union” without frontiers, “fiscal matters” remain without any solid constitutional framework. After demonstrating the lack of a “constitutional fiscal framework”, the thesis proceeds with a historical account, through the turning points of European Economic integration (Pre- Maastricht, Post-Maastricht and financial crisis). <b>This</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>aims</b> to show the inter institutional struggles among the different actors (the legislator, the Member States, the executive and the judiciary) in their bid to fill this lacuna in the European (Economic) Constitution, through distinct or sometimes parallel ways. To this end, the thesis primarily gives the institutional and constitutional background of ‘fiscality’, while it continues by analysing the different possibilities of integration through ‘fiscality’: a) positive integration through the legislator via hard or soft law means, b) spontaneous integration triggered by regulatory competition and the Member States, c) ‘coordinated’ integration prompted by the Member States, d) negative integration prompted by the CJEU, e) crisis-induced integration outside or within the EU law framework, f) integration by ‘force’, g) integration by exception. The thesis maintains that, notwithstanding the efforts of the CJEU that has risen as the key player pushing for integration {{in the area of the}} tax policy, it has been the recent ﬁnancial crisis which has spurred the other actors towards more integration in the area of fiscal policies with the anticipated domino effects in the direct taxation field. The final part of the thesis attempts, by means of a normative claim, to sketch the salient features of a ‘ﬁscal Constitution’ for the EU, as part of the ‘new economic governance construction’, that will be both (politically) feasible and compliant with certain standards of legitimacy and the rule of law desiderata...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The high {{prevalence}} of neck and {{low back pain}} in the rapidly aging population is associated with significant increases in health care expenditure. While spinal imaging can be useful to identify less common causes of neck and back pain, overuse and misuse of imaging services has been widely reported. <b>This</b> <b>narrative</b> review <b>aims</b> to provide primary care providers with an overview of available imaging studies with associated potential benefits, adverse effects, and costs {{for the evaluation of}} neck and back pain disorders in the elderly population. While the {{prevalence of}} arthritis and degenerative disc disease increase with age, fracture, infection, and tumor remain uncommon. Prevalence of other conditions such as spinal stenosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) also increase with age and demand special considerations. Radiography of the lumbar spine is not recommended for the early management of non-specific low back pain in adults under the age of 65. Aside from conventional radiography for suspected fracture or arthritis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) offer better characterization of most musculoskeletal diseases. If available, MRI is usually preferred over CT because it involves less radiation exposure and has better soft-tissue visualization. Use of subspecialty radiologists to interpret diagnostic imaging studies is recommended. </p...|$|R
