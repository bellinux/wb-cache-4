5|$|Whitney Frost (portrayed by Wynn Everett) is {{the stage}} name of Agnes Cully, an actress and {{scientific}} genius forced <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>behind</b> her husband, senatorial candidate Calvin Chadwick, {{due to the}} sexism of the age. She accidentally absorbs Zero Matter, which leaves her with a Zero Matter scar on her forehead, {{and the ability to}} absorb any living thing she touches. After she is purged of the Zero Matter, Frost goes insane and is committed to an asylum.|$|E
5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over his shoulders. In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>behind</b> Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{earthworks}} protecting the forts around Wola were being destroyed by Russian artillery. From 6:00, 108 pieces of Russian artillery {{were focused on}} forts 54, 55 and 57. Fort 54 held out and losses among the infantry were low, but the artillery of the isolated outposts was forced <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>behind</b> the ramparts. Forts 59 and 61 could not support their neighbours as their crews fought their own artillery duel with horse artillery of Khilkov's Cavalry Division, which suffered heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|Percy {{lost control}} of his men, and British {{soldiers}} began to commit atrocities to repay for the supposed scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties {{at the hands of}} a distant, often unseen enemy. Based on the word of Pitcairn and other wounded officers from Smith's command, Percy had learned that the Minutemen were using stone walls, trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>behind</b> and shoot at the column. He ordered the flank companies to clear the colonial militiamen out of such places.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>behind</b> his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed II ordered Hadım Suleiman Pasha, Beylerbey (or governor) of Rumelia, {{to invade}} Moldavia – an Ottoman army of about 120,000 strong broke into Moldavia in late 1475. Wallachian troops also joined the Ottomans, while Stephen {{received}} support from Poland and Hungary. Outnumbered {{three to one}} by the invaders, Stephen was forced to retreat. He joined battle with Hadım Suleiman Pasha at Podul Înalt (or the High Bridge) near Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Before the battle, he had sent his buglers <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>behind</b> the enemy fronts. When they suddenly sounded their horns, they caused such a panic among the invaders that they fled from the battlefield. Over the next three days, hundreds of Ottoman soldiers were massacred and the survivors retreated from Moldavia.|$|E
5000|$|Francis states an {{overriding}} principle of pastoral care: [...] "A pastor cannot {{feel that it}} is enough simply to apply moral laws to those living in 'irregular' situations, as if they were stones to throw at people's lives. This would bespeak the closed heart of one used <b>to</b> <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> the Church’s teachings, 'sitting on the chair of Moses and judging at times with superiority and superficiality difficult cases and wounded families'".

5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} {{gravity of the}} situation, the Polish defenders still had sufficient fresh troops to counter-attack and regain the initiative. The Russians' recently captured positions were too far ahead of their artillery, and were all under well-aimed fire from Polish fixed artillery positions on the ramparts of the third line of defences, as well as numerous mobile artillery batteries. Forts 72 and 73, {{as well as the}} Karczma Żelazna inn and the brickyard received constant grapeshot fire. Under fire from all sides, the Russians had <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>behind</b> the outer sides of the ramparts, unable to return fire or even observe the field in front of them. Tirailleurs of the Polish 3rd Foot Rifle Regiment approached the Karczma Żelazna inn almost unopposed and retook it. Soon afterwards they retook the brickyard as well. The Russians abandoned the two forts as well and although Russian light infantry tried to retake them, they were unsuccessful. Around 16:45 the field artillery batteries of Józef Bem were free to leave the safety of the inner defences, return to the battlefield, and open fire on the Grand Battery. Despite over three hours of intensive fighting in the west, the commander of the relatively peaceful southern sector, General Małachowski, did not reinforce the defenders of the western approaches.|$|E

She fights an attraction to Kyle because of their professional relationship and her fears that pursuing it create problems for Kyle because of his addiction problems. Kyle soon becomes troubled by his attraction to both Dr. Lily and a fellow resident, Heather Labonte.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} intervening, between finding Bridger and finding Fitzgerald, Glass and four others were {{dispatched}} in February 1824 with mail for Fort Atkinson. They traveled up the Powder River, then {{across to the}} Platte River. There they constructed skin boats and traveled down the Platte River to {{the lower end of}} the Black Hills. Glass and his party discovered a settlement of 38 lodges of Arikara. Their leader, who was known by Glass, declared the tribe to be friendly and invited them in so the men went ashore. While smoking with him in his lodge, Glass noticed their equipment being taken by the residents and realized it was a trap. The men quickly fled but two were killed by the pursuing war party. Glass managed <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>behind</b> some rocks until the Arikara gave up their search, but was separated from the two other survivors. He was relieved to find his knife and flint in his shot pouch and traveled to Fort Kiowa surviving off the land.|$|E

25|$|The {{common law}} of tort also remains {{particularly}} relevant {{for the type of}} liability an employer has where there is scientific uncertainty about the cause of an injury. In asbestos disease cases, a worker may have been employed with at a number of jobs where he was exposed to asbestos, but his injury cannot with certainty be traced to any one. Although he may be able to sue all of them, a number may have already gone insolvent. In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd the House of Lords held that if any employer had materially increased the risk of harm to the worker, they could would be jointly and severally liable and could be sued for the full sum, leaving it up to them to seek contribution from others and thus the risk of other businesses' insolvency. For a brief period, in Barker v Corus the House of Lords then decided that employers would only be liable on a proportionate basis, thus throwing the risk of employers' insolvency back onto workers. Immediately Parliament passed the Compensation Act 2006 section 3 to reverse the decision on its facts. It has also been held in Chandler v Cape plc, in 2011, that even though a subsidiary company is the direct employer of a worker, a parent company will owe a duty of care. Thus shareholders may not be able <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>behind</b> the corporate veil to escape their obligations for {{the health and safety of}} the workforce.|$|E

The RhAR therefore redeployed to intercept Hor Lung's men. On 9 November, a half-section of Southern Rhodesians led by Corporal Munyameni sighted 16 pack-laden guerrillas, marching east. On his own initiative, Munyameni attacked, catching the communists by surprise; the insurgents split up and fled, running in all directions.

They crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield. Picking their way forward, they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans. Opening fire, they killed them. Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and Milosevich across the road and sprinted towards them, drawing German fire. They made it back to their ridge-top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters. He requested artillery support, but when he reported the German column advancing on his position, the {{voice on the other end}} of the radio told him [...] "he must be seeing things". Bouck told them he had 20-20 vision and demanded artillery fire on the road in front of his unit.|$|E
