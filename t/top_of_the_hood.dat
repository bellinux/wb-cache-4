5000|$|... 1947 - 1957, Diesels {{were bright}} red with silver side panels and cream yellow on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nose <b>hoods.</b> Passenger cars were painted to match. Boxcars, cabooses, and other rolling stock were {{frequently}} painted Sloan Yellow (named for MKT President Matthew S. Sloan).|$|R
50|$|The {{process was}} spread {{out from the}} late 1970s into the early 1980s. As part of this, some {{locomotives}} were repainted in the International Orange livery but with their pre-TMS numbers instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> later TMS numbers. As a result <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> locomotives were equipped with new radiator header tanks which were mounted behind <b>the</b> radiator on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine <b>hoods</b> in a 'north-south' alignment. Later the tanks were relocated to an 'east-west' alignment.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the movie}} Wayne's World, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) is heard {{whistling}} the Star Trek theme while lying on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> of an AMC Pacer.

50|$|The SW1 appears {{very similar}} to its SC and SW predecessors, but has only a single stack instead of two, a {{significantly}} shorter hood and a larger rear platform, no small louvers on the front top hood sides, and a large grille instead of lifting vents on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> front. The sandbox {{in front of the}} radiator is somewhat smaller on the SW1.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper part}} of hood proper was, if possible, fuller than the cloak, being {{gathered}} and rucked behind the neck. The inside of the hood was satin lined and the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> was finished with a satin bow. Within the hood sat the flat jet collar ornamented with a pattern of beaded braid and tied with a satin bow over the single functional fastening of the cloak.|$|E
50|$|Mainly for {{educational}} or testing use, these units generally have a fan mounted on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> (soffit) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> or beneath <b>the</b> worktop. Air is sucked through <b>the</b> front opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> {{and through a}} filter, before passing through the fan and being fed back into the workplace. With a ductless fume hood {{it is essential that}} the filter medium be able to remove the particular hazardous or noxious material being used. As different filters are required for different materials, recirculating fume hoods should only be used when the hazard is well known and does not change.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{different}} carbody variants were produced, {{and were}} differentiated as follows: Phase 1a units had their air intake louvers {{located in a}} continuous line along <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>hood,</b> and a wide separating strip between the radiator fans; Phase 1b modifications were minor, consisting only of a [...] "dip" [...] in <b>the</b> long <b>hood</b> handrails {{that allowed them to}} better follow <b>the</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side walkways; Phase 2 units boasted fewer air intake louvers, with large gaps separating them (the radiators themselves were divided by only a tiny metal strip).|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} visible {{difference on}} the Penn Central/Conrail rebuilds is <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> two conical-shaped EMD switcher style exhaust stacks in place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one rectangular-shaped ALCO stack and a raised hood. Later rebuilds {{would just have}} a raised feature on <b>the</b> long <b>hood</b> to accommodate <b>the</b> larger prime mover. The shape would vary from a rectangular shape with fillets on the long sides to a simple box on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>hood.</b> These locomotives are often called DeWitt Geeps, so named because Penn Central started rebuilding them in their DeWitt, shops in Syracuse, New York.|$|R
5000|$|Changes for the 1970 {{model year}} {{included}} side [...] "hockey stick" [...] stripes which started along the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> {{along with the}} 1970 grille which replaced the four headlights with two vents in the outside position while retaining dual headlights within the grille opening. The dual exhaust system was redesigned, along with the competition suspension and a standard Hurst shifter. The intake valves were slightly smaller, and cast aluminum valve covers replaced the chrome. With a suggested price of $3,720, a total of 7,013 were sold.|$|E
50|$|Rules at {{the time}} {{required}} the top ten drivers to finish the full 500 miles to receive prize money. This led to an interesting sight for spectators who remained after Goux's finish. Charlie Merz, in contention for second place, would have his car catch fire {{towards the end of}} lap 199. Merz, not wishing to surrender the prize money, drove the final lap on fire, while Harry Martin, his riding mechanic, crawled out on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> of the still moving car to beat at the flames and release the straps the held the engine cover to allow the fire to be extinguished faster. Merz finished third. Martin would unfortunately be killed while helping test a car on the speedway less than two months later.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by the COPO Camaros of {{the late}} 1960s, the Camaro LS7 Concept was built from the 2010 Camaro SS with LS3 engine that gets {{replaced}} with a GM Performance Parts LS7 crate engine producing around [...] With {{the inclusion of a}} high performance exhaust, headers, air intake system and replacement camshaft all developed by GM Performance Parts reflects the heritage that the COPO's of past brought to the tracks. Other modifications include a Tremec six-speed manual transmission, Brembo brakes, Hurst short-throw shifter, 20-inch custom wheels, and a lowered ride height. The exterior of the car is presented in a Victory Red color with accents of matte black on the [...] "LS7" [...] badges, front grille slot, rear headlight panel, and hood with the LS7 logo on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> cowl in Victory Red. The interior accentuates the exterior by matching the color scheme with the Victory Red interior panel trim that flows on the doors and dash panel {{as well as on the}} gauges of the odometers and four gauge cluster pack. Gloss black replaces every trim that came in silver in the final production Camaros such as on the steering wheel, Hurst shifter knob, vent trimings, and center console clusters.|$|E
5000|$|Antenitas de Vinil (Little Vinyl Antennae) are two red {{and yellow}} {{antennae}} on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hero's <b>hood.</b> <b>The</b> antennae are connected directly to his body's nervous system, allowing him to have direct control of its powers, including: detect presence of criminals and dangerous situations in general, decode and translate various languages and secret codes, capture readings of toxic or hazardous materials, receive requests for help and activate special electronic bio-resources in the Chapulín's body. The latter allows Chapulín to activate his Antenitas de Alta Velocidad (High-Speed Antennae), dramatically increasing his speed and allowing him to fight on equal terms with fast foes (to <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> casually deflecting bullets).|$|R

50|$|Most {{pedestrian}} crashes {{involve a}} forward moving car (as opposed to buses and other vehicles with a vertical hood/bonnet). In such a crash, a standing or walking pedestrian is struck and accelerated to <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car and then continues forward {{as the car}} brakes to a halt. Although the pedestrian is impacted twice, first by the car and then by <b>the</b> ground, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fatal injuries occur due to the interaction with the car. The vehicle designers usually focus their attention on understanding the car-pedestrian interaction, which is characterized by <b>the</b> following sequence <b>of</b> events: <b>the</b> vehicle bumper first contacts <b>the</b> lower limbs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedestrian, <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> hits <b>the</b> upper thigh or pelvis, and the head and upper torso are struck by <b>the</b> <b>top</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> and/or windshield.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} a simulation {{result of an}} evaluation of the aerodynamic performance of a moving car with a wind turbine system. Sedan type cars (approaching the size of Proton Wira car) were modeled using the SolidWork software and simulation was done by ANSYS FLUENT software. Three car models with different wind turbine system positions (in front of the front bumper, on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> and on top of the roof) plus one model without the wind turbine system were simulated. The study proved that the position of the wind turbine system installation will change the characteristic of the air flow around the car body and affects the aerodynamic performance of the car. Extended front bumper of a car is not significantly affecting the aerodynamic performance of the car. This extended bumper seems to be the suitable area to install a wind turbine system and the investigation shows that the aerodynamic performance of the car improved due to lower drag coefficient, Cd. ...|$|E
40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the design of}} a wind turbine system and the evaluation of aerodynamics performance of pickup truck with wind turbine system. Pickup truck with wind turbine models was developed using Solid Work sohare. Computer simulation (using Ansys software) was carried out to investigate the effects of wind turbine installation on aerodynamics of the pickup truck. Three pickup truck models with different wind turbine system positions i. e in front of the fiont bumper, on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> and on top of the roof plus one model without the wind turbine system were simulated. The study proved that the position of the wind turbine system will change the characteristic of the air flow around the pickup truck body and affects the aerodynamic performance of the pickup truck. Without the wind turbine, the coefficient of drag Cd for the pickup truck model was 0. 345, which was computable to that of stated in Toyota Hilux specification [...] As for the model with wind turbine, the Cd obtained were 0. 345, 0. 349. 0. 353 and 0. 344 for the case of fiont bumper, hood, roof and under pickup truck respectively. Extended fiont bumper of a pickup truck was not significantly affect the aerodynamics performance of the pickup truck. The Cd obtained for the case of extended bumper was slightly lower than of the original bumper height...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 A recent {{development}} in drift-control for agricultural ground sprayers is {{the installation of}} a hood (or shroud) over the boom. Hoods are {{designed to provide a}} protected zone in which droplets can be sprayed and deposited on the target with limited interference from the wind. This study compared chemical drift using hooded and open-boom pesticide sprayers in various configurations. The hooded sprayer included an air-foil mounted on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> designed to re-direct the airflow and further decrease drift. The principal objective was to test the performance of the hood, the air-foil, and nozzle size in reducing drift. A fluorescent dye and water solution was sprayed adjacent to a series of parallel string collectors. The amount of drifting material was determined by rinsing the string and testing the fluorescence of the rinsewater. Wind speed and direction, temperature, and relative humidity were monitored during each field test so that the influence of weather conditions on drift could be assessed. Statistical and graphical comparisons were based on the development of a regression model to describe downwind drift for each sprayer configuration under a set of variable weather conditions. Only parameters found to be important to drift were included in the final model. These parameters included sprayer configuration, wind speed, temperature, and the interactions of configuration with wind speed and temperature. Results of the comparisons indicated that for a larger droplet spectrum, the hood reduced drift significantly, while for smaller droplets the hood was ineffective. The air-foil was found to have no influence on drift...|$|E

50|$|Only a few {{significant}} {{changes were made}} to the original Kine Exakta (version 1) during its production run until it was replaced by the model II in 1948: Within a few months the circular focusing loupe, visible on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapsed finder <b>hood,</b> was substituted for a rectangular one covering about 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground glass image (version 2). This version also appeared on the North American market as Exacta, spelled with a c (version 3).

40|$|Existing {{approaches}} for saving energy in hoods are complicated and costly to implement, {{and do not}} address the worker safety issues inherent in <b>the</b> traditional fume <b>hood</b> design. Innovation is hampered by various barriers stemming from existing fume hood testing/rating procedures, entrenched rules of thumb, and ambiguous and often contradictory guidance on safe levels of airflow.
