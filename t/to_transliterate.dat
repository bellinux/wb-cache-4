50|$|As Hindi {{is neither}} {{traditionally}} taught nor {{used in the}} Roman script, {{it is difficult for}} Hindi speakers, fluent or otherwise, <b>to</b> read Hindi <b>transliterated</b> <b>to</b> Roman, and may be distracting from the matter at hand.|$|R
40|$|Transliteration of given {{parallel}} name entities can be formulated as a phrase-based statistical {{machine translation}} (SMT) process, via its routine procedure comprising training, optimization and decoding. In this paper, we present our approach <b>to</b> <b>transliterating</b> name entities using the loglinear phrase-based SMT on character sequences. Our proposed work improves the translation by using bidirectional models, plus some heuristic guidance integrated in the decoding process. Our evaluated results indicate that this approach performs well in all standard runs in the NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration Shared Task. ...|$|R
25|$|If the romanization {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>transliterate</b> {{the original}} script, the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of {{characters in the}} source language into the target script, with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader's language. For example, the Nihon-shiki romanization of Japanese allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original Japanese kana syllables with 100% accuracy, but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|Romanization {{includes}} any {{use of the}} Latin alphabet <b>to</b> <b>transliterate</b> Hebrew words. Usually it is {{to identify}} a Hebrew word in a non-Hebrew language that uses the Latin alphabet, such as German, Spanish, Turkish, and so on. Transliteration uses an alphabet to represent the letters and sounds of a word spelled in another alphabet, whereas transcription uses an alphabet to represent the sounds only. Romanization can do both.|$|E
25|$|Japanese is {{normally}} {{written in a}} combination of logographic characters borrowed from Chinese (kanji) and syllabic scripts (kana) which also ultimately derive from Chinese characters. Rōmaji {{may be used in}} any context where Japanese text is targeted at non-Japanese speakers who cannot read kanji or kana, such as for names on street signs and passports, and in dictionaries and textbooks for foreign learners of the language. It is also used <b>to</b> <b>transliterate</b> Japanese terms in text written in English (or other languages that use the Latin script) on topics related to Japan, such as linguistics, literature, history, and culture. Rōmaji is the most common way to input Japanese into word processors and computers, and may also be used to display Japanese on devices that do not support the display of Japanese characters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present {{our efforts}} on {{studying}} {{the effect of}} transliteration, on the human readability. We have tried to explore the effect by studying {{the changes in the}} eye-gaze patterns, which are recorded with an eye-tracker during experimentation. We have chosen Hindi and English languages, written in Devanagari and Latin scripts respectively. The participants of the experiments are subjected <b>to</b> <b>transliterated</b> words and asked to speak the word. During this, their eye movements are recorded. The eye-tracking data is later analyzed for eye-fixation trends. Quantitative analysis of fixation count and duration as well as visit count is performed over the areas of interest...|$|R
25|$|In the Fall of 1729, a {{ship from}} Satsuma {{bound for the}} {{province}} of Osaka drifted off course and ended up landing at Cape Lopatka, in Russia. Upon arrival, the crew were attacked {{by a group of}} cossacks led by Andreï Chtinnikov. Out of seventeen members, only two survived: a trader named Soza, and the pilot's son and apprentice, Gonza. The two were sent across the country to the capital of Saint Petersburg, where they were received in audience by Empress Anna Ivanovna, and later baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church. They went on afterwards to teach Japanese, and helped establish the first Japanese-language school in Russia. Gonza, who was also fluent in Russian, wrote and edited a number of books about the Japanese language, using the Cyrillic alphabet <b>to</b> <b>transliterate</b> words. These transliterations provide not only the oldest record of the Satsugū dialect, but have also been cited for their comprehensive evidence of the history, phonology and variability of the Japanese language.|$|E
500|$|Chinese {{characters}} do not reliably {{indicate their}} pronunciation, even for one dialect. [...] It is therefore useful {{to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>transliterate</b> a dialect of Chinese into the Latin alphabet or the Perso-Arabic script Xiao'erjing for those who cannot read Chinese characters. [...] However, transliteration was not always considered merely a way to record the sounds of any particular dialect of Chinese; it was once also considered a potential replacement for the Chinese characters. [...] This was first prominently proposed during the May Fourth Movement, and it gained further support with {{the victory of the}} Communists in 1949. [...] Immediately afterward, the mainland government began two parallel programs relating to written Chinese. [...] One was the development of an alphabetic script for Mandarin, which was spoken by about two-thirds of the Chinese population; the other was the simplification of the traditional characters—a process that would eventually lead to simplified Chinese. [...] The latter was not viewed as an impediment to the former; rather, it would ease the transition toward the exclusive use of an alphabetic (or at least phonetic) script.|$|E
500|$|A vestigial use of GR {{can be seen}} in the {{official}} spelling of the first syllable of Shaanxi for Shǎnxī (陝西) province, to distinguish it from Shānxī (山西) province, particularly in foreign-language text where the tone marks are often omitted. Some prominent Chinese have used GR <b>to</b> <b>transliterate</b> their names: for example the mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern. The romanization system was changed by the government of the People's Republic of China in 1958 to the current system used now in the country, and other foreign and international institutions, like the United Nations, the Library of Congress, the International Organization for Standardization, and is widely used to teach Mandarin Chinese to foreign students: Hanyu Pinyin. Meanwhile, in the Republic of China (Taiwan), GR survived until the 1970s as a pronunciation aid in monolingual dictionaries such as Gwoyeu Tsyrdean [...] and Tsyrhuey , but was officially replaced in 1986 by a modified form known as Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II. The Warring States period State of Wey (...) is often spelled as such to distinguish it from the more prominent state , which are both pronounced Wèi in Mandarin, but in Old Chinese it was probably /*ɢʷat-s/ and /*N-qʰuj-s/, respectively.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{forward-backward}} transliteration system between English and Chinese for the shared task of NEWS 2011.

For <b>transliterating</b> from English <b>to</b> Chinese, our combined system achieved Accuracy in Top- 1 0. 312, compared with the best performance in NEWS 2011, which was 0. 348.
