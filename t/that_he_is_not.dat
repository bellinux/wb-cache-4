5|$|Some have {{interpreted}} Bahá'u'lláh's writing style {{to conclude that}} Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity. Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> actually God, but that he is speaking with the attributes of God.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy {{was first}} {{identified}} {{as a form of}} theodicy by John Hick in Evil and the God of Love, written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified in it. The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> at fault.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, Soundwave assembles a newer, more {{powerful}} chassis for Megatron, {{using it to}} resurrect him. Megatron then challenges Starscream and his loyalists for leadership of the Decepticons, kills his soldiers, defeats him and frees the Combaticons.

Megatron and his soldiers invade the facility and he takes Trypticon's power core, the heart of a transformer.

5|$|While Vali's {{acquisition}} of Ruma— elder brother taking his younger sister-in-law as wife—is universally condemned; however as in Tara's case, elder brother's widow marrying her younger brother-in-law {{seems to be}} a social norm. Ramashraya Sharma considers that Rama's silence on marriage of Tara and Sugriva does not signal non-acceptance of the act, but rather <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> concerned with the issue of the sexual relations of the loose charactered vanaras, in which Tara and Ruma exchange hands between the brothers. Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister-in-law Tara, who is like a mother to him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E

As Guildenstern leaves for the Grand Cathedral, Rosencrantz searches for Ashley and Sydney. Finding them, Rosencrantz, confident in his immunity against Darkness, tries to force Sydney to surrender his powers. Rosencrantz also assaults Ashley to prove <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a suitable candidate for the powers of Darkness. Sydney refuses to listen and kills Rosencrantz by using a possessed statue, leaving Ashley to once again prove himself as his chosen successor.|$|E
5|$|With Carltron's defeat, {{the monsters}} plaguing Evermore disappear, {{but the world}} itself grows unstable. The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking them back to the real world.

5|$|AJ gets a {{job from}} Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) as a {{mechanic}} {{to help the}} family with their financial problems. He selfishly takes money from the family to buy a motorbike, but then sells it to help pay the mortgage. When Zainab says she will stop interfering in people's lives, AJ uses the opportunity to annoy her. AJ and Aliyah receive their decree nisi. When Zainab has a job interview, AJ tells the interviewer she has short-term memory loss. However, when he apologises via a Post-It note, she returns the apology. AJ supports Masood when his relationship with Zainab ends. When AJ has to look after Masood's young son Kamil Masood (Arian Chikhlia), he admits <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> good with children, and was scared when Aliyah wanted one, because he feels he cannot look after himself properly, let alone a child.

Although he initially wants to turn down the position, he eventually accepts the job offer. Shortly before he leaves Walford, AJ learns that his mother has died.

5|$|After sending Meg out on {{an errand}} {{to pick up her}} grandfather, Lois {{continues}} to seduce Anthony, having been interested in him since Peter had begun insulting her about her advancing age. Quickly returning after forgetting the car keys, Meg discovers her mother making out with her new boyfriend on the couch. The bass jingle used extensively in the long-running NBC sitcom Seinfeld is then heard, with the scene pausing, before transitioning to the Jolly Farm studio. In a surprise visit to the Griffin family home, Julie unexpectedly appears when Stewie opens the front door. Expecting Julie to recognize him, he forgets <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> dressed as Karina, causing him to hurriedly change clothing, while pretending to have an argument with his fabricated persona. A similar scene is featured in the 1993 film Mrs. Doubtfire, starring actor Robin Williams. Stewie and Jolly Farm make a reference to Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747–100 destroyed by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 occupants. Large portions of the plane fell onto Lockerbie, which killed 11 people, escalating the death toll to 270. A song features on Jolly Farm that explicitly describes debris from the newly disintegrated plane falling into Lockerbie, sung in the fashion of that of a nursery rhyme.|$|E
5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further.

When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work.

Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E

They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room.

Novak) to save the sting. When Meredith strong-arms both of them, Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. Danny becomes infuriated and walks off. Michael catches up to him and offers him a job, pointing out that with Sabre's better pricing, he could make more sales as a traveling salesman for them. He accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny {{as a part of the}} branch, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> going to rescind Danny's job offer just because it makes the other salespeople uncomfortable. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client-stealing past, then immediately welcomes him to the company.|$|E
5|$|Elphaba {{returns to}} the Wizard's palace to free the monkey {{servants}} and comes across the Wizard himself. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> evil - just a mediocre man who came into his position by chance, led to stay by the reverence of the Ozians, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation ("Wonderful"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, who has lost the power of speech. She vows to fight the Wizard until the end. Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. Fiyero helps Elphaba escape, and decides to escape with her, leaving Glinda behind. Though she was broken-hearted, Glinda reminds the Wizard and Madame Morrible {{that the way to}} recapture Elphaba is to make her think her sister is in trouble, and she will be sure to come to her rescue. She mourns that Fiyero does not love her ("I'm Not that Girl, Reprise").|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, Ann is {{hired by}} a wealthy and {{sophisticated}} aristocrat (Umbers) {{to act as}} a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to deal with any problems that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff—led by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper—and then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house somewhat unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is assured by Mrs Grose that Miles is well behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be charming, and although he does not explain what happened at school, she does not push him.
