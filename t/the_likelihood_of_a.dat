5|$|The orbital radius {{at which}} the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the solar constant—where the {{emission}} matches the Sun's output at the orbital distance of the Earth—is 0.61 astronomical units (AU). That is within the maximum habitable zone of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0AU. As Epsilon Eridani ages {{over a period of}} 20billion years, the net luminosity will increase, causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0.6–1.4AU. The presence of a large planet with a highly elliptical orbit in proximity to Epsilon Eridani's habitable zone reduces <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> terrestrial planet having a stable orbit within the habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|The undated air-fall pumice deposit exists {{across the}} southwestern {{part of the}} Big Raven Plateau called Sheep Track Pumice or Sheep Track member. Pumice is a light {{volcanic}} rock full of air spaces and commonly pale in colour, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, but can be green or black. The Sheep Track Pumice is mysterious because the vent of its origin is unknown, {{even though it is}} estimated from its state of preservation to be younger than 500 years. This pumice deposit emphasizes one of the significant volcanic hazards linked to the Mount Edziza volcanic complex – <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> violent explosive eruption. The volcano that produced the pumice might be covered by glacial ice. Collaborators at the University of British Columbia have started work on samples collected from deposits of Sheep Track Pumice.|$|E
5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value {{in deciding whether}} nominative determinism is a real effect. Instead, {{they argue that the}} claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. <b>The</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

5|$|With the fifth-ranked {{defense in}} the SEC going up against the number-one ranked scoring {{defense in the}} nation, {{attention}} centered on <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low-scoring defensive struggle. Of particular interest were the two teams' quarterbacks and how they would likely fare against such a tough defense. Georgia struggled on offense {{for much of the}} season, resulting in a battle for the starting quarterback position between senior Joe Tereshinski and freshman Matthew Stafford. Though Stafford was eventually given the starting role, he struggled in his first year, completing 126of235passes (53.6%) for 1,620yards, with sixtouchdowns and 12interceptions heading into the Chick-fil-A Bowl. On {{the opposite side of the}} field, Virginia Tech would be starting redshirt sophomore Sean Glennon. Named the starting quarterback at the beginning of the 2006 season, Glennon replaced Marcus Vick, who had been expelled from Virginia Tech at the end of the previous year. While not as statistically successful as Marcus Vick, Glennon still managed to lead the Hokies to their third consecutive 10-win season, and had the edge over Stafford in terms of experience.|$|E
5|$|In the Augustan History, Maeonius was emperor briefly {{before he}} was killed by his soldiers, however, no {{inscriptions}} or evidence exist for his reign. At the time of Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia might have been with her husband; according to chronicler George Syncellus, he was killed near Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia. The transfer of power seems to have been smooth, since Syncellus reports that the time from the assassination to the army handing the crown to Zenobia was one day. Zenobia may have been in Palmyra, but this would have reduced <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smooth transition; the soldiers might have chosen one of their officers, so the first scenario of her being with her husband is more likely. The historical records are unanimous that Zenobia did not fight for supremacy and {{there is no evidence of}} delay in the transfer of the throne to Odaenathus and Zenobia's son, the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Although she never claimed to rule in her own right and acted as a regent for her son, Zenobia held the reins of power in the kingdom, and Vaballathus was kept in his mother's shadow, never exercising real power.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{dispersal}} of seeds, or anemochory, {{is one of}} the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.|$|E

25|$|Recombination {{frequency}} is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used {{in the creation of a}} genetic linkage map. Recombination frequency (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their recombination frequency. This is a good estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a double crossover is very unlikely. When distances become higher, <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double crossover increases. As <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double crossover increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|E
