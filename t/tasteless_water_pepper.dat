40|$|A {{reliable}} and safe water supply {{is fundamental to}} all human existence. The Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks and Romans built aqueducts two thousand years ago, to ensure such a supply. Over the ensuing millennium, such aqueducts continued to bring water from far springs and rivers to communities as far apart as Cairo in Egypt and the Aztec communities at Michoacan and Queretaro in Mexico. In medieval times, engineers at Bruges constructed an underground water supply tunnel with a terminal bucket-to-cistern and chain-wheel-lift {{by the end of}} the thirteenth century. Archaeological evidence of many of these constructions remain today as symbols not only of the origins of pragmatic public health, but as witnesses of municipal foresight and engineering skill.

5000|$|Sashimi is popularly {{served with}} a dipping sauce (soy sauce) and {{condiments}} such as with wasabi paste and grated fresh ginger, or, for meat sashimi, ponzu, and such garnishes as shiso and shredded daikon radish. Wasabi paste is sometimes mixed directly into soy sauce as a dipping sauce, which is generally not done when eating sushi. Another way to flavor soy sauce with wasabi is to place the wasabi mound into the soy sauce dish and then pour it in. This allows the wasabi to infuse the soy sauce more subtly. A reputed motivation for serving wasabi with sashimi (and also gari, pickled ginger), besides its flavor, is killing harmful bacteria and parasites that could be present in raw seafood. Other garnishes, more common in Japan than overseas, include red <b>water</b> <b>pepper</b> sprouts [...] (beni-tade) and a small chrysanthemum [...] (kogiku).
