5|$|When {{it reaches}} <b>the</b> <b>pouch,</b> the {{underdeveloped}} joey suckles the teat {{of one of}} the four mammary glands while the others recede. The joey remains attached to the teat for 100–125 days, after which it ceases its attachment but remains in <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> and continues to suckle, but more intermittently. The joey begins to leave <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> and eat grass at around 200 days when it is more developed. It still suckles, more forcefully but less regularly. By 250 days, the joey no longer needs <b>the</b> <b>pouch,</b> and it is fully weaned at around 300–350 days. The tammar wallaby has been observed to engage in alloparental care, in which an adult may adopt another's young. Male tammars may live for around 11 years, while females live for 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{pelicans}} {{can usually}} {{cope with their}} lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. <b>The</b> <b>pouch</b> louse Piagetiella peralis, which occurs in <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> and therefore cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of <b>the</b> <b>pouch,</b> but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host. The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes Contracaecum multipapillatum and C. mexicanum and the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island. In May 2012, hundreds of Peruvian pelicans {{were reported to have}} perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation.|$|E

Small sections of Velcro, sewn {{on the inside of}} the lids of <b>the</b> <b>pouches,</b> and <b>the</b> top front section of <b>the</b> <b>pouches,</b> allow for easy and effortles fastening. Added silencer strips allow to cover them when not needed.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Thiamin and {{ascorbic acid}} content and {{retention}} were determined in raw, blanched, pouched and canned green beans immediately after processing and after storage {{for four months}} at room temperature or at 37. 5 °C. Ascorbic acid was also determined in raw, pouched and canned Royal Ann cherries immediately after processing and after storage for six months at room temperature. Five replicates of green beans and three replicates of cherries were assayed. Compared to the raw green beans, the blanched green beans were higher in apparent thiamin and lower in ascorbic acid. There was significantly more thiamin and ascorbic acid in <b>the</b> <b>pouched</b> green beans and more ascorbic acid in <b>the</b> <b>pouched</b> cherries than in the canned ones. There were no significant losses in these two vitamins in <b>the</b> <b>pouched</b> and canned products after four months storage at room temperature. These vitamins, however, were significantly lower in <b>the</b> <b>pouched</b> and canned products after four months storage at 37. 8 °C. The liquid portions of <b>the</b> <b>pouched</b> products had significantly higher concentrations of these water soluble vitamins than the canned ones. However, {{the total amount of}} liquid portion was lower in <b>the</b> <b>pouched</b> than in <b>the</b> canned products, leading to smaller total vitamin losses in <b>the</b> <b>pouched</b> products. Canned green beans were yellower and lighter in color than pouched green beans. Pouched cherries were significantly darker red than the canned cherries. <b>The</b> <b>pouched</b> products were firmer in texture than the canned. Results of this study demonstrate that pouched green beans and cherries have a better nutritional value, color and texture than the canned ones...|$|R

5|$|Krycek {{leads the}} agents to Dulles International Airport, where {{they try to}} {{apprehend}} a second courier carrying a diplomatic pouch from Russia. The courier leads the agents on a pursuit through the airport, but drops <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> before escaping. <b>The</b> <b>pouch</b> is revealed to carry a seemingly unremarkable rock. Mulder has Krycek confined at the high rise apartment of Assistant Director Walter Skinner before having the rock analyzed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Dr. Sacks, a NASA scientist, tells Mulder and Scully that the rock is a prehistoric meteorite fragment that might contain fossilized alien bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The female tammar can {{conceive}} {{shortly after}} giving birth. Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant {{for nearly a}} year. For {{the first half of}} the year, the presence of the joey in <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will stimulate the blastocyst's development. However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to <b>the</b> <b>pouch.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{all species}} {{copulation}} {{takes place at}} the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3–10days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build a nest) sometimes in <b>the</b> <b>pouch,</b> and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.|$|E
50|$|Utility Pouch: A pair {{of large}} {{vertical}} rectangular pouches {{with a built-in}} cloth yoke and a narrow strap for securing across the chest. It was a bigger version of <b>the</b> Basic <b>Pouch.</b> <b>The</b> yoke could be worn over the neck and <b>the</b> <b>pouches</b> across <b>the</b> chest or worn over the shoulder with <b>the</b> <b>pouches</b> across one side. Each pouch could carry either (3) BREN gun magazines, (2) Boys Anti-Tank Rifle magazines, (3) 2-inch O.S.B. mortar shells, a Mark VII water bottle, several grenades, or boxes of Small Arms Ammunition.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pouches</b> {{are lined}} by {{olfactory}} epithelium, and commonly include {{a series of}} internal folds to increase the surface area. In some teleosts, <b>the</b> <b>pouches</b> branch off into additional sinus-like cavities, while in coelacanths, they form a series of tubes. Unlike tetrapods, the nasal epithelium of fishes does not include any mucus-secreting cells, since it is already naturally moist.|$|R

5|$|The {{legends of}} self-wounding and the {{provision}} of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest in order to fully empty <b>the</b> <b>pouch.</b> Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this {{may have contributed to the}} myth.|$|E
5|$|Where {{pelicans}} {{interact with}} fishers, through either {{sharing the same}} waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. Fish hooks are swallowed or catch in the skin of <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> or webbed feet, and strong monofilament fishing line can become wound around bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} bird families, {{pelicans}} {{are susceptible to}} a variety of parasites. Specialist feather lice of the genus Piagetella are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito Culex pipens, and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. Leeches may attach to the vent or sometimes the inside of <b>the</b> <b>pouch.</b> A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks and nematodes. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the soft tick Ornithodoros capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several lice are very host-specific.|$|E
30|$|The {{method used}} to induce acute {{inflammation}} {{was similar to}} that described by Romano et al. [17]. Briefly, sterile air pouches were produced by injecting 5 [*]mL of air subcutaneously (s.c.) through a disposable disc filter (EPS® Inc., Ivyland, PA, USA; 2 [*]μm) {{into the back of the}} mouse (day 0); <b>the</b> <b>pouches</b> were injected again with 3 [*]mL of air on day 3. On day 4, <b>the</b> <b>pouches</b> from <b>the</b> mice in group C received 1 -mL saline (B Braum Medical, Barcelona, Spain), and <b>the</b> <b>pouches</b> from <b>the</b> mice in groups I, IN, and INM received 1 -mL carrageenan lambda 1.2 %[*]s.c. (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).|$|R

5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|The P90 has {{provisions}} for mounting {{a number of}} different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal. This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of 184mm (7.2in), a diameter of 35mm (1.4in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5lb). When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> will collect up to one hundred cases before filling.|$|E

25|$|Kangaroos have {{developed}} a number of adaptations to a dry, infertile country and highly variable climate. As with all marsupials, the young are born {{at a very early}} stage of development—after a gestation of 31–36 days. At this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> and attach to a teat. In comparison, a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old, and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive. When the joey is born, it {{is about the size of}} a lima bean. The joey will usually stay in <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> for about nine months (180–320 days for the Western Grey) before starting to leave <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> for small periods of time. It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo {{reproduction}} {{is similar to}} that of opossums. The egg (still contained in the shell membrane, a few micrometres thick, and with only a small quantity of yolk within it) descends from the ovary into the uterus. There it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate. Even in the largest kangaroo (the red kangaroo) the neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually, only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long; its hindlegs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's abdomen into <b>the</b> <b>pouch,</b> which takes about three to five minutes. Once in <b>the</b> <b>pouch,</b> it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> grows rapidly. After about 190 days, the baby (joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of <b>the</b> <b>pouch,</b> after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after about 235 days, it leaves <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> for the last time. The lifespan of kangaroos averages at six years in the wild to in excess of 20 years in captivity, varying by species. Most individuals, however, do not reach maturity in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The female {{kangaroo}} {{is usually}} pregnant in permanence, {{except on the}} day she gives birth; however, she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave <b>the</b> <b>pouch.</b> This is known as diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according {{to the needs of the}} joey. In addition, the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in <b>the</b> <b>pouch.</b>|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the general}} inaccessibility of <b>the</b> <b>pouches</b> in horses, they can be an area of {{infection}} by fungi and bacteria, and these infections can be extremely severe and hard to treat. <b>The</b> condition guttural <b>pouch</b> tympany affects several breeds, including the Arabian horse. The condition predisposes young horses to infection, often including severe swelling and often requires surgery to correct. <b>The</b> guttural <b>pouch</b> is also <b>the</b> site of infection in equine strangles.|$|R

25|$|A jockstrap (also {{known as}} a jock, jock strap, strap, supporter, or {{athletic}} supporter) is an undergarment for supporting the male genitalia during cycling, contact sports or other vigorous physical activity. A jockstrap consists of a waistband (usually elastic) with a support pouch for the genitalia and two elastic straps affixed {{to the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> and to the left and right sides of the waistband at the hip. <b>The</b> <b>pouch,</b> in some varieties, may be fitted with a pocket to hold an abdominal guard (impact resistant cup, box) to protect the testicles and the penis from injury.|$|E
25|$|The gastric bypass {{reduces the}} size of the stomach by well over 90%. A normal stomach can stretch, {{sometimes}} to over 1000 mL, while <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> of the gastric bypass may be 15 mL in size. The gastric bypass pouch is usually formed from the part of the stomach which is least susceptible to stretching. That, and its small original size, prevents any significant long-term change in pouch volume. What does change, over time, is {{the size of}} the connection between the stomach and intestine and the ability of the small intestine to hold a greater volume of food. Over time, the functional capacity of <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> increases; by that time, weight loss has occurred, and the increased capacity should serve to allow maintenance of a lower body weight.|$|E
25|$|With {{the decline}} in the use of jockstrap in sports, the use of the {{necessary}} abdominal guard has also declined despite the safety implications. Some see wearing a cup as a taboo topic. Typically cups are worn in <b>the</b> <b>pouch</b> of a jockstrap which may be double-lined to hold the cup, or in compression shorts or sport-specific briefs.|$|E

50|$|Most {{military}} webbing systems {{incorporate a}} degree of modular construction consisting of a yoke (shoulder harness), a belt {{and a variety of}} pouches specific to different loads, for example ammunition magazines may have dividers, special waterproofing, and/or tabs to help lift the magazines out. Different combinations of pouches can be used to customise webbing to better suit the mission it is needed for. In some better models <b>the</b> <b>pouches</b> are sewn directly onto a hip pad which prevents bouncing of <b>the</b> <b>pouches</b> and makes <b>the</b> webbing more comfortable.|$|R
5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. <b>The</b> <b>pouches</b> are numbered such that <b>the</b> first <b>pouch</b> is <b>the</b> closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from <b>the</b> third <b>pouch</b> with <b>the</b> thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from <b>the</b> fourth <b>pouch.</b> During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by <b>the</b> fourth <b>pouch</b> to <b>the</b> same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from <b>the</b> third <b>pouch</b> within <b>the</b> chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|R
