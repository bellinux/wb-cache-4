Visible on the shirt on the left are signatures by Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw of the tour's opening band Come. The photo was taken by Gordon, who believed it could be used as the album cover. The band liked the shot, but the record label did not want to use it without permission from the fans. As the band did not have any way to contact them, their faces had to be cropped out.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{players were}} chosen {{to be on the}} ballot for the All-Star Game (minimum of two players from each team), but fans were also given the option to write in any player who was not listed. Ballots were all digital for the fourth {{consecutive}} time, giving fans the ability to cast votes online at NHL.com and Facebook. Votes could also be cast via text messages from mobile devices and Smartphone users could vote by way of a mobile ballot feature. The NHL put no limitation on the number of votes an individual could cast. When fan balloting ended, 14.3 million votes had been cast and the top six were named to the All-Star Game. The six top vote recipients were from only two teams, the Pittsburgh Penguins (4) and Chicago Blackhawks (2). Individually, Sidney Crosby led all players with 635,509 votes, while teammate Kris Letang was elected as a write-in candidate. The six players elected by <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> listed below with their vote totals.|$|E

40|$|Al-Batin {{alluvial}} <b>fan</b> <b>is</b> one of <b>the</b> largest alluvial <b>fans</b> in Iraq, {{especially in}} the Iraqi Southern Desert. Its eastern and southern limits form parts of the Iraqi – Kuwait international borders. <b>The</b> <b>fan</b> <b>is</b> de-posited by Wadi Al-Batin, the last apex being on the southern limits of the main wide depression formed by the active Abu Jir – Euphrates Fault Zone.

The length and the maximum width of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>are</b> 110. 192 Km and 119. 1 Km, respectively, whereas the slope along its length is 0. 7 ᴼ. <b>The</b> <b>fan</b> <b>is</b> covered by gypcrete sheet with thickness varies from (0. 5 – 1. 5) m. Four stages <b>were</b> recognized within <b>the</b> <b>fan,</b> which <b>is</b> dated to be Pleistocene in age. The four stages are marked by clear height differences. The deposition of <b>the</b> alluvial <b>fan</b> <b>is</b> highly affected by {{the activity of the}} active Abu Jir – Euphrates Fault Zone, which is represented on the surface as a wide shallow depression in which <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>is</b> laid down by Wadi Al-Batin.

25|$|One of {{the major}} reasons is the stadium's design. Originally built in a shallow sinkhole, the playing surface is below ground level. Expansions have {{enclosed}} the playing area on all sides with steep stands, and <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> within {{a few feet of}} the action. This traps crowd noise inside the stadium, which results in sound levels on the field which have been measured at 115 decibels—just short of the threshold of pain.|$|E

The Omonoia fans which are called Gate 9 have friendship with other teams supporters such as Hapoel Tel Aviv and Standard Liège fans.|$|E
25|$|The 12th man or 12th {{player is}} a term for fans of teams in eleven-a-side sports games, {{particularly}} association football (soccer) or American football. As most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team {{on the playing field}} at a time, referring to a team's fans as the 12th man implies that they have a potentially helpful role in the game. Infrequently, the term has referred to individuals having a notable connection to their football team. In Canadian football, 12 players are usually on the field at one time and the term 13th man is often used to refer to fans. Similarly, in Australian rules football, 18 players are on the field and <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> {{often referred to as the}} 19th man. The term has a different meaning in cricket, referring instead to the first substitute player who fields when a member of the fielding side is injured (the term 6th man has a similar connotation in basketball).|$|E
