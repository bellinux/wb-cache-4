Modeling these reactors with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is advantageous when performing parametric studies for design and scale-up. From a computational resource point of view, <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulations</b> are easier to perform than three-dimensional simulations, but they may not capture the proper physics. This paper will compare two- and three-dimensional simulations in a 10. 2 cm diameter fluidized bed with side air injection to determine when <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulations</b> are adequate to capture the bed hydrodynamics. Simulations will be completed in a glass bead fluidized bed operating at 1. 5 Umf and 3 Umf, where Umf is the minimum fluidization velocity. Side air injection is also simulated to model biomass injection for gasification applications. The simulations are compared to experimentally obtained time-averaged local gas holdup values using X-ray computed tomography.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to study the {{formation}} of the cubic carbide phase (gamma phase) free gradient zone and the gamma cone structure at the edges of gradient sintered cemented carbides. Four types of cemented carbides; WCTi(C,N) -Co, WC-Ti(C,N) -Ni, WC-Ti(C,N) -Fe, WC-(Ti,Ta,NB) (C,N) -Co were gradient sintered and the thicknesses of the gradients were measured. Formation of the gradients is simulated and the simulations results are compared with experimental data. For all of the one-dimensional simulations, the DICTRA [1] software is used. The <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulations</b> are carried out by using a new simulation tool which is called “YAPFI”. The YAPFI software is a tool for simulation of diffffusion in multiphase systems along one, two, or three spatial coordinates. Various numerical parameters have been studied by running less computationally demanding one-dimensional simulations. The optimized parameters are used to setup the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulations.</b> Two different kinetic databases were used in the simulations.

40|$|Computational {{simulations}} of the AIR- 1 test condition in the University of Illinois ’ Hypervelocity Expansion Tube were con-ducted to verify facility operation and to obtain free stream properties that are otherwise difficult to measure. Two types of simulation were undertaken. The {{first was a}} one-dimensional simulation of the entire facility and the second was a hybrid sim-ulation, combining a one-dimensional simulation of the shock tube section with a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulation</b> of the acceler-ation tube. The one-dimensional simulation matched the ex-perimental data well, however the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulation</b> did not initially match the experimental measurements of shock speed and test gas pitot pressure.

40|$|A {{simulation}} model is presented for the verification {{of the recently}} developed steady-state one-dimensional adiabatic thermal Child-Langmuir flow theory. In this theory, a self-consistent Poisson equation is developed {{through the use of}} the fluid-Maxwell equations and an adiabatic equation of state. The adiabatic equation of state is also a statement of normalized rms thermal emittance conservation. Solving the self-consistent Poisson equation with the appropriate boundary conditions yields the current density, electrostatic potential, fluid velocity, equilibrium density, temperature, and pressure profiles at a given cathode temperature. A one-dimensional {{simulation model}} has been developed. It consists of the initial loading, the charged-sheet model algorithm, and the post-processing of the results. Great care has been taken in the initial loading of the beam, with the beam loaded as close to the equilibrium values as possible. Because there is no known solution for the interface problem between the quantum mechanical flow of electrons inside the solid material and the classical flow of electrons in the cathode vacuum, a reinjection scheme is proposed in which the initial phase space near the cathode be maintained throughout the simulation. Three one-dimensional beams are simulated at dimensionless cathode temperatures of 0. 1, 0. 01, and 0. 001. Great success is achieved at validating the theory at the dimensionless cathode temperature of 0. 1. The simulation results for the dimensionless cathode temperature of 0. 01 and 0. 001 cases are consistent with the theoretical prediction. Because of the good agreement between the simulation and theory, the use of the adiabatic equation of state is justified. A strategy to extend the one-dimensional adiabatic thermal Child-Langmuir theory into two-dimensions is presented. Because two-dimensional adiabatic equation(s) of state are currently unknown, a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulation</b> is used to both investigate and help formulate the adiabatic equation(s) of state. A <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulation</b> model has been developed to simulate flows in a Pierce gun slab geometry. The <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulation</b> consists of the meshing of the domain, the initial loading, the particle-in-cell algorithm, and the post-processing of the results. An estimate on the two-dimensional form of the equilibrium density is used to initially load the beam. Like the one-dimensional case, the proposed particle boundary condition for the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulation</b> is that the initial phase space near the cathode be preserved throughout the simulation.

40|$|Flying snakes use {{a unique}} method of aerial locomotion: they jump from tree branches, flatten {{their bodies and}} {{undulate}} through the air to produce a glide. The shape of their body cross-section during the glide {{plays an important role}} in generating lift. This paper presents a computational investigation of the aerodynamics of the cross-sectional shape. <b>Two-dimensional</b> <b>simulations</b> of incompressible flow past the anatomically correct cross-section of the species Chrysopelea paradisi show that a significant enhancement in lift appears at a 35 ◦ angle of attack, above Reynolds numbers 2000. Previous experiments on physical models also obtained an increased lift, at the same angle of attack. The flow is inherently three-dimensional in physical experiments, due to fluid instabilities, and it is thus intriguing that the enhanced lift also appears in the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>simulations.</b> The simulations point to the lift enhancement arising from the early separation of the boundary layer on the dorsal surface of the snake profile, without stall. The separated shear layer rolls up and interacts with secondary vorticity in the near-wake, inducing the primary vortex to remain closer to the body and thus cause enhanced suction, resulting in higher lift...|$|R
