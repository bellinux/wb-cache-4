5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage pregnancy. <b>Teen</b> <b>pregnancy</b> rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E

Schistosomiasis, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at only 0.2percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000people, in part due to the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa.

5000|$|The United States has {{the highest}} rates of teenage {{pregnancy}} and sexually transmitted diseases in developed countries. The two primary reasons given by teenagers for not using protection is that the chance of becoming pregnant is small, and the failure to anticipate intercourse. <b>Teen</b> <b>pregnancies</b> can be prevented. The best method of reducing the consequences of teenage parenthood is by providing reproductive health services to prevent teenagers from becoming pregnant in the first place. [...] Prevention can not only be beneficial on a micro level but it is also beneficial on a more macro scale. Nationally, <b>teen</b> <b>pregnancies</b> cost tax payers an average of $9.4 billion each year. [...] These costs are associated with health care, foster care, criminal justice, public assistance and lost tax revenue. <b>Teen</b> <b>Pregnancies</b> can help be prevented by increasing access to contraceptives and increasing correct and consistent use of contraceptives, more parental involvement, and more education about sexual intercourse. The best method of preventing teenage pregnancy is by integrating sex and STD education into the science curriculum as well as addressing the effects of teenage pregnancies in social studies for middle and high school students.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to collect {{perceptions}} and behaviours of teenmothers and adolescents without children about their sexuality. This lead to ideas to improve the sexual education for teenagers and to prevent <b>teen</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Method: Six teenmothers and six adolescents without children were selected in the social environment of the researchers. A single case study and in-depth interviews were used to examine their perceptions and behaviours. The behavioural determinants of the ASE-model were leading factors of this study. Results: The most important results, collected from qualitative analysis of the interviews, are that teen moms are naïve users of contraceptives and lack knowledge about how birth control pills works. Furthermore, results showed that teen mothers experience low self-efficacy. Discussion: Recommendations are to make teenagers aware of how birth control pills work, to increase their self-efficacy and to emphasize the negative consequences of <b>teen</b> <b>pregnancies...</b>|$|R
