5000|$|In its [...] "decentralized" [...] dimension, {{international}} cooperation {{is a phenomenon}} that emerged following the Second World War, when local governments in Europe - especially those in France, which were active coordinators of this new form of interaction - signed <b>twinning</b> <b>agreements,</b> principally with German local governments, {{in order to promote}} peaceful coexistence and the reconstruction of Europe. At that time, the <b>twinning</b> <b>agreements</b> had a strong cultural and political character while decentralized cooperation had the overarching aim of maintaining peace in the postwar period. However, from the 1970s, the interdependence created by globalization in different fields combined with the evolution of the concept of cooperation (from an assistance-driven to a developmental approach) to elevate the nature of the agreements to another level. At that point, local governments, as they acquired greater autonomy, recognized the importance of international issues in their day-to-day processes and saw decentralized cooperation as a means of overcoming their regional limitations, whether economic, technological, social, or others. From then on, the international participation of local governments has been increasingly evident in practice.|$|R
