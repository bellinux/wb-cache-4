5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed a pain <b>threshold</b> <b>and</b> the run became easier.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was booked}} in Celtic's {{penultimate}} league game against Kilmarnock, which {{caused him to}} go over the disciplinary points <b>threshold</b> <b>and</b> receive a suspension for the first two matches of the 2011–12 season. Brown helped Celtic to the 2011 Scottish Cup Final, which Celtic won 3–0 against Motherwell. This allowed him to collect his first trophy as Celtic captain. Brown played 39 times for Celtic, scoring four goals, during the 2010–11 season. He was often used on the right of midfield, partly due to the form of other central midfielders such as Beram Kayal, Joe Ledley and Ki Sung-Yueng, but also because Brown is more able to play in wide areas than them.|$|E

In 2010, Maiden uniteD, an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of Ayreon, <b>Threshold</b> <b>and</b> Within Temptation, released Mind the Acoustic Pieces, a re-interpretation of the entire Piece of Mind album. Many other Iron Maiden cover albums exist (each featuring various artists), including piano, electro, string quartet and hip-hop tributes.|$|E

5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure <b>threshold</b> <b>and</b> can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E

He also made an appearance in the adventure comedy-drama Lassie as a traveling circus performer. The film received highly positive reviews, though it did not fare well at the box office.|$|E
5|$|When a {{main-sequence star}} consumes the {{hydrogen}} at its core, {{the loss of}} energy generation causes its gravitational collapse to resume. Stars with less than 0.23 , are predicted to directly become white dwarfs when energy generation by nuclear fusion of hydrogen at their core comes to a halt. In stars between this <b>threshold</b> <b>and</b> 10 , the hydrogen surrounding the helium core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, {{turning it into a}} red giant. At this point the star is evolving off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. The path which the star now follows across the HR diagram, to the upper right of the main sequence, is called an evolutionary track.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of <b>thresholding</b> <b>and</b> gradient at different tissue interfaces is of paramount interest in image segmentation and other imaging methods <b>and</b> applications. Most <b>thresholding</b> <b>and</b> gradient selection methods primarily focus on image histograms and therefore, fail {{to harness the}} information generated by intensity patterns in an image. We present a new <b>thresholding</b> <b>and</b> gradient optimization method which accounts for spatial arrangement of intensities forming different objects in an image. Specifically, we recognize object class uncertainty, a histogram-based feature, and formulate an energy function based on its correlation with image gradients that characterizes the objects and shapes in a given image. Finally, this energy function is used to determine optimum <b>thresholds</b> <b>and</b> gradients for various tissue interfaces. The underlying theory behind the method is that objects manifest themselves with fuzzy boundaries in an acquired image and that, in a probabilistic sense; intensities with high class uncertainty are associated with high image gradients generally indicating object/tissue interfaces. The new method simultaneously determines optimum values for both <b>thresholds</b> <b>and</b> gradient parameters at different object/tissue interfaces. The method has been applied on several 2 D and 3 D medical image data sets and it has successfully determined both <b>thresholds</b> <b>and</b> gradients for different tissue interfaces even {{when some of the}} thresholds are almost impossible to locate in their histograms. The accuracy and reproducibility of the method has been examined using 3 D multi-row detector computed tomography images of two cadaveric ankles each scanned thrice with repositioning the specimen between two scans...|$|R
