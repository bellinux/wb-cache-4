[...] "It is well," [...] said the old lady, wrapping herself up in a rich Kashmire, [...] "that there is some way of knowing a thing that cost fifty guineas from an article that is sold for five; but I venture to say there are not one out of ten thousand that would understand the difference." ...|$|E
