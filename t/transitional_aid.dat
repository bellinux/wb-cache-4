40|$|Suomen lammastalouden keskeinen ongelma EU-jäsenyysaikana on ollut erittäin alhaalla pysynyt kotimainen tuottajahintataso. Kotimainen lampaanlihan tuotanto onkin viime vuosina vähentynyt. Toisaalta kuluttajahintojen lasku on lisännyt lampaanlihan kulutusta. Lisääntyneen kysynnän vuoksi tuonti on moninkertaistunut jäsenyysvuosina. Lammastalouteen liittyy kuitenkin monia sellaisia tekijöitä, jotka puoltavat tuotannon säilyttämistä osana kotieläintuotantoamme. Perusedellytykset kannattavalle tuotannolle tulisi silloin olla olemassa. Lammastalouden tulokehitystä on tarkasteltu MTTL:ssa vuodesta 1994 vuoteen 2000 tilamallilaskelmien avulla. Laskelmat osoittavat tuottajahintojen ja tukitasojen alenemisen pudottaneen voimakkaasti lammastalouden tuloja etenkin, kun samanaikaisesti tuotantopanosten hinnoissa ei ole tapahtunut vastaavia muutoksia. Tulojen lasku on ollut voimakkaampaa Etelä-Suomessa A- ja B-alueilla kuin C-tukialueella, jossa pohjoisen tuen avulla on voitu kompensoida siirtymäkauden tukien laskua. Ilman korvaavia tukijärjestelmiä siirtymäkauden tukien päättyminen kuluvan vuoden lopussa romahduttaisi lammastalouden edellytykset eteläisen Suomen alueella täysin. Lammastalouden tulokehitys lähivuosina riippuukin pitkälti harjoitettavasta tukipolitiikasta. Kuitenkin toimenpiteillä, joilla voidaan vaikuttaa markkinahintojen kohoamiseen ja tuotantokustannusten alenemiseen, on pitemmällä ajanjaksolla keskeinen merkitys lammastalouden tulo- ja kannattavuuskehitykseen. The EU {{membership}} and abolition of border controls has been reflected {{as a strong}} growth in the import of sheep meat. During the EU membership the producer price level of sheep meat has been {{only about half of}} the average price level in the EU. The small volume has been considered the main reason for the problems in sheep husbandry due to the low efficiency both in sheep meat production and in the processing industry. The share of sheep husbandry in the total Finnish agricultural production is very small, but sheep husbandry involves factors that support the continuation of this as part of the Finnish livestock production. This report is concerned with the income development in sheep husbandry in 1994 - 2000. The study is based on the farm model drawn up at the Association of Rural Centres, and calculations have been made for the support areas A, B, C 1 and C 3. Depending on the regional differences in the yield levels, the cultivated area that meets the need for fodder in the flock varies from 20 to 30 ha. The number of animals in the model is 100 ewes, and 200 lambs and 20 sheep are annually sold to for slaughter. Wool is also sold. The calculations assume that the yields, use of inputs as well as prices for the products and input prices are the same in the different parts of the country, and there is regional variation only for the part of support. The development of the product and input prices until the autumn of 1999 has been taken into account in the study. The main business result concept used to indicate the income development is agricultural income which shows the compensation for farmers labour and own capital invested in agriculture. The support paid in 1995 - 1999 is based on verified support levels. In the calculations for 2000 <b>transitional</b> <b>aid</b> is no longer paid, and the possible continuation of the aid for serious difficulties has not been taken into account in the calculations. Instead, the effects of the Agenda 2000 reform have been included in the estimates for income development. As a result of the changes in the returns, support and costs after the EU membership, in 1995 the agricultural income of sheep farms fell by almost 11 % in support area A, in area B the income stayed at about the earlier level, in area C 1 it rose by a little over 3 % and in area C 3 it increased by as much as 27 %. Due to the decrease in the <b>transitional</b> <b>aid,</b> based on the farm model calculations the income development in sheep husbandry has been decreasing during the period 1996 - 1999, except in 1998 when the national aid for crop production was also paid to the grass area of sheep farms, and the producer price also rose slightly. At the support levels of 1999 and taking into account the estimated development of the product and input prices, the farm model calculations show that in areas A, B and C 1 the agricultural income falls by 13 - 14 % and in area C 3 by a little under 8 % from 1998. The outcome of the negotiations with the EU Commission concerning the continuation of the national aid for Southern Finland is highly important for sheep farms, too. Without any national aid the agricultural income would fall by 82 % in area A and 66 % in area B from 1999 to 2000. In area C the northern aid compensates to some extent for the decrease in the <b>transitional</b> <b>aid,</b> but the income of sheep farms is still going to fall by almost 10 % in area C 1 and about 2 % in area C 3. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL...|$|E
40|$|In our paper, we {{will first}} {{set the scene}} for the post {{cease-fire}} economic possibilities by briefly examining what we {{refer to as the}} "lost" years since the start of open conflict in the North in 1969. Although economists of nationalist and unionist hues are likely to interpret the historical North-South socio-economic record with differing degrees of emphasis, nevertheless the facts tend to speak for themselves in a relatively uncontroversial way and point generally to the desirability of more imaginative policy experimentation in both parts of Ireland. We then attempt to address more controversial matters and explore three interrelated possible post cease-fire scenarios of peace, that differ in their assumptions concerning North-South economic policy interactions and North-South institutions. The first is the case of peaceful but separate development, or the economic status quo ante. The second is the case of North-South co-ordinated development, where limited forms of political/economic co-operation are put in place. Finally, we attempt to conceptualise the case of a single island economy, borrowing and re-defining a term used in a more restricted context by Sir George Quigley in his address to the CII in 1992 (Quigley, 1992) and elsewhere (Quigley, 1993).

The Commonwealth's new welfare system, {{in conjunction with}} federal reforms in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, limits benefits to 24 months in any consecutive 60 -month period, subject to several statuary exceptions. The TAFDC program also requires that welfare recipients, in order to retain benefit eligibility, must actively seek employment through an intensive, structured job search process. With the Commonwealth's two-year time limit entering into effect on December 1, 1996, a number of welfare recipients lost their benefit eligibility after December 1, 1998. Welfare recipients living in Dorchester and Roxbury communities {{who are unable to}} find work after benefit termination would suffer great difficulty meeting their needs as a result. This new WtW initiative initially launched by the Boston Technical Venture Center (BTVC) is designed to link local residents in Boston's most disadvantaged neighborhoods, who lack sufficient education and training, to the technology marketplace. This new initiative will entail community outreach for "hard-to-employ" and other eligible TAFDC recipients, hiring them for production/assembly jobs at the BTVC developing an on-site Training Program and providing on-site case management for them. It targets low-income residents, long-term or time-limit welfare recipients, former recipients who have exhausted their time-limited benefits, and non-custodian parents (with minor children who are eligible for, or are receiving TAFDC, or other related benefits, as specified).

The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine broiler {{production}} in Finland, investments in broiler husbandry as well as intentions concerning such investments. The another aim was to calculate income development in broiler production in 1994, 1996 and 1997 on the basis of the taxation data and also an estimate was made concerning income development in 1998 - 2000. The data were collected by means of an informed questionnaire, and the number of broiler producers who replied was 53. Depending on the year, the income development in broiler production was examined from the data of 37 - 41 farms, which were weighted by the number of broiler farms in each size class in 1995. Besides that the result of all agricultural production on broiler farms in 1994 - 1996 was examined on the basis of the average weighted taxation data from 36 - 45 broiler farms included in the Enterprise and Income Statistics of Agriculture and Forestry. Most of the farms participating in the study intend to continue broiler production, but about a fifth of the entrepreneurs can be considered to express some uncertainty in terms of this. Two thirds had invested in broiler production in 1995 - 1997. The investments mainly concerned feeding, air conditioning or heating. About a quarter of the farms had built a new production building or extended the old one. According to the study, the willingness to invest continues in 1998 - 2002. Almost an half of those who replied intended to invest in new or existing broiler production buildings. One out of four farmers were uncertain in terms of future investments and one out of ten had no intentions to invest in broiler production. In 1997 an average broiler farm, with about 139, 000 broilers slaughtered, agricultural income from broiler husbandry amounted to about FIM 195, 000. Before the EU membership in 1994 agricultural income was almost the same even if the number of broilers was 18 % smaller. The trends were proportionally the same in the case of the development of the income from all agricultural production on broiler farms included in the Enterprise and Income Statistics of Agriculture and Forestry in 1994 - 1996. As a result of the decrease in the <b>transitional</b> <b>aid</b> paid in 1995 - 1999, the agricultural income in broiler production would fall by a third in 1998 and in 1999 by more than half from the level of 1997. According to the current provisions, in 2000 broiler production in support areas A and B would no longer be eligible for national aid, and in such a situation the incomes would not even cover the costs of broiler production. If the amount of aid stayed at the level of 1999 in support area C 1, where the northern aid can still be paid, agricultural income in this region would remain about FIM 84, 000 per farm. Finland negotiates with the EU in 1999 on the possibilities to continue the aid for livestock production in areas A and B. The sensitivity analysis shows that the development of the sales income from broiler meat and expenditure in purchased fodder are even more significant in terms of the income development in broiler production than the levels of aid. Because of the importance of the sales income and the establishment of the producer price on the market broiler production is highly sensitive to economic fluctuations. The balance between the production and consumption is thus decisive in terms of maintaining stable producer prices. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{realised}} income development of agriculture in 1994 - 1997 on the basis of taxation data on hen farms located mainly in support areas A and B as well as to estimate the income development in 1998 - 2000. The study was also concerned with the investments of hen farms and intentions related to these in 1996 - 2002. Data were mainly collected by questionnaires sent in 1998 to hen farms that had returned a similar questionnaire in 1996. Questionnaires in 1998 were returned from 71 farms, and hen husbandry was still practised on 62 of these. Income development in 1996 - 1997 was examined based on farms that participated in the latter inquiry and income development in 1994 - 1995 based on farms that returned the questionnaire in 1996 from which there was accurate taxation data available. Depending on the year, the number of farms varied from 38 to 51. Data on income development were weighted according to the farm size classes and areas by the number of hen farms in areas A and B in 1995. In addition to the data from the inquiries, the result from agricultural production on hen farms in 1994 - 1996 was examined based on the average weighted taxation data of 189 - 284 on hen farms included in the Enterprise and Income Statistics of Agriculture and Forestry. One out of ten of the entrepreneurs who returned the questionnaires in 1998 expressed intentions to quit egg production by the end of 2002. On these farms the average number of hens was smaller than on farms that intended to continue as before or to expand their production. One out of seven of those who replied were uncertain about their future. Almost a third of the farms that had continued hen husbandry had invested in their hen production in 1996 - 1997. Only few farms had built new henhouses or extended old ones. Many investments concerned manure stores, which had been built on 10 % of the farms. About a third of the entrepreneurs reported intentions to invest in hen husbandry in 1998 - 2002, and the investments would mainly concern manure stores and renovation of henhouses. A third of the producers expressed uncertainty concerning the future investments, and about a third had no intentions to invest in hen husbandry. Using the level of aid in area B, on an average farm in support areas A and B with 2, 500 hens the average total agricultural income in 1997 was about FIM 117, 000, which is about half of the level of 1994 before Finland joined the EU. On the hen farms in support areas A, B and C included in the Enterprise and Income Statistics of Agriculture and Forestry agricultural income in 1994 - 1996 was even lower than the average agricultural income in areas A and B, because in the farms included in the Enterprise and Income Statistics the arable area was much smaller than in areas A and B. As a result of the decrease in the <b>transitional</b> <b>aid</b> paid in 1995 - 1999, the agricultural income of the average farm in areas A and B would fall by a few percentage points in 1998 - 1999, using the aid levels in area B. According to current provisions, after 1999 no national aid can be paid for livestock production in areas A and B, and agricultural income would fall to FIM 73, 000 per farm. If the northern aid were kept at the current level in support area C 1, agricultural income would be about FIM 139, 000. Finland negotiates with the EU in 1999 on the possibility to continue the aid for livestock production in support areas A and B. The sensitivity analysis shows that, apart from aid, agricultural income on hen farms is also sensitive to the development of the sales income of eggs. In order to improve the profitability of egg production it would be important to cut overproduction to reach the self-sufficiency level in the production and through this to raise the producer price. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} question of how to improve the access to higher education for students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, in order to promote equality of opportunity. In order to do so, experimental evaluation methodology is used to address relevant research questions and draw actionable policy lessons in the context of the Chilean higher education system. The first chapter of this dissertation studies the impact of college peers on academic performance with the help of a natural experiment in Chile, which allows for exogenous classroom composition. In particular, first year students at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, one of the leading Chilean universities, are randomly assigned to their first semester college class groups. I take advantage of this feature in order to robustly estimate the impact of peer characteristics on undergraduate academic performance. The research hypothesis is that being assigned as a freshman to a group with more or less students from a same school, or from a given socioeconomic background, may result in very different patterns of adaptation, potentially impacting academic performance. Significant evidence is found that suggests that, contrary to the results found in most of the existing literature, the average college admission score of first semester classmates not only has no positive impact on the academic performance of undergraduate students, but may actually be negatively affecting their grades. Also, although there are some differences across degrees and secondary school types, in general undergraduate students are more likely to be dismissed, and have lower grades, when they share their first semester college class with a secondary schoolmate. Moreover, students assigned to first semester college classrooms with a higher concentration of classmates who attended the same secondary school(s) generally have significantly lower grades, and are less likely to graduate. Finally, students sharing their first semester college classroom with students from public or subsidized secondary schools are more likely to be dismissed due to poor academic performance. The fact that these peer effects are persistent In time points to the existence of a path dependence pattern, suggesting that this initial period in college is key for student adaptation. These findings have important implications for the design of policies intended to improve the adaptation of freshman college students and the access to higher education, suggesting that students would benefit from targeted first semester college class group assignment policies, as well as from additional <b>transitional</b> <b>aid</b> tailored to their profiles. The second chapter addresses {{the question of}} how to distinguish "knowledge" from "ability", in the context of improving the access to higher education. In particular, according to the existing evidence some higher education admission tests may be screening out students who, despite a relative lack of specific knowledge, possess as much intellectual ability as their peers. If this is the case, students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds are likely to be disproportionately affected, since they generally receive a primary and secondary education of worse quality than their better-off peers, often resulting in significant knowledge gaps. Also, although in some cases these formative shortcomings might be too large to be feasibly addressed at the time of enrollment in higher education, it is plausible to think that in some cases they may perhaps be relatively easy to remedy. In view of all this, in this chapter I present a diagnostics experiment, aimed at helping to better understand this issue. In particular, I custom-designed a multiple-choice test, intended to measure an individual's mathematical ability, while minimizing the reliance on previously acquired knowledge. Also, I put together a two page "cheat sheet", which outlined all the necessary concepts to successfully complete the exam, without providing any explicit answers. This test was subsequently used to evaluate the candidates applying for admission into a special access program at one of the leading Chilean universities. A staged randomized control trial was used to measure the difference in academic performance (i. e. number of correctly answered questions) across the three parts of the exam between students who received a "cheat sheet" after the first or second parts of the test, respectively. As expected, "cheat sheets" improved the average performance of candidates on the exam, but their impact varied considerably across individuals. Most importantly, "cheat sheets" proved significantly more beneficial (in terms of improved test performance) to those students who were more likely to have had a secondary education of lower quality. This result has important implications for educational policies in Chile and elsewhere, suggesting that a transition to ability-focused admission tests would facilitate the access to higher education for talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The third and final chapter of this dissertation presents a higher education special access program for students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, custom-designed by the author for one of the leading Chilean universities, and implemented as a pilot during the 2013 and 2014 admission periods. A non-experimental comparison of the academic performance of special and ordinary admission students after enrollment finds evidence that, consistent with Arcidiacono et al (2011), although on average special admission students have comparable final grades than their ordinary admission peers, they tend to perform comparatively worse in "hard" subjects (i. e. those with a strong mathematical component). However, although special admission students seem more likely to decide to withdraw earlier, no significant differences in voluntary withdrawal or dismissal rates are observed between the latter and their ordinary admission peers. Moreover, an initial gap in GPA between special and ordinary admission students is closed by the end of the third semester of enrollment. All this suggests that, with some nuances, students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds can successfully catch up with their peers when provided with adequate support, and that special admission programs can therefore be an effective tool to improve the access to higher education. Nonetheless, the fact that the program was undersubscribed suggests that, apart from potential information diffusion problems, the minimum requirements set forth for special admission may have been too stringent, and/or that the demand for special admission among the targeted student population may not be as large as predicted. by Sandro Diez-Amigo.
