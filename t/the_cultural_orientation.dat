Many research studies have acknowledged the impact of culture on communication across nations and its impact on business operations, however no study has attempted to measure and quantify <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>orientations</b> of people originating from one nation, but working in two different national settings. This study adopted Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck's framework to examine cultural dimensions of a total of 580 Indian respondents comprising two groups: 429 Indian natives living and working in India and 151 Indian migrants living and working in the USA.

40|$|While {{acculturation}} {{is among}} the most popular concepts in cultural psychiatry and psychology, the conceptualization and measurement of this construct continue to be issues of significant debate. Recent literature supports the development of multidimensional models of acculturation, in contrast to traditional linear or unidimensional models. The current study examined a multidimensional model of acculturation in a multi-ethnic community sample of first-generation immigrants in Montreal. Two <b>cultural</b> <b>orientations</b> - Canadian and Self-Defined Ethnicity - were assessed independently among Caribbean (n= 109), Vietnamese (n= 97), and Filipino (n= 109) participants. These two <b>cultural</b> <b>orientations</b> were examined across three dimensions of acculturation: ethnic loyalty, ethnic behaviour, and situational ethnic identity. Correlational and factor analysis were used to assess the distinctiveness of the three dimensions, and the relationship between <b>the</b> two <b>cultural</b> <b>orientations.</b> For ethnic behaviour and situational ethnic identity, <b>the</b> two <b>cultural</b> <b>orientations</b> were not related to one another. Among the Vietnamese and Filipino groups, loyalty to one's self-defined ethnic group was positively related to loyalty towards Canadians.

Design/methodology/approach In-depth interviews were conducted to collect life history data about women’s early lives, education and employment.

Research limitations/implications Limited by the small sample of 19 female national participants that implies further international study is required to extend this research.

50|$|The Albanian {{language}} {{has been written}} using many different alphabets since the earliest records from the 14th century. The history of Albanian language orthography {{is closely related to}} <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>orientation</b> and knowledge of certain foreign languages among Albanian writers. The earliest written Albanian records come from the Gheg area in makeshift spellings based on Italian or Greek and sometimes in Arabic characters. Originally, the Tosk dialect was written in the Greek alphabet and the Gheg dialect was written in the Latin script. Both dialects had also been written in the Ottoman Turkish version of the Arabic script, Cyrillic, and some local alphabets (Elbasan, Vithkuqi, Todhri, Veso Bey, Jan Vellara and others, see original Albanian alphabets). More specifically, the writers from northern Albania and {{under the influence of the}} Catholic Church used Latin letters, those in southern Albania and under the influence of the Greek Orthodox church used Greek letters, while others throughout Albania and under the influence of Islam used Arabic letters. There were initial attempts to create an original Albanian alphabet during the 1750-1850 period. These attempts intensified after the League of Prizren and culminated with the Congress of Manastir held by Albanian intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Manastir (present day Bitola), which decided on which alphabet to use, and what the standardized spelling would be for standard Albanian. This is how the literary language remains. The alphabet is the Latin alphabet with the addition of the letters <ë>, <ç>, and nine digraphs.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess how <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> value <b>orientations</b> of {{individual}} employees moderate their attitudinal responses to different categories of organizational rewards. Specifically, it seeks to examine how one dimension of traditionality, respect for authority, moderates the relationship between affective organizational commitment and three variables: pay satisfaction, autonomy and satisfaction with supervision. Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical regression analysis was utilized to analyze survey data obtained from a sample of 290 employees of a major Chinese airline company. Findings: Employees high in traditionality were found to exhibit higher levels of affective commitment when autonomy and satisfaction with supervision was low. When autonomy and satisfaction with supervision was high employees low in traditionality exhibited higher levels of emotional attachment to the organization. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design is an obvious limitation of the study. Another limitation relates to the generalizability of the study findings outside the context in which the research was undertaken. Social implications: Organizations should consider taking <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>orientations</b> of their workforce into account when developing appropriate human resource policies aimed at heightening employee commitment. This should enhance employee well-being, which is especially important in a global economy characterized by uncertainty and rapid change.

Further, {{it can be argued that}} such differences •in the behaviour of foreign and domestic consumers can be attributed to differences in culture. This paper explores this question by examining, firstly, whether differences in product evaluation processes exist between consumers in different geographical regions of China and, secondly, if such differences, if any, can be attributed to differences in <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>orientations</b> of these consumers from different regions of China.
