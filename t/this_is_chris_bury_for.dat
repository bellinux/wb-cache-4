40|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>Chris</b> Deacy’s first book, which {{lays the}} groundwork for {{examining}} how the medium of film {{may be seen as}} a significant conveyor and agency in contemporary western society of religious hopes and values. In particular, it examines the manner in which a process of redemption analogous to that located in Christian thought may be operative through the ‘secular’ medium of film. It argues that this has considerable significance for the academic study of religion, which has traditionally eschewed the popular media as a serious repository of theological or religious activity, and warrants a radical and new evaluation of contemporary religiosity. It has received strong positive reviews, with William R. Telford writing that its strategy of approaching films redemptively ‘is impressively illustrated’ and that it is ‘a book that is arguably the most consistently theological reading of film that we have seen recently. ...|$|R
