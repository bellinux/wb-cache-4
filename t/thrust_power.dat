5000|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{works best}} as a propellant in extremely high concentrations [...] - [...] roughly over 70%. Although any concentration of peroxide will generate some hot gas (oxygen plus some steam), at concentrations above approximately 67%, {{the heat of}} decomposing hydrogen peroxide becomes large enough to completely vaporize all the liquid at standard temperature. This represents a safety and utilization turning point, since decomposition of any concentration above this amount is capable of transforming the liquid entirely to heated gas (the higher the concentration, the hotter the resulting gas). This very hot steam/oxygen mixture can then be used to generate maximal <b>thrust,</b> <b>power,</b> or work, but it also makes explosive decomposition of the material far more hazardous.|$|E
5000|$|The prior {{research}} efforts to refute Gray's paradox only {{looked at the}} drag reducing aspect of dolphin's skin, but never questioned the basic assumption of Gray [...] "that drag cannot be greater than muscle work" [...] which led to paradox in the first place. In 2014, a team of theoretical mechanical engineers from Northwestern University proved the underlying hypothesis of Gray's paradox wrong. They showed mathematically that drag on undulatory swimmers (such as dolphins) can indeed be greater than the muscle power it generates to propel itself forward, without being paradoxical. They introduced the concept of [...] "energy cascade" [...] to show that during steady swimming all of the generated muscle power is dissipated {{in the wake of}} the swimmer (through viscous dissipation). A swimmer uses muscle power to undulate its body, which causes it to experience both drag and thrust simultaneously. Muscle power generated should be equated to power needed to deform the body, rather than equating it to the drag power. On the contrary drag power should be equated to <b>thrust</b> <b>power.</b> This is because during steady swimming, drag and thrust are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Their findings can be summarized in a simple power balance equation: ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, firstly we {{endeavor}} to prescribe logic definitions and reasoning process for obtaining correct rocket power and relevant efficiency equations. With the Lagrangian Reynolds transport approach, we also rigorously derive these highly generalized equations for rocket total kinetic power, <b>thrust</b> <b>power</b> and related propulsive, thermal, and overall efficiencies. They involve {{a few more}} physical effects including rocket acceleration, relative flow velocity/steadiness, outlet pressure, and gravity, thus open an original route for improving rocket propulsion analysis/design. Incidentally, {{it is interesting to}} note that under some conditions, a rocket in flight may retain less kinetic energy due to ejecting more kinetic energy of burning propellant per second than the <b>thrust</b> <b>power</b> acquired. Also, the derived correct rocket total kinetic power equations are quite reasonable in that all the velocities involved are of relative nature, thus invariant with respect to different observers and shielding the possibility of violating energy conservation law...|$|E

As in other anguilliform swimmers, wave amplitude increases towards the tail; however, the relative caudal amplitude of P. platurus is less than that of the aquatic snakes Natrix and Nerodia and the eel Anguilla. Kinematic analyses of near-surface swimming at 15 and 32 cms" 1 were made from high-speed cin 6 films, and Lighthill's bulk momentum hydromechanical model was used to calculate swimming <b>thrust</b> <b>power</b> at these two velocities.
