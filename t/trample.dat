40|$|The {{occurrence}} of carabid beetles {{in relation to}} <b>trampling</b> was examined in urban forest sites located {{in the city of}} Helsinki, southern Finland. The degree of wear of the forest floor was assessed and used as a measure of <b>trampling</b> intensity. In particular, we examined the following predictions: (1) carabid diversity should decrease with increasing <b>trampling</b> intensity, (2) mean body size of the dominating carabid species should decrease with increasing <b>trampling</b> intensity, and (3) opportunistic species should gain dominance in severely <b>trampled</b> sites. In total, 1, 326 beetles representing 27 species were captured. The first prediction was not supported, as there was no correlation between species richness or Hill’s N 2 diversity index and <b>trampling</b> intensity. However, there was a positive correlation between number of carabids captured and <b>trampling</b> intensity of the site. The second hypothesis gained some support, as there was a marginally significant negative correlation between body size and <b>trampling</b> intensity. The hypothesis that opportunistic species should gain dominance in severely <b>trampled</b> sites was supported as one species was very dominant (Pterostichus melanarius, 60. 0 %) in the heavily <b>trampled</b> sites, while there were two equally and less dominant species in the less <b>trampled</b> sites. Individual species did show different responses to the effects of <b>trampling,</b> and the most sensitive forest species may not survive in the heavily <b>trampled</b> sites. We conclude that at the community level (e. g., species richness, diversity), the effects of <b>trampling</b> on carabids in urban forests are subtle, but impacts are pronounced for some sensitive species...|$|R
40|$|Controlled <b>trampling</b> was {{conducted}} to investigate the <b>trampling</b> resistance of contrasting high fertility basaltic and low fertility rhyolitic soils and their associated highland tropical rainforest vegetation in north east Australia's Wet Tropics. Although this approach has been taken in numerous studies of <b>trampling</b> {{in a variety of}} ecosystem types (temperate and subtropical forest, alpine shrubland, coral reef and seagrass beds), the experimental method {{does not appear to have}} been previously applied in a tropical rainforest context. Ground vegetation cover and soil penetration resistance demonstrated variable responses to <b>trampling.</b> <b>Trampling,</b> most noticeably after 200 and 500 passes reduced organic litter cover. Bulk density increased with <b>trampling</b> intensity, particularly on basalt soils as rhyolite soils appeared somewhat resistant to the impacts of <b>trampling.</b> The permeability of the basalt and rhyolite soils decreased markedly with increased <b>trampling</b> intensity, even after only 75 passes. These findings suggest physical and hydrological changes may occur rapidly in tropical rainforest soils following low levels of <b>trampling,</b> particularly on basalt soils...|$|R

5|$|Other {{threats to}} {{elephants}} include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The Asian elephant lives {{in areas with}} some of the highest human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment.

Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly <b>trample</b> and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the provision of ‘urban corridors’ which allow the animals access to key areas.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{disturbance}} by human <b>trampling</b> on ecosystem processes is essential for themanagement of recreational areas. Discussions on recreational impacts are based either on data from <b>trampling</b> experiments or on field survey data from sites subjected to long-term recreational use, but rarely {{on a combination of}} both. We examined whether results from a short-term <b>trampling</b> experiment reflect the impact of long-term <b>trampling</b> around frequently used fire places. We compared short- and long-term effects of human <b>trampling</b> on above-ground forest vegetation and soil physical, chemical and microbial characteristics. We found both similarities and differences in short- and long-term <b>trampling</b> effects. Both short- and long-term <b>trampling</b> reduced plant cover, plant height and species density, though long-term effects were more pronounced than short-term effects. In both approaches, leaf litter biomass decreased, whereas soil density increased with <b>trampling</b> intensity. Other soil characteristics including soil moisture, total soil organic matter content and total organic nitrogen content were not or only marginally affected by short- and long-term <b>trampling.</b> Furthermore, soil microbial biomass and the activity of dehydrogenase did not change in both approaches. In contrast, the activity of b-glucosidase was only reduced by short-term <b>trampling,</b> whereas activity of phosphomonoesterase was reduced only by long-term <b>trampling.</b> Soil compaction was one factor reducing microbial activities at low and medium <b>trampling</b> intensities in our experiment and in the highly compacted area around the fire rings. We conclude that it could be problematic to use the results of short-term <b>trampling</b> experiments to predict general long-term <b>trampling</b> effects. Our results imply also that the restoration of degraded sites might be hampered by the low nutrient turnover resulting from the reduced litter layer and changes in enzyme activities, mitigating a successful re-establishment and growth of plants...|$|R

We investigated the effects of <b>trampling</b> due to tourism on the meiofauna of reef formations on the northeastern coast of Brazil. Samples were taken from five paired stations located in two areas on the reef: an area protected since 2004, and an area open to tourist visits. <b>Trampling</b> caused important changes in the meiofaunal assemblage. The densities of the total meiofauna and of the commonest groups were negatively affected in the <b>trampled</b> area. Among the major groups, Polychaeta proved to be very sensitive to this disturbance. The meiofauna groups showed different response patterns to <b>trampling</b> depending on the species of algae <b>trampled.</b> Reductions in animal densities were partly attributed {{to the loss of}} turf biomass and associated sand caused by <b>trampling,</b> and partly to the direct effect of people stepping on the animals.

5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers <b>trample</b> vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E

Initially, Maximinus governed only Egypt and the Levant. He issued his own persecutory edict {{in the spring of}} 306, ordering general sacrifice. The edict of 304 had been difficult to enforce, since the Imperial government had no record of city-dwelling subjects who held no agricultural land. Galerius solved this problem in 306 by running another census. This contained the names of all urban heads of household and the number of their dependents (past censuses had only listed persons paying tax on land, such as landowners and tenants). Using lists drawn up by the civil service, Maximinus ordered his heralds to call all men, women, and children down to the temples. There, after tribunes called everyone by name, everyone sacrificed.|$|E
30|$|The results clearly {{show that}} <b>trampling</b> in alpine heaths has large {{negative}} impacts on lichen abundance and species richness. This {{is in line}} with previous observations that lichens are very trampling-sensitive in alpine grasslands (Grabherr 1982) and in maritime Antarctica (Pertierra et al. 2013), although to our knowledge this is the first study showing that <b>trampling</b> can decrease lichen species richness. However, experimental <b>trampling</b> in an alpine heath ecosystem in Scandinavia has shown the opposite effect. Instead of dramatic decreases in lichen abundance, as observed here, the <b>trampling</b> treatment increased the cover of lichens through regeneration (Törn et al. 2006). Although it is difficult to compare <b>trampling</b> with regeneration after the <b>trampling</b> pressure has been removed, the difference in impact may be due to differences in dominance prior to <b>trampling.</b> In the experimental <b>trampling</b> study (Törn et al. 2006), the lichen cover was only 8 % and that of bryophytes was up to 50 %, while at our study site the lichen cover was around 45 % in the plots furthest away from the trail.|$|R

40|$|Understanding post-depositional {{movement}} of artefacts {{is vital to}} making reliable claims about the formation of archaeological deposits. Human <b>trampling</b> has long been recognised as a contributor to post-depositional artefact displacement.

Our <b>trampling</b> substrate is the recently excavated archaeological deposits from Madjedbebe, northern Australia. Madjedbebe is an important site because it contains early evidence of human activity in Australia. The age of artefacts at Madjedbebe is contentious because of the possibility of artefacts moving due to <b>trampling.</b> We <b>trampled</b> artefacts in Madjedbebe sediments and measured their displacement, as well as modelling the {{movement of}} artefacts by computer simulation. Artefact elongation is a significant predictor of horizontal distance moved by <b>trampling,</b> and length, width, thickness and volume are significant predictors of the vertical distance.

Experimental <b>trampling</b> was conducted at 0, 10, 50 and 100 passes/week for 10 weeks of the summer (June - August) in 1979 and 1980 on native Stipa-Koeleria prairie, seeded Bromus-Agropyron prairie and Populus tremuloides understorey. Treatments were designed to compare the effects of one and two summers of <b>trampling</b> {{and the extent of}} community recovery in the year following one summer of <b>trampling.</b> The woodland comnunity was most affected by <b>trampling</b> but the vegetation recovered relatively well during 1980 after <b>trampling</b> had ceased. Of the prairies, the seeded cover was slightly less tolerant than the native cover, but recovery was relatively slow on both. Existing paths also indicated that grassland cover was more resistant than woodland cover. Plant height was reduced in the prairies, and litter depth was reduced in the woodland by <b>trampling,</b> but both recovered slightly during 1980 after <b>trampling</b> ceased. Soil penetrometer resistance increased with increased <b>trampling</b> intensity in all communities, and recovered slightly in the woodland and seeded prairie. Bulk density was not significantly affected by <b>trampling</b> at these levels, except in the woodland. Relative importance of species was affected slightly by <b>trampling</b> in the prairies, and greatly affected in the woodland. In the woodland, the total number of species decreased greatly after 50 and 100 passes/week, and graminoid species became more important. Although plant cover was nearly restored in the recovery year, species composition remained altered. <b>Trampling</b> at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 passes/week for one summer, showed that cover decreased with increasing <b>trampling</b> intensity in an approximately linear fashion on both prairies. Shoe type (hiking boots, flat soled shoes, heeled shoes) did not affect <b>trampling</b> damage at 250 passes/summer. Juniperus horizontalis was more tolerant to <b>trampling</b> than woodland plants, and more tolerant than prairie plants after 10 passes/week but less tolerant than the seeded prairie after 30 passes/ week. Abandoned vehicle tracks suggested that plant cover recovery in lightly and medium used tracks occurred within 5 - 6 years, but soil compaction persisted for a longer period. Recovery of heavily used tracks was slower, and invasion of native species appeared to follow colonisation by weeds and exotic species. Heavily used cart tracks, abandoned for 60 years had recovered native plant cover, but soil compaction persisted...|$|R
40|$|Increased tourist {{activity}} in coastal regions demands management strategies to reduce impacts on rocky shores. The highly populated coastal areas in southeastern Brazil are {{an example of}} degradation caused by development of industry and tourism. Among different shore impacts, <b>trampling</b> has been intensively studied, and may represent {{a significant source of}} stress for intertidal fauna. A randomised blocks design was applied to experimentally study the effects of two different <b>trampling</b> intensities on richness, diversity, density and biomass of the rocky shore fauna of Obuseiro beach, Guarujá, southeastern Brazil. Blocks were distributed in two portions of the intertidal zone, dominated respectively by Chthamalus bisinuatus (Cirripedia) and Isognomon bicolor (Bivalvia). Blocks were <b>trampled</b> over three months, simulating the vacation period in Brazil and were monitored for the following nine months. Results indicate that Chthamalus bisinuatus is vulnerable to <b>trampling</b> impacts. Richness, diversity and turn-over index tended to be higher in <b>trampled</b> plots four months after <b>trampling</b> ceased. In general, results agree with previous <b>trampling</b> studies, suggesting that even low intensities of <b>trampling</b> may cause some impact on intertidal communities. Management strategies should include isolation of sensitive areas, construction of boardwalks, visitor education and monitoring programmes. In Brazil, additional data obtained from experimental studies are necessary in order to achieve a better understanding of <b>trampling</b> impacts on rocky shore communities...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims Grazing is {{a complex}} process {{involving}} the simultaneous occurrence of both <b>trampling</b> and defoliation.

We test the hypothesis that physiological integration (resource sharing between interconnected ramets) may help plants {{to deal with the}} interactive effects of <b>trampling</b> and defoliation. Methods In a field study, small and large ramets of the root-suckering clonal tree Populus simonii were subjected to two levels of <b>trampling</b> and defoliation, while connected or disconnected to other ramets. Plant responses were quantified via survival, growth, morphological and stem mechanical traits. Key Results Disconnection and <b>trampling</b> increased mortality, especially in small ramets. <b>Trampling</b> increased stem length, basal diameter, fibrous root mass, stem stiffness and resistance to deflection in connected ramets, but decreased them in disconnected ones. <b>Trampling</b> decreased vertical height more in disconnected than in connected ramets, and reduced stem mass in disconnected ramets but not in connected ramets. Defoliation reduced basal diameter, leaf mass, stem mass and leaf area ratio, but did not interact with <b>trampling</b> or disconnection. Conclusions Although clonal integration did not influence defoliation response, it did alleviate the effects of <b>trampling.</b> We suggest that by facilitating resource transport between ramets, clonal integration compensates for trampling-induced damage to fine root...|$|R
40|$|In {{semiarid}} drylands {{water shortage}} and <b>trampling</b> by large herbivores are two factors limiting plant growth and distribution. <b>Trampling</b> can strongly affect plant performance, but {{little is known}} about responses of morphological and mechanical traits of woody plants to <b>trampling</b> and their possible interaction with water availability. Seedlings of four shrubs (Caragana intermedia, Cynanchum komarovi, Hedysarum laeve and Hippophae rhamnoides) common in the semiarid Mu Us Sandland were grown at 4 % and 10 % soil water content and exposed to either simulated <b>trampling</b> or not. Growth, morphological and mechanical traits were measured. <b>Trampling</b> decreased vertical height and increased basal diameter and stem resistance to bending and rupture (as indicated by the increased minimum bend and break force) in all species. Increasing water availability increased biomass, stem length, basal diameter, leaf thickness and rigidity of stems in all species except C. komarovii. However, there were no interactive effects of <b>trampling</b> and water content on any of these traits among species except for minimum bend force and the ratio between stem resistance to rupture and bending. Overall shrub species have a high degree of <b>trampling</b> resistance by morphological and mechanical modifications, and the effects of <b>trampling</b> do not depend on water availability.

40|$|The {{impact of}} 10 years of annual foot <b>trampling</b> on soil biocrusts was {{examined}} in replicated field experiments at three cold desert {{sites of the}} Colorado Plateau, USA. <b>Trampling</b> detrimentally impacted lichens and mosses, and the keystone cyanobacterium, Microcoleus vaginatus, resulting in increased soil erosion and reduced C and N concentrations in surface soils. <b>Trampled</b> biocrusts contained approximately half as much extractable DNA and 20 – 52 % less chlorophyll a when compared with intact biocrusts at each site. Two of the three sites also showed a decline in scytonemin-containing, diazotrophic cyanobacteria in <b>trampled</b> biocrusts. 16 S rRNA gene sequence and terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (T-RFLP) analyses of soil bacteria from untrampled and <b>trampled</b> biocrusts demonstrated a reduced proportion (23 – 65 % reduction) of M. vaginatus and other Cyanobacteria in <b>trampled</b> plots. In parallel, other soil bacterial species that are natural residents of biocrusts, specifically members of the Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes, became more readily detected in <b>trampled</b> than in untrampled biocrusts. Replicate 16 S rRNA T-RFLP profiles from <b>trampled</b> biocrusts at all three sites contained significantly more fragments (n= 17) than those of untrampled biocrusts (n 6) and exhibited much higher variability among field replicates, indicating transition to an unstable disturbed state. Despite the dramatic negative impacts of <b>trampling</b> on biocrust physical structure and composition, M. vaginatus could still be detected in surface soils after 10 years of annual <b>trampling,</b> suggesting the potential for biocrust re-formation over time.

We examined existing walking tracks on the island. Track width (25 to 800 cm) increased with soil moisture content. <b>Trampling</b> reduced vegetation height, total cover, and species richness in mires and feldmark and vegetation height and herb layer cover (but not bryophyte cover or species richness) in slopes. In mires, most species were negatively affected by <b>trampling,</b> but in slopes <b>trampling</b> increased the cover of 6 out of 9 significantly affected species.
