5|$|The final {{was held}} at a neutral venue, Prater Stadium in Vienna. The match took place in torrential rain, {{adversely}} affecting the attendance. The official figure was 7,968, though sources vary, {{with a number of}} figures between 7,968 and 15,000 reported. Of those, approximately 5,000 were Manchester City supporters. Due to Eastern bloc travel restrictions, only 300 supporters, relatives and officials were permitted <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the expressway dating back to 1969 were for it <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> current County Road 22, heading west along {{the southern edge of}} Belle River and Tecumseh, meeting up with the current two-lane freeway alignment (Pike Creek Bypass) just east of Puce, as well as having the west end continue south through Lasalle to north of Amherstburg.|$|E

The interchange is also incomplete; drivers must either use the Forbes Road and Penetanguishene Road interchanges, or continue southbound into Barrie and switch direction at Duckworth Street in order <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> southbound Highway400A to northbound Highway400 or from southbound Highway400 to northbound Highway400A.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> the Sun to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to}} the throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E

5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape had changed dramatically after the White Ship disaster. Around three hundred passengers – including Matilda's brother William Adelin {{and many other}} senior nobles – embarked one night on the White Ship <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> Barfleur in Normandy across to England. The vessel foundered just outside the harbour, possibly {{as a result of}} overcrowding or excessive drinking by the ship's master and crew, and all but two of the passengers died. William Adelin was among the casualties.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Air Norway lost 1,300 {{passengers}} {{after the}} Norwegian Air Force {{decided to not}} permit their employees <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> Ørland, but instead have to take cheaper flights from Trondheim, located about a two-hour drive away. The reduction in ridership, along with a strengthening of the Danish krone {{in relation to the}} Norwegian, caused Air Norway to lose NOK100,000 by August 2009. The mayor of Ørland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a PSO. In February 2010, the municipality granted NOK62,500 for Air Norway to run a television commercial during the semi-final of Melodi Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 China and Germany inaugurated {{a long-distance}} freight train service between Beijing and Hamburg. Travelling {{a total of}} , the train uses the China Railways and the Trans-Mongolian line <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> Xiangtan (in Hunan Province) to Ulaanbaatar, where it then {{continues}} north to the Trans-Siberian. After reaching {{the end of the}} Trans-Siberian at Moscow the train continues to Germany via rail links in Belarus and Poland. Total transit time is 15 days, as compared with the 30 days average it would take for the freight to make the same journey by ship. The first train of 50 containers, carrying a mixed load of clothes, ceramics and electronics (for the Fujitsu company), travelled on tracks operated by six different railways.|$|E

The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> the past to the present without a Time Portal; the Tune of Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} politics, Southey {{believed}} that {{war with the}} post-revolution France was inappropriate when he first started composing Madoc. By the time the poem was finished, Southey was an advocate for a war against Napoleon's government. Instead of supporting his own government in return, he was opposed {{to the government of}} Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. The poem is also heavily grounded in Southey's ideas on Pantisocracy, and it includes an earlier version of his democratic ideal within a mythic form. The connection between Wales and America within the poem alludes to Southey's own plans <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> Wales to settle in America to start a new societal system.|$|E
5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} the United States Air Force to {{dispatch}} two transport aircraft to Mogadishu International Airport, but diplomats were unable to contact anyone in the Somali government to obtain clearance for the aircraft to land {{at the airport and}} it also became clear that it was too dangerous <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> the embassy to the airport.

5|$|Link {{can travel}} from the Dark World to the Light World {{at almost any}} outside {{location}} by using the Magic Mirror, and can travel back to the Dark World again from the same location using a temporary portal left behind on the map {{at the point where}} he reappears in the Light World. Otherwise, Link must use hidden warp locations throughout the Light World <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> the Light World to the Dark World. Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the Light and Dark Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E
5|$|Pope Francis's {{desire to}} open the Church's treasures to the public has {{resulted}} in a weekly special train from Vatican City Station that {{is open to the public}} and is provided by the Vatican Museums and the Italian railway. A special train for invited guests and reporters inaugurated the run with on 11 September 2015. This inaugural train was hauled by FS Class 625 steam locomotive 625-017, built in 1915. The same engine was used by the Italian royal family, and also hauled the train which carried Pope John XXIII to Loreto and Assisi in 1962. Scheduled trains use contemporary suburban rolling stock <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> Vatican City railway station to Albano Laziale, via Castel Gandolfo.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where it is able <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that {{has been described as}} similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E

5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>from</b> one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|E
