40|$|The Authors, {{reviewing}} the Literature on asbestos-related Malignant Mesothelioma (MM), found {{that because of}} its very peculiar characteristics, the causal link between professional asbestos exposure {{and the development of}} this tumour is very difficult to define in respect to: diagnosis, causal link and individuation of possible culpable conducts. The evaluation of causal link in different medico-legal areas is studied by different criteria. In civil law the criterion of weak causality is followed to allow compensation for damages. For institutional purposes in INAIL, the definition of causal link is particularly facilitated by <b>the</b> legal <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> In fact it is sufficient, that asbestos-related lesions are ascertained in individuals who are or were exposed at any time of their professional life to the risk of inhaling asbestos fibres. In criminal law, the current approach of the Supreme Court is to demand evidence of strong causality, with a high logical probability and rational credibility, and beyond reasonable doubt, because criminal liability is personal as established in article 27 of the Italian Constitution. It is worth pointing out that all the levels of evidence indicated above must pass the test of scientific suitability or possibility...|$|R

40|$|There has {{recently}} been a proliferation of case law dealing with potential inroads into <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in <b>the</b> criminal law of England and Wales, {{in the light of}} article 6 (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights. This article is concerned with <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. It considers two central issues. The first is how the courts should address the question <b>of</b> when <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is interfered with. The second {{is the extent to which}} interference with <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence may be justified on the grounds of proportionality.

40|$|This article’s primary {{aim is to}} {{highlight}} the essentially critical potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, {{as well as the}} need for this critical potential to be duly recognized. It is argued that the essential meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is best understood when approached from what is referred to as its counterfactual status. As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R

Prajesh Shrestha argues that the 2014 amendments undermine <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, because <b>the</b> protection of the community is given more weight than <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, and that the 'show cause' provision gives the burden of proof to the defendant, not the prosecutor and goes against <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, and that adding in the victim's views is unnecessary and [...] "highly prejudicial to the rights of the accused".|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of surveillance practices to undermine <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence {{is a growing}} concern amongst critics of surveillance. This paper attempts to assess the impact <b>of</b> surveillance on <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. It defends an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence as a protection against wrongful criminalisation against alternatives, and considers both the ways in which surveillance might undermine that protection and the—hitherto overlooked—ways in which it might promote it. It draws on empirical work on the causes of erroneous convictions to suggest that surveillance can be used in ways that prevent innocent people being erroneously charged and convicted with crimes, by providing a source of exculpatory evidence for use in police investigations. It is argued that surveillance practices do not necessarily undermine <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence but can be reformed in ways that both reduce the risk that they will cause wrongful criminalisation and increase their power to protect those already under suspicion...|$|R

2500|$|One of Anthony Flew's most {{influential}} professional works was his 1976 <b>The</b> <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> Atheism in which Flew forwarded {{the proposition that}} the question of God's existence should begin with <b>the</b> <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> Atheism:"What I want to examine is the contention that the debate about the existence of God should properly begin from <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> atheism, that <b>the</b> onus of proof must lie upon the theist.

The impact of Flew's proposed negative atheism, which is often referred to today as 'weak atheism' or 'soft atheism', is illustrated by analytic Philosopher William Lane Craig's 2007 assessment that <b>the</b> <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> Atheism had become [...] "one of the most commonly proffered justifications of atheism."
