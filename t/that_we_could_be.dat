2500|$|When President Reagan {{quoted the}} words that the service of chaplains {{during and after the}} 1983 Beirut bombing symbolized that [...] "we Americans still {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> proud of our particular religions and yet work side by side when the time came to help others, to comfort, and to ease pain," [...] that speech was one of many that saw the presence of military chaplains as both a symbol of faith and a symbol of interfaith cooperation and respect. In the words of that report: ...|$|E
2500|$|Examples include [...] John Sturges's Bad Day at Black Rock (1955); Lonely Are the Brave , {{screenplay}} by Dalton Trumbo (1962), Hud, starring Paul Newman (1963); Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971); The Getaway (1972); Junior Bonner (1972); Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974); Hearts of the West starring Jeff Bridges (1975); [...] Alan J. Pakula's Comes a Horseman (1978); J. W. Coop, directed/co-written by and starring Cliff Robertson; Robert Rodríguez's El Mariachi (1992) and Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003); John Sayles's Lone Star (1996); Tommy Lee Jones's The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2005); Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005); Wim Wenders's Don't Come Knocking (2005); Joel and Ethan Coen's No Country for Old Men (2007); Justified (2010-2015); Hell or High Water (2016); Wind River (2017); and the superhero film Logan (2017). [...] {{is an example}} of a Neo-Western video game. Likewise, the television series Breaking Bad, which takes place in modern times, features many examples of Western archetypes. According to creator Vince Gilligan, [...] "After the first Breaking Bad episode, it started to dawn on me <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> making a contemporary western. So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef — we have Walt and others like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave it an A- rating, saying [...] "Her three count-'em three A albums {{produced}} 12 count-'em 12 top-five singles. All are here. So are two excellent tracks {{from her}} one count-it one Virgin album, and two rather less excellent previously unreleaseds. The three estimate-'em three million who own A albums {{two and three}} needn't bother. Those who begrudge her the place she's earned in the pop cosmos have some catching up to do." [...] With a rating of 7/10 (flawed yet worthy), Spin magazine's Chris Norris said: [...] "Since Janet is State-of-the-art production right down to her sculpted nose, {{it makes sense that}} she should call her retrospective Design. As the studio team that wrought Control, Rhythm Nation and janet. (which for record-label reasons is under-represented here), designers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis are unofficial second and third Janet Jacksons. Their triumph is letting their dazzling sound sculptures fade into the background of Janet's cartoon antics." [...] Elysa Gardner with [...] Vibe magazine was in high praise of Design of a Decade, as well as Jackson herself, stating, [...] "It's been almost 10 years since Janet Jackson announced that her first name wasn't Baby, and it's easy to forget what a bold proclamation that was coming from a woman—particularly a black woman—at that time [...] Only two women were there to remind the rest of us that there was power and freedom in feminine sexuality—to reinforce the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> adorable and flirtatious and strong and assertive. And Madonna wasn't a sista. [...] The 16 songs on her greatest hits package 1986/1996: Design of a Decade—which includes two strong new singles—trace a young woman's progression from questioning others' authority to reveling in her own." ...|$|E
50|$|All <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> you and I if we weren't {{you and me}} (Novel, 2010).|$|R
5000|$|... "At the time, we did {{not know}} what it was like to lose and the thought never {{occurred}} to us. We were convinced, in fact, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> beaten." [...] Sproson speaking in February 1975.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the album's title, Martin said, [...] "We {{called it}} Violator as a joke. We {{wanted to come}} up with the most extreme, ridiculously Heavy Metal title <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could.</b> I'll <b>be</b> {{surprised}} if people will get the joke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so glad," [...] said Ruth, [...] "that Laura is gone. She is very literal-minded. She {{might not}} {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> hastily married and even lease a house, this way, {{and still be}} only tea acquaintances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By {{favour of}} which we are making our way to Parthenay unsuspected, though, by my faith, we gather so like a snowball, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a match for a few {{hundreds}} of Guisards. Who is with you, M. de Ribaumont?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} {{not talk about}} it, my dear," [...] replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly; [...] "for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding, {{she would never be}} persuaded <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> happy together. I had known you by character, however, long before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are very}} few people in this world half so good or so right-minded as Fitzjocelyn,' said Mary, earnestly and deliberately. 'It was he who bade me come to you, well knowing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never <b>be</b> happy without your consent.' ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{had been}} closed for a long time; the place {{was in such a}} state of dereliction. That's when I got the idea <b>that</b> maybe <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{extremely}} candid about the state of Johnny's health, as candid as Johnny has always been in his songs.|$|R
60|$|Clearly all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do <b>was</b> {{to trust}} to {{our sense of}} feeling, and attempt the passage in the dark, so in <b>we</b> crept, fearing <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> delayed to do so our {{exhaustion}} would overcome us, and we should probably lie down and die where we were.|$|R
60|$|As Master Hunt {{said again}} and again when talking over the {{situation}} with Captain Smith, it seemed strange even to us who were there, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{looking forward to a}} famine, when in the sea and on the land was food in abundance to feed half the people in all this wide world.|$|E
60|$|Indeed it was {{not much}} in my thoughts, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> capable to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they went away without the boat, I did not much {{question}} to make her fit again to carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{a serious}} one," [...] Harry replied; [...] "it is only {{that we may be}} chased by English revenue cutters and forced to run off from the English coast again. But even then we should soon return. Besides, I have no doubt the captain would let us have a boat, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> picked up by the cutter in pursuit of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, unless I take a {{telescope}} {{to look at}} them with,' answered Elizabeth; 'perhaps, Anne, in thirty years time, if we both live so long, we may meet and talk over this day, and smile, and wonder <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> vexed by anything at such a time.' ...|$|R
60|$|Thus far we {{had done}} as Jacob would have us, {{and at the same}} time {{performed}} our full duty as Minute Boys, for our task was to learn what Brant counted on doing, and as to <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> certain until he was in the village.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is the}} number. Besides, you see, we {{dare not}} take the frigate in nearer than a mile; and {{a mile and a}} quarter would <b>be</b> safer. So <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> of any assistance, beyond {{annoying}} the battery with long shot. It {{seems to me that there}} is only one chance." ...|$|R
60|$|We rowed {{with all}} our strength, but it was slow going with so many boats in tow. A pistol cracked from the shoal, a second, and a third; then a regular fusillade began. The bullets spat and spat all about us; but thick clouds had covered the moon, and in the dim {{darkness}} it {{was no more than}} random firing. It was only by chance <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> hit.|$|E
6000|$|The other ladies {{had turned}} upon me with {{surprise}} and horror at Mrs. Makely's words, but they now apparently relented, as if I had fully redeemed {{myself from the}} charge made against me. Mrs. Strange alone seemed to have found nothing monstrous in my supposed position. [...] "Sometimes," [...] she said, [...] "I wish we had to work, all of us, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> freed from our servile bondage to servants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my part," [...] {{returned}} the Bear King, [...] "I {{realize that you}} were well worth saving, Miss Ozma, and so I am much pleased <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> of service to you. By means of my Magic Wand I have been creating exact images of your Emerald City and your Royal Palace, and I must confess {{that they are more}} attractive than any places I have ever seen--not excepting Bear Center." ...|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} afternoon {{we crossed the}} Nile, and towards sunset entered the vast and ancient city of Memphis. On its white walls floated the banners of the Great King which Bes pointed out to me, saying <b>that</b> wherever <b>we</b> went in the whole world, it seemed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never <b>be</b> free from those accursed symbols.|$|R
50|$|I come {{of those}} who were transported from India and China, whose being resided in the fact, solely, {{that they were able to}} provide {{physical}} labour, who taught me <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> both <b>be</b> at home and be foreign, who taught me that human existence itself demanded that freedom was a necessary condition for that human existence.|$|R
60|$|A. I {{know that}} {{whenever}} the subject {{has occurred in}} conversation where I have been present, it has {{appeared to be the}} opinion of every one, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> taxed by a Parliament wherein we were not represented. But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed.|$|R
60|$|In {{a second}} the attempt {{had been made}} and failed, so quickly indeed {{that it was not}} until Leo and I {{compared}} our impressions afterwards <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sure of what had happened. As Ayesha passed her, the maddened Khania drew a hidden dagger and struck with all her force at her rival's back. I saw the knife vanish to the hilt in her body, as I thought, but this cannot have been so since it fell to the ground, and she who should have been dead, took no hurt at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Clara, if it {{were only}} <b>that!</b> <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> far happier {{together}} in a little cottage in the country than with all the riches of the City. Poverty could not cut me to the heart, as I have been cut this morning. Why, it is but twenty minutes since I had the letter, Clara, {{and it seems to}} me to be some old, old thing which happened far away in my past life, some horrid black cloud which shut out all the freshness and the peace from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|We had no fear {{of hunger}} in those days, no dread of social unrest, no {{expectation}} of any sudden change. All wars were over--in our opinion. The world was at last definitely at peace, and we in America, like the world in general, {{had nothing to do}} but to go on getting richer and happier, so happy <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> just. We were all young--not one of us had gray hair. Life, for each of us as for the Nation, moved futureward on tranquil, shining course, as a river slips southward to the sea, confident, effortless, and serene. Heavenly skies, how happy we were! ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the risk}} factors for early death after knee {{replacement}} could help {{to reduce the risk}} of mortality after this procedure. We assessed secular trends in death within 45 days of knee replacement for osteoarthritis in England and Wales, with the aim of investigating whether any change <b>that</b> <b>we</b> recorded <b>could</b> <b>be</b> explained by alterations in modifiable perioperative factors...|$|R
60|$|Yuba Bill hesitated no longer. Taking a heavy stone {{from the}} road, he {{battered}} down the gate, {{and with the}} expressman entered the enclosure. We followed. Nobody was to be seen. In the gathering darkness all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> distinguish <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were in a garden--from the rosebushes that scattered over us a minute spray from their dripping leaves--and before a long, rambling wooden building.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{always said}} it!' cried the bride, 'I {{knew she was}} not a common child! Alas, sir! we have no power to help you, for all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do, has <b>been</b> tried in vain.' ...|$|R
60|$|When we {{had carried}} {{all these things}} on shore (the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, {{that if they had}} come strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my {{thoughts}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> able to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they went away without the boat, I did not much question to make her again fit to carry as to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|This was so apparent, {{there was}} no disputing it. We could still see the land, looking low, chill, and of the hue of November; and we could also {{perceive}} that ahead, if anything, it fell off a little towards the northward, while astern it seemingly stretched in a due line with our course. That we passed it with great velocity, too, was a circumstance that our eyes showed us too plainly to admit of any mistake. As the ship was still without a rag of sail, borne down by the wind {{as she had been}} for hours, and burying to her hawse-holes forward, it was only to a racing tide, or current of some sort, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> indebted for our speed. We tried the lead, and got bottom in six fathoms! ...|$|E
60|$|Munich {{is always}} a little mad. The maddest ball I ever danced at was in Munich. I went there with a Harvard University professor. He had been told what these balls were like. Ever seeking {{knowledge}} of all things, he determined to take the matter up for himself and examine it. The writer also must ever be learning. I agreed to accompany him. We had not intended to dance. Our idea was <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> indulgent spectators, regarding from some coign of vantage the antics of the foolish crowd. The professor was clad as became a professor. Myself, I wore a simply-cut frock-coat, with trousering in French grey. The doorkeeper explained to us {{that this was a}} costume ball; he was sorry, but gentlemen could only be admitted in evening dress or in masquerade.|$|E
2500|$|... "This spot is on {{the route}} to Metchley, the Roman fort in Birmingham and it's for this reason, if no other, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> think this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> where the battle took place".|$|R
60|$|We had no {{difficulty}} {{in finding the}} broad elephant trail, which Ventvögel, after examination, pronounced {{to have been made}} by between twenty and thirty elephants, most of them full-grown bulls. But the herd had moved on some way during the night, and it was nine o'clock, and already very hot, before, by the broken trees, bruised leaves and bark, and smoking droppings, <b>we</b> knew <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> far from them.|$|R
60|$|Those <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find, however, <b>were</b> {{filled with}} water and passed by lines of men to the places in most danger--that is, {{practically}} everywhere--while other men tried {{to cut off the}} advance of the flames by pulling down portions of the building.|$|R
