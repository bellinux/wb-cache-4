Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E

500|$|Metagenomics is {{the study}} of genetic {{material}} recovered directly from environmental samples. The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics, ecogenomics or community genomics. While traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing and genomics rely upon cultivated clonal cultures, early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the 16S rRNA gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample. Such work revealed {{that the vast majority of}} microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation-based methods. Recent studies use either [...] "shotgun" [...] or PCR directed sequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities. Because of its ability to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life, metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world. As the price of DNA sequencing continues to fall, metagenomics now allows microbial ecology to be investigated at a much greater scale and detail than before.|$|E
500|$|In {{the reward}} system, reward is the {{attractive}} and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior [...] (also known as approach behavior) – and consummatory behavior. A rewarding stimulus is one <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to cause {{an approach to}} it and a choice {{to be made to}} consume it or not. Pleasure, learning (e.g., classical and operant conditioning), and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward. As an aspect of reward, pleasure provides a definition of reward; however, while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding, not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable (e.g., extrinstic rewards like money). The motivational or desirable aspect of rewarding stimuli is reflected by the approach behavior that they induce, whereas the pleasurable component of intrinstic rewards is derived from the consummatory behavior that ensues upon acquiring them. [...] A neuropsychological model which distinguishes these two components of an intrinsically rewarding stimulus is the incentive salience model, where [...] "wanting" [...] or desire (less commonly, [...] "seeking") corresponds to appetitive or approach behavior while [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure corresponds to consummatory behavior.}} In human drug addicts, [...] "wanting" [...] becomes dissociated with [...] "liking" [...] as the desire to use an addictive drug increases, while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to drug tolerance.|$|E

2500|$|Creating induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} ("iPSCs") is a long and inefficient process.

A specific set of genes, often called [...] "reprogramming factors", are introduced into a specific adult cell type. These factors send signals in the mature cell that cause the cell to become a pluripotent stem cell. This process is highly studied and new techniques are being discovered frequently on how to better this induction process.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reward system}} {{is a group of}} neural {{structures}} responsible for incentive salience (i.e., motivation and [...] "wanting", desire, or craving for a reward), associative learning (primarily positive reinforcement and classical conditioning), and positive emotions, particularly ones which involve pleasure as a core component (e.g., joy, euphoria and ecstasy). Reward is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior – also known as approach behavior – and consummatory behavior. In its description of a rewarding stimulus (i.e., [...] "a reward"), a review on reward neuroscience noted, [...] "any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward."

2500|$|Most {{eukaryotic}} {{cells have}} mitochondria, which produce ATP from {{products of the}} citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and amino acid oxidation. At the mitochondrial inner membrane, electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass through the electron transport chain to oxygen, which is reduced to water. The electron transport chain comprises an enzymatic series of electron donors and acceptors. Each electron donor will pass electrons to a more electronegative acceptor, which in turn donates these electrons to another acceptor, a process that continues down the series until electrons are passed to oxygen, the most electronegative and terminal electron acceptor in the chain. Passage of electrons between donor and acceptor releases energy, {{which is used to}} generate [...] a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane by actively [...] "pumping" [...] protons into the intermembrane space, producing a thermodynamic state <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to do work.
