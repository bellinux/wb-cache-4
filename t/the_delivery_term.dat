In the observed period there were 8, 708 deliveries so {{that the percentage of}} tumours of ovary in pregnant women in our hospital was 0.1 % and that is lower rate than found in the literature. All of the pregnancies had gestation age between 12 and 15  weeks, clinical diagnoses: cysts ovarialis and patohistologic diagnoses were: cystys folicularis ovari in three cases, cystadenoma serosum in five cases and cystis dermoidalis in one case. The smallest diametre of the cyst measured by ultrasound was 8  cm and the greatest 12  cm. Neither of the tumours observed by ultrasound had malignant characteristics and CA 125 was within normal limits. In three cases we performed cystectomy (cystis folicularis) and in another cases adnexectomy. In all operations histopathologic analysis” ex tempore” was done and results were “benignant”. The post-operative period in all patients was regular and they were discharged the next day. We did not prescribe antibiotics as therapy.

40|$|Businesses are {{increasingly}} interested in improving their operations {{with the purpose}} of boosting company performance, which can be impacted through enhanced working capital management. Inventory management is one area that can help release working capital to other investments. In particular, the inventories in the end of supply chain are a potential phase for improvements, because these mostly tie up capital. In international trade, the commonly accepted trade terms, Incoterms, determine where the main risks and responsibilities are exchanged between the trade parties, and the companies can recognize their sales as revenue at this point. Therefore, one opportunity for decreasing the tied-up capital is to select <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>terms,</b> Incoterms, differently in the supply chain. The Incoterms are defectively studied in the academic literature, and there are {{only a small number of}} papers deepening the knowledge surrounding the topic.

We presented a 45 -year-old pregnant woman at 30 weeks of gestation, and with brain tumor recidive in frontal lobe, hystologicaly confirmed as astrocytoma. The patient was newly diagnosed with tumor in 1995, and monitored until 2003, when she was operated. Due to malignant profile and a partial removal of tumor masses, postoperative gamma-ray therapy was recommended.

40|$|When {{managing}} business processes, {{whether it}} involves production, {{the area of}} economics, trade or personnel, one must ask the basic question: "Who is doing it and in what order?" This should be immediately followed by: "Were our decisions correct?" More descriptions of business processes are not sufficient {{in order to be}} certain that the approaches and decisions serve to meet the goals of the company. The idea is to directly try out how the particular processes are connected and coordinated, or how the individual information streams are solved. A range of software tools serve these purposes enabling not only capturing of the processes along with consequent adaptations prior to actual implementation of the information system, hut also making possible simulation of its operations. Various variants of business models can be evaluated prior to implementation of the information system thanks to realistic simulations, thereby enabling one to choose the best solution as the basis for decisions regarding the process changes. This serves to distinctly improve the speed of realization of the particular processes. What are the additional advantages from modelling and use of more forms of solutions?

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (International Commerce)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{importance}} {{of small and}} medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the economy should not be overlooked. The main function of SMEs is to contribute to the economic activities in a country, through the provision of goods and services to the public or other firms. These goods and services could be traded internationally, thus increasing a country?s export performance. It is important for economic growth that SMEs grow within their respective economies. One way that SMEs can achieve growth is through internationalisation. Firms are internationalising faster than ever before (because of advances in telecommunications and transportation) and internationalisation theories that can provide practical guidance to firms are more important today than in the past. A firm?s ability to internationalise no longer only depends on the quality of <b>the</b> product, <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> and competitive prices. Internationalisation increasingly depends on the ability and willingness of financial institutions to grant credit. Obtaining trade finance has become a major hindrance to SME internationalisation, especially in Africa. By overcoming the difficulties in obtaining trade finance, African SMEs will be able to expand into foreign markets. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine how African SMEs can overcome trade finance barriers to internationalisation. SMEs can do so by mitigating the risks involved in every international transaction and by becoming ?trade finance ready?. A trade finance facility that is well suited for African SMEs (because it revolves around identifying and mitigating the risks involved with their international transactions) is structured trade and commodity finance. In trading with China, African SMEs can obtain structured trade and commodity finance from a specialist financial institution that focuses on the Chinese market (which is the focus of this study). China Construction Bank (Johannesburg branch), through their association with Rand-Asia Trade Finance, provides structured trade and commodity finance to African SMEs. The key to receiving structured trade and commodity finance is that these SMEs, together with China Construction Bank (Jhb) and Rand-Asia Trade Finance have to mitigate the risks involved with their international transactions so that the SMEs can become ?trade finance ready?.

The aim {{of the study was to}} find out why and how managers should use management accounting information in the design of a process for delivering portable crushing plants. The study is divided into three parts. The first part comprises cost element mapping that aims to bring transparency to portable <b>deliveries.</b> <b>The</b> second part comprises the strategic choices that need to be considered for <b>the</b> best <b>delivery</b> in <b>terms</b> of costs and risks. In the third part, a process is created that can be used to price and control <b>the</b> <b>delivery.</b> <b>The</b> theory used in this study was based on cost management and supply chain management theory, with the target being to create an effective <b>delivery</b> process. <b>The</b> background of this study is grounded in hermeneutics, and qualitative research methodologies were used. As the aim of this study was to create a new process and to solve a practical problem, the research approach used was constructive. The study was conducted as a single case, embedded case study. The data collection methods used were interviews, observations, and secondary data collection. Management accounting can be used to derive multiple benefits in portable deliveries, such as improved cost efficiency and more accurate pricing. It can also be used to provide tools that measure and control <b>the</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Cost element mapping was the largest part of the study, and it was used to identify the cost structure and the variables behind <b>the</b> <b>delivery.</b> In addition, it also revealed how the costs and benefits were divided between supply chain partners and who controlled the costs. The major finding was that Metso’s pricing was not completely accurate. The most suitable strategy for a portable delivery is based on costs and delivery time. However, quality, technological risks, and risk of damaging the products also need to be considered. The created process comprised different methods for serious and casual inquiries. The process also included templates to price <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> and to measure the performance of <b>the</b> <b>delivery.</b> <b>The</b> findings of this study can mainly be generalized to similar industrial equipment that can be transported containerized or in break bulk on a Ro-Ro vessel. The processes used are, however, bound to the assessed organization and cannot be generalized to other companies...|$|R
