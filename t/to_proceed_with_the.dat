5|$|American Express {{had been}} in discussions to {{potentially}} live stream Lady Gaga's performance during Sunday's ArtRave event. American Express decided not <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> live stream because of an inability to reach a mutual agreement on {{the production of the}} event. However, American Express honored its commitments to Lady Gaga and her team, and the event was able to proceed without an official role for American Express. Lady Gaga is an incredible artist and we hope to work together in the future.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, a 500 MW {{nuclear power}} plant was {{proposed}} for the Jervis Bay Territory, 200km south of Sydney. A local opposition campaign began, and the South Coast Trades and Labour Council (covering workers in the region) {{announced that it would}} refuse to build the reactor. Some environmental studies and site works were completed, and two rounds of tenders were called and evaluated, but in 1971 the Australian government decided not <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> project, citing economic reasons.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Welles's {{daughter}} Beatrice Welles sued Turner Entertainment, {{claiming the}} Welles estate {{is the legal}} copyright holder of the film. She claimed that Welles's deal to terminate his contracts with RKO meant that Turner's copyright of the film was null and void. She also claimed that the estate of Orson Welles was owed 20% of the film's profits if her copyright claim was not upheld. In 2007 she was allowed <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lawsuit, overturning the 2004 decision in favor of Turner Entertainment {{on the issue of}} video rights.|$|E

5|$|In early 1973, the Architectural Review {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} convert the Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river. The proposal proved very popular with the area's residents, and a May 1973 campaign led by John Betjeman, Sybil Thorndike and Laurie Lee raised a petition of 2,000signatures for the bridge to be permanently closed to traffic. Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Architectural Review scheme once legal matters had been dealt with.|$|E
5|$|Jeethu had {{initially}} approached Mammootty {{to play the}} lead, but {{he was unable to}} commit and asked Jeethu <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film with another actor.

He later added that no changes were made in the script when Mohanlal agreed.|$|E
5|$|Mumma {{arrived back}} in the United States in December 1945, and {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships. The Bureau's immediate post war priority was to develop nuclear propulsion for ships. With the Chief of the Bureau, Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, and Captain Paul F. Lee, he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, who were willing to help, but would not offer any fissionable material.

30|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>proceeding</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> real {{numerical}} simulation and model verification, the mesh independence analysis was conducted. In ideal case, {{the accuracy of}} the simulation results obtained is higher when the mesh size is finer and the domain element is denser. At the same time, it must be understood that the period of computational time to complete the simulation run would also be longer. This is due to the significantly increased calculation workload and solving of the governing equations in the model at each time step.|$|R

5|$|Terminal 3 {{opened on}} June 27, 2012. The project was {{announced}} in January 2001 {{as a way to}} accommodate rapid growth in passenger traffic, including international traffic. It came into question amid the 2008 recession and decreased tourism to Las Vegas, but the county decided <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> project, anticipating eventual economic recovery and a rebound in passenger numbers. Terminal 3 cost $2.4 billion to build {{and is one of the}} largest public works projects in Nevada. It replaced Terminal 2, providing more international gates and a larger U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility. With its seven domestic gates, the terminal also eases congestion at Terminal 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{arranged}} by U2 management to showcase the band's live act {{and to promote}} them to American audiences.

The concert was almost cancelled because of the inclement weather, but the band had invested in the filming with Island Records and concert promoter Barry Fey and wished <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gig. The rain and the torch-lit atmosphere of the surroundings made U2's performance dramatic. Segments of U2 Live at Red Rocks were shown in regular rotation on MTV, and were also broadcast on other television networks.|$|E

5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, the Orions {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Afterwards, they were ordered <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet. This grand battle was slow to happen, however, because of the Germans' reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force. As a result, the Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie.|$|E

After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet, but German reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force led to indecisive operations. The Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie. In April 1916, Vanguard was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron while her sisters remained in the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E

Most of it was briefly based (22October to 3November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; Neptune stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27November and the ship began a refit on 11December.|$|E
5|$|Britannia {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to turn the}} fire station into a 227-bed 4-star hotel in June 2010. The Victorian Society praised the proposed conversion.

Despite the plans being approved 16 September 2010, the council continued to pursue a CPO and solicited bids for a development partner in January 2011. Britannia's objection to the CPO led to a public inquiry in April 2011. On 29 November 2011, the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed the CPO had been rejected. Despite Britannia's guarantee at the inquiry <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> development it reconsidered its plans.

5|$|By October 6 the Egyptian naval {{task force}} was at Bab-el-Mandeb where they broke radio silence. When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry {{authorized}} the fleet <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blockade via a codeword. Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased. The blockade was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the blockade {{due to the}} long distance between Israel and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid {{at the entrance to}} the Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a blockade was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of the blockade was censored in Israel.|$|E

In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction <b>to</b> <b>Proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for the deployment. Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. One was for the United States to shoulder the cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible deployment. The other was for an {{agreement to be reached}} on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the plans with Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deployment as fast as the first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly deployment. A formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
