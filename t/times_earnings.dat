Given the recent pace of employee stock option grants, and assuming that equities continue to be priced at about 30 <b>times</b> <b>earnings,</b> our analysis suggests that the pace of net share retirements will fall well below the pace of the last few years, unless corporations use nearly all their earnings to fund shareholder payouts. Moreover, over the long haul, assuming corporations need to retain 40 to 50 percent of their earnings to invest and grow at historical rates, the long-run average pace of net share retirements is likely to fall to 1 / 2 percent or less.

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry is an $ 837 {{billion a year}} industry that is being plagued by low R&D productivity. This decline in productivity has resulted in significant erosion of value. From December 2000 to February 2008, the top 15 pharmaceutical companies lost about $ 850 billion in shareholder value and their stock price fell precipitously from 32 <b>times</b> <b>earnings</b> {{to an average of}} 13 (Garnier, 2008). In an attempt to boost R&D productivity, pharmaceutical companies are jettisoning their old lumbering and bureaucratic R&D organizations for de-centralized and entrepreneurial models in a wave of organizational redesigns that is aimed at delivering innovation and creating value. In this research, I have studied this new trend in organizational redesign by finding out what went wrong with the old model, what are the drivers for change, what is the new model and what strategic imperatives are they aimed at achieving. I have undertaken this by studying the top 5 research-based pharmaceutical companies. I have used interviews and extensive secondary research to gather facts and gain insight into issues and questions mentioned above. I then used the Three Organizational Lenses Framework by (Ancona et al, 2005) to analyze the new model at play in each of the 5 companies studied and proposed recommendations going forward. I found that whilst organizational design provides strong tools, techniques and systems for enhancing R&D productivity, implementing a new organizational structure alone will not suffice. There has to be a comprehensive approach that involves structure, systems and incentives; as well as paradigm shifts in both leadership and culture. by Sunny O. Adeusi. Thesis (S. M.)

We use data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS, 2013) on 572, 222 coupled households, covering the period from 1981 to 2005 in 18 OECD countries. Three trends are described. Firstly, over <b>time</b> women's <b>earnings</b> increasingly contributed to total household earnings, thereby increasing equality within households. Secondly, the positive correlation between spouses' <b>earnings</b> increased over <b>time.</b> Thirdly, <b>earnings</b> inequality among women declined. With a counter-factual decomposition technique on earnings inequality, we show that the combined effect of these trends was that women's earnings increasingly attenuated earnings inequality between households. The trend towards women's earnings increasingly attenuating the inequality between households was mainly driven by decreasing inequality among women. If inequality among women had not declined {{as it did in}} recent decades, inequality between households would have been 25 % higher than it actually was in 2005...|$|R

During this period {{the gap between the}} average weekly ordinary <b>time</b> <b>earnings</b> of women and men working full time in Australia decreased by only one and a half percentage points, from 17 percent in 1990, to 15. 5 percent in 2003 and the gap in Western Australia widened by 5 percentage points. Interviewees and the literature indicated that gender wage inequality was greatest within occupations whilst also occurring between occupations. Stakeholders interviewed felt that gender-related social/cultural values pervade the formal system of industrial relations as well as the wider society. These social/cultural values, changing slower than economic and industrial relations factors, result in persistent gender wage inequality as these values affect occupational choice before the market, the availability of jobs and training in the market and thus wages. Stakeholders showed that they believed that their gender-related values affected actions taken to, and decisions made in, industrial tribunals. Remedies for gende...|$|R
