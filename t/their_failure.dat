5|$|CENIPA {{concluded}} that the ExcelAire pilots {{also contributed to the}} accident with, among others, <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation.|$|E
5|$|Classical Athenian girls {{probably}} reached menarche {{at about}} age fourteen, {{when they would}} have married. Girls who died before marriage were mourned for <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to reach maturity. Memorial vases for dead girls in classical Athens often portrayed them dressed as brides, and were sometimes shaped like loutrophoroi (vases which held water used to bathe before the wedding day).|$|E

5|$|The Pirates {{have failed}} once in signing a draft pick. This {{occurred}} in 2012, when the Pirates selected RHP Mark Appel from Stanford University, who sought a significant bonus which, {{according to new}} MLB rules, would have cost the Pirates a future draft pick. The Pirates will receive the 9th overall pick in the 2013 draft for <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to sign Appel.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Gliese 3634 b {{was reported in}} the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011. Gliese 3634 b was the first planet discovered by the astronomers after adopting their new strategy, despite <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to find a transit event for the planet.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} cordite handling, {{the battle was}} mostly inconclusive, though both the British {{flagship}} Lion and Seydlitz were severely damaged. Lion lost speed, causing her to fall behind {{the rest of the}} battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships {{for the remainder of the}} engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser Blücher, sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.|$|E

50|$|The {{results of}} a zero-defects mentality can include careerism, reduced {{motivation}} and stifled innovation. Soldiers or employees will feel neither empowered by their successes nor accountable for <b>their</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Week 1, {{there was}} no elimination. Subsequently, Mawi and Marsha were chosen by the Principal to be re-entered into the {{competition}} through 'AFSERAP', after <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> to be chosen in Prelude Concert.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{contacts}} with the imperials, Euphemius was now willing to serve as their guide, evidently hoping that the Muslims, humbled by <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> and without the strong will of Asad to guide them, could now be made to serve his purposes. After Mineo surrendered, the Muslim army divided in two: one part took Agrigento in the west, while the other, along with Euphemius, attacked Enna. The garrison of Enna began negotiations, offering to acknowledge Euphemius' authority, but when Euphemius with a small escort met with their emissaries, he was murdered. It is unknown what happened to Euphemius' supporters after his death, whether they dispersed or continued fighting alongside the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|Following Australia's {{unlikely}} win at Headingley, the England selectors {{were widely}} condemned for <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> {{to choose a}} specialist wrist spinner to exploit the turning pitch. This was cited {{as a reason for}} the hosts' loss, as the part-timer Compton was able to trouble the batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets, only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings. In response, the English selectors made four changes to the team for the Fifth Test, one of these being the inclusion of leg spinner Eric Hollies. Their frequent changes to the team meant the hosts used a total of 21 players for the five Tests, and the repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the war, the camp was staffed by 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), {{approximately}} 12 percent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at the camp, and <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to bomb the camp or its railways remains controversial. One hundred forty-four prisoners are known to have escaped from Auschwitz successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units—prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers—launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.|$|E
5000|$|The Financial Times quotes Giampaolo as {{believing that}} {{entrepreneurs}} should not hide behind a persona of success, but embrace <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> instead: [...] "The best entrepreneurs talk about failure {{with pride and}} guts." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{test has}} {{highlighted}} educational disparities by race, disability, income, and whether English is spoken in the home. This has been politically embarrassing for school districts, who were previously able to ignore <b>their</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|R
50|$|The second {{way that}} people self-handicap is by coming up with {{justifications}} for <b>their</b> potential <b>failures,</b> so {{that if they do}} not succeed in the task, they can point to their excuses as the reasons for <b>their</b> <b>failures.</b> This is known as claimed self-handicapping, in which the individual merely states that an obstacle to performance exists. Examples of claimed self-handicaps include declarations that one is experiencing physical symptoms.|$|R
5|$|Mickl {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the 42nd Panzerjäger Battalion during the invasion. He got along well with Rommel, and his battalion fought well but suffered serious casualties during the Battle of Arras on 21 May while trying to stop the heavily armoured tanks of the British 1st Army Tank Brigade with its 37 mm anti-tank guns. His soldiers derided their guns as Panzeranklopfgerät (tank-door knocker), due to <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to penetrate the British Matilda I and Matilda II tanks. Mickl's battalion tried to protect the exposed flank of the division, but was overrun. The situation was saved by anti-aircraft guns and field artillery which were able to knock out the British tanks with direct fire.|$|E
5|$|Ranko Marijan, the Justice Minister {{in a new}} government, criticised his {{predecessors}} and the police for <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to pursue the case, but the authorities failed to protect Levar, who was murdered by car bomb on 30 August 2000. The investigation of the killings in Gospić was a contributing factor in the criticism of the government's efforts by seven active duty and five retired Croatian generals who issued the Twelve Generals' Letter making their grievance public. That led to sacking of the seven active duty officers, including by President Stjepan Mesić. The group included Norac, who had held the rank of major general since September 1995.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new {{provisions to}} cover this sort of situation. Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property, owed by the landlord to anyone who could reasonably {{be expected to be}} harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a landlord who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to repair.|$|E
5000|$|Next, Edwards {{describes}} how these individuals inevitably fail {{to live up}} to the Old Testament legalist standard, and they experience despair at <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> and inherent sinfulness, often believing they have committed [...] "unpardonable sin." ...|$|R
5000|$|Attribution {{asymmetry}} - We tend {{to attribute}} our success to our abilities and talents, but we attribute our failures to bad luck and external factors. We attribute other's success to good luck, and <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> to <b>their</b> mistakes.|$|R

5|$|She and Leopold {{married in}} a {{religious}} ceremony five days before his death, though <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage void under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline numerous properties, items of high material value, Congolese bonds, and other valuable sources of income – all of which turned her into a multimillionaire. For years the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters attempted to recover some of this wealth, with their success varying depending on the case. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 in Cambo-les-Bains, France.|$|E
5|$|Terry Pratchett {{was pleased}} with the 1986 {{interactive}} fiction game The Colour of Magic, but criticised its poor marketing. He was reluctant to grant Discworld licences due to concern for the series, and wanted a reputable company who cared about the property. Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to obtain a Discworld licence {{led to the creation of}} Simon the Sorcerer, which took inspiration from the Discworld series of books.|$|E
5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, {{which resulted in a}} loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.|$|E
5000|$|Attribution asymmetry: People tend to {{attribute}} their own success to internal factors, including abilities and talents, but explain <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> {{in terms of}} external factors such as bad luck. The reverse bias is shown when people explain others' success or failure.|$|R
50|$|Flagellation {{in these}} confraternities {{developed}} {{an even stronger}} tradition in the fourteenth century with the pandemic of The Plague or Black Death. Christian religious groups often expressed {{the belief that the}} plague was the wrath of an angry God, who was punishing his followers. In an effort to appease God, lay religious groups advocated punishing their own flesh to show God how they regretted <b>their</b> personal <b>failures</b> and how they were punishing themselves for <b>their</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|R
50|$|Finding {{out that}} the story is even bigger than what they bargained for, Gil takes enough {{pictures}} and both gather enough material to last weeks for the tabloid. They more than make up for <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> and Mac gets his banner headline.|$|R
5|$|The side's {{success in}} their rugby matches contrasted to <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> in Victorian Rules– the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria: against Melbourne, a Navy selection, and Victoria. The matches were all won, with their game against Victoria a 19–0 victory. After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches, and {{defeated}} New South Wales 12–9. After two further victories, the side again faced New South Wales, {{and won the}} match 16–12. Another two victories followed, before the team played their only association football matches of the tour– both defeats.|$|E
5|$|Ulrezaj reappears {{several years}} later, {{residing}} on Aiur {{where he is}} manipulating a faction of Protoss survivors who were not evacuated. Ulrezaj uses these Protoss to attempt to capture a Terran archaeologist, Jacob Ramsey, who has the powerful mind of a Protoss archivist, Zamara, residing in his own mind; <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> to do so leads to Ulrezaj personally trying to take Ramsey, but the archaeologist escapes through a warp gate while both Zerg and Valerian Mengsk's forces also attempt to capture him. Ulrezaj traces Ramsey to Ehlna, breaking through the defenses of both the Protoss and the Dominion. However, Zamara uses her last energy to lock Ulrezaj's mind into a storage crystal, sacrificing herself to keep Ulrezaj trapped.|$|E
5|$|Vaduz's {{success in}} their nation's cup ensured they {{gained access to}} the UEFA Cup, and in August 2002, Burgmeier scored his first European goal during a 1–1 with Livingston, the Scottish side's first game in Europe. In the second leg, Vaduz had a late goal {{disallowed}} during a 0–0, and so they {{went out in the}} qualifying round for the third successive year, losing on the away goals rule. Vaduz topped the Fall Season table that season, but failed to win promotion to the Swiss Super League after finishing fourth in the Final League. <b>Their</b> <b>failure</b> was offset with another victory in the Liechtenstein Cup, this time defeating Balzers in the final.|$|E

40|$|Human {{experience}} with interactive {{games will be}} enhanced if the software agents that play the game learn from <b>their</b> <b>failures.</b> Techniques such as reinforcement learning provide {{one way in which}} these agents may learn from <b>their</b> <b>failures.</b> Model-based meta-reasoning in which an agent uses a self-model for blame assignment provides another. This paper evaluates an framework in which both these approaches are combined. We describe an experimental investigation of a specific task (defending a city) in a computer war strategy game called FreeCiv. Our results indicate that in the task examined, model-based meta-reasoning coupled with reinforcement learning enables the agent to learn the task with performance matching that of an expert designed agent and with speed exceeding that of a pure reinforcement learning agent...|$|R
