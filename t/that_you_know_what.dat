500|$|It wasn’t as hard as, say, {{running around}} with all my gear on in Jarhead. I’d rather go for an awkward moment than {{physical}} exertion any day. The only thing that I think [...] get freaked out about {{when they have to}} do something like kiss a guy in a movie—when to their knowledge they’re straight—is that they’re afraid they’re going to be turned on. And if you’re not afraid that you’re going to be turned on—meaning <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you like—then really it’s not that hard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I mean..." [...] Ginger {{seemed to}} be finding his usual {{difficulty}} in expressing himself. [...] "About <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> you said." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of course, I know it's as bad {{as being}} henpecked; but then Jeeves is always right. You've got to {{consider}} <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>What?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you said}} nothing, McCrae," [...] he began presently. [...] "I felt all along <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was wrong--if <b>you</b> had only spoken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's curious <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the errand was, unless Miss Graham told you." [...] Mrs. Keith looked sternly at Millicent, who blushed. [...] "I {{have been}} led to believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> made her acquaintance, without my knowledge, on board the steamer by which we came up." ...|$|R
5000|$|Teicher {{had told}} Merkin not to invest with Madoff because such steady returns were impossible. [...] After Madoff's arrest, Teicher {{immediately}} sent some emails to Merkin:“You, however, took a brilliant career and actively, willingly, wiped your ass {{with it when}} it was obvious <b>that</b> <b>you</b> (<b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you)</b> were doing.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> art can offer, {{would you}} change your life? Would you have missed all the delight it has given you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are content, then, to {{let your}} husband drift back into his old {{relations}} with the Duchess? I presume <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they were?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But how {{on earth}} can that be?" [...] his friend asked. [...] "Are you sure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you are saying? Is your head quite clear, old friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and I also {{remember}} sending you word {{not to show}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> she was doing; but {{to wait and see}} if she turned her knowledge of writing to account, and took or sent any letters to the post. You informed me, in your regular monthly report, that she nearer did anything of the kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I saw <b>that</b> {{she liked}} <b>you,</b> and because such a {{marriage}} {{would have been}} so suitable. She has all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they say of her now?" ...|$|R
60|$|I don't wish {{to deceive}} <b>you.</b> It's best <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should <b>know</b> <b>what</b> has happened.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no cousin!' said Mr Jonas, {{sitting down}} {{beside her on the}} window-seat. 'Don't be in a hurry. There's no {{occasion}} for <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> a cruel girl you are!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> she is," [...] cried Mr. Worthington, {{rising and}} smiting {{the pile of}} letters on his desk, [...] "why do you keep her there an instant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He says so; and I {{believe his}} word {{on such a}} subject sooner than yours. You are likely to quarrel without knowing it, and he is not. He thinks <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> has become of Mountjoy." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{before she}} {{had time to think}} whether she excused him or not-- which afterwards, at leisure, she became {{conscious}} that she did--he began to talk about music, and {{to say that it was}} his greatest pleasure in life. He had heard all the great singers in Paris and London--Pasta and Rubini and Lablache--and when <b>you</b> had done <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> could say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> singing was.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can <b>you</b> ask <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a good Presbyterian I am, Cornelia? How could a Presbyterian {{get along}} without a devil?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well deserved, I am confident,' said Logan; 'and now <b>you</b> {{are sure}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have to do, as I have explained?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean," [...] he answered, {{avoiding}} her eyes. [...] "Your villagers {{will certainly}} think it strange {{to see their}} mistress walking with the poor missioner who wasn't allowed to hold his services." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My wishes {{have nothing}} to do with it," [...] said Dr. May. [...] "The point is--that I must do right, as far as I can, as well as try to secure your happiness; and I want to be sure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you are about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From the first, you know," [...] he answered, [...] "you took an {{interest}} in my prospects. You were on my side. That gratified me, I assure you. And now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they have done to me, I am sure you are with me all the more." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. [Violently.] How dare <b>you</b> say <b>that?</b> <b>You.</b> <b>You.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I am. Yes, it's all true. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> but it can't {{be worse}} than the truth. And whose fault is it? Yours. If I'm rotten it's you who made me rotten.|$|R
6000|$|... "Met {{him last}} night at the Duchess's hop. Seems a decent little chap. No side and <b>that,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean. Hullo, there's his number!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} <b>that,</b> Lechmere. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the Bible says, 'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord,' and whoever it may be, leave him safely in God's hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. That is natural. It {{would have}} been a great misfortune if you had loved him before you had reason to know that he loved you;--a great misfortune. But now,--now that you cannot but think of him, now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> his wishes are, perhaps you may learn--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like your}} nerve, coming {{bounding}} about the place, saying 'Well, Gussie.' That's {{about all the}} 'Well, Gussie' I shall require from you, Wooster. And it's no good looking like <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean. That damned prize-giving! It was a dastardly act to crawl out as you did and shove it off on to me. I will not mince my words. It was the act of a hound and a stinker." ...|$|E
6000|$|If {{you come}} {{to deal with a}} {{tradesman}} or handicraft man, and talk his own language to him, he presently supposes you understand his business; <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you come about; that you have judgment in his goods, or in his art, and cannot easily be imposed upon; accordingly, he treats you like a man that is not to be cheated, comes close to the point, and does not crowd you with words and rattling talk to set out his wares, and to cover their defects; he finds you know where to look or feel for the defect of things, and how to judge their worth. For example:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean to {{tell the}} jury then <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> meant when you said the thing had been talked over; do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why? I {{have seen}} {{so little of}} you. I had no idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> even <b>what</b> had become of me since I had left my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Alone, quite alone. You {{have no fear}} of <b>that.</b> And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> word means? Not only to be {{separate}} from all others but to have not even one friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I a liar in your eyes?" [...] {{he asked}} passionately. [...] "Little sceptic, you shall be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains to prove: I caused a rumour {{to reach her}} that my fortune was not {{a third of what}} was supposed, and after that I {{presented}} myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not--I could not--marry Miss Ingram. You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I love as my own flesh. You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are--I entreat to accept me as a husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|KEEGAN. It's not {{nonsense}} at all: it's true--in a way. But {{never mind}} the black man. Now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a travelled man I am, what can I do for you? [She hesitates and plucks nervously at the heather. He stays her hand gently]. Dear Miss Nora: don't pluck the little flower. If {{it was a pretty}} baby you wouldn't want to pull its head off and stick it in a vawse o water to look at. [The grasshopper chirps: Keegan turns his head and addresses it in the vernacular]. Be aisy, me son: she won't spoil the swing-swong in your little three. [To Nora, resuming his urbane style] You see I'm quite cracked; but never mind: I'm harmless. Now what is it? ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing is {{more curious}} than the myriad {{ways in which}} {{reaction}} from an unfortunate love-affair manifests itself in various men. No two males behave {{in the same way}} under the spur of female fickleness. Archilochum, for instance, according to the Roman writer, proprio rabies armavit iambo. It is no good pretending out of politeness <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> that means, so I will translate. Rabies--his grouch--armavit--armed--Archilochum--Archilochus--iambo--with the iambic--proprio--his own invention. In other words, when the poet Archilochus was handed his hat by the lady of his affections, he consoled himself by going off and writing satirical verse about her in a new metre which he had thought up immediately after leaving the house. That was the way the thing affected him.|$|E
60|$|FAITH. You cannot think (but <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> something) <b>what</b> a {{flattering}} tongue she had; she lay at me hard to turn aside with her, promising me {{all manner}} of enjoyment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O dear! if {{you would}} let me see whether d'Artagnan got to England. I must know that! I'm sure there can't be any harm in <b>that.</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it is about?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh don't--please don't!" [...] Miriam wailed at this. She {{stood before}} the fireless chimney-piece {{with one of her}} hands on it. [...] "If it's only to say <b>that,</b> don't <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what's</b> the use?" ...|$|R
