50|$|Single rotor {{helicopters}} need a {{tail rotor}} {{to neutralize the}} <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> produced by the single large rotor. Transverse rotor helicopters, however, use counter-rotating rotors, with each canceling out the other's torque. Counter-rotating rotor blades won't collide with and destroy each other if they flex into the other rotor's pathway.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional strip methods for two-way slab design, {{finite element analysis}} (FEA) automatically provides deformation compatibility and a full equilibrium load path. Designers using FEA, however, have often blindly ignored <b>twisting</b> <b>moments</b> that occur {{on the edges of}} the elements because they are not sure how to account for them. This assumption may be unconservative where torsion is high. The available methods for explicitly incorporating <b>twisting</b> <b>moments</b> in the design of slabs based on FEA results are discussed in this article. clos...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that by {{employing}} a torsion-tension test, {{it is possible}} to have a complete mapping near the origin of the two principal strain invariants associated with the rate of change of the strain energy function. However, the mathematical representation of the <b>twist</b> <b>moment</b> and normal forces vs strain and the strain energy function are complex. This problem is solved by using a set of solid cylindrical bars with different diameters such that the difference in diameter of two successive bars is small. The stress-strain equations can be grossly oversimplified by considering differences in <b>twist</b> <b>moment</b> and normal force as a function of difference in radius...|$|R
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} {{twisting force}} is experienced by any asymmetrical spinning object. In the propeller it acts to twist the blades {{to a fine}} pitch. The aerodynamic centre of pressure is therefore usually arranged to be slightly forward of its mechanical centreline, creating a <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> towards coarse pitch and counteracting the centrifugal moment. However in a high-speed dive the aerodynamic force can change significantly and the moments can become unbalanced.|$|E
50|$|Following World War I, {{automatic}} propellers {{were developed}} to maintain an optimum angle of attack. This was done by balancing the centripetal <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> on the blades {{and a set of}} counterweights against a spring and the aerodynamic forces on the blade. Automatic props had the advantage of being simple, lightweight, and requiring no external control, but a particular propeller's performance was difficult to match with that of the aircraft's power plant.|$|E
50|$|Camber thrust is {{approximately}} linearly proportional to camber angle for small angles, reaches its steady-state value nearly instantaneously after {{a change in}} camber angle, and so {{does not have an}} associated relaxation length. Bias-ply tires have been found to generate more camber thrust than radial tires. Camber stiffness is a parameter used to describe the camber thrust generated by a tire and it is influenced by inflation pressure and normal load. The net camber thrust is usually in front of the center of the wheel and so generates a camber torque, twisting torque, or <b>twisting</b> <b>moment.</b> The orientation of this torque is such that it tends to steer a tire towards the direction that it is leaned. An alternate explanation for this torque is that {{the two sides of the}} contact patch are at different radii from the axle and so would travel forward at different rates unless constrained by friction with the pavement.|$|E
30|$|Barber (1979) {{investigated}} the deflections of annular sectorial plates for {{some problems with}} concentrated moments and forces on a plate with a straight edge. He also provided a solution for <b>twisting</b> <b>moments</b> applied at the vertex of an infinite sectorial plate. Lim and Wang (2000) developed solutions for annular Mindlin sectorial plates using the Kirchhoff solutions, and Boonchareon et al. (2013) revisited the William’s problem for plate bending, providing solutions for problems that were previously unsolved. Huang et al. (2016) solved the infinite sectorial plate problem subjected to tip loads consisting of two <b>twisting</b> <b>moments</b> and a bending moment in a functionally graded plate, as well as concentrated forces in {{the plane of the}} plate; these solutions employed complex variable techniques.|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this study reports an {{experimental}} program consisting of six full-scale tests on pipe sections under load combinations of shearing forces, bending <b>moments,</b> and <b>twisting</b> <b>moments.</b> The experimental results agree very well with the predicted failure loads based on recently developed interaction relations. The experimental program establishes the validity of the analytical techniques used to derive the interaction relations for pipe sections. The verified methodology is extended to derive interaction relations for square hollow structural sections under combinations of normal forces, <b>twisting</b> <b>moments,</b> biaxial bending moments, and biaxial shearing forces. Careful consideration is given to the applicability limits of the developed interaction relations. A stress resultant transformation scheme is devised {{in order to reduce the}} number of interaction relations from 20 cases to only three fundamental cases...|$|R

5000|$|Handle paddles {{increase}} the resistance the hand experiences {{as it tries}} to move through the water during the effective part of the arm stroke - the part of the stroke described as the [...] "pull". [...] This gives the swimmer considerably more forward propulsion from the arm stroke than does a naked hand, and affords an enhanced kinesthetic [...] "feel" [...] of the pull. It also enhances the swimmer's feel of the [...] "catch", the phase prior to the pull, where the hand turns from a streamlined position to grasp the water and begin the pull. If the hand catches or pulls at an incorrect angle, the increased resistance afforded by the hand paddle will exacerbate the result <b>twisting</b> <b>moment,</b> making the defect clearer to the swimmer. The considerably increased load imposed by the hand paddle on the arm and shoulder can, however, lead to pain and an increased risk of injury, so coaches advise only limited use of paddles and that use be discontinued if the swimmer feels shoulder pain.|$|E
40|$|It is shownthat, when {{employing}} the integral formulation to describe contact problemsbetween Kirchhoff plates and irregular linear supports, the equivalent shear force concept maybe {{incompatible with the}} integral approach. In such circumstances the equivalent shear forceconcept has to be abandoned in favour of an equivalent <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> approach. A classicalexample of an infinite plate resting on a linear central segment is revisited {{in the light of}} theequivalent <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> concept, where all the computations are carried out in exact form. An additional example is developed to show that the usefulness of an integral approach basedupon the equivalent <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> concept remains valid even when the equivalent twistingmoment is applied at a plate border along which the <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> must be null, as it occursin a partially clamped border.

40|$|Composite {{structures}} {{are used for}} a wide variety of aerospace applications. Practical structures contain cutouts and these {{structures are}} subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane loading conditions. Structurally efficient designs for composite structures require a thorough understanding of the effects of cutouts on the response of composite plates subjected to inplane or out-of-plane loadings. Most investigations of the behavior of composite plates with cutouts have considered in-plane loadings only. Out-of-plane loadings suchas bending or twisting have received very limited attention. The response of homogeneous plates (e. g., isotropic or orthotropic plates) subjected to bending or <b>twisting</b> <b>moments</b> has been studied analytically. These analyses are for infinite plates and neglect finite-plate effects. Recently, analytical and experimental studies were conducted to determine the effects of cutouts on the response of laminated composite plates subjected to bending moments. No analytical or experimental results are currently available for the effects of cutouts on the response of composite laminates subjected to <b>twisting</b> <b>moments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cyclic {{activation}} of the external and internal oblique muscles contributes to <b>twisting</b> <b>moments</b> during normal gait. During pushing while walking, it is not well understood how these muscles respond to presence of predictable (cyclic push-off forces) and unpredictable (external) perturbations that occur in pushing tasks. We hypothesized that the predictable perturbations due to the cyclic push-off forces {{would be associated with}} cyclic muscle activity, while external perturbations would be counteracted by cocontraction of the oblique abdominal muscles. Eight healthy male subjects pushed at two target forces and two handle heights in a static condition and while walking without and with external perturbations. For all pushing tasks, the median, the static (10 th percentile) and the peak levels (90 th percentile) of the electromyographic amplitudes were determined. Linear models with oblique abdominal EMGs and trunk angles as input were fit to the <b>twisting</b> <b>moments,</b> to estimate trunk stiffness. There {{was no significant difference between}} the static EMG levels in pushing while walking compared to the peak levels in pushing while standing. When pushing while walking, the additional dynamic activity was associated with the <b>twisting</b> <b>moments,</b> which were actively modulated by the pairs of oblique muscles as in normal gait. The median and static levels of trunk muscle activity and estimated trunk stiffness were significantly higher when perturbations occurred than without perturbations. The increase baseline of muscle activity indicated cocontraction of the antagonistic muscle pairs. Furthermore, this cocontraction resulted in an increased trunk stiffness around the longitudinal axis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} model study {{on the effects of}} {{eccentricity}} between centre of mass and centre of stiffness of a tall rectangular building on the wind-induced response characteristics and wind excitation mechanisms was carried out. The results indicated significant effects of eccentricity on the along-wind, cross-wind, and <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> responses for both cases of the incident wind normal to the narrow and wide faces of the building model. The periodic twisting moments, created either by the flow separation at the upstream corners and the reattachment process of the separated shear layers, or by the eccentricity between the resultant lift force and centre of stiffness, were found to be a dominant wind excitation mechanism causing {{a significant increase in the}} <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> response of the building model. In addition, the <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> responses could be greatly amplified by the effects of resonance between the frequency of the periodic <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> and the torsional natural frequency of the building model. For the building model with the centre of stiffness located downstream from the centre of mass, increases in the <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> response and the resultant acceleration response at the corner of the building model were more prominent.

40|$|In the {{locomotion}} of man, usually, three step-force components (comression, anterior-posterior and transcurrent force) {{have been}} concerned. However, beside three components the torsional moment {{around the body}} axis is also brought about. In a leg part, a hip joint and an ankle joint combine to allow the body rotation as rotational pairs of spherical joints. Walking naturally acompanies this twisting motion, but to the date, no investigations on the <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> have been made. One of the reasons {{may be difficult to}} measure the <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> itself. In this paper, the measuring system is developed, by which a reliable twisting force related to <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> can be measured. Twisting force diagrams obtained through seven sorts of walking method.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{interaction between}} two bodies involves normal loading {{in combination with}} tangential, torsional and rotational loading. This paper focuses on the torsional loading of two spherical bodies which leads to <b>twisting</b> <b>moment.</b> The theoretical approach for calculating <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> between two spherical bodies has been proposed by Lubkin [1]. Due {{to the complexity of}} the solution, this has been simplified by Deresiewicz for discrete element modelling [2]. Here, the application of a simplified model for elastoplastic spheres is verified using computational modelling. The single grain interaction is simulated in a combined finite discrete element domain. In this domain a grain can deform using a finite element formulation and can interact with other objects based on discrete element principles. For an elastoplastic model, the contact area is larger in comparison with the elastic model, under a given normal force. Therefore, the plastic <b>twisting</b> <b>moment</b> is stiffer. The results presented here are important for describing any granular system involving torsional loading of elastoplastic grains. In particular, recent research on the behaviour of soil has clearly shown the importance of plasticity on grain interaction and rearrangement...|$|E
