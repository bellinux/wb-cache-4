In last 25 years, dynamics of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry has changed dramatically and manufacturing moved from developed countries to the low-cost manufacturing countries. <b>Textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> manufacturing is a highly labor oriented industry and labor cost is the basic criteria for its relocation. China emerged as the largest manufacturer of <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> globally. In recent times, labor wages have increased by many folds and labor is moving to other manufacturing industries due to better compliance and wages in China. Also, relocation of <b>Textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry within China is taking place, which will further affect the price and supply chain of textile products. After joining the WTO by Vietnam in 2007, <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry in Vietnam has seen fast and sustainable growth over these years and {{making it one of}} the top five garments producer. Export value of <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry is expected to increase and it is expected that in future Vietnam will be the second biggest producer of <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>products</b> after China.

30|$|Sustainability is {{the major}} concern {{in the age of}} the modern world. For the <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel sector, it has been a burning issue for many related {{concerned}} bodies. Challenges faced by the apparel manufacturers and retailers, brands with many incidents such as the Rana Plaza building collapse, the Tazreen garments fire tragedy in Bangladesh, and the crisis in Cambodia, led the clothing industry giants, nonprofit organizations, fashion designers, manufacturers, and consumers to be well aware towards sustainable <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> business practices. Over the past few years, increasing awareness of the environmental and social concerns surrounding the fashion industries and consumers has led to a rise in the implementation of sustainability initiatives. There has been a growing concern over apparel brands in improving their environmental impact and the social responsibility throughout their supply chains (Allwood et al. 2006). Most of the <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>product</b> used by the consumer has a significant impact on the environment. For example, according to a study, one 0.5 -lb cotton T-shirt requires 700 gallons of water during processing, uses 0.2 lb of fertilizers and 0.01 -lb pesticides, and emits 6 lb of CO 2, 1.2 lb of fossil fuels, and 0.11 lb of other gases. One 0.5 -lb pound T-shirt does 18.3 pounds of CO 2 emission on average from washing and dyeing 50 times in US (Fletcher and Grose 2012; USagain, 2015). Many consumers today do not know the extent to which these products impact the environment—low or high. They must account for the environmental impacts of the materials she uses, the resulting waste of the forms she chooses, how products are produced and packaged, where they will be made and then sold, causing the energy use for transportation, how consumers may use and dispose of the product (Adams and Frost 2008). A product is thought to be eco-sustainable if it is manufactured, used, and disposed of in a manner that would not harm the environment when compared to a product that was manufactured and used without any environmental concern. However, consumers have become more conscious of these impacts and are spelling out their preferences for eco-friendliness, thereby forcing the manufacturer to adopt clean technologies all along the supply chain to produce environmentally friendly products (Challa 2014). Environmental sustainability refers to the ability of something to continue without upsetting the earth’s ecological balance. Sustainable apparel products can be defined as a part of the growing design philosophy and trend of sustainability, the goal of which is to create a system which can be supported indefinitely in terms of environmentalism and social responsibility (Adams and Frost 2008). Environmental sustainability in business refers to longevity but in terms of which natural resources the production process might draw upon, how resources are used and replenished, the overall impact of the final production on the environment, and where the product ends up following its disposal. The <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel products impact the environment at every point along the product’s lifecycle (Fletcher 2008). However, rapid growth in the <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry sector is playing a vital role in the economy of Bangladesh. Despite the growing necessity of environmental practices in the apparel industry, little research has explored methods and standard tools to guide apparel designers, manufacturers, merchandisers, and consumers in adapting environmental issues in their works. Many designers do not recognize how their designs impact the environment. The role of the designer must expand dramatically in light of current environmental concerns with the contamination and destruction of the ecosystem (DEFRA 2010). Today’s designer, manufacturer, merchandiser, and consumer must be well informed on a vast array of topics, from methods of production to governmental regulations to life cycle analysis. They must account for the environmental impacts of the materials’ uses, the resulting waste of the forms they choose, how products are produced and packaged, where they will be made and then sold, the causing energy use for transportation, and how consumers may use and dispose of the product (Goworek 2011). All products that are manufactured cause environmental degradation, either during manufacture, use, or disposal. This can be evaluated by looking at the different phases of the product’s life cycle and taking action at the phases where it will be most effective to reduce the environmental impact. Among many techniques to study the eco-impact of products, the life cycle assessment is most widely used one. LCA examines products from initial stage to the final stage, covers the entire life cycle, and also examines eco-impact during the whole lifetime (Muthu et al. 2012). However, the life cycle of a product is long and complicated, covering many areas with many people involved in each phase. A remedial measure or policy may not be possible to address this aspect, but a variety of voluntary and mandatory tools will help to achieve this objective. These include eco-friendly tests for related <b>clothing</b> <b>products,</b> economic instruments, bans on certain substances, environmental labeling, voluntary agreements, and product design guidelines (IPP 2014). Hence, there is a growing need to evaluate the environmental sustainability of apparel products by standard methods, tools, and techniques to minimize the environmental impact. The Higg Index by the Sustainable Apparel Coalition is such a standard tool by which the environmental sustainability of apparel products could be evaluated. This study attempts to identify and analyze a number of these issues related to apparel product sustainability focusing on materials and manufacturing environmental sustainability by taking several local and foreign branded knitted T-shirts into consideration as a case study.|$|R

Employing administrative person-level panel data matched with employer data for the period 1999 to 2010, I exploit the dismantling of import quotas on Chinese <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>products</b> in conjunction with China 2 ̆ 019 s accession to the WTO as a quasi-natural experiment and utilize within-industry heterogeneity in workers 2 ̆ 019 exposure to this trade shock. Results show a negative and significant impact of the low-wage import shock on workers 2 ̆ 019 future earnings and employment trajectories, which stems mainly from shortened employment at the firm that was exposed to the competition shock and subsequent difficulty in maintaining stable employment. While the service sector is the main absorber of all types of workers displaced by the import shock, recovery from the shock in service sector jobs varies greatly across workers depending on occupation, education and age. Less-educated, older and workers who had occupations with a high industry-specific skill content at the exposed firms had the worst adjustment experience. The results show that trade-induced adjustment costs are substantial and heterogeneous across workers. For some, challenges remain even after transitioning to full-time jobs outside of manufacturing, as the loss of human capital specific to their former industry remains as an important hurdle to recovery...|$|E
40|$|China has {{now become}} the largest {{producer}} and exporter of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>products</b> in the world. The objective {{of this research is}} to explore the relationship between the complicated interactive process of institutional change and the development of industrial clusters in China. It focuses on the distinctive institutional factors that have allowed the textile and clothing clusters in China to benefit from globalisation while those in other transitional economies have not done so. The research also aims to make a thorough investigation into how the dynamic change of the public-private interface has influenced the development and upgrading of the textile and clothing clusters in contemporary China-in-transition, with all the political and social implications that the process entails. The research mainly uses the New Institutional Economics Approach (NIE) and gives weight to institutional change through multiple case studies of textile and clothing clusters in Zhejiang province, East China. The micro case studies are effective in illustrating the interaction between institutional change and industrial development. The research argues that the unique institutional factors leading to the rapid development of textile and clothing clusters in China include hybrid ownership, public entrepreneurship and the specialised wholesale market. The research has also shown that the theory of local state corporatism alone fails to explain the great success of textile and clothing clusters in China. The development and upgrading of textile and clothing clusters in China has witnessed extraordinary institutional change through co-evolution between the public sector and the private sector, which can be reflected through the interaction among social networks, entrepreneurship and performance of local government. The flexibility in the public-private interface is one unique endogenous institutional arrangement embedded in the economic system in China. It is a dynamic process of institutional embeddedness, deembeddedness and reembeddedness with a diversity of economic regimes coexisting at different hierarchies of governmen...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, {{the textile}} and {{clothing}} clusters of the Yangtze River Delta (consisting of Shanghai City, Zhejiang Province and Jiangsu Province, East China) have developed {{to such an}} extent that only five years after joining the World Trade Organisation at the end of 2001, China has now become the largest producer and exporter of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>products</b> in the world. The objective of this research is to explore the relationship between the complicated interactive process of institutional change and the development of industrial clusters in China. It focuses on the distinctive institutional factors that have allowed the textile and clothing clusters in China to benefit from globalisation while those in other transitional economies have not done so. The research also aims to make a thorough investigation into how the dynamic change of the public-private interface has influenced the development and upgrading of the textile and clothing clusters in contemporary China-in-transition, with all the political and social implications that the process entails. The research mainly uses the New Institutional Economics Approach (NIE) and gives weight to institutional change through multiple case studies of textile and clothing clusters in Zhejiang province, East China. The micro case studies are effective in illustrating the interaction between institutional change and industrial development. My empirical research in Ningbo clothing cluster, Shaoxing synthetic fibre cluster, Yiwu stocking cluster in Zhejiang Province, China, demonstrates that the reaction to the globalization challenge may differ greatly even among industrial clusters specialized in the same industrial sector. No common and unidirectional development pattern has proved valid any more, and different paths have been followed to face the new competitive challenges posed by the global institutional change. Moreover, the scope and variety of inter-firm alliances are continuously expanding, in relation to the increasing internationalization of economic and innovative activities. The research has also shown that local state corporatism alone cannot explain the great success of textile and clothing clusters in China. The development and upgrading of textile and clothing clusters in China have witnessed the extraordinary institutional change through the co-evolution between the public sector and the private sector, which can be reflected through the interaction among social network, entrepreneurship and performance of local government. The dynamic change of public-private interface is one unique endogenous institutional arrangement embedded in the economic system in China.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates small remote island economies (SRIEs) —a unique {{grouping of}} countries {{that has not been}} addressed systematically in the economics literature. The rationale behind this categorisation lies in the interactions of smallness, islandness and remoteness. These interactions might exacerbate the problems face by these economies, and possibly create new opportunities for them. This study consists of four essays which address their most important economic issues. The first essay brings SRIEs into context by drawing from the existing literature. Economists and other social scientists acknowledge the economic challenges of smallness: limited scale economies, limited resource endowments, economic concentration, high economic openness and consequent vulnerability to external shocks. Many small countries are also islands: islandness contributes to economic volatility because it increases the risks associated with environmental hazards, climate change, and man-made and natural disasters. The new category SRIEs highlights a well-documented economic problem—remoteness. However, there is little research on the implications of remoteness for small island economies. This thesis addresses this gap in the literature and seeks to better inform policy. Many SRIEs were affected by the dismantling of the Multifibre Agreement (MFA). MFA quotas guaranteed that the <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> (T&C) <b>products</b> of SRIEs had accessed to developed markets and protected these small economies from competitive larger developing countries. The second essay adopts a novel methodology—network analysis—to investigate the impacts of the ensuing trade liberalisation in T&C on SRIEs. The MFA altered T&C trade patterns: in the post-quota period, SRIEs preferred to trade with closer partners, thus, supporting the hypothesis that remoteness matters. Network statistics demonstrate that liberalisation led to convergence. SRIEs had a relative comparative advantage in final rather than intermediate products. An analysis of trade specialisation patterns confirms that MFA quotas created artificial comparative advantages. The third essay analyses individual cases of SRIEs through a global value-chain framework. T&C global fragmentation of production was shaped by quotas. A distance effect on trade is revealed as trade with relatively remote partners declined post-MFA. The results of a unit-value analysis support the thesis that those SRIEs that survived moved up the value-chain or upgraded to maintain competitiveness. Upgrading involved shifting to higher-valued products and niche markets but also integrating regionally. The last essay provides an alternative explanation for the notion of remoteness, particularly when viewed from a tourism perspective. Scholars agree that nature attracts tourists. An exploratory analysis shows that SRIEs are well-endowed in nature. Indeed, the econometric results show that remoteness is positively associated with tourism performance. Price acts as a sorting factor signalling the high-value tourist to choose less competitive but remote destinations; destination choices, hence arrivals, are price-dependent. However, price is irrelevant for expenditure per tourist. In sum, the cost of remoteness can be offset by its value. Remote island tourism is proposed as a positional good.
