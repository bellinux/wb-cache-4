30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a great {{interest}} in production of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and transparent oxide semi-conductors for the development of photonic devices and transparent conducting electrodes (TCE) for solar cells [1]. One-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures are expected to provide functional components for future electronic, optoelectronic, and nano electromechanical systems [2]. The wide direct band gap (3.37  eV) and large exciton binding energy (~ 60  meV) make zinc oxide (ZnO) an excellent optoelectronic material [3]. ZnO-based nanostructure research has drawn considerable attention {{in the last few years}} as a multi-functional material due to its versatile properties like near UV and visible (green, blue and violet) emission, optical transparency, electrical conductivity, piezoelectricity and many other promising applications in electroacoustic transducers, gas sensors, <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>coating</b> materials, photovoltaic devices and optical solar cells [4]. ZnO has also been confirmed as a promising functional material in other nanodevices such as field emitters and gas sensors. The synthesis of ZnO nanostructures is thus currently attracting intense worldwide interest. Numerous ZnO nanostructures have been demonstrated, for example, nanowires, nanotubes, nanobelts, nanopropellers, and nanocages [3]. It manifests its applications, especially when approaching the nanoscale size, for example, in the form of one-dimensional nanowires/nanorods/nanotubes or two-dimensional nanoplates/nanosheets, which have been widely accepted as the building blocks for nanodevices. In view of this, controlled growth of nanostructures in terms of size, shape, and orientation is a prerequisite, and a large amount of intensive research has been conducted to prepare desired ZnO architectures [5]. Various techniques have been adopted to synthesize ZnO nanostructures such as vapor transport process or physical vapor deposition (PVD), metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), microwave plasma deposition, hydrothermal synthesis and electrochemical deposition [6].|$|E

This experiment gives a quantitative measure of the speed with which a film is able to switch between the two states i. e. the coloured and the bleached states. PProDOT-S films were switched at a voltage of 1 center dot 9 V with a switching speed of 2 s at lambda (max) of 565 nm and showed a contrast of similar to 37 %.

A 5. 0 % efficiency was reached with these type of cells {{which is more than}} 2. 5 times higher compared to previously reported devices with metal counter electrode and cobalt complex electrolyte. The electrochemical impedance spectra analysis showed that the best cells with the ferritic steel counter electrode had as low charge transfer resistance (3. 6 cm 2) as the reference glass cells with the same electrolyte. While in previous studies many metals have corroded in the cobalt complex electrolyte, the stability analysis including scanning electron microscope imaging of the aged electrodes suggested that the {{ferritic stainless steel}} substrates did not corrode in the electrolyte. Hence ferritic stainless steel appears as a possible alternative counter electrode in dye solar cells with cobalt electrolyte in terms of cost, performance and stability. © 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, thin films of CdSnSe have been {{developed}} on <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> oxide (TCO) <b>coated</b> glasses by electrolytic deposition. The controlled incorporation of Sn in the semiconducting layer have been achieved by varying the concentration of Sn 2 + from 5 to 22 g/l of SnCl 2 in the deposition bath. The semiconductor film grown on the glass substrate consisted of n-type CdSnSe semiconductor compounds (alloyed and/or mixed type) {{in the form of}} highly dispersed, spherically shaped polycrystallites as detected from X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

40|$|This {{work has}} focused on the design, {{construction}} and testing of a close space sublimation system for CdTe deposition. In addition, it also focused on variations to the treatment and fabrication procedures of the <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> oxide and CdS layers prior to the CdTe deposition, in order to influence the structure and electrical properties of the CdTe/CdS interface. CdTe was deposited by the physical vapour process, close space sublimation. The equipment used was custom built for this work and is therefore described in detail. Some of the deposition parameters of the equipment were varied in order to allow a comparison between the equipment in this work and those reported in the literature. Bilayers of CdS have been created by depositing two individual CdS layers, on top of one another, whilst also varying the annealing treatment of the first layer. These bilayers were included in devices and which subsequently underwent a series of etches to allow analysis of the materials. The bilayers were shown to effect the preferred orientation of the CdTe layer deposited on top, but the results suggested the bilayers had a negative effect on the amount of current recombination in the depletion region. The roughness of the <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> oxide <b>coated</b> glass substrates used in this work, was proposed as a way of influencing the roughness of the CdS layer deposited on top and therefore the roughness of the layer the CdTe is deposited on. It was proposed that the CdTe material deposited on a roughened substrate may have an increased grain size; no evidence for this was found for samples including CdS layers. A second phase of CdTe was observed and assigned to the presence of a CdSxTe 1 −x alloy. The sulphur content of the alloy was found to increase as the roughness of the substrate increased. CdS was deposited by the wet chemistry process chemical bath deposition. In situ monitoring of the deposition was carried out by studying the re ection of light from the interface {{at the end of an}} optical fibre placed within the solution. The results indicated that the in situ monitoring was sensitive to the initial deposition but the sensitivity reduced as the film thickness approached 150 nm. The in situ monitoring technique and ellipsometry measurements of the CdS showed good agreement with the theory of two deposition mechanisms occurring during the deposition. The results showed that CdS grown by chemical bath deposition has a two layer structure consistent with; a low density CdS grown by homogeneous deposition, on top of dense CdS grown by ion by ion deposition. An ellipsometry model for the CdS and CdTe layers is presented, along with its optical properties over the wavelength range 245 to 1690 nm.

Revenue of the display-related industries is estimated to be about 2. 9 billion U. S. dollars in 2012. There are many well-known <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> materials, but most of them are n-type binary oxide. The development of p-type <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> material is an important issue for the optoelectronic semiconducting p-n junction-based devices, such as diodes, transistors, and light-emitting diodes. The study of p-type TCC based on multi-element oxide and oxynitride is still rather limited. It is, therefore, of great interest to explore and tailor the multi-element nitride, oxide, and oxynitride thin films for the advanced applications. This research is a three-year project. It focuses on the development and advanced applications of novel multi-element nitride, oxide, and oxynitride thin films upon high-entropy effect. The high-entropy <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> films are to be synthesized by a magnetron sputtering system. A systematic study is carried out to investigate the microstructure, chemistry, physical, optoelectronic and thermal stability properties of the films. In the first year, we will study the four-element CuZnSnAl alloy nitride and oxide thin films. The second year will focus on the oxynitride films of four-element CuZnSnAl alloy. We will synthesize oxynitride films of the multi-element CuZnSnAl-based alloy with different dopants in the last year. The content of this research includes manipulating the process variables to control its microstructure, physical, and optoelectronic properties, and thermal stability as well. We will collaborate with other subprojects and colleagues to apply the high-entropy <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> films developed in our group to touch panels, solar cells and light emitting devices, if feasible. Over the past several years, my research group has accumulated many precious experiences and fruitful outcomes in preparing and analyzing n-type <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> thin films and multi-element TiVCr-based alloy films. Moreover, the preliminary results on p-type multi-element <b>transparent</b> <b>conducting</b> oxide films are very encouraging and promising. We believe that this project shall have a pertinent impact on both materials technology and optoelectronic industry. 透明導電化合物(Transparent Conducting Compound, TCC) 是一種兼具透光性與導電性的特殊材料，在顯示器產業上扮演非常重要的角色，例如液晶顯示器陣列與彩色濾光片，以及觸控面板所使用的ITO玻璃與光學膜。近年來iPhone等觸控手機引領潮流，加上 2009 年問世的微軟Windows 7 系統，推升高科技產業對觸控面板的需求，外加太陽能電池產業的蓬勃發展，TCC的用途越來越廣泛，其在光電產業上的重要性與日俱增，預估在 2012 年TCC產值將成長到 2. 9 億美元。惟傳統的透明導電材料多為n-type二元氧化物(Transparent Conducting Oxide, TCO) ，光電性質與應用範圍有其侷限性。為發展新型光電半導體元件，開發p-type透明導電材料己成為未來材料技術發展的重要課題。以目前文獻所載，p-type透明導電材料皆為多元合金氧化物或氮氧化物，有鑑於此，開發具有透明導電特性的多元高熵合金氮化物、氧化物或氮氧化物，是值得嘗試且有發展潛力的領域。本計畫研究重點為多元高熵合金透明導電膜薄膜的開發與應用，在薄膜製備方面將採用磁控濺鍍(Magnetron Sputtering) 法，透過製程參數調變與理論計算，找出各種高熵合金氮、氧化物薄膜的最佳製程條件，並深入探討薄膜微結構、化學成分以及其製程條件對物理、化學、光學、電學及穩定性等的影響，做一系統性的研究。計畫分三年進行，第一年研究之材料系統為四元的CuZnSnAl合金氮化物及氧化物薄膜；第二年為四元的CuZnSnAl合金氮氧化物薄膜；第三年為CuZnSnAl為基本架構之多元高熵合金氮氧化物薄膜。研究過程除探討改變製程參數對微結構與光電性質的關聯之外，擬結合光電元件製作專長之研究團隊，進一步了解該薄膜使用於觸控面板、太陽電池及發光元件等的可行性。本研究團隊已有多年從事薄膜製程、分析與應用研究的經驗，在n-type透明導電薄膜和TiVCr為基本架構的多元高熵合金薄膜的研究，累積豐富經驗並獲得豐碩研究成果；在開發p-type多元高熵透明導電薄膜方面，也已獲得相當令人鼓舞的初步結果，相信透過本計畫的執行，有系統的針對CuZnSnAl為基本架構的多元高熵合金氮氧化物薄膜進行研究，一定可以獲得很好的成果，推動材料科技術的進步，為發展新型光電半導體元件做出重要貢獻...|$|R
