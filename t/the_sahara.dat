5|$|In {{the week}} before the 2011 Indian Grand Prix, Force India {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Group had purchased a 42.5% stake in the team, valued at US$100million. The investment gave <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Group and team principal Vijay Mallya an equal stake in the team, with team director Michiel Mol controlling the remaining 15% of the team. Under the terms of the sale, <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Group became Force India's naming-rights sponsor. Mercedes GP also changed the name of their team, announcing that they were to become known as Mercedes AMG. The new name originates from AMG, Mercedes-Benz's performance and luxury road car brand.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for generating solar energy from <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert is huge, the highest {{found on the}} globe. Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. <b>The</b> <b>Sahara</b> receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. <b>The</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17weeks. Photography {{then moved to}} <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> desert outside {{the small town of}} Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before {{completion}} of shooting on August 29, 1998. The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E

5|$|Ronald Victor Courtenay Bodley, MC (3 March 1892– 26 May 1970) was a British Army officer, {{author and}} journalist. Born to English parents in Paris, {{he lived in}} France until he was nine, before {{attending}} Eton College and then the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and served with them during the First World War. After the war he spent seven years in <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> desert, and then travelled through Asia. Bodley wrote several books about his travels. He was considered among the most distinguished British writers on <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> {{as well as one}} of the main western sources of information on the South Pacific Mandate.|$|E
50|$|The Garamantes were a Berber {{people living}} in the Fezzan in <b>the</b> northeastern <b>Sahara</b> Desert, {{originating}} from <b>the</b> <b>Sahara's</b> Tibesti region.

5000|$|The Army of Liberation (Berber: Aserdas n Uslelli, جيش التحرير) was a force {{fighting}} for the independence of Morocco.

5|$|Although {{the role}} of the camel is {{diminishing}} with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas. The dromedary has been used in warfare since the 2nd century BC, and it remains popular for racing, particularly in the Arab world. Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.|$|E
5|$|Elephants, lions, buffalo, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, giraffes, antelopes, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, {{and many}} species of snakes are found here, {{although}} most large carnivore populations have been drastically reduced since the early 20th century.

5|$|Encouraged by a friend, {{she went}} to Paris to become a writer but had little success. While in Paris Eberhardt met the widow of Marquis de Morès. Although deMorès was {{reportedly}} murdered by Tuareg tribesmen in <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> {{no one had been}} arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt was familiar with the area where deMorès died, she hired her to investigate his murder. The job benefited Eberhardt, who was destitute and longed to return to <b>the</b> <b>Sahara.</b> She returned to Algeria in July 1900, settling in El Oued. According to Sahara expert R. V. C. Bodley, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate deMorès' death; Bodley considered this due to a combination of the unwillingness of the French to co-operate in an investigation and Eberhardt's fatalism rather than deliberate dishonesty. Word eventually got back to the deMorès widow about Eberhardt's lackluster investigation, and she subsequently cut off her funding.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted {{seventeen}} weeks; {{the crew had}} to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in <b>the</b> <b>Sahara.</b> The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.|$|E
5|$|Iguanodon was {{recorded}} from Africa based on teeth from Tunisia {{and elsewhere in}} <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> but the description of Lurdusaurus and Ouranosaurus cast doubt on African records of Iguanodon. The genus was also recorded from Mongolia based on the description of I. orientalis, and in North America based on I. ottingeri from Utah. Another North American species, from South Dakota, once assigned to Iguanodon as I. lakotaensis, has since been reclassified as the genus Dakotadon.|$|E

5|$|Pale {{crag martin}} pairs often nest alone, {{especially}} in <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form.

Two broods are common, and three {{have been raised}} in a season.|$|E
5|$|People have {{struggled}} to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil {{and is one of}} the causes of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across <b>the</b> <b>Sahara.</b> Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.|$|E
