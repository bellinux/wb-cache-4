500|$|During {{the time}} that Saint-Just {{was working on the}} constitution, {{dramatic}} political warfare was taking place. The sans-culottes – deemed [...] "the people" [...] by many radicals, and represented by the Paris Commune – had grown antipathetic to the moderate Girondins and on 2 June 1793, in a mass action supported by National Guardsmen, they surrounded the Convention and exacted the arrest of the Girondin deputies. The deputies – even the Montagnards, who had long enjoyed an informal alliance with the sans-culottes – resented the intimidation but they were compelled to make some obeisance. The Girondin leader Jacques Pierre Brissot was indicted for treason and scheduled for trial, but the other Brissotins were imprisoned (or pursued) without formal charges. The Convention debated their fate and the political disorder lasted for weeks. Saint-Just had previously remained silent about the Girondins, but now clearly stood with Robespierre who had been thoroughly opposed to most of <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> When the initial indictment by the Committee was served, it was Saint-Just who delivered the report to the Convention.|$|E

2500|$|Social sharing {{behaviors}} incite a socio-affective dynamic {{between the}} involved persons {{and according to}} several studies, may produce interpersonal benefits, and this can result in further social integration. Humans have long been aware of such processes, and have been using and even exploiting <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> [...] A particularly prominent example of such purposeful collective social sharing is the celebration or commemoration of collective events (such as war victories and defeats or natural disasters), ceremonies, symbols, symbolic characters or stories, etc. [...] According to Frijda, such collective instances of social sharing are created for similar reasons to those for individual instances; the event has not been fully integrated {{into the lives of}} the participants. For collective social sharing, this may mean that the emotions elicited by the event are reactivated in the people who actually experienced the event, or that the emotional event is being reproduced for successive generations who did not actually experience the event because the event represents an important memory of the group. Following this idea, the collective rituals and symbols are linkened to conventional social sharing situations, which both cause a reactivation of the emotions that were lived or relived.|$|E

In doing this they consider that they are acting piously and are clad in garments pleasing to God. But if they take my advice let them sell those clothes and honour the living image of God. Do not picture Christ on your garments. It is enough that he once suffered the humiliation of dwelling in a human body which of his own accord he assumed for our sakes. So, not upon your robes but upon your soul carry about his image.|$|E

2500|$|During the 19th {{century the}} area across Latium, Umbria and Tuscany marked the {{southern}} border of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and, since 1861 the Kingdom of Italy and the States of the Church. The area included woodlands such as Selva del Lamone and Monti di Castro, with isolated caves and small rivers out of the main roads. Several brigands used to live here. One of the latest brigands of northern Latium, in action {{at the end of}} the 19th century when the area became part of the Kingdom of Italy, was Fortunato Ansuini. He was as cruel as anybody else. The most influential brigand of the zone was Domenico Tiburzi, who was called Domenichino, and was known as the King of Lamone, or the Robin Hood of Maremma. He always refused to come into alliance with Ansuini because he considered him no more than a common outlaw. Born at Norcia in 1844 from a family of farmers, Ansuini was forced by parents to work as a stonemason. He killed a man in a tavern and was sentenced to 11 years in prison in Rome. In May 1866, together with three jail-mates, he escaped through a drain. The fugitives left Rome and chose Maremma as a secure place for their furtiveness. Here, their new life had a start, made of robberies and racketeering to get weapons, bullets, and money. The gendarmes were on their traces and forced them to continuously move from one place to another, without capturing <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> The soldiers could identify them with the help of a spy, and caught them while banqueting inside a cave. The outlaws surrendered soon.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{surviving}} examples {{were not used}} for clothes and feature very large woven or embroidered designs.

Some examples show very large designs being used for clothing by the great - two enormous embroidered lions killing camels occupy the whole of the Coronation cloak of Roger II in Vienna, produced in Palermo about 1134 in the workshops the Byzantines had established there. [...] A sermon by Saint Asterius of Amasia, {{from the end of the}} 5th century, gives details of imagery on the clothes of the rich (which he strongly condemns):When, therefore, they dress themselves and appear in public, they look like pictured walls in the eyes of those that meet them.
