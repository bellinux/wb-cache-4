5|$|In October 2017, it was {{reported}} that a flaw in a code library developed by Infineon, which had been in widespread use in security products such as smartcards and TPMs, enabled private keys to be inferred from public keys. This could allow an attacker to bypass BitLocker encryption when an affected TPM chip is used. Microsoft released an updated version of the firmware for Infineon TPM chips that fixes <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> via Windows Update.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not known}} when Marshall began {{studying}} law, nor who his tutor was, he was practicing as early as 1785. In that year, he discovered a flaw in the original 1774 survey of the town of Frankfort. Due to <b>the</b> <b>flaw,</b> several choice acres of land {{in the northern part of}} Frankfort remained unclaimed, and Marshall quickly entered claims for them at the land office. Marshall also gained membership in the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge, a Danville-based society dedicated to disseminating information to farmers, mechanics, and other common citizens. He apparently was not accepted for membership in the Danville Political Club, although some sources report that he was accepted as a member after initially being rejected.|$|E

5|$|Work {{began in}} about 1735 and {{continued}} until Dashwood's death in 1781, when the older {{house had been}} transformed inside and out. The long building time partly explains the flaws and variations in design: when building commenced, Palladianism was the height of fashion, {{but by the time}} of its completion, Palladianism had been succeeded by Neoclassicism; thus, the house is a marriage of both styles. While the marriage is not completely unhappy, the Palladian features are marred by the lack of Palladio's proportions: the east portico is asymmetrical with the axis of the house, and trees were planted either side to draw the eye away from <b>the</b> <b>flaw.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flaw</b> in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} {{data were}} obtained from three point bend fracture toughness specimens of 12 -nickel maraging steel, and two pressure vessels of the same material. One of the pressure vessels contained a prefabricated flaw which was extended and sharpened by fatigue cycling. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>flawed</b> vessel had similar characteristics to the fracture specimens, thereby allowing estimates {{to be made of}} its nearness to failure during a proof test. Both <b>the</b> <b>flawed</b> and unflawed pressure vessel survived the proof pressure and 5 cycles to the working pressure, but it was apparent from the acoustic emission response during the proof cycle and the 5 cycles to the working pressure that <b>the</b> <b>flawed</b> vessel was very near failure. <b>The</b> <b>flawed</b> vessel did not survive a second cycle to the proof pressure before failure due to <b>flaw</b> extension through <b>the</b> wall (causing a leak) ...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flaw</b> in the Chinese {{plan was}} a lack of {{accurate}} intelligence about the UN forces. Even though the US X Corps was stretched thin over northeast Korea, the slow Marine advance allowed the bulk of the US 1st Marine Division, including the 5th, 7th and 11th Marines, to be concentrated at Yudami-ni. Furthermore, the strategically important Hagaru-ri, which contained an airfield and a supply dump, was not a priority for the Chinese despite being lightly defended by the 1st and the 7th Marines. Only the Regimental Combat Team 31, an understrength and hastily formed regimental combat team of the US 7th Infantry Division, was thinly spread along the eastern bank of the reservoir. Those units would later take the brunt of the Chinese assaults. As for the UN forces, the 1st Marine Division had an effective strength of 25,473 men {{at the start of the}} battle, and it was further reinforced by the British 41 Royal Marine Commando. and the equivalent of two regiments from the 3rd and the 7th Army Infantry Divisions. The UN forces had a combined strength of about 30,000 men during the course of the battle. The UN forces at Chosin were also supported by one of the greatest concentrations of air power during the Korean War, since the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing stationed at Yonpo Airfield and five aircraft carriers from the US Navy Task Force 77 were able to launch 230 sorties daily to provide close air support during the battle, while the US Air Force Far East Combat Cargo Command in Japan reached the capacity of airdropping 250 tons of supplies per day to resupply the trapped UN forces.|$|E

25|$|Before launch, {{testing of}} the {{assembled}} spacecraft uncovered a potential data corruption problem with an interface card {{that was designed to}} route MARDI image data as well as data from various other parts of the spacecraft.

This was judged to be an unacceptable risk, and it was decided to not use MARDI during the mission.
