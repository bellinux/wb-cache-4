5|$|Few zoos hold termites, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} in keeping them captive and to the reluctance of authorities to permit potential pests. One of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving Macrotermes bellicosus populations– resulting in an event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying termites. This happened in September 2008, when thousands of male termites left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.|$|E
5|$|Fort Smith {{was chosen}} to house the civil service because of its {{geographical}} location and state of development. The community was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> had steamboat service from the railheads in Alberta {{and access to the}} vast waterways in the territory. The community was the easiest for the government to access, and the most well developed community, closest to Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Mass escapes were rare. One of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> succeeded {{took place}} on 2October 1961, when 53people from the border village of Böseckendorf– {{a quarter of the}} village's population– escaped en masse, {{followed}} by another 13inhabitants in February 1963. An unusual mass escape occurred in September 1964 when 14East Germans, including 11 children, were smuggled across the border in a refrigerated truck. They were able to escape detection by being concealed under the carcasses of slaughtered pigs being transported to the West.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament {{is based}} in three {{different}} cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in Strasbourg (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in Brussels. Luxembourg hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is the only assembly {{in the world with}} more than one meeting place and one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> does not have the power to decide its own location.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistance}} was alerted {{to carry out}} these tasks by messages personnels transmitted by the BBC's French service from London. Several hundred of these messages, which might be snatches of poetry, quotations from literature, or random sentences, were regularly transmitted, masking <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> were actually significant. In the weeks preceding the landings, lists of messages and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups. An increase in radio activity on 5 June was correctly interpreted by German intelligence to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway. However, because of the barrage of previous false warnings and misinformation, most units ignored the warning.|$|E
5|$|Adam Berry, the show's {{original}} score composer, used {{sound synthesis}} to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as leitmotifs for the show's establishing shots. After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original {{music for the}} next seven seasons. Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer. Dunlap's contributions to the show are one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.|$|E

5|$|From December 12, 1994, to January 2000, the PGSO did not hire any new deputies or {{civilian}} employees, {{leaving the}} agency with 92 vacant positions {{that needed to}} be filled. Over that period, 66 deputies left the agency, some retiring routinely, others leaving due to increased workloads caused by vacant positions. In some cases, deputies worked sixteen hours in one day, eight in courtrooms, and eight serving warrants. In December 1994, the agency had 248 deputies, whereas on January 20, 2000, it only had 192 deputies, with 20 leaving from November 1998 to January 2000. In July 1996, the county government decreased the amount of funding the PGSO was receiving. Unlike the PGPD at the time, the PGSO was not nationally accredited and still is not, as of January 2015. Computers were also in short supply, and <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> were in use were outdated and obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Grinsell {{was born}} in London on 14 February 1907. With his family, he moved to Brighton shortly after the First World War. There, his {{interest}} in archaeology was encouraged by H. S. Toms, the curator of Brighton Museum who had formerly been an assistant to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. Moving back to London, in 1925 Grinsell became a clerk for Barclays Bank. Although he had developed his interest in prehistory through an examination of stone tools, he came to focus his attention on barrows, recognising that these were among the least well understood prehistoric monuments in the British landscape and one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> could be studied from the position of an amateur. At the time, a number of antiquarians were still active in southern England, with Grinsell being encouraged in his interests by prominent figures in this milieu such as Eliot Curwen and Hadrian Allcroft.|$|E
5|$|Most Stylidium species {{tend to be}} hardy {{species and}} can be easily {{cultivated}} in greenhouses or gardens. They are drought resistant, hardy to cold weather, and the species diversity in this genus gives gardeners {{a wide variety of}} choices. Most species that are native to Western Australia will be cold hardy to at least -1 to -2°C. <b>The</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> can be found all over Australia, like S. graminifolium, will tolerate a wider range of habitat since their native ranges includes a great diversity of ecoregions. Some species of triggerplants are suitable for cultivation outdoors outside of the Australian continent including most of the United Kingdom and as far north as New York City or Seattle in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>that</b> I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E
