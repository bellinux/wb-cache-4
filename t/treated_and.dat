5|$|In the 20th century, many {{individuals}} with Down syndrome were institutionalized, {{few of the}} associated medical problems were <b>treated,</b> <b>and</b> most died in infancy or early adult life.

5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat <b>treated</b> <b>and</b> welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler {{crabs and}} shrimp, among the {{mangroves}} also occupy a significant {{place in the}} local economy. While {{a large number of}} shrimp species inhabit the Senegambian area, a single family exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed {{the extent to which the}} shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which <b>treated</b> <b>and</b> exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|During the interregnum, Hippesley {{initially}} {{continued as}} captain of Sandgate, {{until he was}} replaced in 1653, resulting in complaints from {{him that he had}} been unfairly <b>treated</b> <b>and</b> that he was owed money by Parliament. During this period the garrison was increased to include a governor, two corporals, twenty soldiers and three gunners. When Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, Sandgate and the other Device Forts initially remained {{at the heart of the}} south coast defences, but by now their design was antiquated. The garrison was cut back to its pre-war levels, and then reduced further in 1682 to only ten men. Sandgate had fallen into a poor condition, and £200 was assigned in 1663 for the repair of the castle, to be met partially from the proceeds of lands around Sandgate confiscated from former supporters of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is <b>treated</b> <b>and</b> reused in the boilers.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are <b>treated</b> <b>and</b> whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is <b>treated</b> <b>and</b> survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E

His mother and Theoktistos both underestimated the young emperor's desire to free himself from their custodianship, and antagonized him further when they arranged a bride show and selected Eudokia Dekapolitissa as his bride, disregarding Michael's attachment to his mistress, Eudokia Ingerina. Theodora's brother Bardas {{was able to}} use Michael's resentment for the high-handed manner in which he was <b>treated</b> <b>and</b> began to turn him against the regency. With Michael's backing, Bardas was allowed to return to the capital, and on 20 November 855, Theoktistos was murdered.

5|$|On 14 June 1952, Bleak {{was part}} of a patrol of the 2nd Battalion, 223rd Infantry, sent north to probe Chinese forward {{positions}} and attempt to obtain Chinese prisoners of war for interrogation. Bleak volunteered to accompany the 20-man patrol of an I Platoon on this mission, which was to send them to a sparsely vegetated feature called Hill 499, where Chinese forces were known to be operating. The patrol left United Nations lines at 04:30 Korea Standard Time on 14 June, under cover of darkness. It was preceded by an attack by F Company, 223rd Infantry, to the west which was intended to distract Chinese forces. However, as the patrol ascended the hill, it came under heavy Chinese automatic weapons fire which struck the lead elements, injuring several soldiers. Bleak, {{at the rear of the}} formation, rushed forward and <b>treated</b> <b>and</b> stabilized several soldiers hit in the initial volley, then followed the remainder of the patrol as it continued its mission.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November, the Croatian Serb TO and the SDG arrested ethnic Hungarian and Croat {{civilians in}} Erdut {{as well as}} in the nearby villages of Dalj Planina and Erdut Planina, and {{detained}} them in the SDG training camp.

Five more non-Serb civilians were arrested by the Croatian Serb TO and the SDG in the village of Klisa on 11 November, one in Bijelo Brdo and one in Dalj, and taken to Erdut for interrogation. Two of the seven had Serb relatives and were released, while the remaining five were brutally <b>treated,</b> <b>and</b> were killed and buried in a mass grave in Ćelije after being interrogated.
