40|$|This {{report is}} the fifth of a series {{presenting}} the results of strength tests of thin-walled cylinders and truncated cones of circular and elliptic section; it includes the results obtained from torsion <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> 30 cylinders, pure bending <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> 30 cylinders, and combined transverse shear and bending <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> 60 cylinders. All the cylinders tested were elliptic section with the ends clamped to rigid bulkheads. In the pure bending and combined transverse shear and bending tests the loads were applied in {{the plane of the}} major axis. The results of the <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> elliptic cylinders are correlated with the results of corresponding <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> circular cylinders and are presented in charts suitable for use in design...|$|R

5|$|As a team, the Australians {{were greeted}} by record crowds and gate {{receipts}} across the country, even when wet weather curtailed the matches. The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times, in the Second Test at Lord's, the Third Test at Old Trafford, and the Fourth Test at Headingley.

5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this <b>test</b> <b>on</b> every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd wrote {{a letter}} to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning him that the Germans might be researching the {{development}} of atomic weaponry and that it was necessary that the United States fund research and development of its own such project. Roosevelt agreed, and the result was the Manhattan Project—a top-secret research program administered by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. The first bomb was tested successfully in the Trinity nuclear <b>test</b> <b>on</b> July 16, 1945.|$|E

All three tests can be easily implemented through a nonlinear least squares procedure. Simulation results show that, in terms of finite sample performance, the LM <b>test</b> based <b>on</b> expected information is the best, followed by the LM <b>test</b> based <b>on</b> Hessian and then the LM <b>test</b> based <b>on</b> gradient. The LM <b>test</b> based <b>on</b> gradient can perform rather poorly. An example is given for illustration...|$|R
