5|$|In the Lego toyline Bionicle series, the Visorak horde is {{a species}} {{consisting}} of six spider-like breeds. They {{are created by}} the Brotherhood of Makuta to conquer islands; they possess mutagenic venom and spin sticky green webs. In the Transformers franchise, Tarantulas and Blackarachnia are both Predacons <b>that</b> <b>turn</b> into giant spiders. Blackarachnia, being part biological, has venom that paralyzes other Transformers and she is capable of spinning webs.|$|E

Eventually, Ross concludes {{that he is}} not on Earth, but is on the unknown planet – a Counter-Earth that is a mirror image of his. Signs of this reversal include a clock whose hands move anticlockwise, a tape deck's reels <b>that</b> <b>turn</b> clockwise and an oscilloscope that scans from right to left.|$|E

5|$|Business Loop Interstate 75, or BL I-75 is a {{business}} loop running through Gaylord. The loop starts at exit279 on I-75 in Bagley Township south of Gaylord. The highway follows the five-lane Otsego Avenue northward from the freeway into the city and though a commercial area. Otsego Avenue jogs eastward slightly south of 2nd Street, and then intersects M-32 (Main Street) in downtown Gaylord. BL I-75 turns west onto the five-lane Main Street and runs concurrently with M-32 through downtown. About five blocks each of <b>that</b> <b>turn,</b> BL I-75/M-32 meets I-75 at exit282; BL I-75 ends while M-32 continues westward. On average each day in 2013, 8,289vehicles use the business loop south of the M-32 junction, and 23,436vehicles do so in downtown Gaylord along the M-32 concurrency, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal batons and clubs <b>that</b> <b>turn</b> into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} <b>that</b> <b>turn,</b> a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
25|$|The George Washington Bridge is {{notorious for}} traffic jams during rush hour, {{as are the}} {{highways}} connected to it, including the Trans-Manhattan Expressway <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> into the Cross Bronx Expressway to the east, the Harlem River Drive <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> into the FDR Drive, the Henry Hudson Parkway <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> into West Side Highway to the south, and the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87) in the Bronx {{at the other side}} of the Harlem River at its interchange with I-95. The western approaches in New Jersey are also slow, specifically I-95, US 1-9, and 46 (merged before the bridge), Route 4, and the Palisades Parkway.|$|R

5|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the track on 22 February 2010 after {{bobsleigh}} four-man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary practice. Following a meeting with 11 team captains, practice runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape of turn 11 so it would be easier for sleds to get {{through the rest of the}} track without crashing. FIBT spokesman Don Krone also stated that it was common <b>that</b> <b>turn</b> profiles were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines such as luge and skeleton.|$|E
5|$|SR202 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with SR522 northwest of downtown Woodinville {{and east of}} the I-405 interchange. The highway travels south on 131st Avenue NE, crossing under a railroad overpass, before turning west onto NE 175th Street. SR202 then crosses a railroad grade crossing and bridges the Sammamish River, before turning south onto Redmond–Woodinville Road. The highway travels south along {{the west side of}} the Sammamish River valley into Woodinville wine country, a district of wineries and tasting rooms south of Woodinville. SR202 turns east onto NE 145th Street and crosses over the Sammamish River, and then enters the first in a series of three roundabouts <b>that</b> <b>turn</b> the highway southward.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in <b>that</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make <b>that</b> <b>turn,</b> but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let it hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into her ear for the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
5|$|The edible Coprinellus bisporus {{is nearly}} {{identical}} but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per basidium. The scaly inky cap (Coprinus variegatus = Coprinus quadrifidus) has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap (Coprinellus disseminatus, edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills <b>that</b> <b>turn</b> black {{but do not}} dissolve away; it always grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood). Coprinus atramentarius is a larger, gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on the cap, and the cap and gills dissolve at maturity. Coprinellus radians develops singly or in clumps from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange mycelium on the wood. Coprinellus truncorum is also covered with glistening granules and {{is said to be}} almost indistinguishable from C.micaceus in the field; microscopy is needed to tell the difference, as C.truncorum has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of C.micaceus. One study suggests that compared to C.truncorum, C.micaceus is browner {{in the center of the}} cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more molecular evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Gymnopilus, {{it is located}} in the {{subgenus}} Gymnopilus and section Macrospori. The subgenus Gymnopilus was proposed by Henri Romagnesi as Cortinatae (while the genus was known as Fulvidula) in 1942, though the name Gymnopilus was given later by Rolf Singer. The subgenus is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no veils, or veils that do not form rings. The section Macrospori, proposed by Guzmán-Dávalos in 1995, is made up of large-spored species with ringless mushrooms. Molecular analysis revealed that G.maritimus forms a sister group to (that is, shares an immediate common ancestor with) the spectabilis–imperialis clade, a clade that includes G.imperialis, G.spectabilis, G.junonius (often considered synonymous with G.spectabilis), G.pampeanus, and others. G. maritimus forms a more inclusive clade along with the members of spectabilis–imperialis; while it produces the smallest fruit bodies, it shares with the other members strong, sturdy mushrooms, caps with fibrils (sometimes with scales) and large, warty spores <b>that</b> <b>turn</b> red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine.|$|E
