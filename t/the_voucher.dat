25|$|The Artistic Freedom Voucher (AFV) {{introduced}} by Dean Baker {{is a way}} for consumers to support “creative and artistic work.” In this system, each consumer would have a refundable tax credit of $100 to give to any artist of creative work. To restrict fraud, the artists must register with the government. <b>The</b> <b>voucher</b> prohibits any artist that receives the benefits from copyrighting their material for a certain length of time.

25|$|Two {{distinct}} premium {{support systems}} {{have recently been}} proposed in Congress to control the cost of Medicare. The House Republicans’ 2012 budget would have abolished traditional Medicare and required the eligible population to purchase private insurance with a newly created premium support program. This plan would have cut the cost of Medicare by capping the value of <b>the</b> <b>voucher</b> and tying its growth to inflation, {{which is expected to}} be lower than rising health costs, saving roughly $155 billion over 10 years. Paul Ryan, the plan’s author, claimed that competition would drive down costs, but the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the plan would dramatically raise the cost of health care, with all of the additional costs falling on enrollees. The CBO found that under the plan, typical 65-year-olds would go from paying 35 percent of their health care costs to paying 68 percent by 2030.|$|E

500|$|Obama {{initially}} viewed Ryan as a Republican {{who could}} help cut the federal deficit. In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a [...] "serious proposal" [...] finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying [...] "some ideas in there ... that I would agree with, {{but there are some}} ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's [...] "Roadmap" [...] with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had [...] "some potential" [...] to make healthcare prices [...] "more sustainable," [...] he was more [...] "confident" [...] in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a [...] "fraud" [...] saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and [...] "dismantling Medicare as we know it" [...] by suggesting <b>the</b> <b>voucher</b> system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that [...] "Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate." ...|$|E

Clear links existed between the dismal performances and the policies that the IMF had advocated, such as <b>the</b> <b>voucher</b> privatization schemes and excessive monetary stringency.

2500|$|Although Paul {{supports}} {{the right of}} state and local school districts, under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, to implement education voucher plans, he rejects federal government-controlled school voucher plans, preferring federal education tax credits instead. He regards federal voucher programs as a form of [...] "taxpayer-funded welfare" [...] in which money is taken from middle-class families to unfairly provide private-school educations to a particular group of children favored by politicians and bureaucrats. He also worries that with federal school vouchers inevitably come further central government regulation and loss of local control over education. Private, religious schools, for instance, would feel pressured to conform to government dictates in order to become accredited by the Department of Education to qualify for participation in <b>the</b> <b>voucher</b> program. He points to how the federal government has used the threat of cutting off funding to dictate to universities which policies they must accept; he argues that the government would try to do the same with private schools.|$|E
2500|$|Boots UK began {{planning}} a loyalty card in November 1993, but building a CRM-focussed loyalty program. With {{an investment in}} excess of 30 million GBP, the Boots Advantage Card, launched in 1997, is the largest smart card retail loyalty card scheme in the world, and the third-largest retail loyalty scheme in the UK in terms of cards issued. The Advantage scheme has 16.4 million cardholders using the card online and in store and at 3rd party retailers. [...] The scheme gives a cardholder four points for every pound spent in a Boots store under normal shopping circumstances. [...] Most stores have kiosks {{which can be used}} in conjunction with the cards for [...] "exclusive offers" [...] which are printed on vouchers and can be used at the till. [...] These vouchers enable money off specific purchases, extra points for specific purchases, or money off or extra points when spending has reached an amount specified on <b>the</b> <b>voucher,</b> or other offers such as double points on either everything of specific products. [...] For example, a customer may get a voucher which provides 250 extra points when they have spent £50 in one transaction. [...] Points equal pence in store, and can be spent at any time and on anything in store, providing the card has enough points to cover the entire cost of the merchandise. The kiosk system was replaced with the Boots App in 2014, where customers can automatically load offers on to their Advantage Card straight from their smartphone.|$|E
2500|$|The Madonna {{remained}} in Essen throughout World War I but was again evacuated in its aftermath. After the communist revolt in the Ruhr {{area in the}} spring of 1920, the authorities of St. Johannes parish, fearing another uprising, decided to hide the statue in a safe place that would be unknown even to its own priest so as to prevent discovery by treason or extortion. A goldsmith from Aachen was assigned to find a hiding place, and he finally negotiated with another German diocese that the Madonna {{and the rest of the}} Essen treasure was to be concealed in a place that only the goldsmith and a designated guardian would know about: even the bishop was only informed about the general plan, but not about the exact location of the sanctuary. A document detailing the whereabouts was deposited in a Dutch diocese in case the middleman was killed. The plan worked so well that to this day it is unknown where exactly the treasure was hidden at that time. The only certainty is that it was packed in shabby cardboard suitcases and taken to some place in the Diocese of Hildesheim. <b>The</b> <b>voucher</b> deposited in the Netherlands was destroyed after the treasure was finally brought back to Essen in 1925 when the political situation seemed stable. In the summer of 1925 the goldsmith from Aachen and his son retrieved the treasure from its sanctuary and brought it back to Essen, travelling in a fourth-class Reichsbahn carriage and carrying the treasure inconspicuously as hand luggage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{biggest issue}} of Chavous' third term was school {{vouchers}}. [...] Chavous had opposed vouchers in the past, but by February 2003, The Washington Post reported, Chavous {{was much more}} interested in providing ways to given parents a choice in whether to send their child to public school, private school, or charter school. Chavous and Mayor Williams met with Secretary of Education Rod Paige on February 6, 2003, to discuss vouchers and other [...] "choice" [...] programs, during which time Paige pledged a voucher program would not be forced on the city. After the meeting, Chavous said he had not yet decided if he would support vouchers or not. Chavous then began to significantly moderate his criticism of Williams. By March 31, Chavous said that he had come to support vouchers, but only if the program were not forced on the city and only if federal (not city) funds were used to finance the program. On February 8, 2003, President George W. Bush announced that he would seek federal legislation to impose a school voucher program on the city. As Bush's proposal was considered by the House of Representatives, Chavous and D.C.'s Delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton (a strong opponent of vouchers), blamed one another for a series of snubs, missed meetings, and attacks. By the time the measure moved to the Senate in September, Chavous (along with Mayor Williams and Board President Cafritz) was opposed on <b>the</b> <b>voucher</b> issue by a significant majority of elected officials in the city. The Senate passed the school voucher bill on January 23, 2004, and President Bush signed it into law. [...] The legislation provided for a temporary, five-year experiment under which 1,700 low-income students would received up to $7,500 a year so that they could attend a private school in the city or nearby jurisdictions.
