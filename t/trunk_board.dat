50|$|The A-series adapter {{was later}} supplanted by the DX adapter, which was microprocessor-based, and could contain a {{selection}} of device cards, <b>trunk</b> <b>boards,</b> link boards, as well as LAN and WAN cards including Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, or an IP router board for IP communication, in a chassis of up to 16 slots. As it could contain more than one device interface board, it could handle inter-device communication without resort to the Hyperchannel trunk, which was only retained for communication with legacy equipment.|$|R
50|$|Callaway succeeded D. W. Caldwell as {{president}} of the Nickel Plate Road in 1895. It was about this time that Callaway was also offered the position of president for the Grand Trunk system he had recently left; he declined this position based on his feeling {{that he would not be}} allowed the autonomy that he wanted from the Grand <b>Trunk's</b> <b>board</b> of directors. Callaway was succeeded {{as president}} of the Nickel Plate Road by W. H. Canniff in 1897. Callaway then succeeded D. W. Caldwell {{as president of}} the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad in 1897.|$|R

50|$|Captain McConnell {{testified that}} he had seized a <b>trunk</b> from King's <b>boarding</b> room on High Street, and that it {{contained}} the items presented to the court, and two pistols, {{one of which was}} used to fire the three shots that killed the victim. He noted that King had been apprehended and brought to the Second Precinct station at noon the previous Tuesday.|$|R
50|$|After the war trunk {{services}} were rapidly restored and telegraph {{services were}} connected in days using military wireless equipment. The cables were quickly {{picked up and}} the pre-war circuits put back into service. The GPO upgraded the cable capacity in 1952 and opened {{in the spring of}} 1953 a new <b>trunk</b> manual <b>board</b> in an extension over the Telephone Department offices. The GPO installed new cables to cater for increased demand in 1958 Tucton Bridge, Bournemouth to Grève D'Azette and in 1968 Tucton Bridge to Grève D'Azette. A further analogue multiplex repeated submarine cable from Bournemouth to Grève D'Azette was added jointly by the Telecommunications Board and recently branded British Telecom in 1982 after the takeover of the trunk system by the States of Jersey in 1973.|$|R
50|$|DeForest Skinner {{acquired}} the recently built house {{around the time}} he married Rachel Ann Maxwell in 1861. Skinner had arrived in Valparaiso in 1847 at age eleven with his parents John and Emily Skinner; he displayed business acumen early in life as he worked for various commercial interests. From 1874 to 1878, {{as a member of}} the Republican Party, he served {{as a member of the}} Indiana Senate. Then in 1880 and 1888 he represented his area at the Democratic National Conventions. He also served as the President of the First National Bank from 1887 until his death in 1902. He was also Indiana's representative at the World's Congress of Bankers in 1893. Furthermore, he was on the Chicago and Grand <b>Trunk</b> Railroad's <b>board</b> of directors. His death in 1902 occurred in the house.|$|R
50|$|The {{general public}} seemed unaware {{that no other}} country had {{commercial}} flying services without government subsidy. Only in United States were military and civil aviation clearly separated though civil was still subsidised. For their Brisbane-Darwin-Singapore service operating the same DH86 aircraft QANTAS Empire Airways received a greater subsidy per mile than proposed for the <b>trunk</b> route. The <b>board</b> had been directed {{to take into account}} the value of the usefulness of all the proposed airways facilities for auxiliary defence purposes.|$|R
60|$|After {{finishing}} their breakfast, Mr. George and Rollo went out, {{and they}} rambled about the town {{until the time}} drew near for the sailing of the boat. Then {{they went to the}} station for the luggage, and having engaged a porter {{to take it to the}} boat, they followed him down to the pier till they came to the place where the boat was lying. After seeing the <b>trunk</b> put on <b>board</b> they went on board themselves. A short time afterwards Mr. and Mrs. Parkman came.|$|R
5000|$|While swim briefs {{are used}} {{worldwide}} by athletes for water sports, {{the popularity of}} swim briefs as casual beachwear and swim wear varies throughout the world. In mainland Europe and Brazil, briefs are relatively common among male casual swimmers and beach goers. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the roomier and less revealing <b>trunks</b> or <b>board</b> shorts are the suits preferred for recreation, although swim briefs are always seen to some extent. [...] In some countries like France, men are only permitted to wear swimming trunks and not shorts, for reasons relating to hygiene. Swim briefs are chosen for recreation include style, ease of movement in the water, sunshine exposure, quick drying time, {{and the ability to}} be worn under pants or shorts. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing [...] "speedos" [...] or [...] "budgie smugglers".|$|R
60|$|Among {{the various}} persons who {{were about to}} proceed up the Missouri with Mr. Hunt, were two {{scientific}} gentlemen; one Mr. John Bradbury, a man of mature age, but great enterprise and personal activity, who had been sent out by Linnaean Society of Liverpool to make a collection of American plants; the other, a Mr. Nuttall, likewise an Englishman, younger in years, who has since made himself known {{as the author of}} Travels in Arkansas, and a work on the Genera of American Plants. Mr. Hunt had offered them the protection and facilities of his party, in their scientific research up the Missouri River. As they were not ready to depart at the moment of embarkation, they put their <b>trunks</b> on <b>board</b> of the boat, but remained at St. Louis until the next day, for the arrival of the post, intending to join the expedition at St. Charles, a short distance above the mouth of the Missouri.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Craig," [...] said she, [...] "this is no laughin' matter. What me and Mrs. Aleshine is sayin' is {{for your}} good, and {{for the good of}} Miss Ruth along with you. I haven't much opinion of her father, but his money is as good as anybody else's, and though they had to leave their <b>trunks</b> on <b>board</b> their ship, what little they brought with them shows that they've been used to havin' the best there is. Mrs. Aleshine and me has set up till late into the night talkin' over this thing, and we are both of one mind that you two need never expect to have the same chance again that you've got now. The very fact that the old gentleman is a preacher, and can marry you on the spot, ought to make you tremble when you think of the risks you are runnin' by puttin' it off." ...|$|R
6000|$|About nine o'clock, on Monday morning, the [...] "Tigris" [...] came in. When we boarded her, {{which we}} did {{almost as soon as}} the stairs had been put down her side, we found that she would make a shorter stay than usual, and would go out that evening, at high tide. So {{there was no time to}} lose. After the letters had been {{delivered}} at the hotel, and we had read ours, we sent our <b>trunks</b> on <b>board,</b> and went around to finish up Nassau. We rowed over to Hog Island, opposite the town, to see, once more, the surf roll up against the high, jagged rocks; we ran down among the negro cottages and the negro cabins to get some fruit for the trip; and we rushed about to bid good-bye to some of our old friends--Poqua-dilla among them. Corny went with us, this time. Every darkey knew we were going away, and it was amazing to see how many of them came to bid us good-bye, and ask for some coppers.|$|R
5000|$|The Thistle is a {{high-performance}} one-design racing dinghy, {{also used for}} day sailing, popular in the United States. The Thistle was designed by Gordon K. (Sandy) Douglass who later designed the Highlander and Flying Scot. (These names commemorate Douglass’s Scots heritage.) Starting in 1945, 4040+ boats have now been built. Their construction originally used molded plywood. The builders started using Glass-reinforced polyester or [...] "fibreglass" [...] in the late 1950s. The current hull configuration uses a glass-reinforced polyester molded boat with wooden rails, centre <b>board</b> <b>trunk,</b> thwart, fore grating, and aft grating. The spars were once made from spruce, but are now of entirely extruded aluminum construction.|$|R
40|$|Eighteen green cocowood samples, 3 m {{in length}} each were sawn into 3 cm thick <b>boards.</b> <b>Trunk</b> samples {{consisted}} of two groups, butt logs and top logs. Each group was sawn with 3 degrees of hook angle, namely 19, 22 and 25 degrees. Sawing properties, i. e., power consumption, sawing productivity and lumber recovery were related with hook angle and trunk portion. The results reveal that trunk portion and hook angle {{had a significant effect}} on power consumption. The butt logs consumed power higher than top logs. Trunk portion had no effect on sawing productivity but greater hook angle tends to increase the productivity. Hook angle and trunk portion had no effect on recovery...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{hope you}} will, but my {{experience}} {{of women is}} pretty extensive, and I have scarcely met one who could be relied upon to keep an appointment punctually. Don't laden yourself {{more than you can}} help with little bags, and parcels, and bundles of all kinds; I expect you will be three or four in a cabin, and you will find that {{there is no room for}} litter. Take the things you will require at first in one or two flat trunks which will stow under your berth; once a week or so, if the weather is fine, you will be able to get at your things in the hold. Do try if possible to pack all the things that you are likely to want to get at during the voyage in one trunk, and have a star or any mark you like painted on that trunk with your name, then there will be no occasion for the sailors to haul twenty boxes upon deck. Be sure you send all your <b>trunks</b> on <b>board,</b> except those you want in your cabin, two days before she sails. Do you think you can remember all that?" ...|$|R
60|$|And I will say, here, that I {{would rather}} travel with an {{excursion}} party of Methuselahs than {{have to be}} changing ships and comrades constantly, as people do who travel in the ordinary way. Those latter are always grieving over some other ship they have known and lost, and over other comrades whom diverging routes have separated from them. They learn to love a ship {{just in time to}} change it for another, and they become attached to a pleasant traveling companion only to lose him. They have that most dismal experience of being in a strange vessel, among strange people who care nothing about them, and of undergoing the customary bullying by strange officers and the insolence of strange servants, repeated over and over again within the compass of every month. They have also that other misery of packing and unpacking trunks--of running the distressing gauntlet of custom-houses--of the anxieties attendant upon getting a mass of baggage from point to point on land in safety. I had rasher sail with a whole brigade of patriarchs than suffer so. We never packed our trunks but twice--when we sailed from New York, and when we returned to it. Whenever we made a land journey, we estimated how many days we should be gone and what amount of clothing we should need, figured it down to a mathematical nicety, packed a valise or two accordingly, and left the <b>trunks</b> on <b>board.</b> We chose our comrades from among our old, tried friends, and started. We were never dependent upon strangers for companionship. We often had occasion to pity Americans whom we found traveling drearily among strangers with no friends to exchange pains and pleasures with. Whenever we were coming back from a land journey, our eyes sought one thing in the distance first--the ship --and when we saw it riding at anchor with the flag apeak, we felt as a returning wanderer feels when he sees his home. When we stepped on board, our cares vanished, our troubles were at an end--for the ship was home to us. We always had the same familiar old state-room to go to, and feel safe and at peace and comfortable again.|$|R
5000|$|Tardy {{called to}} Dobson [...] "Mr. Dobson, where are you?" [...] Dobson replied, [...] "In the maintop." [...] Tardy replied [...] "Are you wounded?" [...] Dobson replied [...] "Yes." [...] Tardy asked Dobson to descend, Dobson refused. When Tardy assured Dobson {{he would be}} spared, if he would come down, Dobson descended and was {{immediately}} surrounded by the Spaniards. Tardy asked the whereabouts of the <b>trunk</b> brought on <b>board</b> by Felix. Dobson said he had put the trunk in the stateroom, but didn't know {{what had become of}} it. Tardy explained that the Captain had refused the Spaniards access to the trunk, causing them to suspect it had been put ashore in Matanzas. Therefore, they decided to take the law into their own hands, and killed the Captain taking control of the ship. They determined that rather than continue to the United States they should instead sail for Europe and if Dobson would assist them he would be well paid for his services when the ship's cargo was sold. Dobson agreed and obtained permission to lay down. Tardy then asked him where Dolliver and Potter where. Dobson replied that they were in the Maintop. The two men were then asked to descend, repeatedly assured by Tardy that no harm would befall them. Doliver came down and was immediately stabbed by Courro and pushed overboard by Pepe. In the water, Doliver told Potter to stay where he was or he would certainly be killed. His last words were addressed to the Spaniards, saying that they were [...] "barbarous and bloodthirsty wretches, equally destitute of courage and humanity". Shortly afterwards, Potter fell from the rigging landing heavily in the water with no struggle, causing Dobson to assume he was either dead or had fainted.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not a {{very good}} ladder, but it's quite firm," [...] says I, as he seemed to be afraid of it. And he didn't look a broken-down old man, either. You can see {{yourself}} what he is. Straight as a poker, and life enough in him yet. But he made no move, and I began to feel foolish. Then she comes forward. [...] "Oh! Thank you, Mr Franklin. I'll help my father up." [...] Flabbergasted me--to be choked off like this. Pushed in between him and me without as much as a look my way. So of course I dropped it. What do you think? I fell back. I would have gone up on board at once and left them on the quay to come up or stay there till next week, only they were blocking the way. I couldn't very well shove them on one side. Devil only knows what was up between them. There she was, pale as death, talking to him very fast. He got as red as a turkey-cock-- dash me if he didn't. A bad-tempered old bloke, I can tell you. And a bad lot, too. Never mind. I couldn't hear what she was saying to him, but she put force enough into it to shake her. It seemed--it seemed, mind!--that he didn't want to go on board. Of course it couldn't have been that. I know better. Well, she took him by the arm, above the elbow, as if to lead him, or push him rather. I was standing not quite ten feet off. Why should I have gone away? I was anxious to get back on board as soon as they would let me. I didn't want to overhear her blamed whispering either. But I couldn't stay there for ever, so I made a move to get past them if I could. And that's how I heard a few words. It was the old chap--something nasty about being [...] "under the heel" [...] of somebody or other. Then he says, [...] "I don't want this sacrifice." [...] What it meant I can't tell. It was a quarrel--of that I am certain. She looks over her shoulder, and sees me pretty close to them. I don't know what she found to say into his ear, but he gave way suddenly. He looked round at me too, and they went up together so quickly then that when I got on the quarter-deck I was only {{in time to see the}} inner door of the passage close after them. Queer--eh? But if it were only queerness one wouldn't mind. Some luggage in new <b>trunks</b> came on <b>board</b> in the afternoon. We undocked at midnight. And may I be hanged if I know who or what he was or is. I haven't been able to find out. No, I don't know. He may have been anything. All I know is that once, years ago when I went to see the Derby with a friend, I saw a pea-and-thimble chap who looked just like that old mystery father out of a cab.|$|R
