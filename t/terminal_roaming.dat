Ensuring that threats to the interconnected communications systems and terminals are sufficiently and appropriately reduced by technical, procedural and environmental countermeasures is vital to realise the trusted and secure communication system needed for the pursued PPDR transnational cooperation activities. In this context, ISITEP Work Package 2. 2 (WP 2. 2) “Security Requirements” is aimed at establishing the set of security requirements needed to drive {{the development of the}} security architecture and its components. This first deliverable from WP 2. 2 provides a description of the preliminary framework and methodology defined to carry out the development of the security requirements. The framework includes aspects such as the identification of the ISITEP system components and players that are relevant for the security analysis, and the definition of security objectives. On this basis, the document also conducts a first assessment to delineate the state-of-the-art of the security features existing in current PPDR technologies and networks, security procedures carried out by PPDR end-users and operators in order to realise the trusted and secure communication system needed in national PPDR networks, and to provide an overview of the regulatory and legislation framework that impacts affects PPDR communication networks. Finally, a preliminary assessment of security threats to ISITEP system is also reported. The assessment is focused on those security threats that are relevant to the new communications capabilities brought by the ISITEP solution in terms of service interworking across multiple national networks and <b>terminal</b> <b>roaming.</b> Preprin...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{signaling protocol}} for mobility application part (MAP) {{is essential to}} mobility support when mobile <b>terminals</b> <b>roam</b> between different networks in next generation wireless systems such as IMT- 2000. In this paper, a new signaling protocol is proposed to reduce the overhead caused by mobility management, alleviating network load and consumption of network resources. Moreover, the new protocol effectively reduces the latency of call delivery and call loss rate due to crossing wireless systems with different standards and signaling protocols. Instead of performing location registration after a mobile user arrives at the new system, the mobile user is required to update its location information prior to its reaching the boundary of two systems. Results in this study demonstrate that the new protocol yields significant benefits in terms of reducing signaling costs, delays, and call loss rates. 1...|$|R

The Internet architecture was designed underlying the existing of the end-to-end path connection. The promise of wireless Internet networks is to provide roaming users connectivity anywhere anytime. However, quality of service (QoS) is still an open issue in wireless networks, which are characterized by possible intermittent connectivity and large transmission delays, due to user mobility, sparse mobile node distribution, link failures (because of hostile propagation medium), and/or other high-priority traffc. In this thesis, a credit-based user authentication scheme is proposed for delay tolerant mobile wireless networks. The proposed authentication scheme isolates the uncertain network condition in the high delay wireless backhaul with high error rate, and accelerates the overall authentication process when the mobile <b>terminal</b> <b>roams</b> in the visited network. Furthermore, an analytical study of overall network performance is presented for the authentication scheme in terms of authentication cost and delay.

These heterogeneities must be captured and handled dynamically as mobile <b>terminals</b> <b>roam</b> between different wireless architectures.

Thus, {{the integration of the}} existing medium access schemes, e. g., CSMA, TDMA and CDMA, dictates an adaptive and seamless medium access control (MAC) layer that can achieve high network utilization and meet diverse QoS requirements. In this paper, an adaptive medium access control (A-MAC) layer is proposed to address the heterogeneities posed by the NG wireless networks. A-MAC introduces a two-layered MAC framework that accomplishes the adaptivity to both architectural heterogeneities and diverse QoS requirements.

40|$|Nowadays, Internet {{uses the}} Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv 4) {{in the network}} layer. IPv 4 assumes that {{computers}} are always attached to their networks without the possibility to communicate if they move to a remote location. Mobile IP is an extension to IPv 4 that permits the once fixed terminal to “visit ” a foreign network and to maintain seamless communication without changing its IP number. However, Mobile IP presents difficulties such as the routing scheme {{and the need for}} registration of the mobile terminal with its Home Agent every time it migrates to a new network. Some proposals have been developed that aim to minimize the number of registrations when the mobile terminal is within a limited area. For example, Cellular IP applies mobility management functions of cellular systems within a network domain, but when the mobile device is migrating between two domains, the registration follows Mobile IP. This paper proposes a functional entity to locate mobile <b>terminals</b> when <b>roaming</b> between Cellular IP networks.

40|$|The rapid {{diffusion}} of heterogeneous forms of wireless connectivity {{is pushing the}} tremendous growth of the commercial interest in mobile services, i. e., distributed applications to portable wireless <b>terminals</b> that <b>roam</b> during service provisioning. In the case of both location-dependent mobile services and mobile services with session continuity requirements, {{there is a growing}} need for decentralized and lightweight solutions to predict cell handovers, in order to enable proactive service management operations that anticipate actual terminal reconnections at their newly visited cells. The paper discusses how to predict client handovers between IEEE 802. 11 cells in a portable and completely decentralized way, only by exploiting RSSI monitoring and with no need of external global positioning systems. In particular, the paper focuses on proposing and comparing different filtering techniques for mitigating Received Signal Strength Indication abrupt fluctuations. Experimental results point out that i) filtering techniques can relevantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of handover prediction, and ii) the choice of the most appropriate filtering solution to adopt should be made at provisioning time depending on specific service/system requirements, e. g., privileging minimum overhead vs. greater prediction proactivity. 1...|$|R

Supporting terminal and user mobility requires a middleware infrastructure capable of efficiently answering the needs of scalable resource discovery, of security and interoperability, of Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring and adaptation.

40|$|Problem statement: In the {{heterogeneous}} networks, {{generally the}} entire networks operating&# 13; on the Radio Frequencies under wireless mode available for communication are brought under a single&# 13; head {{based on their}} common operating procedures and functions. As a common mode the basic&# 13; functions of the networks are requesting, tracing, sending, acknowledging, authenticating, authorizing,&# 13; receiving, updating, forwarding, controlling, registering, managing. As the radio frequency is&# 13; considered the signal strength, maximum coverage, power level are taken as the major factor. &# 13; Approach: Todays cellular network has a wide coverage area and also a good signal strength and as&# 13; the WiMax is considered the data transmission rate and the volume of information communicated is&# 13; high. As we consider the Adhoc Network the path tracing and the nearby node identification is faster&# 13; {{and there is no}} need for a standard architecture. As the major of the different networks are combined&# 13; with certain QoS without disturbing the existing infrastructure a fast seamless flow of voluminous&# 13; information in real time application can be achieved. As the data transmission is considered the major&# 13; part is affected based on the initiation & delay such as authentication delay, handover delay, session&# 13; initiation, activation which is being carried out only after the control had reached the service point. &# 13; Results: In the proposed study the transmission of information is purely controlled by categorizing the&# 13; type of information that is being transmitted such as the information ready for transmission is online or&# 13; offline. Coming to on line either voice communication, Multimedia communication or real-time&# 13; information transmission. Considering the offline the information is stored file or images. Among the&# 13; above one the real time video transmission is considered as the major application because delay cannot&# 13; be permitted and one more thing the mobility should be managed without any break in the transmission&# 13; path.
