Three tanks working {{together}} would advance in a triangle formation, with the two rear tanks providing cover for an infantry platoon.

The effectiveness of tank–infantry co-operation was demonstrated {{during the battle}}, when Major General George Montague Harper of the 51st (Highland) Division refused to co-operate with the tanks, a decision that compelled them <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> without any infantry support; the result was the destruction of more than 12 tanks by German artillery sighted behind bunkers.|$|E
