5000|$|On 31 July, Anonymous {{attacked}} the websites of 77 different law enforcement websites hosted {{on the same}} server. As much as 10 gigabytes of data was taken, including the personal information of police officers from numerous jurisdictions. Emails were also taken, {{as well as the}} confidential information of inmates and confidential informants, though not released yet. Anonymous said that they would redact inmate names but would <b>release</b> <b>the</b> names of all [...] " [...] informants who had the false impression that {{they would be able to}} ‘anonymously’ snitch in secrecy." [...] <b>The</b> <b>release</b> also included a demand that all arrested members of Anonymous be released immediately.

5000|$|According to {{the history}} based on {{documents}} <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Security</b> Archive and reflected in the book Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, the coup caused long-lasting damage to the U.S. reputation."The '28 Mordad' coup, {{as it is known}} by its Persian date the Solar Hijri calendar, was a watershed for Iran, for the Middle East and for the standing of the United States in the region. The joint U.S.-British operation ended Iran's drive to assert sovereign control over its own resources and helped put an end to a vibrant chapter {{in the history of the}} country's nationalist and democratic movements. These consequences resonated with dramatic effect in later years. When the Shah finally fell in 1979, memories of the U.S. intervention in 1953, which made possible the monarch's subsequent, and increasingly unpopular, 25-year reign intensified the anti-American character of the revolution in the minds of many Iranians." ...|$|R
50|$|As the combats progressed in {{the main}} urban centers of the country, a {{military}} unit of the infamous Batallón Atlacatl broke into José Matías Delgado University (Spanish: Universidad Centroamericana José Matías Delgado, UCA) and executed six Jesuit priests and two domestic employees on November 16, 1989. The UCA martyrs, as they became known, were considered by the Salvadoran right as the “brain of the guerilla” due to their affinity to Liberation Theology and their calls for peace and social justice. Despite the situation, OAS secretary general João Clemente Baena Soares arrived to the country on November 19 to promote peace negotiations. As they advanced through San Salvador, FMLN guerillas eventually reached Hotel Sheraton, where Berna Soares was staying along with several foreigners and five U.S. Marines. The rebels took over the hotel’s VIP tower for several hours holding Baena Soares and the others hostage. Eventually, after an agreement unknown to the public, <b>the</b> hostages were <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Salvadoran <b>security</b> forces.As {{a consequence of the}} Ofensiva, the Salvadoran government broke diplomatic relations with the Nicaraguan government on November 27, claiming involvement in support of the rebels. Two days after, the insurgents assassinated Supreme Court president Francisco José Guerrero and ventured into the affluent neighborhoods Maquilishuat, Campestre, Lomas Verdes and Escalón. The objective was to pressure and destabilize the Army, which would be more hesitant to fight them in these neighborhoods, with important sites like the presidential residency. Finally, by the beginning of December, the Ofensiva was finally ceasing.|$|R
