50|$|Subject-matter {{jurisdiction}} must {{be distinguished}} from personal jurisdiction, which {{is the power of}} a court <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> against a particular defendant, and territorial jurisdiction, which is the power of the court <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> concerning events that have occurred within a well-defined territory. Unlike personal or territorial jurisdiction, lack of subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. A judgment from a court that did not have subject-matter jurisdiction is forever a nullity. To decide a case, a court must have a combination of subject (subjectam) and either personal (personam) or territorial (locum) jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|Territorial {{jurisdiction}} in United States law {{refers to a}} court's power over events and persons {{within the bounds of}} a particular geographic territory. If a court does not have territorial jurisdiction over the events or persons within it, then the court cannot bind the defendant to an obligation or adjudicate any rights involving them. Territorial jurisdiction is to be distinguished from subject-matter jurisdiction, which is the power of a court <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> concerning a certain subject matter, or personal jurisdiction, which is the power of a court <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> concerning particular persons, wherever they may be. Personal jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction, subject-matter jurisdiction, and proper notice to the defendant are prerequisites for a valid judgment.|$|E

50|$|In Constitutional law, the Last Resort Rule is {{a largely}} {{prudential}} rule which gives {{a federal court}} the power to avoid a constitutional issue in some circumstances.

Dr. Mandler was clearly ahead of his times with his developments. That is proven by the numerous optical computations that still have lost nothing in terms of current relevance. Among them is the 50 mm f/1 Noctilux-M lens that he designed. Today, many publications still refer to his work, notably the landmark 50 mm f/2 Summicron-M lens. And there are numerous other examples that prove how important his work was for the evolution of photographic optics in general and for the evolution of photography at Leitz. This includes his apochromatically corrected telephoto lenses. ...

5000|$|This last (fourth) {{requirement}} is {{explained in the}} official notes as follows: When a defendant, if he desires to defend his interest in property, is obliged {{to come in and}} litigate in a court to whose jurisdiction he could not ordinarily be subjected, fairness suggests that he should not be required to assert counterclaims, but should rather be permitted to do so at his election. If, however, he does elect to assert a counterclaim, it seems fair to require him to assert any other which is compulsory within the meaning of Rule 13(a). Clause (2), added by amendment to Rule 13(a), carries out this idea. It will apply to various cases described in Rule 4(e), as amended, where service is effected through attachment or other process by which the court does not acquire jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>a</b> personal <b>judgment</b> against the defendant. Clause (2) will also apply to State courts jurisdictionally grounded on attachment or the like, and removed to the Federal courts. NOTES of Advisory Committee on 1963 amendments to Rules ...|$|R
40|$|Antitrust law {{confronted the}} {{challenges}} of regulating interoperability between platforms and applications in both the AT 2 ̆ 6 T and Microsoft cases, but {{it has yet to}} mine the series of lessons that can inform how to address this challenge going forward. With the Microsoft consent decree still in place, it may too soon <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>a</b> final <b>judgment</b> on the remedy adopted in that case as well as to evaluate more generally whether antitrust law is up to the task of developing the institutional strategies - be it the use of technical committees or reliance on standard setting bodies - for addressing interoperability concerns that are likely to increasingly arise in the information-based economy. Nonetheless, policymakers focused on the interoperability issue need to begin evaluating the possibilities and limits of antitrust law in this context. This Article argues that the effort to promote interoperability through antitrust oversight must grapple with a twin set of challenges. First, it must appreciate how standard setting bodies operate and how to bolster their effectiveness through appropriate government support and antitrust law oversight. Second, it must evaluate the comparative institutional competence of the available institutions that might play a role in different remedial strategies. If courts and enforcers can exercise increased creativity and develop effective remedial strategies, antitrust law can {{play an important role in}} avoiding the type of regulation that has generally governed network industries of critical importance to the economy. To be sure, it may be the case that regulating interoperability requires a regulatory authority to oversee the terms of access (as was the case in AT 2 ̆ 6 T), but there are significant costs associated with moving towards an increased reliance on such authorities. Consequently, it is critically important that antitrust law - along with other institutions, such as standard setting bodies - grapple with the question of how to ensure effective oversight regarding access to a platform in a technologically dynamic environment...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the state}} of Texas argued that “this {{intangible}} property {{should be treated as}} situated in Texas, so as to permit that State to escheat,” two other areas, {{the state of}} New Jersey, where Sun Oil Co. was incorporated, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where their corporate offices were located, argued for their own right to escheat. Since the Supreme Court had ruled three years previously, in [...] Western Union Co. v Pennsylvania (1961), that one state had “no power <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> of escheat which would bar...any other State from escheating the same property”, the state of Texas petitioned the court, under Art. III, 2, of the Constitution, which gave the Court original jurisdiction over cases between states, for a definitive declaration of rights on the subject. Noting that “since the States separately are without constitutional power to provide a rule to settle this interstate controversy and since there is no applicable federal statute,” the Court accepted the case, arguing that it was their responsibility “in the exercise of our original jurisdiction to adopt a rule which will settle the question of which State will be allowed to escheat this intangible property.” ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ongoing {{conflict}} in the Darfur region of Sudan {{has resulted in a}} severe humanitarian crisis. We sought to characterize the nature and geographic scope of allegations of human rights violations perpetrated against civilians in Darfur and to evaluate their consistency with medical examinations documented in patients' medical records. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a retrospective review and analysis of medical records from all 325 patients seen for treatment from September 28, 2004, through December 31, 2006, at the Nyala-based Amel Centre for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture, the only dedicated local provider of free clinical and legal services to civilian victims of torture and other human rights violations in Darfur during this time period. Among 325 medical records identified and examined, 292 (89. 8 %) patients from 12 different non-Arabic-speaking tribes disclosed in the medical notes that they had been attacked by Government of Sudan (GoS) and/or Janjaweed forces. Attacks were reported in 23 different rural council areas throughout Darfur. Nearly all attacks (321 [98. 8 %]) were described as having occurred in the absence of active armed conflict between Janjaweed/GoS forces and rebel groups. The most common alleged abuses were beatings (161 [49. 5 %]), gunshot wounds (140 [43. 1 %]), destruction or theft of property (121 [37. 2 %]), involuntary detainment (97 [29. 9 %]), and being bound (64 [19. 7 %]). Approximately one-half (36 [49. 3 %]) of all women disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted, and one-half of sexual assaults were described as having occurred in close proximity to a camp for internally displaced persons. Among the 198 (60. 9 %) medical records that contained sufficient detail to enable the forensic medical reviewers <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>an</b> informed <b>judgment,</b> the signs and symptoms in all of the medical records were assessed to be consistent with, highly consistent with, or virtually diagnostic of the alleged abuses. CONCLUSIONS: Allegations of widespread and sustained torture and other human rights violations by GoS and/or Janjaweed forces against non-Arabic-speaking civilians were corroborated by medical forensic review of medical records of patients seen at a local non-governmental provider of free clinical and legal services in Darfur. Limitations of this study were that patients seen in this clinic may not have been a representative sample of persons alleging abuse by Janjaweed/GoS forces, and that most delayed presenting for care. The quality of documentation was similar to that available in other conflict/post-conflict, resource-limited settings...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} indicates that the Sombrero Operating System offers a model for computing that reduces complexity {{in the implementation of}} both system and application software.

A good software development environment facilitates good software development. The effort to install a Sombrero development system has been reduced and thereby the coding and testing of Sombrero system modules was made easier and previously undocumented aspects of Sombrero have been documented. This is an area where Sombrero will continue to lag because of the small development community. This effort also exploits Sombrero’s object-oriented development model to provide an implementation of a lower-level architecture for the Alpha platform. Softwar...|$|E

40|$|A {{husband and}} wife were {{residents}} of Wyoming. In a divorce proceeding in that state, having both parties before it and having jurisdiction over {{the subject matter of}} the suit, the Wyoming court granted a decree of divorce to the wife. The decree ordered the husband to deliver to the wife a quit claim deed to property in Nebraska. The husband did not comply with this order. Instead, he left Wyoming and went to the situs of the land in Nebraska and brought a suit there to have the Wyoming decree declared void and to quiet his interest in the property. The wife cross-petitioned asking that the Wyoming decree be enforced, or in the alternative, to quiet title in the wife to the husband 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the property. The Nebraska Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court with orders <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> either enforcing the order of the Wyoming Court, or in the alternative, quieting title in the wife to the husband’s interest in the property. The problem presented in this case is the effect, in Nebraska, of a decree of a sister state ordering a conveyance of Nebraska real estate. The maxim that a court of one state cannot directly affect or determine title to real property located in another state is not as final as it sounds. Under the guise of “indirectly affecting” real property, courts of one state may affect real property in another by rendering an in personam order to convey title to that land. Once this order becomes final, it is then backed by the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution...|$|E
