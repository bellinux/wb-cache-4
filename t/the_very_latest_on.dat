40|$|Book synopsis: This {{major new}} {{reference}} presents The Foresight Mental Capital and Wellbeing Project (a UK Government {{project in the}} Government Office for Science). It offers a comprehensive exploration of how mental capital and wellbeing operate over the lifespan; how experiences in the family, in school, at work and following retirement augment or reduce mental capital and wellbeing, and the impact that this has for the individual and for the welfare and economic progress of the nation. Mental Capital and Wellbeingcomprises a series of scientific reviews written by leading international scientists and social scientists in the field. The reviews undertake systematic analyses of the evidence base surrounding five key themes, on which they propose future policies {{will have to be}} based. An internationally renowned team of Editors introduce each theme and draw together conclusions in terms of both policy and practice. Section 1 (Mental Capital and Wellbeing Through Life) – Mental capital refers to the totality of an individual’s cognitive and emotional resources, including their cognitive capability, flexibility and efficiency of learning, emotional intelligence and resilience in the face of stress. The extent of an individual’s resources reflects his or her basic endowment (e. g. genes and early biological programming), motivation and experiences (e. g. education) which take place throughout the life course. This section presents <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> <b>on</b> the science of mental capital throughout life. Section 2 (Learning Through Life) provides a coherent overview of a fast-moving and complex field of policy and practice. Educational attainment has a considerable impact on physical and mental wellbeing, both directly and indirectly, by enabling people better to achieve their goals. The ability to continue learning throughout the lifespan is critical to a successful and rewarding life in contemporary societies...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} published Yemeni observing report about SN 1006 from al-Yamani clearly gives AD 1006 Apr 17 ± 2 (mid-Rajab 396 h) as first observation date. Since {{this is about}} 1. 5 weeks earlier than the otherwise earliest reports (Apr 28 or 30) as discussed so far, we were motivated to investigate an early sighting in more depth. We searched for additional evidences from other areas like East Asia and Europe. We found that the date given by al-Yamani is fully consistent with other evidence, including: (a) SN 1006 "rose several times half an hour after sunset" (al-Yamani), which is correct for the location of Sana in Yemen for the time around Apr 17, {{but it would not}} be correct for late Apr or early May; (b) the date (3 rd year, 3 rd lunar month, 28 th day wuzi, Ichidai Yoki) for an observation of a guest star in Japan is inconsistent (there is no day wuzi in that lunar month), but may be dated to Apr 16 by reading wuwu date rather than a wuzi date; (c) there is observational evidence that SN 1006 was observed in East Asia early or mid April; for the second half of April, a bad weather (early monsoon) period is not unlikely [...] {{there is a lack of}} night reports; (d) the observer in St. Gallen reported to have seen SN 1006 "for three months", which must have ended at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> <b>on</b> AD 1006 Jul 10, given his northern location, so that his observations probably started in April. We conclude that the correctly reported details give quite high confidence in the fully self-consistent report of al-Yamani, so that the early discovery date should be considered seriously.

However, Wente {{published}} a heavily damaged inscription from Karnak in which a High Priest (name lost, but almost certainly Amenhotep) looks back at a period when he was ousted from office. The text is highly suggestive of Amenhotep having been restored to his former position after {{an appeal to the}} king.If Amenhotep was succeeded by Herihor, Amenhotep's pontificate must have been over by year 5 of the Renaissance at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest,</b> since, <b>on</b> that model, this is the year in which the priest Wenamun set out on his journey to Byblos.

60|$|Whether the {{glittering}} iridescent tints and singular ornaments for which this family is famous {{result from the}} cumulative process of conscious or voluntary sexual selection, as Darwin thought, or are merely {{the outcome of a}} superabundant vitality, as Dr. A. R.. Wallace so strongly maintains, is a question which science has not yet answered satisfactorily. The tendency to or habit of varying in the direction of rich colouring and beautiful or fantastic ornament, might, for all we know to the contrary, have descended to humming-birds from some diminutive, curiously-shaped, bright-tinted, flying reptile of arboreal habits that lived in some far-off epoch in the world's history. It is not, at all events, maintained by anyone that all birds sprang originally from one reptilian stock; and the true position of humming-birds in a natural classification has not yet been settled, for no intermediate forms exist connecting them with any other group, To the ordinary mind they appear utterly unlike all other feathered creatures, and as much entitled to stand apart as, for instance, the pigeon and ostrich families. It has been maintained by some writers that they are anatomically related to the swifts, although the differences separating the two families appear so great as almost to stagger belief in this notion. Now, however, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> authority <b>on</b> this subject, Dr. Schufeldt, has {{come to the conclusion that}} swifts are only greatly modified Passeres, and that the humming-birds should form an order by themselves.|$|R
40|$|Argument {{is central}} to law: legal {{disputes}} arise out of a disagreement between two parties and, since the disappearance of trials by ordeal and combat, such disputes are resolved by {{the parties to the}} dispute presenting arguments for their position to an agreed arbiter, who will typically justify the choice of the arguments he accepts with an argument of his own, intended to convince superior courts and the public at large. Given the centrality of argument to law, it is unsurprising that AI systems intended to model legal reasoning have found it necessary to model argument. This volume contains a collection of papers representing some of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> work <b>on</b> argumentation in AI and Law.

We will not pretend to give a complete survey, but rather to introduce the key concerns and issues relating to argumentation which have arisen in previous work in AI and Law. Major topics which have emerged as important in AI and Law and argumentation include: – Arguing on the basis of precedent cases – Using argumentation to resolve rule conflicts and explore defeasibility – Dialogue and dialectics – Argument Schemes – Determining whether an attack on an argument is successful We will briefly consider each of these in turn...|$|R
60|$|The tidings {{had reached}} <b>the</b> parsonage <b>very</b> <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} night--so late that the rector had been disturbed {{in his bed}} to receive them. It was his duty to make known to Lady Clavering {{the fact that she}} was a widow, but this he could not do till the next morning. But there was little sleep that night for him or for his wife! He knew well enough that the property was entailed. He felt with sufficient strength what it was to become a baronet at a sudden blow, and to become also the owner of the whole Clavering property. He was not slow to think of the removal to the great house, of the altered prospects of his son, and of the mode of life which would be fitting for himself in future. Before the morning came he had meditated who should be the future rector of Clavering, and had made some calculations as to the expediency of resuming his hunting. Not that he was a heartless man, or that he rejoiced at what had happened. But a man's ideas of generosity change as he advances in age, and the rector was old enough to tell himself boldly that this thing that had happened could not be to him a cause of much grief. He had never loved his cousins, or pretended to love them. His cousin's wife he did love, after a fashion, but in speaking to his own wife of the way in which this tragedy would affect Hermione, he did not scruple to speak of her widowhood as a period of coining happiness.|$|R
40|$|A {{thorough}} {{review is}} made of Climate Change Science, going into much greater detail than is typical of papers in Economics and specifically emphasising the hard thermodynamic limits of biological and physical processes. This theme is then continued in a historical review of theory relevant to Climate Change taken from Economics, Physics, Biology and Mathematics, clarified by extensive real-life historical time series plus calculations of fundamental thermodynamic limits – which results {{in a series of}} pointed, uncomfortable truths that our culture & society prefers to overlook. Two types of “costs of climate change” models are then placed under the microscope: (i) The Stern Report (2007) and (ii) The Limits to Growth (2004) – both chosen as the two most widely known by the greater public. Both models are evaluated according to the scientific realities outlined in the previous two chapters, including going into some detail of the specifics of the models themselves through analysis of their source code implementations. Finally, the author’s subjective opinion is given as {{to the quality of the}} models given the results of the prior chapter. I conclude that the models are primitive, but not much better than the state-of-the-art currently employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The hard reality is that we do not sufficiently understand the nature nor causes of climate change, only that it is happening – and thus building a realistic model is currently outside our capability. This is changing very quickly however – the paper has tried, where possible, to include <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> research <b>on</b> climate change and to show by just how much the ground is currently moving. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an extensive {{overview of the}} economic importance and evolution of the car manufacturing industry. In addition, it provides evidence that the car industry is still playing {{a vital role in}} process innovation. The currently widespread lean production method, under which companies focus on their core activities and develop a network of subcontractors, in fact originates from the Japanese car industry. The introduction of the "lean production" concept in Europe had a far-reaching impact on corporate relations. Important responsibilities - such as product development, quality control, innovation efforts and timely deliveries - have been/are passed on to the subcontractors. Company clusters have been formed, which often also have consequences in terms of geographical location due to the necessity of "just-in-time" or even "just-in-sequence"-deliveries. The mere fact that global companies have implemented this production method, also adds to the internationalization of the subcontracting companies. The latter conclusion fuelled/fuels the trend to anchor as it were the industrial core activities through an appropriate policy. Such a policy must be based upon reliable statistical observations. A major disadvantage, however, is that because of their network structure, the corporate clusters' importance is hard to measure. Since the input-output tables are not available for <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> years, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand, and are not sufficiently detailed, on the other hand, a method has been searched for which allows to gauge the importance of a specific branch. In this paper the method will be applied to the car manufacturing in Belgium. The proposed calculation method is based on the supply and use tables drawn up by the Bank {{within the framework of the}} National Accounts Institute. branch survey, car industry, subcontracting, indirect effects...|$|R
40|$|Many current {{public health}} actions and {{policies}} aimed at older people {{revolve around the}} often prevailing view that failing health {{is a consequence of}} ageing. It is now clear {{that it is possible to}} postpone or even prevent much of the age-related decline in health that was once thought inevitable. Future policies must recognise this changing paradigm, and, using a multi-disciplinary approach, integrate fully the changing needs of older people into all areas of public policy including health, nutrition, social support, housing, and economic security. Derived from the 47 th Annual Symposium of the Society for the Study of Human Biology in November 2005, Ageing Well: Nutrition, Health, and Social Interventions highlights important health and social factors affecting quality of life in older age, and reviews possible interventions aimed at the prevention or amelioration of problems that reduce the potential for ageing well. Covering a wide range of topics, contributors address the nutritional vulnerability and specific nutritional needs of older adults and confirm the necessity of appropriate diet and exercise in order to maintain both physical and cognitive health. Reminiscence, social interaction and support are highlighted as crucial for the preservation of identity, health and emotional well-being. Other chapters are concerned with socio-economic differences in the extent of age-related changes in health, resulting particularly from poor quality housing and lack of family support networks. The book includes an examination of the economic consequences for health care systems and pension schemes of ageing populations, provides insight into the methodology of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions, and outlines how the minimum cost of healthy living for the 65 + population can be estimated. Bringing together <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> information <b>on</b> successful ageing, Ageing Well: Nutrition, Health, and Social Interventions presents an up-to-date synthesis of the current evidence of nutrition, public health and social interventions aiming to ensure health and good quality of life in older age...|$|R

I stress {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} different methodologies and highlight the continuing need for detailed tests on mock data - particularly in the light of recently discovered evidence for disequilibria in the Milky Way disc. I highlight several recent measurements in order of increasing data complexity and prior, and, correspondingly, decreasing formal error bars.

40|$|The Doha round {{negotiations}} in World Trade Organisation (WTO) {{have been suspended}} in the last July {{due to lack of}} agreement in agriculture issues. Nevertheless, several leaders of WTO countries have stated publicly their will in reviving WTO talks. Therefore, further negotiations should be expected. Despite the last July failure in obtaining a final text on the negotiating modalities for agriculture, {{it should be noted that}} since the launch of Doha round in 2000 significant progress was made in the negotiations. WTO members tabled more generous offers than the initial ones in the round. In fact, during July talks the EU had a active role offering more concessions, such as, 48 % reductions of their import tariff (instead of the 39 % cuts proposed in its last Octobers offer), increases in Tariff Quotas, and progressive elimination of export subsidies. The EU recent offers would have had a considerable impact on New Zealand (NZ). The EU is the second largest market for NZ exports. It will be relevant to analyse what impact these changes would have had in the EU and NZ if the latest negotiation offers would have been accepted.
