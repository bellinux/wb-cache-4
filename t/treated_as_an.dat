5|$|Several {{key areas}} have been {{targeted}} for economic analysis and reform: the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth; the consequences of nature being <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> economic externality; {{and the possibility of}} an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.|$|E
5|$|Jibril is a , a {{powerful}} angelic race {{known for their}} ruthlessness. Jibril is over 6000-years old and is the youngest and most powerful of her species. She won Elkia's library from Stephanie's grandfather in order to store her books {{and use it as}} a home. After losing to Sora and Shiro in a game of Shiritori, she becomes their slave, but is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> equal. She often provides magic or transportation necessities for the protagonists. Later on, she begins publishing novels based on Sora and Shiro which makes them famous among the flügels. She is voiced by Yukari Tamura and English dubbed by Amelia Fischer.|$|E
50|$|Pasiphila was {{formerly}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> synonym of Chloroclystis, as was Gymnodisca, {{which is now}} mostly <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subgenus of Pasiphila. Rhinoprora is sometimes <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> synonym of subgenus Gymnodisca.|$|R
50|$|Plectostoma was <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{subgenus}} of Opisthostoma. In a 2014 revision, Plectostoma is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate genus.|$|R
50|$|Zeuzera biebingeri is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{subspecies}} of Z. pyrina by some sources, but {{is mostly}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> valid species.|$|R
5|$|Sitta przewalskii {{is not yet}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} species by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its threat {{level is}} not evaluated by either. Despite being described as rare in China and Southeast Tibet, because the taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of S. leucopsis, the evaluation of its population incorporates the relative abundance of its parent species. Concomitantly, it takes on its parent category of least concern. As S. przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from S. leucopsis, a classification of data deficient could be applied, but the rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status; a finding of near threatened or even classification as a vulnerable species may be warranted.|$|E
5|$|The {{scholars}} Pratapaditya Pal, {{an expert}} on South Asian art and H. Bhattacharya, author of Hinduder Debdebi {{on the subject of}} Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and the renewal of creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood– drunk by her attendants– nourishes the universe. One invocation to her calls her the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the recipient of the sacrifice, with the severed head <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus the cycle of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may be <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure {{the roots and}} expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
50|$|The {{equality}} symbol {{is sometimes}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> non-logical symbol and sometimes <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of logic. If it is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> logical symbol, then any interpretation {{will be required}} to interpret the equality sign using true equality; if interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> non-logical symbol, it may be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation.|$|R
50|$|The Sokoke bushy-tailed mongoose, Bdeogale omnivora, is {{sometimes}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of B. crassicauda, but is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate species by the IUCN.|$|R

5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

50|$|The Flores hawk-eagle has {{traditionally}} been <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of the changeable hawk-eagle, but it is now often <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate species, N. floris.|$|R
50|$|Lythrurus alegnotus was {{originally}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sub-species of Lythrurus bellus. However, {{it has since}} been <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unique species {{by a number of}} sources.|$|R

25|$|This {{article is}} focused mainly on {{classical}} thermodynamics which primarily studies systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is often <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{extension of the}} classical treatment, but statistical mechanics has brought many advances to that field.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{since each}} stratum is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} population, different sampling approaches {{can be applied}} to different strata, potentially enabling researchers to use the approach best suited (or most cost-effective) for each identified subgroup within the population.|$|E
50|$|Salix pulchra, also {{commonly}} called diamondleaf or tealeaf willow and sometimes <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of S. planifolia (S. planifolia ssp. pulchra), is now <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> distinct species.|$|R
50|$|Assault is {{typically}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> misdemeanor and not <b>as</b> <b>a</b> felony (unless {{it involves a}} law enforcement officer). The more serious crime of aggravated assault is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> felony.|$|R
50|$|Blepharizonia is {{sometimes}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> monotypic genus, and sometimes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> genus with two species. One variety or subspecies of B. plumosa {{is sometimes}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> distinct species called Blepharizonia laxa.|$|R
25|$|In the {{earliest}} known records, slavery is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> established institution. The Code of Hammurabi (c. 1760BC), for example, prescribed death for anyone who helped a slave escape or who sheltered a fugitive. The Bible mentions slavery as an established institution.|$|E
25|$|If the Trustee (or debtor in possession, in many chapter 11 cases) rejects a contract, the debtor's {{bankruptcy}} {{estate is}} subject to ordinary breach of contract damages, but the damages amount is an obligation and is generally <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unsecured claim.|$|E
