Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.|$|E
5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> imagination to the greatest effect.|$|E
5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E

On 15October 2012 Sihanouk {{died of a heart attack}} at 1:20am, Phnom Penh time. When the news broke, Sihamoni, Hun Sen, and other {{government}} officials flew to Beijing to pay their last respects. The Cambodian government announced an official mourning period of seven days between 17October and 24October 2012, and state flags were ordered to fly at one-third height. Two days later, Sihanouk's body was brought back from Beijing on an Air China flight, and about 1.2million people lined the streets from the airport to the royal palace to witness the return of Sihanouk's cortege.|$|E
5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled {{his work with}} a feeling of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Peter, Joe and Quagmire are shown {{watching}} television at the Drunken Clam, when an infomercial featuring Rat Pack members Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin is shown, featuring several songs with racially offensive lyrics. Immediately after, the group believes that they see their old friend, Cleveland, who moved to Virginia, across the bar, but are disappointed when it is revealed to be a lamp. Peter then goes on <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> desire to finally replace Cleveland, stating that their group is just like the Muppets character Statler without Waldorf. Deciding to hold auditions for a replacement for their entourage, they first audition actor Kevin Connolly, who is discouraged from joining once Quagmire attempts to steal his Lucky Charms cereal.|$|E

Prapanca did not shy away <b>to</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>his</b> admiration, even bordering somewhat a cult, since he often invoked a divine {{quality of the}} king and his royal family. Nevertheless, the work seems to be independent of court's patronage since Prapanca wrote them incognito after {{he retired from the}} court.|$|R
5|$|Lowell {{graduated}} from Harvard College in 1838, despite {{his reputation as}} a troublemaker, and went on to earn a law degree from Harvard Law School. He published his first collection of poetry in 1841 and married Maria White in 1844. The couple had several children, though only one survived past childhood. They soon became involved in the movement to abolish slavery, with Lowell using poetry <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> anti-slavery views and taking a job in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the editor of an abolitionist newspaper. After moving back to Cambridge, Lowell was {{one of the founders of}} a journal called The Pioneer, which lasted only three issues. He gained notoriety in 1848 with the publication of A Fable for Critics, a book-length poem satirizing contemporary critics and poets. The same year, he published The Biglow Papers, which increased his fame. He went on to publish several other poetry collections and essay collections throughout his literary career.|$|E
5|$|On 14 January 1892, {{six weeks}} after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of pneumonia, leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father. George had only just {{recovered}} from a serious illness himself, after being confined to bed for six weeks with typhoid fever, the disease that was thought to have killed his grandfather Prince Albert. Queen Victoria still regarded Princess May as a suitable match for her grandson, and George and May grew close during their shared period of mourning. A year after Albert Victor's death, George proposed to May and was accepted. They married on 6 July 1893 at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, London. Throughout their lives, they remained devoted to each other. George was, on his own admission, unable <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> feelings easily in speech, but they often exchanged loving letters and notes of endearment.|$|E
5|$|Sundaram, a poor man, {{comes to}} Madras with {{aspirations}} {{of becoming a}} film actor. However, he ends up getting {{a job in a}} restaurant called Greenlands Hotel as a waiter. While catering for {{a group of people who}} go on an excursion to Mahabalipuram, he meets Radha, the daughter of his restaurateur, Chakravarthy. He misinterprets her friendly nature as love and falls in love with her. In the meantime, Sundaram happens to meet his friend Raghavan, an influential businessman, in the restaurant. During their subsequent meetings, Sundaram tells Raghavan about his ambition to become an actor as well as about his love for Radha, without mentioning her name. Raghavan genuinely believes that the girl reciprocates Sundaram's feelings and motivates Sundaram <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> love.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Nocturne was {{composed}} by Shoji Meguro, with additional work by Kenichi Tsuchiya and Toshiko Tasaki. Mixing {{was done by}} Meguro, Tsuchiya, and Tasaki. The soundtrack included tunes from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles composed by Tsukasa Masuko. While composing the music, Meguro attempted <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> feelings {{when he saw the}} world while remaining true to the styles established by the original Megami Tensei games. Taking inspiration from the game's dungeon-battle transitions, and the cut-scenes' combination of current graphics with classic use of subtitles for storytelling, Meguro created modulating tunes which included elements from 1980s music. Meguro also introduced orchestral elements which were absent from previous Megami Tensei scores, using it to emphasize the gameplay's constant shifts between movement and stillness. Meguro generally worked solo on the original version, but for the director's cut, he had help composing new tracks.|$|E
5|$|This sincere {{attitude}} {{seems to}} have largely prevailed in practice. Theophilus Lindsey, who had helped establish Unitarianism in Britain, wrote to the Reverend Newcome Cappe <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> displeasure at a review in {{the first issue of}} the Analytical, demonstrating that Unitarian theology was not being promulgated by the journal. Furthermore, Johnson chose as his theological reviewer, not a Dissenter as his friend Joseph Priestley urged, but Alexander Geddes, a talented Scot who had been ordained in Paris as a Roman Catholic priest. However, modern scholars have suggested that he did so not for religious reasons, but because Geddes lived in London and had close connections both to Wollstonecraft and Johnson's friend, Henry Fuseli.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>his</b> reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E
