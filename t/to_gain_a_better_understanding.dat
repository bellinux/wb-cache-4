John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. <b>To</b> <b>gain</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> {{of the history of the}} planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, CERN {{announced}} that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the SLAC/Fermilab concept during the PS210 experiment. The experiment was performed using the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri. Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, ATHENA and ATRAP.|$|E

Analogues of GHB such as 3-methyl-GHB, 4-methyl-GHB, and 4-phenyl-GHB {{have been shown}} to produce similar effects to GHB in some animal studies, but these compounds are even less well researched than GHB itself. Of these analogues, only 4-methyl-GHB (γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, GHV) and a prodrug form γ-valerolactone (GVL) have been reported as drugs of abuse in humans, and on the available evidence seem to be less potent but more toxic than GHB, with a particular tendency to cause nausea and vomiting.|$|E
500|$|As Anning {{continued}} to make important finds, her reputation grew. On 10December 1823, she found the first complete Plesiosaurus, and in 1828 the first British example of the flying reptiles known as pterosaurs, called a flying dragon when it was displayed at the British Museum, followed by a Squaloraja fish skeleton in 1829. Despite her limited education, she read {{as much of the}} scientific literature as she could obtain, and often, laboriously hand-copied papers borrowed from others. Palaeontologist Christopher McGowan examined a copy she made of an 1824 paper by William Conybeare on marine reptile fossils and noted that the copy included several pages of her detailed technical illustrations that he was hard pressed to tell apart from the original.

500|$|The {{structure}} of the book drew mixed reactions, with Toronto Star's Kim Hughs describing it as [...] "the novel's most defining feature and its most exasperating conceit". She believed that Pari {{was meant to be}} the protagonist of the story but that the shifting focus on the numerous other personalities left her [...] "barely [...] through the clutter". The Independent's Arifa Akbar stated, [...] "The changing points of view and leaps in time can confuse and confine, leaving characters clearly defined but lacking depth. Decades gallop by and {{it is as if the}} story of these interconnected, cross -generational lives will simply go on echoing the original crime of Abdullah and Pari's separation." [...] Michiko Kakutani from The New York Times thought the novella-like storytelling was handled well and wrote, [...] "Khaled Hosseini's new novel, And the Mountains Echoed, may have the most awkward title in his body of work, but it's his most assured and emotionally gripping story yet, more fluent and ambitious than The Kite Runner (2003), more narratively complex than A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007)." [...] Kamal agreed, saying that the structure was [...] "exquisitely crafted".

500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns set out <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, {{referring to the}} latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't do it any other way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene was}} also a pivotal point in the {{development}} of Elsa's character and was initially planned to depict her becoming evil. Robert Lopez, who composed the song with his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, explained, [...] "Elsa was going to go from being this perfect princess that had tried to keep her personality down her whole life to saying, 'Screw it. I'm gonna be me.'" [...] They had wanted to use the song as a way <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of the character and what she would be like if she was no longer living in fear, which ultimately resulted in her becoming much more complex. The final lyrics and Menzel's [...] "ability to be so fragile and vulnerable and then break into this powerhouse voice" [...] turned the plot around and led to Elsa being revised as a [...] "good" [...] character. She initially attempts to suppress her powers in order to avoid hurting others, particularly Anna, and when she is no longer able to do so, she banishes herself from the kingdom to protect those around her. Lead writer Paul Briggs said that Anna's support is what Elsa needs most when her secret is exposed. [...] "The strength of the family bond is what makes this story so powerful," [...] he explained, [...] "because it's her sibling who's willing to look beyond her powers and stand between her and the world if that's what it takes." ...|$|E
