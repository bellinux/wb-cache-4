25|$|When activated, {{toll-like}} receptors (TLRs) take adapter molecules {{within the}} cytoplasm of cells {{in order to}} propagate a signal. Four adaptor molecules {{are known to be}} involved in signaling, which are Myd88, <b>TIRAP,</b> TRIF, and TRAM. These adapters activate other intracellular molecules such as IRAK1, IRAK4, TBK1, and IKKi that amplify the signal, eventually leading to the induction or suppression of genes that cause certain responses. Thousands of genes are activated by TLR signaling, implying that this method constitutes an important gateway for gene modulation.|$|E
