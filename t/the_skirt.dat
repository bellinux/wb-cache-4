5|$|A {{thorough}} technical investigation {{including a}} pigment analysis of Las Meninas was conducted around 1981 in Museo Prado. The analysis revealed the usual pigments of the baroque period frequently used by Velázquez {{in his other}} paintings. The main pigments used for this painting were lead white, azurite (for <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> of the kneeling menina), vermilion and red lake, ochres and carbon blacks.|$|E
5|$|Insects, {{including}} beetles, moths, wasps and flies, use the bark, {{leaves and}} flowers {{of the tree}} in various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> of dead leaves, a favourite dry place for weta to hide in winter. Many of the insect companions of C.australis have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens. If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.|$|E
5|$|In September 1954, Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, {{in which}} she starred {{opposite}} Tom Ewell {{as a woman who}} becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In the shoot, Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> of her white dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of large trim and heel angles of the wrecked submarine, the double spherical shell {{rotating}} docking skirt is studied. According to the working principle of <b>the</b> rotating docking <b>skirt,</b> and <b>the</b> fixed <b>skirt,</b> <b>the</b> directional <b>skirt,</b> <b>the</b> angle <b>skirt</b> are simplified as the connecting rod. Therefore, the posture equation and kinematics model of <b>the</b> docking <b>skirt</b> are deduced, and according to the kinematics model, the angle of rotation of <b>the</b> directional <b>skirt</b> and <b>the</b> angle <b>skirt</b> is obtained when the wrecked submarine is in different trim and heel angles. Through <b>the</b> directional <b>skirt</b> and angle <b>skirt</b> with <b>the</b> matching rotation can make docking <b>skirt</b> interface in <b>the</b> 0 °~ 2 γ range within the rotation, to complete <b>the</b> docking <b>skirt</b> and <b>the</b> wrecked submarine docking. The MATLAB software is used to visualize the rotation angle of fixed skirt and directional skirt, which lays a good foundation for the development of the control of the double spherical shell rotating docking skirt in future...|$|R

5|$|The {{austerity}} and the passivity of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in <b>the</b> <b>skirt,</b> while wearing red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features a bright red room with red candles and candelabra. While the spiritual and pious Madonna shyly watches the Latinos and prays silently in her room, the passionate Madonna dances and leaves the room to join the dancers in the streets.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best known is Epiphryne verriculata, the cabbage tree moth, which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs {{at the base of}} the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
25|$|Women's {{clothing}} styles {{maintained an}} emphasis on the conical shape of the torso while the shape of <b>the</b> <b>skirts</b> changed throughout <b>the</b> period. The wide panniers (holding <b>the</b> <b>skirts</b> out at <b>the</b> side) for the most part disappeared by 1780 for all but the most formal court functions, and false rumps (bum-pads or hip-pads) were worn for a time.|$|R

25|$|Silhouette later {{began to}} emphasise a slope {{toward the back}} of <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> Polonaise style was {{introduced}} where fullness bunched up at the back of <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> Crinolines and cages also started to disappear with it being more dangerous to working class women. Tournures or bustles were developed.|$|E

25|$|Early model diving masks had {{a single}} {{elliptical}} pane of glass. These masks have indentations in <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> at the bottom {{on either side of}} the nose, into which the diver can insert a thumb and forefinger to pinch the nose, when performing a Valsalva maneuver to clear their ears. This design was improved by bringing the window closer to the face, reducing the volume of air inside the mask, thus making mask clearing easier. The window has a cutout to fit around the nose, which is covered by the rubber or silicone material of <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> This facilitates pinching the nose when ear-clearing.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the steel cage crinoline in 1856 provided a means for expanding <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> still further, and flounces gradually disappeared {{in favor of a}} skirt lying more smoothly over the petticoat and hoops.

25|$|For women, <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> suit or {{dress suit}} are both acceptable; a blouse, {{which can be}} white or {{coloured}}, usually {{takes the place of}} a shirt.

25|$|The Hard and Soft Kankanaey {{also differ}} {{in the way they}} dress. Women's dress of the Soft dialect {{generally}} has a colour combination of black, white and red. The design of the upper attire is a criss-crossed style of black, white and red colors. <b>The</b> <b>skirt</b> or tapis is a combination of stripes of black, white and red.|$|E

25|$|In pre-Columbian Central America Quetzalcoatl was {{sometimes}} depicted as biting its own tail. The mother of Quetzalcoatl was the Aztec goddess Coatlicue ("the one with <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> of serpents"), {{also known as}} Cihuacoatl ("The Lady of the serpent"). Quetzalcoatl's father was Mixcoatl ("Cloud Serpent"). He was identified with the Milky Way, {{the stars and the}} heavens in several Mesoamerican cultures.|$|E
25|$|However, when 1877 approached, dresses moulded {{to fit the}} figure, as {{increasing}} slimmer silhouettes were favoured. This was allowed by {{the invention of the}} cuirass bodice which functions like a corset, but extends downwards to the hips and upper thighs. Although dress styles took on a more natural form, the narrowness of <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> limited the wearer in regards to walking.|$|E
25|$|The bustle made a re-appearance in 1883, and it {{featured}} a further exaggerated horizontal protrusion {{at the back}}. Due to the additional fullness, drapery moved towards the sides or front panel of <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> instead. Any drapery at the back was lifted up into poufs. Bodices on the other hand, shortened and ended above the hips. Yet the style remained tailored, but was more structured.|$|E
