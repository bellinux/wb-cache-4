Our results show that major alterations occur in the CTL and TCR V beta repertoire following BT.

Together with current approaches to diminish host preparative immunosuppression before stem cell transplant, issues regarding the cells and effector pathways involved in resistance to progenitor cell presence in recipients are of increasing interest. The present investigation addressed {{questions concerning the}} contribution of cytotoxic effector mechanisms used by host cells involved in resistance to progenitor cell engraftment. A murine model was developed in which short-term resistance against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -matched allogeneic T cell [...] depleted marrow was examined using a sensitive in vitro assay to detect progenitor cell presence by colony formation in vitro. Resistance {{was found to be}} dependent on previous priming to donor nonMHC antigens and could be transferred by a CD 3 +NK 1. 1 - population. The resistance mechanism explicitly discriminated between donor and syngeneic progenitors after mixed marrow transplantation. Interestingly, the resistance was not impaired in animals unable to mediate cell-mediated cytotoxicity involving perforin-dependent or CD 95 L-dependent pathways. These results indicate that either cytotoxic effector pathway alone is sufficient to effect marrow allograft resistance or that non-perforin and CD 95 L effector mechanisms are responsible for barrier activity. The findings are discussed with respect to previous studies concerning T-cell involvement in resistance to MHC and hematopoietic histoincompatible-mismatched marrow grafts.

40|$|In resource-limited {{settings}} {{and in the}} military theater, fresh human whole blood is commonly transfused, but infectious risks are a concern. Sophisticated molecular testing for potential infectious agents in the whole blood is often unavailable. To address this unmet need, pathogen reduction technology (PRT) has been developed, {{and it is an}} effective approach to inactivate a broad range of pathogens found in human blood. However, studies are needed to determine if it is harmful to blood cells and whether these cells could damage the <b>transfused</b> <b>recipient,</b> including the development of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this study, we used a commercial PRT system to treat human whole blood that was then transfused into immunodeficient mice, and the development of acute lung injury was determined. In a model of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), BALB/c SCID mice developed more robust lung injury when challenged with a MHC Class I monoclonal antibody compared to BALB/c wild-type and NOD/SCID mice. Transfusion of control versus Mirasol PRT-treated whole blood (25 % blood volume exchange) into BALB/c SCID mice did not produce lung injury at storage day 1. However, mild lung injury at storage days 14 and 21 was observed without significant differences in lung injury measurements between Mirasol PRT-treated and control groups. The mild storage-dependent acute lung injury correlated with trends for increased levels of cell-free hemoglobin that accumulated in both the control and Mirasol PRT-treated groups. Neutrophil extracellular traps were elevated in the plasma of BALB/c SCID mice in the monoclonal antibody TRALI model, but were not different in mice that received exchange transfusions.

40|$|BACKGROUND:HLA {{antibodies}} passively {{transferred to}} <b>transfused</b> <b>recipients</b> may cause transfusion reactions such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), {{but in many}} of the reported TRALI incidents, no white blood cell antibodies have been identified. We investigated whether a higher number of anti-HLA would be detected in donor's plasma by using a method with potential higher sensitivity rate. STUDY DESIGN and METHODS:Sera from 300 previously pregnant female blood donors were screened for anti-HLA using a solid-phase mixed-antigen assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]). Samples from 60 women with three or more pregnancies with a negative ELISA were further tested using microbead-flow assays (LABScreen mixed, panel-reactive antibodies [PRA], and single antigen). RESULTS:Anti-HLA Class I and/or Class II were detected by ELISA in 26. 7 % (80 / 300) of all women and in 37. 0 % (37 / 100) of women with three or more pregnancies. the LABScreen assays detected additional anti-HLA specificities (44 Class I and 17 Class II) in 28. 3 % (17 / 60) of ELISA-negative donors with three or more pregnancies. HLA antibodies were detected in 8. 3 % (5 / 60), 18. 3 % (11 / 60), and 21. 7 % (13 / 60) of ELISA-negative women by LABScreen mixed, PRA, or single antigen, respectively. CONCLUSION:Our data showed that the microbead-flow detected more HLA antibodies than ELISA, but the clinical significance of these antibodies is currently unknown. Detecting anti-HLA is useful for donor management and could contribute to the decision to definitively defer blood donors involved in TRALI incidents. However, further studies are necessary to better determinate the relative risk of TRALI induced by anti-HLA detected only by techniques with higher sensitivity rate.

40|$|Transfusion with {{donor blood}} before {{transplantation}} can prolong {{the survival of}} renal allografts in the rat. The phenomenon is donor specific. We have investigated the effect of blood transfusion on both lymphocyte proliferation and the generation of donor-specific cytotoxic cells. In the first instance the kinetics of the proliferative responses of lymph node, spleen and thoracic duct lymph (TDL) leucocytes (harvested 7 days after transfusion of donor-specific blood, third-party allogeneic blood, syngeneic blood or no treatment) to lymph node stimulator cells were determined in a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). Four strain combinations (LEW to DA, LEW to PVG, PVG to DA and DA to PVG) were investigated in this study. Maximal proliferation was observed at 4 days in the MLC and this was not altered by prior blood transfusion. When lymph node and TDL cells from <b>transfused</b> <b>recipients</b> were used as responders and stimulation was provided by cells from the same strain of rat as the blood donor, {{there was a significant}} depression of the MLC response compared to the response of cells harvested from untreated animals or animals given a syngeneic blood transfusion. This correlated with the behaviour of renal allografts in the same strain combinations. Lymph node and TDL cells harvested from rats that had received a third-party blood transfusion produced variable results in the MLC, ranging from a normal to a depressed response. No prolongation of allograft survival was noted in any animals pretreated with third-party blood. In contrast, when spleen cells were used as responder cells there was a donor-specific increase in the proliferative response on Day 4 in all strain combinations tested. In the second instance, specific cytotoxic activity was generated by in vitro (MLC) stimulation of lymph node or TDL, but not spleen, cell responders harvested from transfused or untreated rats. The activity of cytotoxic cells generated in MLC was quantified in a 51 Cr-release assay, using Con A blast lymph node target cells prepared from animals of the same strain as the blood donor or a third-party strain. The specific cytotoxic activity generated was significantly increased when the responding cells were harvested from an animal that had received a donor-specific transfusion and then been restimulated by the blood donor in MLC.

The current selection process is concerned principally with {{the safety of the}} blood donor at the time of donation and of the recipient at the time of transfusion. Recent evidence suggests that the characteristics of the donor may affect short- and long-term transfusion outcomes for the <b>transfused</b> <b>recipient.</b> We conducted a systematic review with the primary objective of assessing the association between blood donor characteristics and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases and performed manual searches of top transfusion journals for all available prospective and retrospective studies. We described study characteristics, methodological quality, and risk of bias and provided study-level effect estimates and, when appropriate, pooled estimates with 95 % confidence intervals using the Mantel-Haenszel or inverse variance approach. The overall quality of the evidence was graded using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. From 6121 citations identified by our literature search, 59 studies met our eligibility criteria (50 observational, 9 interventional). We identified the evaluation of association of 17 donor characteristics on RBC transfusion outcome. The risk of bias and confounding of the included studies was high. The quality of evidence was graded as very low to low for all 17 donor characteristics. Potential associations were observed for donor sex with reduced survival at 90 days and 6 months in male recipients that receive donated blood from females (hazard ratio 2. 60 [1. 09, 6. 20] and hazard ratio 2. 40 [1. 10, 5. 24], respectively; n = 1), Human Leukocyte Antigen - antigen D Related (HLA-DR) selected transfusions (odds ratio [OR] 0. 39 [0. 15, 0. 99] for the risk of transplant alloimmunization, n = 9), presence of antileukocyte antibodies (OR 5. 84 [1. 66, 20. 59] for risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury, n = 4), and donor RBC antigens selection (OR 0. 20 [0. 08, 0. 52] for risk of alloimmunization, n = 4).

Left ventricular mass index (p = 0. 001), maximal wall thickness (p = 0. 006) and the proportion with mitral annular calcification (p = 0. 001) were significantly higher in the non-survivors. The risk factors for ischaemic heart disease and exercise test data {{were not significantly different}} between the two groups. Four independent predictors of mortality after renal transplantation were identified: age 50 years (p = 0. 002), LVESD 3. 5 cm (p = 0. 002), maximal wall thickness 1. 4 cm (p = 0. 014) and mitral annular calcification (p = 0. 036). The 5 -year survival estimates for 0, 1, 2 and 3 prognostic factors were 96 %, 86 %, 69 % and 38 %, respectively. No patient had four prognostic factors. In patients 50 years, the 5 -year survival estimates for 0, 1 and 2 additional prognostic factors were 73 %, 45 % and 18 %, respectively. Conclusion: In addition to selection according to current guidelines, age and three conventional echocardiography parameters may further improve risk stratification before renal transplantation.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Sudden death (SD) {{and acute}} {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI) are the main complications limiting long-term survival after heart transplantation (HT). They are unpredictable and, at present, unpreventable. Platelet aggregation (PA) has recently emerged as a significant prognostic indicator in nontransplanted coronary disease patients. The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate to what extent PA could predict SD and AMI in long-term survivors of HT independently of serum lipid levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 207 patients. All received triple immunosuppressive therapy. During follow-up, the incidence of SD and AMI was determined, and the independent role of PA as predictor was evaluated with other usual risk factors by a Cox multivariate regression model. There were 11 SDs and 14 AMIs after an average follow-up of 642 days, giving an average incidence rate of 7. 3 events per year per hundred patients. By univariate analysis, the most potent predictors were ADP-induced platelet aggregation (positive association) and total cholesterol (negative association). Age and length of time since transplant were not predictors. By multivariate analysis, only the secondary wave of ADP-induced platelet aggregation (P =. 001) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P =. 03) were independent predictors. The relative risk of SD or AMI based on a comparison between patients with high (> 36 %) or low (< 36 %) ADP-induced platelet aggregation was 4. 3 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 9 to 9. 5, P =. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first demonstration of an association between increased platelet aggregation and subsequent SD or AMI in HT recipients. It suggests that platelets and thrombosis also are implicated in the pathogenesis of AMI and SD in HT <b>recipients.</b> <b>Identification</b> of a safe and effective antiplatelet therapy should be actively pursued...|$|R
40|$|Although blood {{transfusion}} can be lifesaving, it involves risks such as transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). In late 2003 in Korea, 4 units of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) -infected blood were <b>transfused</b> to <b>recipients</b> during the window period. At that time, it was also disclosed that many unqualified blood products had been supplied to hospitals [1]. These serious incidents prompted enactment of the National Blood Safety Improvement Projects {{by the government in}} 2004. In this issue of Blood Research, Kim et al. report a performance review of the 5 -year project (2004 – 2009) to improve safety of blood supply provided by the Korea Red Cross (KRC) and other blood centers [2]. The project consists of 5 major categories: blood donor recruitment, blood testing and manufacturing, blood supply and use, enhancement of blood service expertise, and government responsibility for the national blood program. Our government has provided enormous financial support to implement this project. As a result, the number of blood collection centers has increased up to 127 nationwide, and blood-testing centers have been consolidated and upgraded. Furthermore, the Blood Information Sharing System (BISS) has been successfully established for networking between KRC and hospital blood centers; this system facilitates blood ordering and inquiry of donor eligibility. Nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) was started in 2005 and that for hepatitis B virus (HBV) was started in 2012...|$|R
40|$|Inappropriate {{neutrophil}} activation {{has been}} implicated in the pathology of several clinically important inflammatory conditions. Although murine models are extensively used {{in the investigation of}} such pathological processes, a reliable method by which viable, quiescent neutrophils can be isolated from murine blood has not been developed. Here we describe a novel method based on negative immunomagnetic separation, which yields highly pure populations of murine neutrophils. Blood is incubated with a cocktail of antibodies against specific cell markers on unwanted cells, and then with secondary antibody-coated magnetic beads. After running the preparation through a column within a magnetic field, labeled cells are retained, and a neutrophil-rich effluent is collected. This method yields a > 95 % pure suspension of > 97 % viable neutrophils, recovering ∼ 70 % of neutrophils from whole blood. Flow cytometric analysis shows little difference in surface L-selectin and CD 18 expression on isolated neutrophils compared with neutrophils in whole blood, indicating that neutrophils are minimally activated bythe isolation process. Stimulation with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) reduced L-selectin andincreased CD 18 expression. Isolated neutrophilsmigrate under agarose in response to fMLP, and fluorescently labeled neutrophils <b>transfused</b> into <b>recipient</b> mice interact with postcapillary venules in a manner comparable to endogenous leukocytes. These findings show that neutrophils isolated using this method can be used for inflammatory studies in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Donors and {{recipients}} {{were asked}} to complete questionnaires regarding symptoms and risk factors for infection and to provide blood samples for laboratory analysis. RESULTS: Among National Guard personnel who donated blood, 12 individuals were found to have a confirmed or probable case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever or ehrlichiosis. A total of 320 units (platelets or packed red cells) from 377 donors were <b>transfused</b> into 129 <b>recipients.</b> Although 10 recipients received units from National Guard personnel with confirmed or probable infection, none became ill. CONCLUSION: Transfusion-transmitted illness did not occur. Despite the awareness of the risk for tick-borne diseases and the use of tick-preventive measures, many National Guard personnel reported exposure to ticks. In addition to augmenting current tick-preventive measures, scheduling blood drives before rather than after field exercises could further reduce the potential for transmission of tick-borne pathogens...|$|R
