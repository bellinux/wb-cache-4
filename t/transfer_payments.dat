30|$|The {{existing}} literatures mainly {{focus on}} the effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on local financial efficiency. This paper studies the different efficiencies of three kinds of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> systems. In China’s current financial <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system, there are three kinds of transfer payments: tax refund, categorical <b>transfer</b> <b>payment,</b> and condition payment. The proportion of tax refund since the tax reform in 1994 is continually declining while the other two kinds of payment are increasing. It is of great significance to study the effect of structural changes in <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on financial efficiency in order to optimize the form of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> and improve the financial funds efficiency. The following structure of this paper is as follows: based on the present literature research, the second part measures the financial efficiency with the SE-DEA model and analyzes the change trend of overall efficiency of fiscal funds. The third part constructs the theory model of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure’s effect on local government’s expenditure behavior and analyzes how the change of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure affect local government fiscal efficiency in the condition of unchanged amount of central <b>transfer</b> <b>payment.</b> The fourth part uses the quantile regression method to empirically test the relationship between <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure and local financial efficiency. The firth part summarizes the conclusions and briefly describes the significance of this study.|$|R
5|$|In 1927, Earle Page {{handed down}} the first budget in deficit for the {{coalition}} government, and Bruce recognised that Australia's economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia's level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the debt problem. By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a National Loan Council in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments to the states, {{to be replaced by}} a funding formula tied more to financial need. These two changes formed the Financial Agreement of 1927, the provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth <b>transfer</b> <b>payments,</b> after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.|$|E

25|$|Since {{joining the}} EU in 1973, Ireland has {{received}} over €17 billion in EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These {{are made up}} of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) and were used to increase investment in the education system and to build physical infrastructure. These <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> from members of the European Union, such as Germany and France, were as high as 4% of Ireland's gross national product (GNP). Ireland is unique among cohesion countries, having allocated up to 35% of its Structural Funds to human resource investments, compared with an average of around 25% for other cohesion fund recipients. The Irish economy's increased productive capacity is sometimes attributed to these investments, which made Ireland more attractive to high-tech businesses, though the libertarian Cato Institute has suggested that the EU <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> were economically inefficient and may have actually slowed growth. The conservative Heritage Foundation also attributed to <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> no significant role in causing growth.|$|E
30|$|China’s biased of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> {{system is}} mainly {{reflected}} in two aspects. Firstly, <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> {{from the central}} government to the local government is bias towards wealthier regions. Empirical evidence shows that regions with higher per capita GDP (mainly referring to {{the eastern part of}} China) are likely to receive more <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> from the central government than regions with lower per capita GDP (mainly referring to the central and western regions, especially the western region); in short, rich areas get more <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> (Luo and Cao 2006). Such biased <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system is likely to widen the gap between {{the rich and the poor}} and the degree of urbanization between more developed regions and less developed regions. Western China is the region with the smallest per capita GDP and the lowest level of urbanization, and thus, instead of receiving the least amount of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment,</b> it should receive a greater proportion; otherwise, the current <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system harms the western regions more than it harms any other region.|$|R

30|$|Since {{the central}} <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> has the double goal of “fairness” and “efficiency” (Zhu, 1997), {{not only the}} “efficiency”, but also the “fairness” {{should be taken into}} consideration. The {{domestic}} literature on <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> having fairness effect (Yin et al. 2007; Jia, 2009) has indicated that tax refund and condition grant is the way of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> that is most unequal. In combined with the results, the policy can be acquired: the categorical grant is conductive to fairness, and tax refund is more conductive to efficiency. But the condition grant has neither fairness nor efficiency. The direction of optimizing the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure is to reduce the proportion of condition grant while increasing that of categorical grant or tax refund.|$|R

30|$|Since the {{tax reform}} in 1994, the basic pattern with the revenue {{centralization}} and expenditure decentralization {{in the relationship}} between the central and local allocation gradually formed. Local government has undertaken the responsibility of providing most of public service in a local region. The <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system that is also known as the fiscal <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system or local <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system from central to local has been established and gradually perfected. Because of the large difference between different financial local governments, the government in the poverty-stricken areas appeared to be inadequate and the ability to regulate the income gap is minimal, which heavily depends on the central transfer. The data from the ministry of finance show that the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> from the central government to the local government in 2014 reaches 4.66 billion yuan. In 2015, it is expected to reach 5.1 billion yuan. 1 Nevertheless, China’s long-term Gini coefficient is higher than the international warning line with 0.4. The Gini coefficient of residents issued by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2014 is 0.469, and the income gap between urban and rural areas is still serious, which indicates that on the one hand, the current income distribution in China still has a lot of convergence space. On the other hand, we should also examine the impact of the current <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system on the income gap. At {{the beginning of the year}} of 2015, the State Council issued the “opinions on the reform and promotion of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system from central to local,” which is committed to further improve the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system, especially to promote the interregional equalization of basic public services as the main target and to promote the sustained and healthy development of economy and society. Therefore, the research on the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment’s</b> effect on the income gap between urban and rural areas has important theoretical and practical significance, which is related to the implementation of fiscal policy to promote the balanced development of regional economy and also is directly related with the prospect and future of China’s economic growth.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> {{structure}} on the financial efficiency of local government. Analyzing the data of financial <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure, this paper found that the way and structure of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> from central to local government changes obviously. The proportion of tax refund is decreased from 73.7 % in 1995 to 11.3 % in 2012. The proportion of categorical grant and condition grant is increased. Tax refund is no longer the major way of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> from central to local government. After calculating the efficiency of national financial fund by the model of EDA, this paper found that the overall efficiency of China’s financial capital showed a downward trend. Based on the theory of consumer behavior analyzing the financial expenditure, the reason of declining financial funds is analyzed and two hypotheses about the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure on financial efficiency is put forward: one is that in the situation of size of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> and tax refund unchanged, increasing the categorical grant while decreasing the condition grant with similar size could make the efficiency of financial funds be lower than the original level. The other is that due to a certain cost needed in local government completing for the central subsidy, the tax refund is transformed into the categorical grant and condition grant, which leads to low financial efficiency of local government. Based on the theoretical analysis, this paper uses the regression method with the panel data and mixed data {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure and financial efficiency. The empirical results show that tax refund has a significant positive correlation with financial efficiency of local government, which indicates the declining proportion of tax refund the one of reasons that financial efficiency is declining. Moreover, the empirical results has not supported the hypothesis that condition grant has significant difference with categorical grant. The possible reason is that in the appropriation of condition grant, central government pays more attention to fairness rather than efficiency.|$|R
