25|$|ACTB is {{a highly}} complex locus. A number of pseudogenes exist that are {{distributed}} throughout the genome, and its sequence contains six exons <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> rise to up to 21 different transcriptions by alternative splicing, which are known as the β-actins.

A new form of actin has been discovered, kappa actin, which appears to substitute for β-actin in processes relating to tumours.|$|E

25|$|The {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of 2,3,5-substituted pyrroles {{was achieved}} by the recognition that such substrates bear the same substitution pattern as 2-substituted indoles, and an asymmetric hydrogenation system that is effective {{for one of these}} substrates might be effective for both. Such an analysis {{led to the development of}} a ruthenium(I)/phosphine/amine base system for 2,3,5-substituted N-Boc pyrroles <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> either dihydro or tetrahydropyrroles (pyrrolidines), depending on the nature of the pyrrole substituents. An all-phenyl substitution pattern leads to dihydropyrroles in very high yield (>96%) and essentially perfect enantioselectivity. Access to the fully hydrogenated, all-cis dihydropyrrole may then be accessible through diastereoselective heterogeneous hydrogenation. Alkyl substitution may lead to either the dihydro or tetrahydropyrrole, although the yields (>70%) and enantioselectivities (often >90%) generally remain high. The regioselectivity in both cases appears to be governed by sterics, with the less-substituted double being preferentially hydrogenated.|$|E
25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E

500|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{has had a}} {{controversial}} history in Tuscan wine, particularly for {{its role in the}} arrivals of [...] "Super Tuscan" [...] in the mid-1970s. The origin of Super Tuscans is rooted in the restrictive DOC practices of the Chianti zone prior to the 1990s. During this time Chianti could be composed of no more than 70% Sangiovese and had to include at least 10% of one of the local white wine grapes. Many Tuscan wine producers thought they could produce a better quality wine if they were not hindered by the DOC regulations, particularly if they had the freedom to use Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend and not required to use white grape varieties. The marchese Piero Antinori {{was one of the first}} to create a [...] "Chianti-style" [...] wine that ignored the DOC regulations, releasing a 1971 Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon blend known as Tignanello in 1978. Other producers followed suit and soon the prices for these Super Tuscans were consistently beating the prices of some of the most well known Chianti. Other Tuscan wine regions followed suit, blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and even making varietal versions of the grape. Gradually the DOC system caught on and began allowing more regions to use the grape in their DOC designated wines. Cabernet Sauvignon in Tuscany is characterized by ripe black cherry flavors <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> a perception of sweetness as well as strong notes of blackcurrant. The wines typically reach an alcohol level around 14% but can still maintain notable levels of acidity. When blended with Sangiovese in significant quantities, Cabernet Sauvignon can dominate the blend with most Tuscan producers aiming to find a particular balance that suits their desired style.|$|E
500|$|The CPC's {{organizational}} {{principle is}} democratic centralism, {{which is based}} on two principles; democracy (synonymous in official discourse with [...] "socialist democracy" [...] and [...] "inner-party democracy") and centralism. This has been the guiding organizational principle of the party since the 5th National Congress, held in 1927. In the words of the party constitution, [...] "The Party is an integral body organized under its program and constitution and on the basis of democratic centralism". Mao once quipped that democratic centralism was [...] "at once democratic and centralized, with the two seeming opposites of democracy and centralization united in a definite form." [...] Mao claimed that the superiority of democratic centralism lay in its internal contradictions, between democracy and centralism, and freedom and discipline. Currently, the CPC is claiming that [...] "democracy is the lifeline of the Party, the lifeline of socialism". But for democracy to be implemented, and functioning properly, there needs to be centralization. The goal of democratic centralism was not to obliterate capitalism or its policies but instead it is the movement towards regulating capitalism while involving socialism and democracy. [...] Democracy in any form, the CPC claims, needs centralism, since without centralism there will be no order. According to Mao, democratic centralism [...] "is centralized on the basis of democracy and democratic under centralized guidance. This is the only system <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> full expression to democracy with full powers vested in the people's congresses at all levels and, at the same time, guarantee centralized administration with the governments at each level exercising centralized management of all the affairs entrusted to them by the people's congresses at the corresponding level and safeguarding whatever is essential to the democratic life of the people".|$|E
