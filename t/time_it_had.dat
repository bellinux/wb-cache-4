5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the natural history of the Borneo shark. It is {{viviparous}} like other requiem sharks; the females bear litters of six pups, which are provisioned through gestation by a placental connection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this species as Endangered, at which <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> not been seen since 1937. While an extant population has since been found, the Borneo shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly limited range within heavily fished waters.|$|E

5|$|In October 2010, Microsoft {{suggested}} {{on one of}} its websites that a Windows Phone {{version of}} Angry Birds was in development.

5|$|On June 12, 2003, NOAA {{published}} a forecast for the East Pacific hurricane season, the first <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> done so.

This {{was the first}} time the country has entered more than a single athlete, with skiers Lamine Guèye and Alphonse Gomis both taking part. The lack of support staff meant that Guèye sought medical assistance from another team. Neither competitors won a medal, and Gomis was noted by the media for the number of falls he had on the slopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{proposed}} by the North London Railway (NLR). The line originally opened as the East & West India Docks & Birmingham Junction Railway in 1850, in order to transport freight between the London and Birmingham Railway and the London Docklands. By the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been renamed to the NLR in 1853, passenger traffic had grown in equal importance, so {{it was decided to}} build a station with direct access to the City.|$|E

5|$|Three spacewalks were {{conducted}} by the crew of STS-97, {{all of which were}} completed prior to opening the hatch between shuttle and station. On 8 December, the hatch between the two was opened and the two crews greeted each other for the first <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> <b>had</b> remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures. The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle, which was thought to be good for their psychological well-being.|$|E
5|$|With {{ten minutes}} remaining, he was reintroduced by manager Mickey Harte, {{likely due to}} his {{experience}} as {{the only member of}} the team who had played in an All-Ireland final before. This reintroduction, while not the first <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> happened (blood substitutions had been used sporadically, for example), was seen as one of the greatest moments in the GAA in the last forty years.|$|E
5|$|Work {{on major}} {{facilities}} at Jacquinot Bay began in December. These were {{to include a}} large dock, an airstrip, buildings {{to be used by}} 2/8th General Hospital and stores depots. By this <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been decided to stockpile sufficient stores at Jacquinot Bay to support 13,000 soldiers for 60 days. Work on the airstrip was completed in May 1945. Two squadrons of Corsair fighter aircraft from the Royal New Zealand Air Force were later based there.|$|E

5|$|A {{scheme to}} {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter to round up people from Portland saloons, and then {{take them to the}} land office where they would register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
5|$|As Pellew's {{squadron}} neared Griessie, {{a message}} {{arrived from the}} Dutch civilian governor at Sourabaya, reversing Cowell's orders and offering a full surrender. Pellew accepted the message and on 7 December his ships entered Griessie. However, during the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> taken to exchange messages, Cowell had ordered that all shipping in Griessie harbour be destroyed to prevent the British gaining control of it. The ships were scuttled in shallow water, leaving only wrecked hulls for the British to claim. Pellew ordered the hulls burned, and British landing parties investigated the town, burning and destroying all military supplies and cannon they found. Another party landed at Sambelangan and demolished the battery there. Pellew withdrew on 11 December, his ambition of destroying the Dutch naval presence in the East Indies complete.|$|E
5|$|By {{the next}} day, Mackay {{realised}} {{that the position}} could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with {{the security of the}} new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were severe enough for him to be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Sam (JTWC designation: 03S) was {{an intense}} {{tropical}} cyclone that brought flooding rainfall {{to a wide}} swath of northern Australia in December2000. The first tropical cyclone of the regional season, Sam originated from a tropical low that formed in the Arafura Sea on 28November. Tracking generally westward, the initial low-pressure area remained generally weak until it entered the Timor Sea, by which <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 5December. Though a subtropical ridge was forcing the cyclone westward at the time, an approaching shortwave trough caused Sam to track southward the following day, towards the Australian coast. During its southward progression, Sam rapidly intensified, and reached its peak intensity on 8December. Soon afterwards, the storm made landfall near Lagrange, Western Australia at the same intensity. Once inland, Sam was slow to weaken as it re-curved eastward, and persisted for nearly a week inland before dissipating on 14December.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{in the face}} of the {{emerging}} Cold War scenario, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> also become apparent that newly developed jet propulsion would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of the success of}} the legislation, most of the 333,456 large cents struck in 1857 never left the Philadelphia Mint, and were later melted. Snowden purchased a new set of rollers and other equipment so that the Mint could produce its own cent planchets, the first <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> done so in over 50 years. Although the legislation was still a day from final passage, Snowden recommended Longacre's designs to Guthrie on February 20. Guthrie approved them on the 24th, though he requested that the edge of the coin be made less sharp; Snowden promised to comply. Flying Eagle cents were struck beginning in April 1857 and were held pending official release. The Mint stored the pieces pending accumulation of a sufficient supply; in mid-May, Snowden notified Philadelphia newspapers that distribution would begin on May 25.|$|E
