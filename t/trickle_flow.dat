40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the effect of {{periodic}} liquid feeding on trickle bed fluid mechanical and mass transfer characteristics and on the effect of packing particle shape by comparing data obtained with cylindrical extrudates and with spherical particles. Cylindrical-extrudate particles are employed to study air-water downflow (steady <b>trickling</b> <b>flow)</b> in a packed bed of 14 cm i. d. The effect of particle shape, neglected in the literature so far, is shown to be very significant. A packed bed of extrudates displays significantly greater global dynamic liquid holdup hd and pressure drop, as well as a trickling-to-pulsing transition boundary at higher gas flow rates, compared to beds of spheres of comparable size. Moreover, packed extrudates exhibit a significant increase of holdup, hd, in the axial flow direction, a trend reported {{for the first time as}} there are no similar data available in the literature; on the contrary beds of spherical particles are characterized by practically constant hd in the axial direction. Although an explanation for this hd axial variation is not obvious, one might attribute it to the anisotropy and non-uniformity of interstitial voids of packed cylindrical particles. Comparisons are reported with literature methods for predicting the measured parameters; discrepancies between data and predictions may be partly due to the inadequacy of a single “equivalent” diameter to represent both shape and size of non-spherical particles; predictive methods performing best are also identified. Periodic liquid feeding is investigated – at sufficiently high frequencies to be classified as “fast” mode of induced pulsing – in the range of mean gas and liquid flow rates corresponding to the steady “trickling flow” regime. Detailed information is obtained, on the axial propagation and attenuation of pulses, from instantaneous, cross-sectionally averaged holdup measurements. Key fluid-mechanical parameters studied include, aside from dynamic holdup and pressure drop, pulse celerity and intensity, as a function of fluid feed rates (G, L) and liquid cyclic frequency. Data from previous work for 6 mm glass spheres and 3 mm spheroid particles, are employed for comparison; it is shown that, for the particles examined, particle-size has a pronounced effect, but not as significant as that of particle shape. For particles of comparable volume, the cylindrical shape is associated with much greater global dynamic holdup and pressure drop, and with increased pulse attenuation. Moreover, packed extrudates exhibit a significant increase of holdup in the axial direction, as in the case of steady <b>trickling</b> <b>flow.</b> For spherical particles, both time-average holdup and pulse celerity are practically constant along the bed for fixed liquid and gas flow rates. Pressure drop, global holdup and pulse celerity are not affected by cyclic liquid feeding frequency, for both spherical and cylindrical extrudate particles. For the mass transfer study, experiments aimed at determining local and global liquid/solid mass transfer rates, mainly for the so-called fast mode of periodic liquid feeding. Uniform 6 mm spheres and cylindrical extrudates, of 1. 5 mm diameter and a narrow distribution of lengths, are employed in the tests. For completeness, results are also reported for single-phase (liquid) and <b>trickling</b> <b>flow</b> through the same packed beds. A well-known electrochemical technique is employed to measure instantaneous local mass transfer coefficients by means of quite a few probes distributed throughout the bed. The hydrodynamic characteristics under the above conditions, are helpful in interpreting the new mass transfer data. There is a wide spread of measured local mass transfer rates, in all cases tested, apparently due to packing and flow non-uniformities. This spread is much smaller in the case of packed uniform spheres. In general, the benefits of cyclic liquid feeding are more evident in the packed bed of spheres than in that of cylindrical extrudates; for instance, with increasing mean liquid rate, induced pulsing tends to reduce the spread of local mass transfer coefficients, which suggests that more uniform fluids distribution is promoted. Other trends of local mass transfer rates are identified and discussed in relation to measured variation of liquid holdup, under the same conditions. For packed spheres, the measured global mass transfer rates are in fair agreement with literature correlations obtained for the <b>trickling</b> <b>flow</b> regime, unlike the case of packed extrudates where significant discrepancies are observed. In conclusion, imposed pulsing flow appears to promote a uniform distribution of fluids in the packing characteristics. Moreover, for comparable particle size and mean packing void fraction ε, the uniform spherical shape displays clear advantages over the cylindrical extrudates, both with respect to fluid mechanical parameters and to mass transfer rates. ...|$|R

Agreement and discrepancies are discussed, and, finally, it has been found that the actual PNM approach produces realistic pressure drops as far as inertial contributions to friction are negligible.

40|$|Pulsing flow is {{well known}} for its {{advantages}} in terms of an increase in mass and heat transfer rates, complete catalyst wetting and a decrease in axial dispersion compared to <b>trickle</b> <b>flow.</b> The operation of a trickle-bed reactor in the pulsing flow regime is favorable in terms of a capacity increase and the elimination of hot spots. Extending the knowledge on the hydrodynamic nature and characteristics of pulsing flow stands at the basis of further exploitation of the effects of this flow regime on reactor performance. An analysis of the hydrodynamics of pulsing flow reveals that pulse properties as liquid holdup, velocity and duration, are invariant to the superficial liquid velocity at a constant gas flow rate. The pulse frequency, however, increases with increasing superficial liquid velocity. The relative contribution of the pulses and the parts of the bed in between pulses to an average measured property can thus be obtained. By applying this concept it is shown that the linear liquid velocity inside the pulses varies between 0. 1 and 0. 2 m s- 1. The linear liquid velocity in between pulses, however, is invariant to gas and liquid flow rates and packing properties and equal to about 0. 05 m s- 1. This suggests that a linear liquid velocity of about 0. 05 m s- 1 is the maximum velocity possible in the bed to maintain the <b>trickle</b> <b>flow</b> regime. All liquid in excess is transported as pulses. The liquid holdup in the parts of the bed in between pulses equals the liquid holdup at the transition to pulsing flow at all gas flow rates. The same trend holds for the linear liquid velocity in between pulses. Pulsing flow then is a hybrid of two transition states. The pulses reside at the transition to bubble flow, while the parts of the bed in between pulses reside at the transition to <b>trickle</b> <b>flow.</b> The enhanced particle-liquid heat transfer coefficient inside the pulses is mainly the result of the high linear liquid velocity inside the pulses. Particle-liquid heat transfer rates in between pulses are constant due to the constant linear liquid velocity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trickle</b> <b>flow</b> is {{encountered}} {{in a variety}} of process engineering applications where gas and liquid flow through a packed bed of stationary solid. Owing to the complexities of three interacting phases, a fundamentally exhaustive description of <b>trickle</b> <b>flow</b> hydrodynamics has not been achieved. A complicating factor in describing the hydrodynamics {{is the fact that the}} hydrodynamic state is dependent not only on the present operating conditions but also on their entire history, including fluid flow rate changes and pre-wetting procedures. This phenomenon is termed hydrodynamic multiplicity and is the subject of this work. Hydrodynamic multiplicity greatly complicates both the experimental investigation into the behaviour of a <b>trickle</b> <b>flow</b> column and the theoretical modelling of the observed behaviour. Broadly speaking, this study addresses hydrodynamic multiplicity on three levels. First, a conceptual framework is proposed that can be used to study hydrodynamic multiplicity with limited resources. It is based on the absolute limiting values that the hydrodynamic parameters can adopt for a certain set of conditions, and encompasses both flow rate hysteresis loops and pre-wetting procedures. There are 5 such hydrodynamic modes. When the existing literature is critically evaluated in light of this framework, it is established that the reported experimental studies have not addressed all the issues. Previous modelling attempts are also shown to be unable to qualitative explain all the existing data. Moreover, authors have suggested different (and often contradictory) physical mechanisms responsible for hydrodynamic multiplicity. Secondly, an experimental investigation intended to supplement the existing literature and illustrate the utility of the proposed framework is launched. This includes bed-scale measurements of liquid holdup, pressure drop and gas-liquid mass transfer for a variety of conditions including different flow rates, pressures, particle shapes, particle porosity and surface tension. The second part of the experimental effort uses radiography and tomography in new ways to visualise the temporal and spatial characteristics of the different hydrodynamic modes. The tomographic investigation incorporates advanced image processing techniques in order to culminate in a pore-level evaluation of the hydrodynamic modes that reveals additional features of hydrodynamic multiplicity. Thirdly, the experimental insights are condensed into a set of characteristic trends that highlight the features of hydrodynamic multiplicity. A pore-level capillary mechanism is then introduced to qualitatively explain the observed behaviour. The mechanism shows how the differences in advancing and receding contact angles and the characteristics of the packed structure (or pore geometries) are ultimately responsible for the observed hydrodynamic multiplicity behaviour. Lastly, the effect of hydrodynamic multiplicity on trickle bed reactor performance is discussed. It is established experimentally that depending on the reaction conditions, different modes yield optimal performance. The idea of optimizing the performance by manipulating the hydrodynamic state is introduced. In totality, this work advances the understanding of <b>trickle</b> <b>flow</b> hydrodynamics in general and hydrodynamic multiplicity in particular.

At higher gas densities, the operating region for <b>trickle</b> <b>flow</b> becomes larger while the gas-liquid interfacial area increases only slight-ly. Pressure gradient and liquid hold-up are considerably affected by gas density and correlations have been derived for these parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{properties of}} counter-current gas-solid flow over a regularly stacked packing at <b>trickle</b> <b>flow</b> conditions have been studied. The flow {{properties of the}} solids phase were examined, using five types of solid particles with a mean particle diameter ranging from 70 to 880 pm and a particle density from 800 to 7800 kg mW 3. Data on the solids hold-up and the pressure drop caused by the solids flow were obtained from experiments in a test column of 0. 10 m square cross-section. A particle flow model has been developed based on the momentum equation of a single particle. In this model, particles are assumed to collide regularly with the packing and the mean particle velocity has been derived by taking account of the acceler-ation due to gravity and the drag forces exerted by the upward gas flow. The experi-mental data are described reasonably well by this model {{in the case of}} <b>trickle</b> <b>flow</b> of coarse particles. On the other hand, the flow behaviour of small particles is substantially influenced by particle shielding and solids agglomeration phenomena, resulting in slip velocities well above the single-particle terminal velocity. Generally, the dmg force exerted by the particles on the gas flow is smaller than the net gravitational force for both small and large particles, although for different reasons. As a consequence, the pressure drop caused by the solids flow is generally below the value to be expected for fully suspended particles...|$|E
50|$|This {{aquatic insect}} is about 6 {{millimeters}} long. It does not fly. It {{lives in the}} Point of Rocks Springs at Ash Meadows, {{where it can be}} found in a few channels of flowing water measuring no more than 0.3 meters wide by 10 meters long. It was restricted to these <b>trickles</b> when the <b>flowing</b> spring water was channelized and impounded. Ten acres have been designated critical habitat for this insect.|$|R
25|$|Though Thompson's {{books were}} {{falling out of}} print in the United States, the French had {{discovered}} his works. Though they were not runaway bestsellers in France, his books did sell well enough in that country to keep a <b>trickle</b> of royalties <b>flowing</b> towards Thompson. Incidentally, Polito also debunks the myth that Thompson was not paid well for his works: Thompson's pay, he notes, was roughly {{in line with what}} writers of similar works received during that era. Rather, Thompson's drinking and general instability are what left him destitute.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the longest}} {{permanent}} {{river in the}} Northern Territory, as defined by international standards, is the Katherine/Daly River. This is a single river with two separating (at the Flora River tributary) European names. This great river was, until recently, deemed as two separate rivers due to the European naming conventions of the time. Its journey begins just south of Jabiru, high in the Arnhem Land escarpment as a <b>trickle</b> until it <b>flows</b> into the Timor Sea some 690 km later, thus making it 130 km longer than the Victoria River.|$|R
