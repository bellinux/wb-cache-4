50|$|Robert Ryan {{developed}} and executed a structured plan {{that led to}} over a decade of steady geographic and product growth with sustained and growing profitability. He identified, secured financing, negotiated and successfully acquired and merged six struggling companies resulting in the rapid growth and profitability of the parent company - steadily transforming a small computer service bureau into the world leader of electronic mail services with offices in nineteen countries. Dialcom was the first email service offered in the US or any other country and it controlled 35% and 98% US and international email market share respectively. International expansion was accomplished through strategic partnerships and joint ventures with the governmental telecommunications bodies in all major telecommunications consuming countries. Robert Ryan {{developed and}} negotiated all international licenses and partnerships. Market growth and profitability was constant through these intense periods of geographic and product expansion. In 1982 Robert Ryan negotiated the sale of Dialcom to ITT and remained as CEO for three years. Concurrent with Dialcom and {{with the support of}} the Dialcom Board of Directors Robert Ryan was Co-Founder & President of Source <b>Telecomputing</b> Corporation. In concert with William VonMeister (deceased) Robert Ryan conceived, financed, designed, and implemented “The Source” - America’s first consumer oriented information service - the direct predecessor of AOL. After achieving dominant market share in its first year of operation, “The Source” was sold by management to Readers Digest. Mr Ryan has to date started or managed (at C level positions) over a dozen companies during his ongoing career. He is a long-standing supporter of entrepreneurship and has worked with educational institutions to further his beliefs.|$|E
40|$|The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) 1 {{provides}} point-to-point digital {{communications and}} its most attractive feature {{is its ability}} to simultaneously transmit voice, images, video and data on existing telephone lines. The existing analog modems are suitable mainly for batch oriented and low speed <b>telecomputing</b> tasks but for tasks like high speed <b>telecomputing</b> and WWW browsing, they are ineffective. Leased circuits if used usually have higher installation and other recurring costs. For such applications ISDN presents an attractive technology that delivers the required speed in a cost effective, viable manner. In this paper we evaluate several ISDN applications and compare their performance with other current technologies. Our analysis shows that ISDN is efficient and cost effective technology to deliver information services at high speed, by comparing its performance with existing high speed alternatives. keywords: ISDN, Video Conferencing, <b>Telecomputing.</b> 1 Introduction [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Software {{architecture}} styles {{for developing}} multiuser applications are usually defined at a conceptual level, abstracting such low-level issues of distributed implementation as code replication, caching strategies and concurrency control policies. Ultimately, such conceptual architectures must be cast into code. The iterative design inherent in interactive systems implies that significant evolution {{will take place}} at the conceptual level. Equally, however, evolution occurs at the implementation level in order to tune performance. This paper introduces Dragonfly, a software architecture style that maintains a tight, bidirectional link between conceptual and implementation software architectures, allowing evolution to be performed at either level.

40|$|The {{worlds of}} {{telephony}} and of computer systems profoundly {{differ in their}} approach to providing service quality. For decades, traditional telecommunication systems have reliably delivered telephony services by using specialized, expensive equipment and software. With the advent of low cost and high performance computers, it has become conceivable to deliver similar and more powerful services using computer systems constructed with off-the-shelf components (<b>telecomputing</b> systems). However, this cannot be done by service providers without strengthening the approach of computer networks to service delivery and service quality. In this paper, the two worlds are analyzed and contrasted along multiple dimensions. While the reconciliation between the two world must happen along all these dimensions, a case study is given {{in the area of}} service dependability. The approach to dependability described here has several ingredients. The service software model consists of a service object using performers to perform service actions. The service objects execute on scaleable service platform clusters, and the performers execute on scaleable resource servers. The dependability of the services is provided mostly through software by resource availability management, service platform availability management, and service object management. The feasibility of the approach strongly hinges on the ability of the recovery software to assess the survivability of the system’s components. Over time, one can expect off-the-shelf components to come equipped with standard survivability “assessment windows. ” In a similar way, the other differences between the worlds of telephony and of computing need to be bridged, if one hopes to enable service providers to deliver <b>telecomputing</b> services in a cost effective way...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{prevalence}} of <b>telecomputing</b> technologies presents instructors {{with a wide}} range of options for enhancing the learning experience of students in the Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy curricula, particularly in large-class settings. However, this wealth of technological resources consists largely of discrete tools developed for purposes other than instruction, and therefore instructors are challenged to devise a unified, integrated approach that both accommodates the very diverse experience and capabilities of students, and satisfies the instructor’s need for resilient, robust, and low-maintenance technologies. We describe here an integrated application of technologies for presenting Internet-based resources to students in Pharmaceutical Mathematics and Statistics, a course that serves approximately 100 students per semester in the School of Pharmacy at the State University of New York at Buffalo. We discuss the integration of specific resources with each other and with traditional classroom learning. World Wide Web (WWW) pages are used as repositories both for supplemental material and for archived discussions. Communication among students and instructors is managed via both direct, individual electronic mail (e-mail) and via group-distributed (Listserv) e-mail. By these means, several objectives have been achieved. Communication among students and instructors was enhanced, and discussion among students was promoted. Ancillary course materials were provided to students in a timely and resource-conserving manner, and rapid feedback was provided to students following learning assessment exercises such as exams and quizzes. The model used for integrating Internet-based technologies in this Pharmaceutical Calculations course could be applicable to a variety of large class situations in pharmaceutical education...|$|E

40|$|The Teacher Enhancement Institute (TEI), {{under the}} {{direction}} of the Center Education Programs Officer offered three two-week workshops to 58 elementary and middle school teachers in science, math, and technology using the Problem Based Learning Model. The 1995 program was designed with input from evaluations and recommendations from previous TEI participants and faculty. The TEI focused on Aviation and Aeronautics as the unifying theme. Four specific objectives were developed. After completing the requirements for the TEI, the participants should be able to: (1) Increase their content knowledge, particularly in aeronautics, science, math, and technology; (2) Design and implement lessons that use scientific inquiry through Problem Based Learning; (3) Demonstrate knowledge of instructional technologies, their uses, and applications to curricula; and (4) Disseminate to their school communities the information acquired through the TEI. Thirty percent of the program was devoted to the effective use of computer technology. SpaceLink, the NASA <b>telecomputing</b> service for educators, was the primary tool used in the technology component of the institute. The training focused on the use of SpaceLink and its many educational services, and Internet tools because of its universal, nongraphical link to any computer plafform the participant may use at his or her school or home. All participants were given Educator Accounts to facilitate the use of E-mail, and access to the Internet and the World Wide Web using their SpaceLink accounts. Classroom demonstrations used videotaped guides and handouts to support concepts presented followed by intensive hands-on activities. Each participant was assigned to an individual Power Mac networked workstation and introduced to the state of the art, graphical, Word Wide Web with the Netscape browser. The methodology proved very effective in reaching the program's goals for technology integration by having the participants learn to use the computer as a tool for communication and research rather than teaching the use of any particular software application alone. However, because of the skill level of the majority of the participants, more hands-on computer time is recommended for future Teacher Enhancement Institutes...|$|E
