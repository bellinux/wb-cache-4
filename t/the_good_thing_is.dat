Luckily, Burn One already had those beats sitting in my e-mail to give it that sound, and then I really took the words to it. The difference from this and other projects is really being in a time crunch.

30|$|Reducing {{noise from}} noise-corrupted speech is {{essential}} for communication or recording devices. Spectral subtractive noise reduction algorithms have been widely developed {{under the assumption that}} input noise is stationary or slowly varying [1 – 3]. Therefore, the linear filtering methods cannot remove transient noise easily which has abruptly varying characteristic [4 – 6]. In general, transient noise is generated by tapping a recording device or an object near it. Since transient noise randomly occurs in time and has a time-varying unknown impulse response, the characteristic of the noise is not easy to estimate. In other words, both the occurrence time and the impulse response of transient noise are unpredictable. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that transient noise usually is a fast varying signal with short duration and high amplitude thus its activity is relatively easy to detect [4 – 8].|$|E

The aim, {{is to create}} a comprehensive urban - architectural project of area, which is based on the use of local resources to support rural, economic and social development in the region of South Moravia. The area is situated {{on the outskirts of the}} village Strachotín, which is part of the site Novomlýnska nádrž. The urban concept should attract people, not just domestic, but also international clients, because of the proximity to Austria, Slovakia borders, and because of a good connection to the highway D 2. Important was, to create a supporting function_WELLNESS, which complements the lack of capacity of the accommodation and offers services that are not around. A prerequisite, for immediate gripping the concept in the country, is also the existence of several hiking, biking, wine routes which pass through the area. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a close proximity to water, which I use in eco - energy concept, but also for recreation, relaxation purposes. The core project is the integration of new technologies in wine production, architecture, town planning, to create facilities, operating with minimum power consumption and minimal burden on nature. From the operational point of view, I separated the two ongoing operation of buildings-WELLNESS-located at the bottom of the plot, with access from Sklepní street, and linked with water. -WINERY- with accessing comunication from the existing path, with the possibility to access directly to winery by 3 m wide drivable pavement and with beautiful views. Buildings are connected with educational wine route. Visually, the project is built on the use of excavated soil, formed in the mounds, which should symbolize "volumes exserted from the ground" with the metaphorical meaning of interface with nature. Urban and architectural design is in a harmony with the country - respects terrain conditions, using solar energy, and natural material solution that is designed in its crude form...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn todays’ {{economically}} viable worldview scenario, {{everyone wants to}} earn sufficient money which can be spent to maintain better lifestyle. There are many factors such as {{people living in the}} remote areas without appropriate communication systems or the physically challenged people et al who are not able to attend the traditional college system hence they seek an alternative option to gain education. E-Learning is a best alternative that provides suitable opportunity to all such individuals to obtain the desired qualifications or degrees as quality education even without attending any face to face college system in the educational institutions. The most positive point in E-Learning is that students find opportunity for access to the course materials anytime and anywhere whenever they find time through the use and application of electronic gadgets. Today, every reputed educational institution especially universities worldwide run their distance learning courses under the E-Learning system. Most powerful feature of E-Learning is that it remains an extremely interactive experience. Too many applications and tools are already available abundantly in the market today to promote E-learning in multiple ways. Take for example Moodle, Blackboard, LectureCast, Classroom 2. 0, ELE (E-learning Environments) and E-Learning 2. 0 amongst others. In this paper, we have focussed on the Second Life by Linden Lab (USA) for educational trainings. It has special instructiveness as we compare to rest E-Learning training methodologies available before us nowadays. It gives an opportunity to the students to attend virtual classrooms and attend lectures. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that Second Life develops a sense of presence in the students who feel as if they are physically present in the university campuses and spend time with their faculty members or peers. There are several other impeccable and strong features in Second Life. We have focused on Second Life education project to connect with Blackboard which we have already started to use in our university...|$|E
40|$|Supply chain {{management}} and logistics management have proven {{successful in the}} manufacturing industry, with improved productivity as a consequence. However, {{in the construction industry}} these issues have not been high on the agenda. This may be one reason why the construction industry lags behind the manufacturing industry in terms of productivity. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that there is a growing interest for managing the construction supply chains. The basic idea in this thesis is not to come up with new logistical principles, but to learn from the existing performance in the manufacturing industry. A theoretical framework concerning general supply {{chain management}} and logistics issues is presented. This includes nine logistical principles, which have been acknowledged by the manufacturing industry. Previous academic reports concerning supply chain management and logistics in the construction industry are analysed with the general theoretical framework as a basis. In addition to this literature review two case studies have been conducted. Both case studies involve a supply chain starting at the manufacturer and ending at the client. The first case regards radiators and the second case regards installation cable. Common for both cases is that they represent groups of material which have shown a historic high cost increase. The results confirm that supply chain management has still not been widely spread, and was not implemented in either of the two supply chains studied. However, there were signs among the client and the building contractor in the first supply chain of an emerging focus on the supply chain performance, which very well may lead to the adoption of supply chain management. Both case studies show similar results that the wholesalers offer excessive service when delivering stocked material within a day from receiving the order. This is a consequence of the contractors’ lack of establishing detailed delivery dates early in the projects. This thesis has come up with several suggestions for improvements in the supply chains, which all together shows that there is much to gain in starting to manage the supply chains and avoiding sub-optimisation...|$|E
