The Ice King is a {{recurring}} antagonist of the series, and frequently steals princesses throughout Ooo; although he is often at odds with Finn and Jake, he is generally not a serious threat. He was formerly a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who discovered a magic crown <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> magical ice powers but eroded his memory and made him go insane. In addition, throughout the series, various character and events hint at the mysterious Mushroom War, a cataclysmic war that destroyed modern human society.|$|E

For twelve hours {{after taking the}} pill, he becomes the smartest person in the world, able to perfectly recall every detail {{of his life and}} capable of prodigious leaps of intuition and reasoning. With the mysterious US Senator Eddie Morra (Cooper) providing him with an immunity shot to counteract NZT's deadly side effects, Brian uses his enhanced abilities to help F.B.I. agent Rebecca Harris (Carpenter).

25|$|After Finn {{watched his}} girlfriend, Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco) and Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny) fight, {{he has a}} strange dream <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> a sense of pleasure; however, he {{is not able to}} finish it before he wakes up. Upon awakening, he realizes that the Cosmic Owl (voiced by M. Emmet Walsh) was in the vision, which Jake interprets to mean that the reverie was a prophetic dream. Jake urges Finn to somehow finish the dream. Finn, therefore, gets Flame Princess and Ice King to fight once more, but this time Ice King nearly defeats Flame Princess. That night, Finn has a similar dream, only this time, he imagines Ice King {{blasting}} him with ice.|$|E
25|$|Mase Teonea, {{a pastor}} in the Brethren Church, sought a {{declaration}} that {{the resolution of}} the Falekaupule was null and void as contrary to the Constitution, in that the resolution was contrary to: section 23(1) of the Constitution of Tuvalu 1986 as it hinders freedom of belief and worship; section 24(1) and 25(1) in so far that it limited the freedom of expression, and freedom of association of the church members; and that the resolution was discriminatory and contrary to section 27(1) in so far that it treated the applicant in a way <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> and his church congregation less favourable treatment than other such groups and persons. The judgement of Ward CJ balanced the freedoms of religion, expression and association against the values of Tuvaluan stability and culture, with the Chief Justice accepting the evidence of the unrest and tension on Nanumaga. The decision of the Chief Justice was to refuse to grant the declaration sought by Mase Teonea.|$|E

25|$|After the Persian {{conquest of}} Egypt, the Persian {{commander}} in Egypt, Megabyzus, forces the Egyptians to fight as expendable soldiers in Xerxes armies. Inaros trains soldiers for the Persian army, but has {{never thought of}} rebellion because he knows the Persians are much stronger than the Egyptians. The only thing <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> comfort is his lover Meritaton. However, when Megabyzus abducts Meritaton, Inaros is moved to begin a rebellion. As news of the rebellion spreads throughout Egypt, Megabyzus begins slaughtering innocent citizens. Inaros heads to Elbo to recruit the Nubians, and then to Libya to urge the Libyans to join him. After they pledge their support, word reaches Inaros that Leonidas has arrived in Egypt and is laying siege to Sais. Inaros aligns himself with Leonidas and the Spartans against the Persians, helping Leonidas conquer Sais, before heading to recruit more Egyptians into the rebellion, and arranging to meet the Greeks and Libyans near Memphis. After defeating a Persian force in Athribis, Inaros rescues Leonidas from a trap, and rendezvouses with the Libyans. Together, the Egyptians, Spartans and Libyans attack Memphis, killing Megabyzus. Inaros is reunited with Meritaton, as the Egyptians celebrate their freedom.|$|E

500|$|Danner {{was portrayed}} by comedic actor Joe E. Brown in the 1938 film The Gladiator, which loosely adapted science-fiction drama as a comedy, and, {{among the many}} changes, renamed the protagonist [...] "Hugo Kipp". The film begins when Kipp wins a large sum of money in a contest and decides to return to college. There, he is talked into joining the {{football}} team and fails {{to live up to}} his athletic father's legendary reputation. But after a Professor Danner (Lucien Littlefield) injects Kipp with a serum <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> superhuman strength, he becomes an unstoppable player and wins the heart of the self-centered quarterback's girlfriend (June Travis). In the end, he faces Man Mountain Dean in a wrestling match, but the serum runs out at the last minute.|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon {{established}} himself as an unusually skilled offensive player for a big man, perfecting a set of fakes and spin moves that became known as his trademark Dream Shake. Executed with uncanny speed and power, they are still regarded as the pinnacle of [...] "big man" [...] footwork. Shaquille O'Neal stated: [...] "Hakeem has five moves, then four countermoves – <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> 20 moves." [...] Olajuwon himself traced the {{move back to the}} soccer-playing days of his youth. [...] "The Dream Shake was actually one of my soccer moves which I translated to basketball. It would accomplish one of three things: one, to misdirect the opponent and make him go the opposite way; two, to freeze the opponent and leave him devastated in his tracks; three, to shake off the opponent and giving him no chance to contest the shot." [...] The Dream Shake was very difficult to defend, much like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's sky-hook.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Cooper {{starred in}} the techno-thriller Limitless, based on the 2001 novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn. In the Neil Burger-directed film, he played a {{struggling}} writer who is introduced to a nootropic drug <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> the ability to fully utilize his brain and vastly improve his lifestyle. The box office website Box Office Mojo was apprehensive of the film's financial prospects, but it emerged as a commercial success with a worldwide gross of $161 million. A writer for Variety said of Cooper's performance that he [...] "makes further strides toward major stardom, spelling excellent early spring returns and socko vid play." [...] Greater commercial success followed with the comedy sequel The Hangover Part II (2011), which earned over $580 million worldwide. Reviews for the film were generally negative, though the critic for Time complimented him: [...] "Cooper gives a knowing performance: he's both the peacock and the parody of one. He's blessed with good looks and fantastic timing, the kind that makes every line funnier, even the small asides." [...] At the 38th People's Choice Awards, he was nominated for Favorite Comedic Movie Actor.|$|E

2500|$|Partly due {{to efforts}} from 350.org and other organizations, President Obama officially {{rejected}} {{the building of}} Keystone XL on November 6, 2015. This {{marked the end of}} a seven-year review on the pipeline. Speaking on the decision, Bill McKibben said, “President Obama is the first world leader to reject a project because of its effect on the climate. <b>That</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> new stature as an environmental leader, and it eloquently confirms the five years and millions of hours of work that people of every kind put into this fight.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Leader" [...] is {{a mysterious}} {{character}} {{who is the}} worst enemy of Vaillante {{and owner of the}} Leader team. The Leader team uses modern and advanced technology to compete against the Vaillante team in motor races. The team resorts to aggressive strategies to win races and uses dangerous drivers, such as Vince Hummer, Bob Cramer, Dan Hawkins and Donald Payntor. The leader was brought up by Buddhist monks. An ambitious and cruel man, he studied a form of Buddhism <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> amazing powers, which he uses to try to dominate the motor industry. His first appearance was in the album [...] "Mach 1 pour Steve Warson".|$|E
2500|$|... "Platonism" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} {{scholars}} {{to refer to the}} intellectual consequences of denying, as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world. In several dialogues, most notably the Republic, Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the Theaetetus, he says such people are eu amousoi (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, [...] "happily without the muses" [...] (Theaetetus 156a). In other words, such people live without the divine inspiration <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him,</b> and people like him, access to higher insights about reality.|$|E

2500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review and wrote, [...] "If your {{intention is to}} make a brooding, hauntingly allegorical terror-thriller, it's probably not a good sign when spectacles of mass death and intimations of planetary destruction are met with hoots and giggles ... The draggy, lurching two hours of [...] "Knowing" [...] will make you long {{for the end of the}} world, even as you worry that there will not be time for all your questions to be answered." [...] In the San Francisco Chronicle, Peter Hartlaub called the film [...] "an excitement for fans of Proyas" [...] and [...] "a surprisingly messy effort." [...] He thought Nicolas Cage [...] "borders on ridiculous here, in part because of a script <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> little to do but freak out or act depressed".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{considered}} the possibility {{at the end of}} the second season, Cleese left the Flying Circus {{at the end of the}} third. He later explained that he felt he no longer had anything fresh to offer the show, and claimed that only two Cleese- and Chapman-penned sketches in the third series ("Dennis Moore" [...] and the [...] "Cheese Shop") were truly original, and that the others were bits and pieces from previous work cobbled together in slightly different contexts. He was also finding Chapman, who was at that point in the full throes of alcoholism, difficult to work with. According to an interview with Idle, [...] "It was on an Air Canada flight on the way to Toronto, when John (Cleese) turned to all of us and said 'I want out.' Why? I don't know. He gets bored more easily than the rest of us. He's a difficult man, not easy to be friendly with. He's so funny because he never wanted to be liked. <b>That</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> a certain fascinating, arrogant freedom." ...|$|E
2500|$|For The Sands of Time, the {{character}} was completely redesigned, taking reference purely {{from the original}} game rather than Prince of Persia 3D. Mechner wrote the new story for the Prince purely for newcomers to the series, wanting {{the character}} to be memorable so as to provide a good [...] "hook" [...] for players together with the gameplay. He again drew inspiration from the opening of Raiders of the Lost Ark {{for the opening of}} The Sands of Time. Something he was pleased with was his initially unsympathetic portrayal of the Prince. His inspiration for the character's more serious portrayal was the stories of the Shahnameh, although he later admitted that he could not entirely remove the influences of the original Prince. In his view, [...] "It's [...] inability to solve this conflict <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> his particular charm." [...] For his gameplay model, the Prince had over 780 movement animations scripted, far more than any other character in the game. This conversely led to difficulties with other enemy movements. The Prince was designed by Raphael Lacoste, the game's art director, who went through multiple versions from a young boy to a bare-chested older man. His final look was partially determined by the aesthetics of the game's environments.|$|E
