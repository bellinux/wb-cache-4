5|$|In August 1843, {{just after}} she turned 25, Stone {{traveled}} by train, steamship, and stagecoach to Oberlin College in Ohio, the country's first college to admit {{both women and}} African Americans. She entered the college believing <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> vote and assume political office, <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> study the classic professions and <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> {{be able to speak}} their minds in a public forum. Oberlin College did not share all of these sentiments.|$|E
5|$|As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Periyar {{advocated}} forcefully {{throughout his}} life <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men {{and that they should}} be given good education and have the right to property. He thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women. He was keen <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country.|$|E
5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> not be limited to such capacities.|$|E

5|$|Caspar Bartholin, a 17th-century Danish anatomist, {{dismissed}} Colombo's and Falloppio's {{claims that}} they discovered the clitoris, {{arguing that the}} clitoris had been widely known to medical science since the second century. Although 17th-century midwives recommended {{to men and women}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> aspire to achieve orgasms to help them get pregnant for general health and well-being and to keep their relationships healthy, debate {{about the importance of the}} clitoris persisted, notably in the work of Regnier de Graaf in the 17th century and Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the 19th.|$|E
5|$|Raised by Mormon {{parents and}} devout to the faith, Dalton was a feminist; as a child, she felt jealous of boys {{for the freedom}} and {{privileges}} they enjoyed and felt that girls were neglected by the education system. She became a women's rights activist, believing <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> {{have the right to}} suffrage, education, property, control over their money, and custody of their children. As a teacher, she advocated for equal educational and recreational opportunities for girls.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} Rights of Woman after reading Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord's 1791 report to the French National Assembly, which stated <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.|$|E

60|$|So, {{then and}} there--according to the records--was the {{alliance}} {{formed by the}} only two who's-who ladies in the world.

5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|Endecott was a zealous and {{somewhat}} hotheaded Puritan, with Separatist {{attitudes toward the}} Anglican Church. This sometimes put him at odds with Nonconformist views that were dominant among the colony's early leaders, which became apparent when he gave shelter to the vocally Separatist Roger Williams. Endecott also argued <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> dress modestly and that men should keep their hair short, and issued judicial decisions banishing individuals who held religious views that did not accord well {{with those of the}} Puritans. He notoriously defaced the English flag because he saw St George's Cross {{as a symbol of the}} papacy, and had four Quakers put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment. An expedition he led in 1636 is considered the opening offensive in the Pequot War, which practically destroyed the Pequot tribe as an entity.|$|E
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly {{you have}} a high and {{faithful}} heart, and <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> <b>should</b> be honoured whom you love. What is the secret? There must be more in it than the mere desire for a woman's beauty, though I know that at times this can make men mad. In such a business the soul must play its part." ...|$|R

5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> be denied participation in the proceedings, even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to sit in a roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead to sit with the women.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

25|$|The trilogy {{was written}} in the 1980s when many feminists denounced {{pornography}} as violation of women's rights, but Rice firmly believed <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>should</b> have the freedom to read and write whatever they pleased, and considered the trilogy her political statement.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the total}} weight gain depends on pre-pregnant body weight, it is {{recommended}} <b>that</b> underweight <b>women</b> <b>should</b> undergo a larger weight gain for healthy pregnancy outcomes, and overweight or obese <b>women</b> <b>should</b> undergo a smaller weight gain.|$|R
25|$|The {{ideology}} of Maternal feminism incorporates ideas from social feminism and domestic feminism.

25|$|In the 1870s feminists {{advanced}} {{the concept of}} voluntary motherhood as a political critique of involuntary motherhood and expressing a desire for women's emancipation.

25|$|Fanny Cradock {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the public in the postwar-utility years, trying to inspire the average housewife with an exotic approach to cooking.

5|$|The Woman's Bible is {{a two-part}} non-fiction book, written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a {{committee}} of 26 women, published in 1895 and 1898 to challenge the traditional position of religious orthodoxy <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> <b>should</b> be subservient to man. By producing the book, Stanton wished to promote a radical liberating theology, one that stressed self-development.
