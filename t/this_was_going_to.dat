5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
5|$|This was a storyline that Russell T Davies {{thought up}} {{as a final}} one-part special for David Tennant on Doctor Who, (<b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> air around Easter 2010, near the time Series 5 would be airing.). The plot would have been that the Doctor finds a {{spaceship}} with an alien family on board (Russell mockingly titled them 'The Proestix Family'.) where the ship was broken, in the special {{he would have to}} sacrifice his life to save this family. This was a choice of a plotline which was also brought up with a two part special that then became The End of Time that he told to Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner. The Proestex family was kept in the special but were changed to be the Vinvocci, Aaddams and Rossiter.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{hoped to}} be posted to Britain {{at the end of}} his training, and was {{initially}} told that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen, but he was instead sent to the Middle East. He was despatched to Idku, a small RAF base near Cairo, in late 1942, from where he was posted to an operational training unit based at Baalbek in Lebanon. He spent six weeks there, flying over much of the Levant in a Hawker Hurricane fighter, before being posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron to begin active service, again piloting Hurricanes. The squadron was stationed near the Iranian capital of Tehran when Smith joined it, but it almost immediately transferred to Kirkuk in Iraq, to help guard the oil wells and pipelines there. In March 1943, it was again committed to the Western Desert Campaign in North Africa, having previously served there during 1941–1942, and Smith served on this front as a Hurricane pilot. He was promoted to flying officer on 25 March 1943.|$|E

Thus it was not Lambot who attacked, but Heusghem (who had been second {{for the last two}} years). It appeared that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be his shining Tour, however his bicycle broke on the ride to Metz. Heusghem made a prohibited bike change to stay in race for first. However, this defied the rules during this time, and he was docked one hour by race officials, dropping him to fourth overall. This is when Lambot noticed his change and took over in Dunkerque. Amidst all this Lambot took his second win of the Tour de France at the age of 36, becoming the first to win the Tour de France without winning a stage.|$|E
25|$|By February 638 {{there was}} a lull in the {{fighting}} on the Persian front. The Suwad, the Tigris valley, and the Euphrates valley were now under the complete control of the Muslims. The Persians had withdrawn to Persia proper, east of the Zagros mountains. The Persians continued raiding Mesopotamia, which remained politically unstable. Nevertheless, it appeared as if <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the dividing line between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Sassanids. In the later {{part of the year}} 638 Hormuzan, who commanded one of the Persian corps at the Battle of Qadisiyyah {{and was one of the}} seven great chiefs of Persia, intensified his raids in Mesopotamia, Saad according to Umar's instructions undertook offensive actions against Hormuzan and Utbah ibn Ghazwan aided by Nouman ibn Muqarin attacked Ahvaz and forced Hormuzan to enter into a peace treaty with the Muslims according to which Ahvaz would remain in Hormuzan's possession and he would rule it as a vassal of the Muslims and would pay tribute. Hormuzan broke the treaty and revolted against the Muslims. Umar sent Abu Musa Ashaari, governor of Busra to deal with Hormuzan. Hormuzan was defeated and sought once again for peace. Umar accepted the offer and Hormuzan was again made vassal of the Muslims. This peace also proved short-lived once Hormuzan was reinforced by the fresh Persian troops sent by Emperor Yazdgerd III in late 640. The troops concentrated at Tuster north of Ahvaz. Umar sent Governor of Kufa, Ammar ibn Yasir, governor of Busra Abu Musa, and Nouman ibn Muqarin towards Tustar where Hormuzan was defeated, captured and sent to Madinah to Caliph Umar, where he apparently converted to Islam. He remained a useful adviser of Umar throughout the campaign of conquest of Persia. He is also considered to be the mastermind behind the assassination of Caliph Umar in 644. After the victory at Tustar, Abu Musa marched against Susa, a place of military importance, in January 641, which was captured after a siege of a couple of months. Next Abu Musa marched against Junde Sabur, the only place left of military importance in the Persian province of Khuzistan which surrendered to the Muslims after a siege of a few weeks.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Madonna {{was working}} with {{producer}} Reggie Lucas on her debut album. She had already composed three songs, when Lucas brought {{one of his own}} compositions to the project, calling it [...] "Borderline". However, after recording the song, Madonna was unhappy with the final version. According to her, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the song. This led to a dispute between the two. After finishing the album, Lucas left the project without altering the songs to Madonna's specifications. Hence, Madonna brought her then boyfriend John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to remix [...] "Borderline" [...] and two other recorded tracks.

500|$|Following the episode's release, ScreenRant's Andre Dyce {{reviewed}} the series' ratings performance {{up to that}} point, noting that over 7 million viewers is [...] "still {{a far cry from}} trouble on their own", but as the show [...] "continues to slip in both viewers and demographics, the trend could become problematic." [...] He noted that the drop in viewers from the series premiere, which had [...] "some of the highest ratings in recent history" [...] for ABC, to the second episode was to be expected, but [...] "the fact that [...] can’t seem to hold steady in its fifth week is a sign that it may be charting troubled waters ... A rocky start is to be expected, but by this point in the season, most procedural dramas tend to have hit their pace both in structure and audience."

Gonen rejected the suggestion, stating that, [...] "If we knew in advance <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen {{we would not have}} started the crossing operation, but now that we have crossed then let us follow through to the bitter end." [...] Bar-Lev concurred with Gonen, and Dayan decided not to press his suggestion. At around 6:00 AM, Golda Meir telephoned Dayan to inquire about the situation. Dayan informed her that the bridges had not yet been laid and that the Egyptians had closed the routes leading to Deveroir. He also stated there were high hopes that Egyptian resistance would be overcome and that the bridges would be laid during the morning. Dayan also told her that Matt's paratrooper brigade had crossed to the west bank without encountering resistance and that Southern Command, as yet, had no intentions of withdrawing the brigade, even if the bridge-laying was delayed.|$|E

Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else.

500|$|It was {{announced}} in January 2016 that Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler were working on a memoir titled The 15:17 to Paris, which would highlight {{the events of the}} 2015 Thalys train attack. Perseus Books Group, who will be publishing the book, described the memoir as “the gripping true story of a terrorist attack that would have killed more than 500 people if not for their actions, but it is also the story of three American boys, their friendship, and the values we hold dear.” Jeffrey E. Stern, an international journalist, will co-write the book. David Steinberger, {{president and chief executive of}} Perseus Books Group, said that he is “confident that this is going to be a film. It’s extremely cinematic, and there’s a lot of interest in the movie.” He further said that [...] "based on the material, that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an important book and one that readers were really going to respond to.” The memoir was made available to the public on August 23, 2016, almost a year after the 2015 Thalys train attack.

500|$|Recording {{completed}} in March 1999 and all parties involved were enormously {{proud of the}} record. [...] "When it was done, we were so stoked.

[...] Hoppus felt the band achieved the purest, cleanest sound on the record that they had been striving for. Finn felt similarly, proud of his work on the record and believing in retrospect that the album would appeal to the masses. As the album was recorded on analog tape, the trio put enormous trust into Finn to give the record the polished pop sound they wanted, recalled DeLonge in 2012. [...] "The Party Song" [...] was the final song to be completed, and the three were mixing the song coincidentally when lead single [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] premiered on Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ. Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., best known for his work with Beck, played keyboards for several songs on the album. After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. In 2013, Hoppus referred to Enema of the State as [...] "the heart of Blink-182's musical sensibilities," [...] singling out [...] "its simplicity, its purity, its singularity of purpose between the three of us." [...] According to Barker, the album's title stemmed from DeLonge, who was worried about his diet at the time and using enemas.|$|E

[...] Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound praised the performance, writing that [...] "by the second song, 'Beat Goes On', it was clear that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be one hell of an innovative show." [...] Roffman also pointed out that [...] "a digital Kanye West joined Madonna on stage, rapping along as the singer flipped and bounced on the floor." [...] During a Chicago concert, Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "a song about the freedom to dance ("Beat Goes On") becomes an anthem for political frustration, and it's the only moment that's generated any real controversy, but she doesn't say anything about either the Republican or the Democratic candidate that she hasn't said before. The power of any great Madonna song is implicit: 'Say what you like/Do what you feel/You know exactly who you are'."

The boys' Aunt Gertrude becomes [...] "Trudy", their mother Laura is given {{a career as a}} librarian, and their father is semi-retired.

[...] The Hardys are also featured in a new graphic novel series, begun in 2005 and produced by Papercutz, and a new early chapter book series called The Hardy Boys: Secret Files, begun in 2010 by the publisher Simon & Schuster under their Aladdin imprint.

500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet.
