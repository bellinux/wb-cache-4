50|$|Hangarter gave several {{important}} findings {{of law that}} aid disabled claimaints. First, futile attempts to return to an occupation are insufficient to reverse a jury’s determination of <b>total</b> <b>disability</b> under California law. <b>Total</b> <b>disability</b> may still be found, even if an insured {{was able to do}} some work under her occupation. The guiding focus is whether an insured was unable to perform the substantial and material duties of her own occupation in the usual and customary way with reasonable continuity. Second, the 9th Circuit affirmed that recovery under <b>total</b> <b>disability</b> is not precluded because an insured was able to generate income during her disability. Disability insurance is designed not as insurance against loss of income, but as a substitute for earnings when an insured is deprived of the capacity to earn an income. Third, repeated use of a medical examiner overcomes any presumption that an insurance company’s denial of a claim is a genuine dispute. The practice of using the same medical examiner when claims are being rejected evinces bad faith {{on the part of the}} insurance company.|$|E

40|$|Using the 1994 - 95 National Health Interview Supplement Disability Supplement, {{the authors}} study levels of disabilities and {{accommodations}} among US adults with arthritis disability, compared {{to people with}} disability due to other conditions. Arthritis-disabled people are defined in two ways. One definition covers {{a broad range of}} arthritis and rheumatic conditions, and the other concentrates solely on arthritis. The authors find that arthritis-disabled people have more <b>total</b> <b>disabilities</b> than other-disabled peop e. However, their disabilities are less severe, have shorter durations, and accumulate more gradually over time. Despite more disabilities, people with arthritis disability use fewer assistive and service accommodations than other-disabled people. They do use more mobility aids. Because arthritis is the leading chronic condition for middle-aged and older adults, th s profile of extensive but mild-to-moderate disability is experienced by many millions of adults. Accommodations for arthritis may also be extensive but aimed more toward self-care than toward assistive and medical services...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} effects of high {{frequency}} stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on axial symptoms occurring in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD).  METHODS—The efficacy of STN stimulation on <b>total</b> motor <b>disability</b> score (unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) part III) were evaluated in 10 patients with severe Parkinson's disease. The subscores were then studied separately for limb akinesia, rigidity, and tremor, which are known to respond to levodopa, and axial signs, including speech, neck rigidity, rising from a chair, posture, gait, and postural stability, which are known to respond less well to levodopa. Patients were clinically assessed in the "off" and "on" drug condition during a levodopa challenge test performed before surgical implantation of stimulation electrodes and repeated 6 months after surgery under continuous STN stimulation. A complementary score for axial symptoms from the "activities of daily living" (ADL) —that is, speech, swallowing, turning in bed, falling, walking, and freezing—was obtained from each patient's questionnaire (UPDRS, part II).  RESULTS—Improvements in <b>total</b> motor <b>disability</b> score (62 %), limb signs (62 %), and axial signs (72 %) obtained with STN stimulation were statistically comparable with those obtained with levodopa during the preoperative challenge (68 %, 69 %, and 59 %, respectively). When levodopa and STN stimulation were combined there was a further improvement in <b>total</b> motor <b>disability</b> (80 %) compared with preoperative levodopa administration. This consisted largely of an additional improvement in axial signs (84 %) mainly for posture and postural stability, no further improvement in levodopa responsive signs being found. Axial symptoms from the ADL showed similar additional improvement when levodopa and STN stimulation were combined.  CONCLUSION—These findings suggest that bilateral STN stimulation improves most axial features of Parkinson's disease and that a synergistic effect can be obtained when stimulation is {{used in conjunction with}} levodopa treatment. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Total</b> Permanent <b>Disability</b> (TPD) is {{a phrase}} {{used in the}} {{insurance}} industry and in law. Generally speaking, it means that because of a sickness or injury, a person is unable to work in their own or any occupation {{for which they are}} suited by training, education, or experience. An individual or group of individuals can insure themselves against it through a disability insurance policy, as part of a life insurance package or through worker's compensation insurance.|$|R

The new regulations took effect July 1, 2010. Under further changes set to take effect July 1, 2013, if a borrower is determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration, that determination will be accepted as proof of <b>total</b> and permanent <b>disability</b> if the SSA placed the individual on a five- to seven-year review cycle (the longest currently used by SSA).|$|R
5000|$|Benefits are {{generally}} paid until the injured worker returns {{to work or}} is capable of returning to work and suitable work is available. For example, if an injured worker fully recovers from an injury and can return to work, <b>total</b> <b>disability</b> benefits end. Also, even if an injured worker cannot return to his regular job due to a physicians restrictions, compensation ends if the employer offers the employee suitable work. Short of offering a job, the employer/insurer may stop compensation for <b>total</b> <b>disability</b> if it can prove suitable jobs exist in the employees commuting area. If those jobs do not meet or exceed the injured worker's previously established AWW, the employer/carrier {{may have to pay}} either partial disability benefits or a [...] "scheduled award," [...] depending {{on the nature of the}} original injury.|$|E

50|$|Chief on the Legion's {{legislative}} agenda {{was a dramatic}} improvement {{of the level of}} compensation for soldiers who suffered permanent disability during the war. At the time of the end of World War I, American law stated that soldiers who suffered <b>total</b> <b>disability</b> were to receive only the base pay of a Private—$30 per month. The Legion concentrated its lobbying effort in 1919 on passage of legislation increasing payment for <b>total</b> <b>disability</b> suffered in the war to $80 a month—a sum roughly sufficient in dollars of the day to provide a living wage. Those partially disabled by their wounds were to receive lesser payments. A flurry of lobbying by the Legion's National Legislative Committee in conjunction with cables sent to Congressional leaders by National Commander Franklin D'Olier helped achieve passage of this legislation by the end of 1919.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} a demographic view of disability patterns in Pakistan, and also highlights the inadequacies and inconsistencies of data, especially those {{provided by the}} census. Besides assessing the prevalence of disability by age, gender considerations, nature of disability and reasons of disability, the paper examines such features among the disabled population as their work participation, training, self-sufficiency and dependence on {{the help of the}} others. Even though the estimates of disability worked out from the 1984 - 85 Survey of Disabled Population are relatively more realistic, the need for broadening and standardisation of the concepts and adoption of improved survey procedures for better coverage and diagnostics is clearly evident. The high prevalence of disability and the fact mat nearly half of the <b>total</b> <b>disabilities</b> occur due to disease, more than a third are by birth, and about 15 percent are due to accidents, clearly point towards the need for preventive and curative health facilities and imparting of proper awareness among the people. The association of disability prevalence with the prevailing conditions of fertility, health, education and socio-economic circumstances, observed from the results have important policy implications for the country. The study which has attempted to provide a view of disability patterns in Pakistan, and to highlight some of the covariates of disability rate, represents a beginning of a demographic concern in this important area. ...|$|R
