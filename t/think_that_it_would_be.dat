500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and appeared later at a press conference. Franchitti was happy with the victory, saying {{that he did not}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> different to win at the track but that it was [...] "very, very special". He said that after his first pit stop he did not think that {{he would be able to}} win the race, and praised his team for their work. Da Matta stated that he was worried about his advantage in the points standings and felt he had the car which could win the event. He added that he could not relax because other drivers still had a mathematical chance of clinching the championship, but he was pleased with the result. Third-place finisher Carpentier said he was happy with his position and that it was a good day for his team. He revealed that changes made to his aerodynamic setup worked on the rolling restarts although it slowed him on the backstraight. Franchitti's race engineer Allen McDonald praised his driver, saying his first victory on an oval track was one that he would remember and that it was an [...] "unbelievable day".|$|E
500|$|Darwin's {{position}} as a naturalist on board was as a self-funded guest with no official appointment, and he could leave the voyage at any suitable stage. At the outset George Peacock had advised that [...] "The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish you with an official appointment & every : if a salary should be required however I am inclined to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> granted". Far from wanting this, Darwin's concern was to maintain control over his collection. He was even reluctant {{to be on the}} Admiralty's books for [...] until he got assurances from FitzRoy and Beaufort that this would not affect his rights to assign his specimens. Darwin did not want his collection to go to the British Museum as he had heard that specimens from the first Beagle voyage were still waiting to be described. Beaufort assured him that he [...] "should have no difficulty" [...] as long as he [...] "presented them to some public body" [...] such as the Zoological or Geological societies. Darwin himself thought his new finds should go to the [...] "largest & most central collection", not the [...] Cambridge Philosophical Society museum that Henslow was setting up at Cambridge, but after getting Henslow's willing agreement to take delivery of the consignments of specimens, Darwin replied that he hoped to give some to the Cambridge museum.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fun to do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience and see if we get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we felt we had sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E

2500|$|Chief Justice Earl Warren admitted, {{writing for}} the {{majority}} two years later when denying boxing the exemption, that [...] "this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business.

[...] Dissenters Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton, who were in the Toolson majority, were harshly critical. [...] "It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions ...and baseball insofar as the conduct of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes applicable to a 'trade or commerce.'", the former wrote. [...] "I cannot translate even the narrowest conception of stare decisis into the equivalent of writing into the Sherman Law an exemption of baseball to the exclusion of every other sport different not one legal jot or tittle from it."
