5|$|The bulb of the radish {{is usually}} eaten raw, {{although}} tougher specimens can be steamed.

5|$|Thelephora anthocephala is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance, {{but can be}} distinguished by branches that taper upward, branch tips that are flattened (instead of spoon-like), {{and the lack of}} a fetid odor. The North American species T.vialis has smaller spores and a more variable color. Darker Ramaria species are distinguished by their non-leathery flesh <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> pointy branch tips.|$|E

5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E

The {{shape of the}} doughnut can lend to the retention of a greater amount of glaze or other toppings compared to other doughnut styles.

5|$|Like other abelisaurids, Majungasaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} {{with a short}} snout. Although the forelimbs are {{not completely}} known, they were very short, while the hind limbs were longer and very stocky. It can be distinguished from other abelisaurids by its wider skull, the very rough <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> thickened bone {{on the top of}} its snout, and the single rounded horn on the roof of its skull, which was originally mistaken for the dome of a pachycephalosaur. It also had more teeth in both upper and lower jaws than most abelisaurids.|$|E

Halo2s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game. Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed the sentiment that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> detail of the Flood. The action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the Flood, the third series featured a human Combat Form.|$|E
5|$|The Jif plastic {{containers}} were originally made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The {{plastic containers}} served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic <b>texture,</b> <b>and</b> then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E

Despite the apparent uniformity of design, individual buildings varied considerably in the detail {{of their designs}} in effort to express their particular identities, the Peoples Gas Building using <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> the Railway Exchange Building white terracotta, for example.|$|E
