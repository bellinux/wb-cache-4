5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>tickets</b> for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following {{the announcement of the}} matchup, ticket sales diverged. By December 12, Cincinnati sold about 9,000 tickets. This total increased to approximately 13,000 tickets by December 20, and the school prepared multiple tour buses for a student convoy to the game. At Virginia Tech, meanwhile, sales lagged. In an effort to spur sales, Tech administrators had head football coach Frank Beamer star in a video asking Hokies fans <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>tickets</b> to the game. Owing to limited demand for tickets, prices in the secondary market plunged.|$|E

Björkman said that official tickets {{had not yet been}} released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made. Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, some may be made available to the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} bookings {{for the film}} opened, a {{reported}} crowd of 100,000 gathered outside the Maratha Mandir <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>tickets.</b> The tickets, the most expensive for a Bollywood film at that time, were dockets containing text, photographs and trivia about the film, and are now considered collector's items. They sold for 100 (valued at about US$21 in 1960), compared to the usual price of 1.5 (US$0.31). Bookings experienced major chaos, {{to the extent that}} police intervention was required. It was reported that people would wait in queues for four to five days, and would be supplied food from home through their family members. Subsequently, the Maratha Mandir closed bookings for three weeks.|$|E

5|$|Tickets to {{the game}} sold quickly at first, but trailed off as the game approached. Virginia Tech sold 5,000 tickets {{in the first three}} days after the Hokies were selected, but one week later, Tech managed to {{increase}} that total to just 8,300. In an effort to spur sales at the school, Virginia Tech athletic director Jim Weaver asked fans <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>tickets</b> even if they did not plan on attending the game. The tickets could then be donated to charity. As an incentive for Gator Bowl officials to select Virginia Tech, the school agreed to sell 18,000 tickets—more than the minimum 11,500 North Carolina agreed to sell. When a shortfall resulted in Tech selling just 11,000 tickets, the school was forced to purchase the remaining 7,000, costing Virginia Tech $245,000. At North Carolina, tickets sales were even slower, with about 6,000 having been sold through the school two weeks after the matchup was announced. The Gator Bowl ticket office sold approximately 22,000 tickets directly to fans in the same timeframe, and Gator Bowl officials predicted a crowd of between 50,000 and 55,000 people at the game.|$|E

Temperamental, flamboyant, she was a passionate player whose intensity on court could lead to an unabashed display of tears.

Her excellent play and introduction of glamour to the tennis court increased the interest in women's tennis, and women's sports in general.|$|E
25|$|Metropolitan Stadium was {{the home}} of the Minnesota Kicks soccer team from 1976 until the team folded in November 1981. The Kicks, members of the North American Soccer League, were highly {{anticipated}} in Minnesota and had to delay their first game at the Met by 15 minutes to accommodate the large crowd waiting <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>tickets.</b> To help speed things along, the Kicks' owners let two thousand fans enter the stadium for free. An NASL attendance record was set one month later, when Pelé and the New York Cosmos drew 46,164 fans to Metropolitan Stadium. Large crowds continued for the Kicks, who drew 41,505 for that year's opening playoff game. Four days later, another record was set when 49,571 fans came to see the Kicks defeat San Jose, 3-1. The team enjoyed great success in their first four seasons in Minnesota, winning a division title each year. Attendance dipped {{toward the end of the}} franchise's history, however, with an average of 16,605 per game in 1981, their final season.

50|$|As with {{previous}} Springsteen tours, ticket scalpers were {{a major problem}} when it came <b>to</b> <b>buying</b> <b>tickets.</b> Tickets for Springsteen's New York City shows began popping up on resale sites such as StubHub and eBay on December 7, 2015, four days before they went on sale to the public. Scalpers were re-selling tickets not yet available {{for as much as}} $5,000. This prompted the New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to launch an investigation into how this happened and wrote a letter forcing both companies to immediately remove any listings for ticket sales. When tickets finally went on sale on December 11, many fans again were shut out from <b>buying</b> <b>tickets</b> as most venues sold out quickly and within minutes, tickets were appearing for hundreds to thousands of dollars more on resale sites. According to reports, Springsteen's shows sold out in record time. Springsteen's show in Newark, New Jersey at the Prudential Center sold out in a few minutes. His previous 2012 show at the same venue took two hours to sell out.|$|R
