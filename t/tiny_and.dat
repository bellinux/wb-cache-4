5|$|The early anti-smoking {{campaign}} {{was considered a}} failure, and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany. The rate of smoking in the nation increased faster even than in neighboring France, where the anti-tobacco movement was <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> far less influential. Between 1932 and 1939, per capita cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year, while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630.|$|E
5|$|Single-sensed souls, however, called nigoda, and element-bodied souls pervade all {{tiers of}} this universe. Nigodas are souls {{at the bottom}} end of the existential hierarchy. They are so <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> undifferentiated, that they lack even {{individual}} bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of nigodas {{can also be found}} in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies. Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub–sub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within samsara.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the onefin electric ray is wider than long and almost circular in shape. The two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The eyes are small and protruding; the larger spiracles lie closely behind and have three small finger-like projections on their rims. The nostrils are placed rather close together, and between them is a long skirt-like flap of skin that reaches the mouth. The small and protrusible mouth is nearly straight and surrounded by prominent furrows. The teeth are <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> pointed. There are five pairs of small gill slits on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The prickly shark has a flabby and {{cylindrical}} body, {{with the}} adults markedly bulkier than juveniles, and a short, moderately flattened head. The nostrils are placed far apart and preceded by small flaps of skin. The spiracles are <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> positioned well behind the eyes, which lack nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a broad arch, with very short furrows at the corners. There are 21–25 and 20–27 tooth rows {{in the upper}} and lower jaws respectively. The knife-like teeth each have a strongly angled main cusp flanked by up to three smaller cusplets on either side; the lateral cusplets are absent in young sharks. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is similar}} in shape to that of M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the front part of the braincase is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> pressed against the upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4). The canine is less {{well-developed}} than in M.mystacinus. There is a clear cusp present {{on the side of}} the P4. The accessory cusp known as the protoconule is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. M.mystacinus lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars, but M.brandtii has an even larger cusp on P4.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, flabby body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin. The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to the snout tip is about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners. The distance between the mouth and the snout tip is about equal to the mouth width, and three times that of the distance between the nostrils. There are 25–28 upper tooth rows and 19–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> smooth, with a single sharp cusp.|$|E

25|$|The {{architects of}} Vladimir-Suzdal {{switched}} from brick to white limestone ashlar as their main building material, which provided for dramatically effective church silhouettes, but made church construction very costly. The ornamentation combined native carpentry, oriental, Italian Renaissance, and German Gothic motifs. The architects of Novgorod and Pskov constructed their churches of fieldstone and undressed blocks of limestone. As a result, the northwestern buildings have highly textured walls, as if hand-moulded of clay. A trefoil facade with pointed gables {{was a common}} arrangement in the later Novgorod Republic. The churches of Pskov were <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> gabled; they developed an enclosed gallery {{which led to a}} porch and a simple belfry, or zvonnitsa.|$|E
25|$|The {{explosion}} in Havana Harbor of the battleship USS Maine—sent by the U.S. to protect American commercial interests in Cuba—led to the Spanish–American War in 1898. It resulted in Spain's losing {{many of its}} remaining colonies; Cuba became nominally independent while the United States took possession of Puerto Rico and Spain's Pacific colonies of the Philippines and Guam. This left Spain with {{the remainder of the}} Spanish East Indies in the Pacific, about 6000 islands that were <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> sparsely populated. After the loss of the administrative center of Manila, the minor islands became ungovernable and, after the entire loss of two Spanish fleets in 1898, indefensible.|$|E

25|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the spotted stingaree is oval {{in shape and}} slightly longer than wide; it is more circular in juveniles. The snout is fleshy and usually smoothly rounded, without a protruding tip. The eyes are <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> followed by much larger comma-shaped spiracles, which have rounded posterior rims. There is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the nostrils. The floor of the small mouth bears 912 papillae (nipple-like structures); a further narrow patch of papillae is found on the lower jaw. The teeth are small, with roughly oval bases. The five pairs of gill slits are short, and the pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{heaviest}} fighting in North Africa, the Pacific War was also in its early stages, and RAAF units in Australia were completely lacking in suitable fighter aircraft. Spitfire production was being absorbed by the war in Europe; P-38s were trialled, but were difficult to obtain; Mustangs had not yet reached squadrons anywhere, and Australia's <b>tiny</b> <b>and</b> inexperienced aircraft industry was geared towards larger aircraft. USAAF P-40s and their pilots originally intended for the U.S. Far East Air Force in the Philippines, but diverted to Australia as a result of Japanese naval activity were the first suitable fighter aircraft to arrive in substantial numbers. By mid-1942, the RAAF was able to obtain some USAAF replacement shipments; the P-40 was given the RAAF designation A-29.|$|E
