[...] First Command's new president, Marty Durbin, responded to her criticism by stating, [...] "It’s unfortunate that settling these charges still doesn’t mean it’s behind us. But it’s a futile effort to try to fight negative press and so we decided not <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> energy that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mullen, who had mostly been {{absent from}} the {{sessions}} {{to start a family}} and nurse a worsening back injury, had major surgery on his back in November 1995. Mullen was unable to drum properly during this period, forcing U2 to abandon their usual methods of songwriting as a group but also allowing them to pursue different musical influences. Mullen admits that he was upset that the band entered the studio without him, cognizant that key decisions would be made in the early months of recording. Eno attempted to convince the other band members to wait for Mullen, but as the Edge explains, [...] "The thinking was {{that we were going to}} further experiment with the notion of what a band was all about and find new ways to write songs, accepting the influence, and aesthetics of dance music... we thought, 'Let's just start with Howie mixing drum beats and see where that gets us.'" [...] Mullen was back in the studio three weeks after his surgery, but his back prevented him from fully dedicating himself to recording. As he described, [...] "I needed a little more time to recover. But we were struggling with some of the material and for the project to move ahead, I had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time in." [...] Sessions ceased temporarily in January 1996 to allow Mullen to rehabilitate.|$|E
5000|$|The Beast Within has a {{much more}} {{involved}} plot than its predecessor, Sins of the Fathers. Jane Jensen {{said that this was}} because the FMV graphics [...] "limited the interactivity we could do. I specifically tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more intrigue in the plot, so even though the interactivity was easier, there would still be enough meat going on to keep people engaged." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2000, Centre Place {{underwent}} a $10 million redevelopment {{to increase the}} size of the shopping centre from 65 stores to 85; other additions were a 'mothers room', a 14,000 m2 international food-court, and a new 'Lifestyle Precinct'. Development Manager Nick Sharp {{said in a statement that}} [...] "We want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more emphasis in the entertainment and leisure sectors".

2500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "War Pigs" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be called [...] "Walpurgis". It was then changed to [...] "War Pigs", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that {{the song of the}} same name had potential as a single. [...] Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: [...] "I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' you know, the Satanic version of Christmas write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'." [...] In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, [...] "It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song... Geezer also liked <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did." ...|$|E

[...] "When we came here yesterday, and found you were not in your room, a sudden idea struck her. 'I will stay here myself, this morning,' she said, 'and do his writing. I want to know what sort of a story this is that is being dictated to a sister of our House;' and so she simply turned me out and told me to go home. You don't know how frightened I was. I was afraid that, as we dress exactly alike, you might not at first notice that Sister Sarah was sitting at the table, and that you might begin with an awfully affectionate speech by Tomaso; for I knew that something of that kind was just on the point of breaking out, and I knew too that if you did it there would be lively times in the House of Martha, and perhaps here also. I fairly shivered the whole morning, and my only hope was that she would begin to snap at you as soon as you came in, and you would then know whom you had to deal with, and that you would have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> water into your love-making if you wanted any more help from the sisters. But if I had known that you would not find out that she was writing for you, I should certainly have died. I couldn't have stood it. But how in the world could you have kept on thinking that that woman was I? She is shorter and fatter, and not a bit like me, except in her clothes; and if you thought I was writing for you, why did you dictate that ridiculous stuff?" ...|$|E
5000|$|After the rushed {{production}} of the first album, Waiting for a Miracle, the band was able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more craft into Sleep No More. Frontman Stephen Fellows described how they achieved a resonant sound {{on a couple of}} the tracks: [...] "Pete Wilson suggested taking the drums out of the studio - on the fourth floor at Polydor - and putting them near the lift-shaft (elevator shaft) by the stairs. We then put microphones on the three floors above and below....Obviously we were only able to do this sort of thing in the evening when the offices were closed!" ...|$|R

Between 1982 and 1987 he undertook several humanitarian missions together with Alain Deloche and Bernard Kouchner. In 1985, Dr. Anh Tuan Dinh-Xuan initiated a joint effort between the Vietnamese humanitarian organization in the United States called the Boat People SOS Committee, based in California, and Médecins du Monde. This initiative permitted the collection of funds from the Vietnamese community in the United States to partially the rescue operations of the Vietnamese Boat people from 1985 until 1988 (the year of the last mission of Médecins du Monde in the China Sea).|$|R

He told him to imitate Junior Barnard, who had been part of the band and had a bluesy style. Shamblin was instructed to play louder and bend strings. The result was what can now be considered proto-rockabilly.|$|E
