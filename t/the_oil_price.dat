40|$|The recent {{fluctuations}} in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> have intensified <b>the</b> {{discussion on the}} dynamics and causes of real <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> changes. While <b>the</b> long-run component of real <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> {{seems to have a}} stochastic trend, global real economic activity has been thought to generate important changes in real <b>oil</b> <b>prices.</b> Based on this argument, in this paper, we analyze <b>the</b> real <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> within a trend-cycle decomposition framework, where we impose a stochastic trend and assume the cyclical term to be affected by global economic conditions. We also let the parameters vary over time to see whether shocks to trend and the cycle have changing effects on <b>the</b> real <b>oil</b> <b>prices.</b> As a result, we find that shocks to trend are more persistent recently. In that sense, this paper contributes to the literature by offering an explanation for the increased volatility in <b>oil</b> <b>prices.</b> In addition, we show that global economic activity contributed also to <b>the</b> previous <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks, which were regarded mainly as supply-side driven. <b>Oil</b> <b>prices</b> Trend and cycle decomposition Extended Kalman filter...|$|R

25|$|During the 1973–74 winter season, Clarksons's plight worsened. At the time, the UK was in {{the grip}} of a recession, as a result of the early 1970s energy crisis caused by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' oil boycott of the West in the {{aftermath}} of the 1973 Arab–Israeli War. This was a punitive measure directed against these countries for their support of Israel during that war. It led to a drastic reduction in the availability of petroleum products — including jet fuel.

30|$|The {{scenarios}} {{to investigate}} for this paper reflect {{the impact of}} external shocks {{in the form of}} changes in <b>the</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> This research was inspired by the current trend in crude <b>oil</b> <b>prices,</b> which seems to display a ‘new’ trend in crude <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> that deviates from the preceding behavior. As well as the decline in crude <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> <b>the</b> paper also looks at the cases of <b>the</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> rising. As a small open economy that is heavily dependent on exporting goods and importing commodities, the Korean economy is expected to be greatly impacted by the trends of <b>the</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another {{influential}} {{factor is}} oil revenues. Historically, in periods of {{high oil prices}} and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in crowding out domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated {{in the past couple}} of years when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; the result is that agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable chunk of the household consumption basket. Over the past few years, there have been significant price increases in agricultural products in Iran. This is due both to rising domestic demand and to rising global commodity prices.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} of expansion, farmers {{introduced}} modern production practices. The widespread use of modern inputs—chemical fertilisers and insecticides, agricultural machinery, and improved seed varieties—sharply improved crop yields. Yet the modernisation process again made farm production dependent on supplies from abroad, this time on imports of petroleum and fertilisers. By 1984 domestic sources of energy covered only about 20 percent of farm needs, while in 1950 domestic sources had supplied 70 percent of them. In the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> increases of the early 1970s, farmers began to return to local energy sources such as firewood. The existence of many farms that were too small to allow efficient use of tractors also limited mechanisation. Another weak point was the existence of many fields with open drainage ditches needing regular maintenance; in the mid-1980s, experts estimated {{that half of the}} cropland needed improved drainage works. At that time, about 1 million hectares had underground drainage, and agricultural authorities planned to help install such works on another million hectares. Despite these shortcomings, Finland's agriculture was efficient and productive—at least when compared with farming in other European countries.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, when Russian Federation {{experienced}} a severe financial crisis, its military expenditure {{in real terms}} reached its lowest point— barely one-quarter of the USSR's in 1991, and two-fifths {{of the level of}} 1992, the first year of Russia's independent existence. However, since the rise to power of Vladimir Putin and the exposure of the poor state of preparedness amongst Russia's armed forces in the Chechen Wars and the 2008 invasion of Georgian territories (e.g., South Ossetia), Russian military spending has rapidly increased, particularly after the 2008 Russian military reform. According to SIPRI, Russian military spending in real terms in 2012 was the highest it has been since Russian Federation's re-emergence as an independent nation, but is still far lower than the estimated military expenditure of the USSR in 1990 - its final full year of existence (US$291 billion at 2012 prices). The budget expanded from 1998 until 2015, but economic problems including a sharp decline in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> mean it will be cut by 5.3% in 2016 despite analysts saying that large increases are required to fund the current equipment plans and accommodate high rates of inflation; the navy may be the most likely victim of cuts.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>the</b> {{international}} <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> kept {{rising and}} losses expanded.

This study is conducted around a multiple regression model with panel data with the financial performance ratios (ROA, ROE, Profit Margin) as dependent variables and <b>the</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> as independent variables. A knowledge gap is visible since <b>the</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> was never used as an independent variable in relation to the financial performance ratios of IOCs. In addition, the IOCs in the Eurozone have not been studied since most studies focuses on the United States and Asia. Moreover these studies focus on stock returns rather than financial performance.
