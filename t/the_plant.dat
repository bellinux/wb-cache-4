5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> was {{intended}} to serve 70,000 homes in the outer northeastern suburbs of Adelaide, specifically those north of the River Torrens. The total construction cost was $14.5million, including changes to the existing pipeline. As of 2005, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> filters approximately 20% of Adelaide's water supply. A small hydroelectric plant began operating in adjacent Hope Valley in 2003, using the head of water as it flows down Anstey Hill. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> is designed to supply 7,000megawatt hours per year.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> sabotages the warning siren.|$|E

5|$|These were {{received}} at <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{in large quantities}} from wholesalers, and in smaller quantities from the corporation's own network of warehouses that spanned the United States and Canada.

5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is checked in and weighed, before {{being delivered to}} the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> the combustion gases and maximises the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

On June 30, 2009, after the river flow rate increased to over 24,000m3, all 28 generators were switched on, producing only 16,100MW because the head available during flood season is insufficient.

5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste.

50|$|A more {{advanced}} method, (aquaponics), being used experimentally in Egypt, is farming fish next to plants {{in a closed}} cycle. This allows <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> {{to benefit from the}} ammonia excreted by the fish, helping <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> to grow better {{and at the same time}} eliminating the need for changing the water for the fish, because <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> help to keep it clean by absorbing the ammonia.

50|$|Maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>planted</b> {{trees and}} shrubs involve the {{controlling}} of weeds or other competing species around <b>the</b> young <b>plants</b> and provide adequate watering {{in the event of}} summer drought conditions to help <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> establish.|$|R

5|$|Horticulturists and {{scientists}} Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones {{have proposed that}} cultivating <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> would aid in its conservation. Cultivating <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> would most likely require good water drainage, a sunny or part-shaded position and acidic soil. P.terminalis is hardy to heavy frosts, {{and is expected to}} fare better in a temperate rather than subtropical garden climate. Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by any means in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Ibicella lutea {{is another}} flypaper protocarnivore {{that has been}} the subject of several studies. Early studies {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> digested proteinaceous offerings, though the methods were crude.

5|$|In 1883, Cornell {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{university}} campuses to use electricity to light the grounds from a water-powered dynamo. In 1904, a hydroelectric plant was built in the Fall Creek gorge. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side of the gorge to power up to 1.9 megawatts of electricity. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic penalty on independently generating electricity. The abandoned plant was vandalized in 1972, but renovated and placed back into service in 1981.|$|E
50|$|After harvesting, stems are {{decorticated}} while <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> are fresh. If this is {{not done}} while <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> are still fresh <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> will dry out and the bark {{will be hard to}} remove. The bark ribbon is then dried as quickly as possible. This will prevent bacteria and fungi from attacking it.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plants</b> are {{hardy and}} can be grown easily from the seeds. Since <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> are of tropic origin, they thrive in areas with {{tropical}} climate.

A soil temperature of about 60 F is ideal for growth. <b>The</b> <b>plants</b> are relatively easy to grow and care for, having few insects that feed on them. Mites, though, are known to feed on <b>the</b> <b>plants.</b> <b>The</b> <b>plants</b> are also susceptible to leaf spotting, root rot and root strangulation. However the former two can be prevented by avoiding a damp soil and the latter by frequent weeding. Also wetting the leaf and flowers should be avoided as they can lead to fungal diseases.|$|R
