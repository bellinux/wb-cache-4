You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{finishing}} {{college in}} 1992, Welch and Rawlings moved to Nashville, Tennessee. [...] She recalled, [...] "I {{looked at my}} record collection and saw that all the music I loved {{had been made in}} Nashville—Bill Monroe, Dylan, the Stanley Brothers, Neil Young—so I moved there. Not ever <b>thinking</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thirty years too late." [...] Rawlings soon followed. In Nashville, after singing [...] "Long Black Veil", the two first realized that their voices harmonized well and they started to perform as a duo. [...] They never considered using a working name, so the duo were simply billed as [...] "Gillian Welch". [...] A year after moving to Nashville, Welch found a manager, Denise Stiff, who already managed Alison Krauss. Both Welch and Stiff ignored frequent advice that Welch should stop playing with Rawlings and join a band. They eventually signed a recording contract with Almo Sounds. [...] Following a performance opening for Peter Rowan at the Station Inn, producer T-Bone Burnett expressed interest in recording an album. Burnett did not plan to disturb Welch's and Rawlings' preference for minimal instrumentation, and Welch agreed to take him on as a producer.|$|E
2500|$|The Collective {{originally}} {{started out}} as an informal gathering of friends (many of them related to one another) who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment on East 36th Street in New York City to discuss philosophy. Barbara Branden said the group met [...] "because of a common interest in ideas". Greenspan recalled being drawn to Rand because of a shared belief in [...] "the importance of mathematics and intellectual rigor". The group met at Rand's apartment {{at least once a}} week, and would often discuss and debate into the early morning hours. About these discussions, Greenspan said, [...] "Talking to Ayn Rand was like starting a game of chess <b>thinking</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> good, and suddenly finding myself in checkmate." [...] Eventually, Rand also allowed them to begin reading the manuscript of Atlas Shrugged (1957) as she completed it. As the years went on, the Collective would proceed to play a larger, more formal role, promoting Rand's philosophy through the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI). Some Collective members gave lectures at the NBI in cities across the United States and wrote articles for its newsletters, The Objectivist Newsletter (1962–1965) and The Objectivist (1966–1971).|$|E

2500|$|In remarks aired by the CNN program D.L. Hughley Breaks the News on March 1, 2009, Steele said he, {{rather than}} Limbaugh, is [...] "the de facto {{leader of the}} Republican Party. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly." [...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those things}} where I <b>thinking</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not." [...] Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh [...] "is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, really," [...] he admitted, [...] "when I come {{to think}} of it seriously, I {{scarcely}} know. I have lived alone with an elder brother, who hates London and would be very unhappy if I got into the way of coming up regularly.
