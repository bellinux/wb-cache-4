25|$|Led {{from the}} front by Steve Waugh, Australia began the day at a {{precarious}} 291/8 but that {{would prove to be}} the high of the day for India. The 35 yr old Waugh batted well with Gillespie and then Glenn McGrath – and crossed numerous landmarks on the way – as he took Australia to a total of 445. In the process the Australian captain notched up his 25th Test century, crossing Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 24 hundreds at the time. Having never made a Test hundred in India, Waugh was more emotional than normal as he <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> the red handkerchief in his pocket, took off his helmet and raised his bat to a full house Eden crowd. He also passed Javed Miandad to become the (then) 4th highest run getter in test cricket.|$|E
25|$|The Sikh Khalsa's rise {{to power}} began in the 17th century {{during a time of}} growing militancy against Mughal rule. The {{creation}} of a Sikh Empire began when Guru Gobind Singh sent a Sikh general, Banda Singh Bahadur, to fight the Mughal rulers of India and those who had committed atrocities against Pir Buddhu Shah. Banda Singh advanced his army towards the main Muslim Mughal city of Sirhind and, following the instructions of the guru, punished all the culprits. Soon after the invasion of Sirhind, while resting in his chamber after the Rehras prayer Guru Gobind Singh was stabbed by a Pathan assassin hired by Mughals. Gobind Singh killed the attacker with his sword. Though a European surgeon stitched the Guru's wound, the wound re-opened as the Guru <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> a hard strong bow after a few days, causing profuse bleeding that led to Gobind Singh's death.|$|E

At 16:00 that same afternoon, Galland shot down a No. 611 Squadron Spitfire, but watching his victim for too long, he was himself shot down in Werknummer (Factory number) 6713, code [...] "<- + -", by a 145 Squadron Spitfire flown by Sergeant R.J.C. Grant. [...] Galland bailed out and <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> {{what he thought was}} his parachute ripcord, but was actually pulling at his parachute release harness. With a [...] "sickening" [...] feeling, he composed himself and pulled the ripcord which opened. Theo Osterkamp drove over to the hospital where Galland was being treated for his wounds and informed him his 69 victories had now earned him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (...)

500|$|Gaga {{opened the}} 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards with a {{performance}} of the song, sporting a bejeweled catsuit and a bob teal colored wig. While on tour in Japan, Gaga performed [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] and [...] "Born This Way" [...] at the 2011 MTV Video Music Aid Japan. She started the performance while hanging from a giant spider web, with her aquamarine hair extensions stuck in it. Beginning to sing, Gaga pulled and <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> the web, and ultimately broke free to join her dancers as she finished the performance. On October 16, 2011 she performed the song during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles for the Clinton Foundation. [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] was performed regularly as the penultimate song of Gaga's [...] Born This Way Ball (2012–2013) tour where she played {{the beginning of the}} song on piano atop a watch tower. She wore a Versace-designed cloth for the performance. In 2014, Gaga sang a short version of the song during the [...]|$|E
500|$|Stephanie Zacharek of Salon felt {{positively}} {{about the}} episode itself but ambivalent {{about the lack}} of resolution, stating, [...] "I'm not sure if Tuesday night's finale is a deeply unsatisfying way to close out a series that's ending before its time or the only way to end such a series." [...] However, she blamed the network for this ending. She also commented on the tone and themes of the episode, arguing that one of the series's main takeaways was that the rich would always be in charge. However, she did not view the finale as being spiteful and pessimistic: [...] "'Veronica Mars' has always been a clear-eyed show, never a bitter one." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt unsatisfied with the episode's conclusion, partially because Veronica and Logan did not resume dating. However, he praised the sex-tape mystery and the plot involving the Castle because of their similarities to earlier seasons. He also praised Keith's actions, stating, [...] "Okay, maybe I'm a sap, but this <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> my heartstrings a bit and left me relieved there wasn't a dreaded Veronica–Keith battle at the end." [...] Stransky concluded by saying that [...] "the end is fine". Sydney Bucksbaum of Zap2it felt disappointed because of the ambiguous endings of Keith's arc and Veronica's love triangle. Although she was positive towards [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] as a standalone episode, she found herself hoping that there were another episode to the season: [...] "Watching Veronica walk out into the pouring rain all alone after casting a probably insignificant vote for her dad was depressing, symbolic (rain in SoCal?), and just downright unsatisfying." ...|$|E

2500|$|Every man {{sprang to}} duty. The cheerful chanty was roared out, and heard above the howl of the gale. The cable held very hard, {{and when it}} surged over, the {{windlass}} sent the men flying about the deck, as if a galvanic battery had been applied to their hands. The vessel's head was often buried in the solid seas, and the men, soaked and sweating, yelled out hoarsely, [...] "Paddy on the Railway," [...] and [...] "We're Homeward Bound," [...] while they <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> the brakes, and wound the long, hard cable in, inch by inch.|$|E
2500|$|... "Someone like You" [...] {{was also}} {{added to the}} set list of the second concert tour by Adele, Adele Live, and it was {{performed}} during the encore. While reviewing a concert by Adele, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK, said [...] "There wasn't a dry eye in the house as Adele powered {{her way through the}} ballad, encouraging the audience to help her sing the somewhat beautiful, yet emotional chorus – giving everyone goosebumps. The sounds of Someone Like You bounced off every wall and <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> every heart-string, making it a truly special moment and something that every member of the Apollo crowd will never forget." [...] Jim Harrington of San Jose Mercury News chose the song as a highlight on the show adding that the song showed [...] "her supreme vocal talent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Turrentine of The Washington Post {{praised the}} book, writing [...] "though The Accidental {{is not a}} {{conventionally}} funny novel, readers may find themselves laughing – in surprise and delight – at the way Smith takes a literary trope and riffs on it until she's turned it inside out, the way a great jazz musician might." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club praised the book, commenting that [...] "though The Accidental is more spectacularly messy than brilliant, it has a strong perspective on {{what it means to}} be alive in the early '00s, and constantly <b>tugged</b> <b>at</b> by the disturbingly similar feelings of guilt and self-righteousness." [...] In a positive review by The Guardian, Steven Poole notes that [...] "The Accidental has an infectious sense of fun and invention. The story goes through some surprising reversals and arrives at a satisfying conclusion, which is also a beginning." [...] Kirkus Reviews called the book [...] "Dazzling wordplay and abundant imagination invigorate a tale of lives interrupted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor wrote [...] "the writing brims with wit, humor, and energy." [...] In a mixed review by 'Bookslut,' Eoin Cunningham wrote [...] "The Accidental ends up more an exercise in cleverness than a story. Equally, the reader’s enjoyment of The Accidental will be inextricably linked to their appetite for such an exercise. If you aren’t swept away by Smith’s undoubted way with words, and you rely on the bones of the story itself, you will be disappointed." ...|$|E
