5|$|The Keynesian Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by Keynes's ideas.|$|E
5|$|After being scammed by Andrew Robinson and Harry Ramsay {{into buying}} a manual {{on how to}} win a girlfriend, Chris befriends them and Summer Hoyland. Chris joins the {{basketball}} team and is later elected captain. He also begins dating Summer, which makes Harry jealous.

When Andrew realises Chris has feelings for him and is annoyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing {{the court for}} {{overriding}} the will of Congress. He accused the court of allowing itself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by political motives rather than the law. In response to the court ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision. In February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own {{to deal with the}} Supreme Court. Roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court, more sympathetic to his agenda, ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.|$|E

5|$|In June 1852 Morris entered Oxford University's Exeter College, {{although}} {{since the}} college was full, he only went into residence in January 1853. He disliked {{the college and}} was bored by {{the manner in which}} they taught him Classics. Instead he developed a keen interest in Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by the many Medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This attitude was compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present (1843), in which Carlyle championed Medieval values as a corrective to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris's dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, and he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{generation}} of painters that followed Raeburn, David Watson (1767–1837) trained with Reynolds in London before returning home {{to become the first}} president of the Scottish Academy in 1826. The influence of both Reynolds and Raeburn can be seen in his work, including A Girl Drawing (1813) and the large group portrait The Children of the Earl of Elgin with their Nurse (c. 1805). He was followed as president of the academy by his nephew John Watson Gordon (1788–1864), who also studied with Raeburn. He painted portraits of leading cultural figures James Hogg and Lady Nairne as part of a series of portraits commissioned by William Blackwood. From the 1840s his work began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, {{as can be seen in}} his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847).|$|E
5|$|Tensions in Johnson County {{remained}} high. On May 10, a Marshal named George Wellman, who {{had been}} appointed deputy U.S. Marshal by Marshall Rankin, was ambushed and killed by locals {{en route to the}} small community of Buffalo. The incident received national attention, with Wellman being the only Marshal to die in the war. His death was grieved by a large crowd, and his funeral service took place in St. Lukes Church, Buffalo. The 6th Cavalry who was sent to relieve the county of its violence, was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by intense local political and social pressure, and they were unable to keep the peace. In one incident, a group of men set fire to the Post exchange and planted a homemade bomb in the cavalry's barracks. Noted officer Charles B. Gatewood was seriously injured by the bomb blast in the barracks; shattering his left arm and disabling him from serving in the Cavalry anymore.|$|E

5|$|The Western Ganga {{rule was}} a period of brisk {{literary}} activity in Sanskrit and Kannada, though many of the writings are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them. Chavundaraya's writing, Chavundaraya Purana (or Trishashtilakshana mahapurana) of 978 CE, is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings, Adipurana and Uttarapurana which were written a century earlier by Jinasena and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I. The prose, composed in lucid Kannada, was mainly meant for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. His writings seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by the writings of his predecessor Adikavi Pampa and contemporary Ranna. The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty-four Jain Tirthankar, twelve Chakravartis, nine Balabhadras, nine Narayanas and nine Pratinarayanas.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> {{in part by}} the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

5|$|From {{the mid-nineteenth}} century {{portrait}} painting declined as an art. This was {{partly due to the}} advent of photography, which could record the human face with greater ease. While grander commissions were still made, the miniature in particular, which had often been in an intimate locket or brooch, was largely replaced. David Octavius Hill (1802–70) originally took an interest in photography as a means of being able to record the figures of Great Disruption of 1843 for a composite painted portrait, but as part of Hill & Adamson {{he was one of the}} founding fathers of art photography. Just as portrait photography inherited many of the conventions of painting, photography also began to influence painting. From the 1840s John Watson Gordon's work began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, as can be seen in his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847). Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803–69), William Quiller Orchardson (1832–1910) and John Pettie (1839–93). John Zephaniah Bell (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists from the later nineteenth century. The most significant grouping in late nineteenth-century Scotland, the Glasgow Boys, mainly focused on landscape. They were influenced by the leading continental artists of the day and broke with Victorian convention. A number of artists identified with the group came to support themselves through portrait painting, including James Guthrie (1859–1930) and Belfast-born John Lavery (1856–1944).|$|E
5|$|The average {{lifespan}} of {{bald eagles}} {{in the wild}} is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by its location and access to prey. As {{they are no longer}} heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a cougar (Puma concolor) ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.|$|E
