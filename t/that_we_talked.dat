500|$|The {{area was}} named after Scarborough, Yorkshire, England by Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first {{lieutenant}} governor of Upper Canada. The bluffs along Scarborough's Lake Ontario shores {{reminded her of the}} limestone cliffs in Scarborough, England. On August 4, 1793, she wrote in her diary, [...] "The shore is extremely bold, and has the appearance of chalk cliffs, but I believe they are only white sand. They appeared so well <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of building a summer residence there and calling it Scarborough." [...] Before that, the area was named Glasgow, after the Scottish city.|$|E
500|$|While {{planning}} the fourth season, Marvel {{suggested that the}} series introduce Ghost Rider, after the character's film rights had returned to Marvel from Sony in May 2013. Loeb felt that this made the season unquestionably [...] "the series' biggest" [...] with the [...] "most ambitious story yet". He added that [...] "one of the things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> about is, S.H.I.E.L.D. always looked out for the weird, the unusual, {{the things that were}} and could be a problem for the public," [...] and Marvel realized that Ghost Rider's abilities, which are more mystical than anything seen in the series to date, opened up [...] "a quarter of the universe that we haven't really {{spent a lot of time}} exploring ... what happens if our very real, our very grounded agents who are very much a family have to take on something that is as bizarre and powerful and unique as Ghost Rider." [...] Bell added that the producers would have been willing to give an entire season of the show to a Ghost Rider arc if the season was 13 episodes or less, but 22 episodes seemed too long to [...] "feel like one flavor".|$|E
2500|$|On October 29, 2001, White House {{spokesman}} Scott Stanzel [...] "disputed {{reports that}} the anthrax sent to the Senate contained bentonite, an additive that ha been used in Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's biological weapons program". Stanzel said, [...] "Based on the test results we have, no bentonite has been found". The same day, Major General John Parker at a White House briefing stated, [...] "We do know that we found silica in the samples. Now, we don't know what that motive would be, or why it would be there, or anything. But there is silica in the samples. And that led us to be absolutely sure {{that there was no}} aluminum in the sample, because the combination of a silicate, plus aluminum, is sort of the major ingredients of bentonite." [...] Just over a week later, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Ridge in a White House press conference on November 7, 2001, stated, [...] "The ingredient <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> about before was silicon." [...] Neither Ross at ABC nor anyone else publicly pursued any further claims about bentonite, despite Ross's original claim that [...] "four well-placed and separate sources" [...] had confirmed its detection.|$|E

6000|$|... "We got chatting about you, my ownest," [...] said Marmaduke; [...] "and {{the subject}} was so sweet, and the moments were so fleet, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> for quite {{an hour on the}} strict q.t. Eh, Marian?" ...|$|E
60|$|After <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of {{this thing}} and of another, it makes little {{difference}} what, I meanwhile watching the sun until my eyes ran water, coming to believe now {{and then it was}} standing still in the heavens, so slowly did it move.|$|E

6000|$|And I {{remember}} too <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> endlessly {{about the}} things I was {{to do in the}} world. I do not remember <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> {{about the things}} she was to do, by some sort of instinct and some sort of dexterity she evaded that, from the very first she had reserves from me, but my career and purpose became as it were the form in which we discussed all the purposes of life. I became Man in her imagination, the protagonist of the world. At first I displayed the modest worthy desire for respectable service that Harbury had taught me, but her clear, sceptical little voice pierced and tore all those pretences to shreds. [...] "Do some decent public work," [...] I said, or some such phrase.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of the past, and speculated on the future.

5000|$|... “Coming {{up with a}} plan {{aimed at}} {{rebuilding}} the country … will require <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about the true issues, and God knows how many they are: insecurity, the sharp financial crisis, the AIDS pandemic and all its consequences, the disaster in the area of education. The issues are many.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Daniel Everett {{has gone}} as far as {{claiming}} that universal grammar does not exist. In his words, [...] "universal grammar doesn't seem to work, there doesn't seem to be much evidence for it. And what can we put in its place? A complex interplay of factors, of which culture, the values human beings share, {{plays a major role in}} structuring the way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> and the things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about." [...] Michael Tomasello, a developmental psychologist, also supports this claim, arguing that [...] "although many aspects of human linguistic competence have indeed evolved biologically, specific grammatical principles and constructions have not. And universals in the grammatical structure of different languages have come from more general processes and constraints of human cognition, communication, and vocal-auditory processing, operating during the conventionalization and transmission of the particular grammatical constructions of particular linguistic communities." ...|$|R

60|$|Florence Farr's {{way home}} was mine also for {{a part of}} the way, and it was often of this <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> and sometimes, though not always, she would share my hesitations, and for years to come I was to wonder {{whenever}} Shaw became my topic, whether the cock crowed for my blame or for my praise.|$|E
60|$|After <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> no more, but {{watched the}} fight. And John Harned was going mad all the time, {{and we did}} not know. The bull refused to charge the horse. And the horse stood still, and because it could not see it did not know that the capadors were trying to make the bull charge upon it. The capadors teased the bull their capes, and when it charged them they ran toward the horse and into their shelters. At last the bull was angry, and it saw the horse before it.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{went out}} to walk over long hills, and looked at Criffel, then without his cap, and down into Wordsworth's country. There we sat down, and talked of the {{immortality}} of the soul. It was not Carlyle's fault <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> on that topic, for he had the natural disinclination of every nimble spirit to bruise itself against walls, and {{did not like to}} place himself where no step can be taken. But he was honest and true, and cognizant of the subtile links that bind ages together, and saw how every event affects all the future. 'Christ died on the tree: that built Dunscore kirk yonder: that brought you and me together. Time has only a relative existence.' ...|$|E
60|$|I do not {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> much of love, though we were very much in love. We kissed; sometimes greatly daring we walked hand in hand; once I took {{her in my arms}} and carried her over a swampy place beyond the Killing Wood, and held her closely to me; that was a great event between us; but we were shy of one another, shy even of very intimate words; and a thousand daring and beautiful things I dreamt of saying to her went unsaid. I do {{not remember}} any endearing names from that time. But we jested and shared our humors, shaped our developing ideas in quaint forms to amuse one another and talked--as young men talk together.|$|E
60|$|The {{meal was}} a culinary success. But more, {{it was a}} social triumph--chiefly, I think, owing to the rare tact of Miggles in guiding the conversation, asking all the {{questions}} herself, yet bearing throughout a frankness that rejected the idea of any concealment on her own part, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of ourselves, of our prospects, of the journey, of the weather, of each other--of everything but our host and hostess. It must be confessed that Miggles's conversation was never elegant, rarely grammatical, and that at times she employed expletives the use of which had generally been yielded to our sex. But they were delivered with such a lighting-up of teeth and eyes, and were usually followed by a laugh--a laugh peculiar to Miggles--so frank and honest {{that it seemed to}} clear the moral atmosphere.|$|E

To celebrate him signing to RCA, GoldLink and Soulection released a remixed version of And After <b>That,</b> <b>We</b> Didn't <b>Talk.</b> Later <b>that</b> year, he {{released his}} new single [...] "Fall In Love" [...] featuring fellow DC rapper and close friend Cisero, produced by BADBADNOTGOOD and Kaytranada.|$|R

"And {{before she}} could speak again I began to talk, talking eloquently--as I could do in that life--talking to exalt love, to make the life we were living seem heroic and glorious; and the thing I was deserting {{something}} hard and enormously ignoble {{that it was a}} fine thing to set aside. I bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it, seeking not only to convert her but myself to <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>talked,</b> and she clung to me, torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that she knew was sweet. And at last I did make it heroic, made all the thickening disaster of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our unparalleled love, and we two poor foolish souls strutted there at last, clad in that splendid delusion, drunken rather with that glorious delusion, under the still stars.|$|E
6000|$|The {{people of}} those foreign {{countries}} are very, very ignorant. They [...] looked curiously at the costumes we had {{brought from the}} wilds of [...] America. They observed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> loudly at table sometimes. [...] They noticed that we looked out for expenses, and got what we [...] conveniently could out of a franc, and wondered where in the [...] mischief we came from. In Paris they just simply opened their eyes [...] and stared when we spoke to them in French! We never did succeed in [...] making those idiots understand their own language. One of our [...] passengers said to a shopkeeper, in reference to a proposed return [...] to buy a pair of gloves, [...] "Allong restay trankeel--may be ve coom [...] Moonday;" [...] and would you believe it, that shopkeeper, a born [...] Frenchman, had to ask {{what it was that}} had been said.

6000|$|... "We'll {{have one}} last talk together," [...] I said, and planned {{that we should}} meet for a half a day between Dover and Walmer and talk {{ourselves}} out. I still recall that day very well, recall even the curious exaltation of grief that made our mental atmosphere distinctive and memorable. We had seen so much of one another, had become so intimate, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of parting even as we parted {{with a sense of}} incredible remoteness. We went together up over the cliffs, and to a place where they fall towards the sea, past the white, quaint-lanterned lighthouses of the South Foreland. There, in a kind of niche below the crest, we sat talking. It was a spacious day, serenely blue and warm, and on the wrinkled water remotely below a black tender and six hooded submarines came presently, and engaged in mysterious manoeuvers. Shrieking gulls and chattering jackdaws circled over us and below us, and dived and swooped; and a skerry of weedy, fallen chalk appeared, and gradually disappeared again, as the tide fell and rose.|$|E
