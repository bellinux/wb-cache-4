5|$|Scully is {{approached}} by the Dark Figure, who is {{revealed to be}} a Seraph, an angel who descended from the heavens and fathered four children with a mortal woman. God sent the Seraph to return the girls to Heaven {{in order to keep}} the Devil from claiming them as his own. Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but the women are confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly lets go of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes that they are now in a place where they were meant to be.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, {{a year after}} the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.|$|E
5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E

500|$|On 10 January, one {{of their}} lawyers, Manohar Lal Sharma, said in a media {{interview}} that the victims {{were responsible for the}} assault because <b>they</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> using public transportation and, as an unmarried couple, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> on the streets at night. He went on to say: [...] "Until today I have not seen a single incident or example of rape with a respected lady. Even an underworld don would not like to touch a girl with respect." [...] He also called the male victim [...] "wholly responsible" [...] for the incident because he [...] "failed in his duty to protect the woman".|$|R

25|$|The rising tone {{of panic}} in these {{messages}} convinced Broome {{and every other}} recipient that Tirpitz was approaching. Since {{the first of the}} messages was not directly addressed to Broome, he was not immediately aware that the cruisers were withdrawing. In fact, although <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{out of sight of the}} convoy, because of navigational errors they were clearly visible as they worked up to full speed. Convinced that the cruisers were about to engage enemy ships, Broome collected the miscellany of destroyers in EG1 and attached them to the cruisers, while the convoy scattered.|$|E
25|$|During his tenure, {{the major}} issues facing state {{government}} were related to secondary education and highway construction. With {{the passage of the}} controversial School Codes of 1919 and 1921 Delaware was committed to an aggressive program of school construction. Pierre S. du Pont had agreed to get the process started and provided the massive financial support from his own funds. However, that could not continue forever and yet the General Assembly refused to levy additional taxes. Fortunately the new income tax and corporate franchise tax were capable of producing the revenue needed, but it was suspected everyone was not filing as <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> To remedy the situation Robinson appointed du Pont himself to be the State Tax Commissioner. Du Pont quickly modernized the office, increased the revenue from the income tax and assured the continuation of the school building program.|$|E

25|$|The {{trial began}} on 21 April 1924. It lasted about two weeks. Near {{the end of}} the trial, Overturf testified in his own defense. He denied the charges, but {{admitted}} that several appraisals were higher than <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> due to inaccurate measurements of the properties. In addition, Overturf testified that he had asked the veterans’ aid commission several times for instructions on how to prepare his appraisal, but had received no answer to his queries. The jury deliberated for twelve hours before finding Overturf and other defendants guilty of mail fraud. However, after the verdict the jury petitioned the judge for leniency in sentencing, recommending that Overturf and the others be given fines rather than prison sentences. The judge agreed, giving Overturf a $1,000 fine and the others three defendants $500 fines. Overturf paid his fine and did not appeal the outcome of the trial.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Midnighters as a {{group were}} {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A special subcommittee, appointed by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, addressed the question of recognizing pioneering groups {{that had not been}} inducted in the Hall's early years, when their front men were inducted. As a result of this committee's decision, the Midnighters were automatically inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside Hank Ballard, without the normal process of nomination and voting, under the premise that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> inducted with Ballard in 1990. The inducted members were Henry Booth, Billy Davis, Cal Green, Arthur Porter, Lawson Smith, Charles Sutton, Norman Thrasher, and Sonny Woods. Original Midnighters Smith (now known as Abdul Bin-Asad) and Thrasher, the last surviving members of the group, accepted the induction on behalf of the group and acknowledged departed members, including the group's founder, Alonzo Tucker, who was not inducted.|$|E

500|$|People {{living in}} the {{vicinity}} of the illegal factory said that the number of deaths might have been reduced had the fire service responded promptly. They claimed that the fire brigade failed to send personnel or equipment to the scene until more than an hour after the brigade first received word of the fire. Residents also claimed that it was only after the police arrived and requested fire service backup that any help was sent. In addition, some on the scene reported an inadequate number of ambulances. The city's [...] mayor admitted to this lapse the following morning.

500|$|Windows 8.1 {{received}} more positive reviews than Windows 8. Tom Warren of The Verge still considered the platform to be a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{due to the}} number of apps available, the impaired level of capabilities that apps have in comparison to desktop programs, and because he felt that mouse and keyboard navigation was still [...] "awkward". However, he touted many of the major changes on Windows 8.1, such as the expanded snapping functionality, increased Start screen customization, SkyDrive and Bing integration, improvements to stock apps, and particularly he considered the Mail app to be [...] "lightyears ahead" [...] of the original version from 8.

500|$|In 2009 the US {{corporation}} Kraft made {{a takeover}} bid for Cadbury Schweppes. [...] Cadbury's {{were seen as}} iconic of British manufacturing industry, and the bid became a cause célèbre of national interest. [...] To sweeten their case before the Monopolies Commission, Kraft made a pledge to keep the Cadbury factory at Somerdale open if they were successful in their bid for the company; and their bid was duly successful. However, {{within a week of}} completing their purchase of Cadbury, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld released a statement announcing that Kraft were to close the factory by 2011, as originally planned by Cadbury. The stated reason for this was that it was only after the purchase had been made that Kraft realised how advanced Cadbury's plans were, but industry experts questioned this, arguing that Kraft invested so much in researching their bid for Cadbury that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aware {{of the extent to which}} plans had been advanced.|$|E
