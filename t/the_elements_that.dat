5|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of all <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> have been produced in amounts large enough to see {{with the unaided eye}} (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university and the state of California.|$|E

5|$|Uranium, element 92, is the {{heaviest}} of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> occur significantly in nature; heavier elements can only practically {{be produced by}} synthesis. The first synthesis of a new element—neptunium, element 93—occurred in 1940 {{by a team of}} scientists in the United States. In the coming years, American scientists undoubtedly synthesized the following elements up to mendelevium, element 101, in 1955. However, starting with element 102, priority of discovery was contested between American and Soviet physicists.|$|E
5|$|Within 100 {{years of}} the {{appearance}} of Mendeleev's table in 1869 {{it has been estimated}} that around 700 different periodic table versions were published. As well as numerous rectangular variations, other periodic table formats have been shaped, for example, like a circle, cube, cylinder, building, spiral, lemniscate, octagonal prism, pyramid, sphere, or triangle. Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables.|$|E

5|$|Early {{concepts}} {{were very}} different from the final film. The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. Docter's next idea introduced many of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting, and that people would forgive the minor inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|The 22.5-foot (6.85m) James Caird was {{launched}} on 24 April 1916. The {{success of the}} voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations {{that would have to}} be made in the most unfavourable of conditions. The prevailing wind was helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in twenty-six years at sea. On 8 May South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.|$|E
5|$|The Year of the Sex Olympics {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} production when the 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers and Listeners Association obtained a copy of the script and attempted to block the production. Her objections were overruled by Hugh Greene. Location filming for the outdoor scenes set on the island that appears in The Live Life Show took place on the Isle of Man between 8 and 10 May 1968. A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist. Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May, covering <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the Sportsex, Artsex and Foodshow programmes as well as the audience reaction shots. The scene where Kin Hodder falls to his death was also shot at Ealing. Following rehearsals, the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June. Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production, {{and by the end of}} the recording session the final ten minutes of the play remained untaped, leading to a remount on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes.|$|E

25|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> form {{volatile}} high-valence fluorides {{will also}} form volatile high-valence chlorides. Chlorination and distillation is another possible method for separation. The sequence of separation may differ usefully from the sequence for fluorides; for example, zirconium tetrachloride and tin tetrachloride have relatively low boiling points of 331°C and 114.1°C. Chlorination {{has even been}} proposed as a method for removing zirconium fuel cladding, instead of mechanical decladding.|$|E
25|$|All <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> can be {{superimposed}} {{on each other}} by symmetries are said to form a symmetry orbit.

If {{all the elements of}} a given dimension, say all the faces, lie in the same orbit, the figure is said to be transitive on that orbit. For example, a cube is face-transitive, while a truncated cube has two symmetry orbits of faces.|$|E
25|$|The {{uniqueness}} of Janus in Latium has suggested to L. Adams Holland and J.
