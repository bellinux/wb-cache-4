2500|$|In December 2001, {{shortly before}} leaving office, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani {{announced}} [...] "tentative agreements" [...] {{for both the}} Mets and New York Yankees to build new stadiums. Of the $1.6 billion sought for the stadiums, city and state taxpayers would pick up half <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> <b>for</b> construction, $800 million, along with $390 million on extra transportation. The plan {{also said that the}} teams would be allowed to keep all parking revenues, which state officials had already said they wanted to keep to compensate the state for building new garages for the teams. The teams would keep 96% of ticket revenues and 100% of all other revenues, not pay sales tax or property tax on the stadium, and would get low-cost electricity from New York state. [...] Business officials criticized the plan as giving too much money to successful teams with little reason to move to a different city.|$|E
