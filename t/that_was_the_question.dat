Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

Looking at the case of Nazi Germany, two groups stand out as good case studies: the SS Einsatzgruppen and the SS cadres in the Death camps. The following analysis {{will focus on the}} motivations of these men to commit mass murder. I argue for a causal sequence of action, beginning with the onset of Nazi ideology, further followed by the dehumanization of the victim and the brutalization of the perpetrator. I will demonstrate how the ideology present during German interwar society influenced these men into participation. Dehumanization and brutalization <b>are</b> complimentary factors <b>that</b> push these men into action...|$|R

40|$|What do adults need {{in order}} to succeed in postsecondary {{education}} and training? <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> facing Ohio, where 45 % of adults ages 25 - 54 (2. 1 million) have no postsecondary education, and employers have a growing demand for a skilled workforce. The Ohio General Assembly sought to address this pressing issue by passing legislation instructing the Ohio Board of Regents (OBR) and the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) to develop a statewide system of "stackable" certificates capable of engaging lowskilled adults in college. The state interagency team charged with designing stackable certificates asked Columbus State Community College (CSCC) to facilitate the design process. CSCC engaged Community Research Partners (CRP), a nonprofit research and workforce policy center, to conduct national benchmarking in search of other stackable certificate type programming. Columbus State contributed to the research by conducting stakeholder focus groups. This information is contained in another report...|$|R
40|$|Why {{was there}} no {{populism}} in Iowa? <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> posed by Jeffrey Ostler, {{assistant professor of}} history at the University of Oregon, in this revised version of his dissertation. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> itself <b>is</b> more complicated than it might first seem, and Ostler 2 ̆ 7 s thoughtful and carefully-researched answers have interesting implications for the study of late 19 th century politics more generally. Ostler approaches his question by comparing Iowa with Kansas and Nebraska. Arguing that the economic situation of farmers in <b>the</b> three states <b>was</b> not sufficiently different to explain the great dissimilarity in their support for the Populist Party in the 1890 s, he demonstrates that the Farmers 2 ̆ 7 Alliance developed comparable levels of strength in all three states. The key differences, he maintains, are to be found instead within the system of party politics within each state and the reception that the Alliance found in each state for its proposals...|$|R
