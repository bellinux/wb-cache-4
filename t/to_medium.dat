In interviews, Garfield has spoken of his {{extensive}} year-long preparation for the role with James Martin, a practicing Jesuit priest working in New York. Garfield detailed that the preparation with Martin included extensive research and immersion in the Jesuit lifestyle and frame of mind which was felt to be essential to the accuracy of the film by the producers. Garfield, who is of slight <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> frame, reported losing 40 pounds to play the role following the rules of abstention which were outlined to him by Martin.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a {{revolution}} in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes' magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.|$|E

5|$|Many unique {{varieties}} of mango are {{native to the}} country, most having been developed {{during the second half}} of the 20th century. New and improved mango varieties are still introduced to markets every few years. Arguably the most popular variety is the Maya type, which is small <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> in size, fragrant, colourful (featuring 3-4 colours) and usually fiberless. The Israeli mango season begins in May, and the last of the fruit ripen as October draws near. Different varieties are present on markets at different months, with the Maya type seen between July and September. Mangos are frequently used in fusion dishes and for making Sorbet.|$|E

5|$|The venom of Portia {{is unusually}} {{powerful}} against spiders. When a Portia stabs a small <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> spider (up to the Portia′s weight), including another Portia, the prey usually runs away for about 100 to 200millimetres, enters convulsions, becomes paralysed after 10 to 30seconds, and continues convulsing for 10seconds to 4minutes. Portia slowly approaches the prey and takes it. Portia usually needs to inflict up to 15stabbings to completely immobilise a larger spider (1.5 to 2times to the Portia′s weight), and then Portia may wait about 20 to 200millimetres away for 15 to 30minutes from seizing the prey. Insects {{are usually not}} immobilised so quickly but continue to struggle, sometimes for several minutes.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear is an {{important}} aspect of a squall line. In low <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to help create a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E

5|$|The Bird Community Index, {{a measure}} of the quality of a habitat based on the {{presence}} of songbirds, has been tested for most of the watershed of Nescopeck Creek. The Bird Community Index was high in one area near the source of Nescopeck Creek. In all other areas of the watershed, the index was low <b>to</b> <b>medium.</b> One of the lowest values is near Nescopeck Creek's mouth. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) has been measured for a number of sites along Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries. Upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, Little Nescopeck Creek B has a high HBI. However, just downstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, the HBI drops off by a large amount. Black Creek has an HBI of 0 to 6.6, and this tributary's biodiversity is lower at its headwaters than at its confluence with Nescopeck Creek. Nescopeck Creek's HBI is from 1.7 to 5.4, depending on the site. In Nescopeck Creek, the total number of macroinvertebrate taxa at several sites ranges from 5 to 26. In Little Nescopeck Creek, the values range from 1 to 18. In Black Creek, the number ranges from 0 to 11.|$|E

5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} breeds across Europe and Asia east {{to eastern}} Siberia and north to about 70°N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran. It is migratory, {{but it is}} one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5metres (16ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> mix of grasses, bracken, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the willow warbler (P. trochilus) prefers younger trees, while the wood warbler (P. sibilatrix) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis, so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.|$|E
40|$|Proliferating serum-dependent 3 T 3 cells prolong their intermitotic time by 9 - 10 h after {{exposure}} <b>to</b> serum-free <b>medium</b> for only 1 h.

These data confirm earlier findings that cells {{are very sensitive to}} growth factor or serum depletion during the first part of G and that only a short exposure <b>to</b> serum-free <b>medium</b> is sufficient for the cells to leave the cell cycle.

This delay of the progeny cycle is mainly ascribable to the postmitotic part of G (Gipm).
