5|$|Max Payne 2 is a third-person shooter, {{in which}} the player assumes the role of Max Payne, but also plays as Mona Sax in a few levels. Initially, the player's weapon is a 9mm pistol. As they progress, players access other weapons {{including}} other handguns, shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and hand-thrown weapons. To move the game along, the player is <b>told</b> <b>what</b> the next objective is through Max's internal monologue, in which Max iterates what his next steps should be.|$|E
5|$|FBI {{director}} J. Edgar Hoover designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background {{investigations of}} employees {{were carried out}} by FBI agents. This was a major assignment {{that led to the}} number of agents in the Bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's sense of the Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know the identities of those who accused them. In many cases they were not even <b>told</b> <b>what</b> they were accused of.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force {{opens with}} Shephard riding on a V-22 Osprey with his squad. His squad discuss their deployment, {{somewhat}} irritated {{that they have}} not been <b>told</b> <b>what</b> they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him.|$|E

He got {{a degree in}} animal nutrition from Iowa, worked as a builder, produced rodeos, staged and performed Western music jamborees, and worked as an advertising manager for a radio station from 1962 onwards. Holt later said of this period:Do you {{realize that this is}} the first time in my life that I can make my own decisions and do what I want to do? First it was my parents who <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> to do, then RKO <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> to do, then I went into the service and Uncle Sam <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> to do. I came back out and RKO still <b>told</b> me <b>what</b> to do. This is the first time I have not been under somebody's thumb in my life.http://comicvine.gamespot.com/red-mask/4005-1345/ ...|$|R

5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds nothing wrong with reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does {{not like to be}} <b>told</b> <b>what</b> she can and cannot do. After it is confirmed that she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was <b>told</b> <b>what</b> happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that one piece of bone was human but it did not belong to Natalee.|$|E
5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

25|$|Various {{approaches}} in pedagogy derive from constructivist theory. They usually suggest that learning is accomplished best using a hands-on approach.

25|$|The crucial private Dáil {{session on}} 6 January was {{informed}} {{that it could not}} be told about a private conference of nine TDs that had reached a compromise agreement on almost all points the night before. Most TDs wanted at least to be <b>told</b> <b>what</b> matters were still not agreed on, and from this point onwards the pro-treaty members insisted that all sessions should be held in public.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of his tenure as President, Saúl Osorio founded the weekly Siete Días en la USAC, which besides reporting on the activities of the University, constantly denounced the violation of human rights, especially the repression against the popular movement. It also <b>told</b> <b>what</b> was happening with revolutionary movements in both Nicaragua and El Salvador. For a few months, the state university was a united and progressive institution, preparing to confront the State head on.|$|E
25|$|The moon never rose again, and {{the people}} {{wondered}} what had happened until the man she had rescued remembered and <b>told</b> <b>what</b> he had seen. A wise woman sent them into the bog until they found a coffin (the stone), a candle (the will-o'-the-wyke), and a cross (the snag); the moon would be nearby. They did as the wise woman said, and freed the moon. From this time on the moon has shone brighter over the boglands than anywhere else, and the evil things were chased from the Carland.|$|E

25|$|In the episode, a 911 call {{directs the}} police to the modern-day asylum. At the past asylum, little Jenny Reynolds (Nikki Hahn) becomes a new patient after her mother (Amy Farrington) {{believes}} she has killed someone. Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) finally gets evidence of Dr. Arden's (James Cromwell) horrific past, but puts someone's life and her career at stake as Arden, Monsignor Howard (Joseph Fiennes), and Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe) indirectly form an evil union. Lana (Sarah Paulson) remains a hostage of Dr. Thredson (Zachary Quinto), but is <b>told</b> <b>what</b> set him off onto his dark path. Chloë Sevigny guest stars as Shelley.|$|E
25|$|Without {{waiting to}} be <b>told</b> <b>what</b> to do by the Senate, Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An {{aqueduct}} (the Aqua Appia) secured the water supply {{of the city of}} Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the Pontine Marshes to the coast northwest of Naples, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became consul twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.|$|E
25|$|The German air {{operations}} staff, at all levels, also practiced {{the concept of}} Auftragstaktik (or mission command) doctrine. It encouraged the improvisation of tactics {{within the framework of}} set operational goals and advocated by-passing some levels of command under some circumstances. The air units were <b>told</b> <b>what</b> to achieve by high echelons, but not how to do it. This form of command was encouraged at the lowest levels to maintain the initiative and operational tempo. The form of warfare was an ad hoc style, but it allowed field commanders to dis-assemble and re-assemble command structures at Air Corps level, and commit them to a crisis, or urgent operations within a short period of time. This gave the Luftwaffe an unmatched degree of tactical and operational flexibility.|$|E

Little Rock <b>told</b> <b>what</b> he had learned about the raids along the Saline and Solomon rivers. According to Little Rock's account, a war party of about 200 Cheyennes from a camp above the forks of Walnut Creek {{departed}} camp intending to go out against the Pawnee. Instead, they raided white settlements along the Saline and Solomon rivers. Some of the warriors returned to Black Kettle's camp. Little Rock learned from them what took place. Little Rock named the warriors most responsible for the raids and agreed {{to try to have}} them delivered to white authorities.|$|E
25|$|In March 1948, David Ben-Gurion ordered Ze'ev HaYam (literally, Sea Wolf), one of {{the main}} figures in Israel's early navy and {{merchant}} marine, to go to Italy to find ships that could be procured for the naval service. While Ze'ev HaYam procured two large motor boats and two landing craft, he wanted to acquire the Decima Flottiglia MAS's MT explosive motorboats that had been used in the Raid on Souda Bay to ram into and destroy larger ships. Ze'ev HaYam believed that these boats could turn the tide of the war. With the help of a relative and Ben-Gurion's consent, he bought six refurbished boats for $3,000 each from an ailing factory, and while the factory owners were <b>told</b> <b>what</b> the boats were for, to the outside they were disguised as racing boats.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} of the Paths of the Dead adds a conversation between Aragorn and the King of the Dead (in the book the Dead don't speak at all) and a scene where the companions must flee an avalanche of skulls, but leaves out the encounter with Baldor's skeleton. In contrast to the book, the viewer doesn't get <b>told</b> <b>what</b> happened in Lebennin between Aragorn and the Corsairs of Umbar. The film version (Extended Edition) doesn't correspond with the map of Gondor, as the company sees a near river with Corsair ships immediately after leaving the Haunted Mountain. In the book, the River Anduin lies several hundred miles farther east, requiring a much longer journey with the Army of the Dead following behind, bringing terror to the towns they pass along the way.|$|E
