5|$|According to Swami Vivekananda, Sita {{is typical}} of India – the {{idealized}} India. Swami Vivekananda assured if world literature {{of the past and}} world literature of the future are thoroughly exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another Sita, because Sita is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} attack at 12:37 to the {{explosion}} at 14:23, Yamato {{was hit by}} at least 11 torpedoes and six bombs. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been two more torpedo and bomb hits, {{but this is not}} confirmed.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, {{during an}} {{excavation}} by South Trafford Archaeological Group, fragments of Roman pottery {{were found in}} the area now occupied by the cemetery – previously the site of Urmston Old Hall – suggesting that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a Roman settlement on the site. In the early 13th century, Lord Greenhalgh and his family lived at Highfield House (under what is now the M60 motorway).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the leper colony on Brei Holm <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony.|$|E
5|$|In fast-progressing cases, {{mortality}} {{was primarily}} from pneumonia, by virus-induced pulmonary consolidation. Slower-progressing cases featured secondary bacterial pneumonias, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been neural involvement {{that led to}} mental disorders in some cases. Some deaths resulted from malnourishment.|$|E

5|$|This may again {{suggest the}} amphitheatre was flooded, as the {{monument}} referred to {{could be an}} altar of Diana, or Pluto, or of Jupiter Latiaris {{that may have been}} present in the centre of the arena, but Pliny the Elder mentions a bridge in connection with the lake of Augustus, suggesting <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been an island there as well.|$|E
5|$|While <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{been the}} {{occasional}} fusion, Bouyon has always maintained a very clear, recognisable and obviously different style from soca. This style of bouyon music was originated in Dominica, {{but is also}} very popular in Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe and Martinique.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E

50|$|Cline also {{suggests}} {{the possibility that}} <b>there</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> been a historical battle of Megiddo involving Josiah, since there's little historical attestation for it outside the Bible. For example, Josiah <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been killed by Necho in some other circumstances.|$|R
5|$|As a {{token of}} respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some {{combination}} of the three to Elagabal as consort. A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. In fact, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.|$|E
5|$|As with written records, {{the archaeological}} {{evidence}} for this period is not extensive, {{and knowledge of the}} daily lives of the population is lacking. It is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E
5|$|At one time, one {{hurricane}} researcher {{identified a}} tropical storm over Cuba in late August, {{although there was no}} evidence the storm actually existed. There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October22, although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E

5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books {{that were in the}} cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. Similar work had been carried out at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been some competition between the two men. The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post}} medieval period {{until the early}} 18th century it served as a {{hospital}} for the local population. In 1829 repairs were carried out to the church. Excavations in 1885 found floor tiles with coats of arms and a pavement from the 14th century beneath which were several coffins. According {{to the findings of}} later resistivity and gradiometer surveys there may also have been a formal Tudor garden and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been fish ponds.|$|E

5|$|Extant East Asian {{starling}}s, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the {{white-headed starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings {{seem to be more}} closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E
5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
