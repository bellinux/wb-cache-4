5|$|Danton was a semi-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy and {{the lead}} ship of her class. She was a <b>technological</b> <b>leap</b> in battleship development for the French Navy, as {{she was the first}} ship in the fleet with turbine engines. However, like all battleships of her type, she was completed after the Royal Navy battleship , and as such she was outclassed before she was even commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw the Echo take a huge <b>technological</b> <b>leap</b> forward when a £12million {{printing}} press was installed. It {{was used for}} the first time in December 1996 and was capable of printing up to 70,000newspapers an hour. The press was part of a multimillion-pound revamp, which also saw journalists making up full news pages on computer screens for the first time. The Echos first internet news service was also launched in 1996. A further £5million was spent on updating the pre-press and press hall area in 2004, to improve printing quality and speed of production.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the most financial viable option, and while the A-7 lacked the interception and air superiority capabilities initially required for the F-86 replacement, it was seen that the aircraft would still provide a <b>technological</b> <b>leap</b> and an improvement in human resources qualification to the Air Force. Furthermore, {{the selection of the}} A-7 permitted more cost reductions by allowing the Air Force to move from two distinct aircraft types, one dedicated to air defense and the other to ground attack, to a single aircraft.|$|E

500|$|Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo {{called the}} storyline {{of a couple}} buying a haunted mansion [...] "a cliché so {{familiar}} that it needs no explanation", but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne {{was too much of}} an exaggeratedly feminine [...] "girlie-type girl". Overall, Dembo said the game [...] "achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game" [...] and was [...] "an important <b>technological</b> <b>leap,</b> and represents a step forward for the whole industry". Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria [...] "appears to deliver on its ambitious promises" [...] and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that [...] "would have had even the folks in Amityville making tracks". Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said some of the acting was [...] "hilariously bad" [...] and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with [...] "so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before".|$|E
2500|$|... 2001 {{marked the}} next great <b>technological</b> <b>leap</b> for storm chasers as the first Wi-Fi units began to emerge {{offering}} wireless broadband service in many cases for free. Some places (restaurants, motels, libraries, etc.) were known to reliably offer wireless access and wardriving located other availabilities.

Further, considering the huge potential of eGovernance in the nation as well as the need to adopt open standards to make our data systems more inter-operable and independent of any limiting proprietary tools, we feel that ODF is a great <b>technological</b> <b>leap</b> and a big boon to further propel IT right to India's grass root levels.

2500|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War led to {{a period}} of {{military}} budget cuts and considerable restructuring. [...] At the same time, U.S. Naval Aviation faced a number of problems. [...] The McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II was canceled in 1991 after the program ran into serious problems; {{it was intended to}} replace the obsolete Grumman A-6 Intruder and LTV A-7 Corsair II. [...] The Navy considered updating an existing design as a more attractive approach to a clean-sheet program. As an alternative to the A-12, McDonnell Douglas proposed the [...] "Super Hornet" [...] (initially [...] "Hornet II" [...] in the 1980s), an improvement of the successful previous F/A-18 models, which could serve as an alternate replacement for the A-6 Intruder. The next-generation Hornet design proved more attractive than Grumman's Quick Strike upgrade to the F-14 Tomcat, which was regarded as an insufficient <b>technological</b> <b>leap</b> over existing F-14s.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the dangers}} of grain {{boundaries}} in certain materials such as superalloy turbine blades, great <b>technological</b> <b>leaps</b> were made to minimize as much as possible the effect of grain boundaries in the blades. The result was directional solidification processing in which grain boundaries were eliminated by producing columnar grain structures aligned parallel to the axis of the blade, since this is usually the direction of maximum tensile stress felt by a blade during its rotation in an airplane. The resulting turbine blades consisted of a single grain, improving reliability.|$|R
