50|$|A <b>tire</b> changer is {{a machine}} {{used to help}} <b>tire</b> {{technicians}} dismount and mount <b>tires</b> with automobile wheels. After the wheel and <b>tire</b> assembly are removed from the automobile, the <b>tire</b> changer has all the components necessary to remove and replace the <b>tire</b> from the wheel. Different <b>tire</b> changers allow technicians to replace <b>tires</b> on automobiles, motorcycles and heavy-duty trucks.

5|$|The {{rejection}} likely {{had several}} causes. The {{people of the}} Grants were <b>tired</b> of the disputes with New York, and they were <b>tired</b> of Allen's posturing and egotistic behavior, which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced. Finally, {{the failure of the}} attempt on St. John's was widely seen as reckless and ill-advised, attributes they did not appreciate in a regimental leader. Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice, and was someone that also commanded respect. The history of Warner's later actions in the revolution (notably at Hubbardton and Bennington) may be seen as a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting. In the end, Allen took the rejection in stride, and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to permit him to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout.|$|E
50|$|Airless <b>tires</b> are {{attractive}} to cyclists, as bicycle <b>tires</b> {{are much more}} vulnerable to punctures than motor vehicle <b>tires.</b> The drawbacks to airless <b>tires</b> depend on the use. Heavy equipment operators who use machinery with solid <b>tires</b> will complain of fatigue whereas lawn mowers that use solid or airless <b>tires</b> have no drawbacks. Bicycle riders who use airless <b>tires</b> may complain that the <b>tire</b> is harder than a comparable pneumatic <b>tire.</b> Only anecdotal evidence exists that airless <b>tires</b> may cause broken spokes on a bicycle wheel. Any airless <b>tire</b> will be heavier than the rubber <b>tire</b> {{it is meant to}} replace; however, many rubber pneumatic <b>tires</b> are also heavy. Rubber <b>tires</b> vary in rolling resistance and an airless <b>tire</b> or solid insert may only marginally increase rolling resistance if at all.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tires</b> {{are often}} {{improved}} on off-road vehicles {{in order to}} better traverse rough terrain. Regular automotive <b>tires</b> don't provide enough traction to help a vehicle through sand, dirt, snow and ice, so specialized <b>tires</b> are normally used on off-road 4x4 vehicles. Large overall wheel diameter provides a better ride comfort and road clearance. Wide <b>tires</b> help to distribute the weight on sand, while narrower <b>tires</b> help get better traction in the snow or on ice. Each <b>tire</b> type has its own tread type to provide a proper grip in certain road conditions. Common off-road <b>tire</b> types are: Sand <b>tires,</b> Mud-terrain <b>tire,</b> Snow <b>tires</b> and All-terrain <b>tire.</b>|$|R
