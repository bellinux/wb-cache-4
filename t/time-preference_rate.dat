40|$|This paper uses a two-period {{overlapping}} generations {{model in}} order to provide a theoretical design for an optimal public pension system based on a partial equilibrium analysis. Household preferences only depend on two periods consumption and leisure and is homogeneous of degree m with respect to consumption in the working and retired periods. We present characteristic features of an optimal public pension system in this paper. First, differences in the population growth rate do not affect the relative level of the optimal net lifetime burden rate of each generation. Second, if m≠ 0 or m< 1, the optimal public pension system can be expressed explicitly. Third, the difference between the market <b>time-preference</b> <b>rate</b> and social <b>time-preference</b> <b>rate</b> provides a crucial insight into the optimal burden rate of each generation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a social}} <b>time-preference</b> <b>rate</b> is derived for the United Kingdom {{on the basis}} of a {{conventional}} utility function. The model which the estimate is based upon is developed in a two-period analysis in which a representative individual is the central figure. The component parameters of this rate are: growth rate of real consumption, elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, and a pure time-discount rate derived {{on the basis of}} individuals' survival probabilities. Then each of these parameters is estimated separately with the final result of 3. 65 % which is very much in line with expectations of many economists. ...|$|E
40|$|We treat {{an animal}} as a {{rational}} optimizer that takes decisions {{so as to}} maximize its Darwinian fitness. That is, we assume it has evolved optimal decision rules under natural selection. We suppose also that it may receive rewards that make a positive contribution to its fitness. Within this framework, we consider how the animal should value a delayed reward, relative to an immediate reward. Consider a reward i. Let ui(t) be its expected contribution to fitness if it is due after a delay t. This is assumed normally to be a decreasing function of t. The instantaneous <b>time-preference</b> <b>rate</b> u {{is defined as the}} proportional reduction in value (i. e. fitness benefit) of the reward per unit delay for small delays: u = Li...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} welfare-theoretic {{consequences}} of diverging social and private <b>time-preference</b> <b>rates</b> and time-to-build {{for the transition}} to a low-carbon energy industry. We show that time-to-build, a prevalent characteristic of capital accumulation in the energy sector, amplifies the distortion induced by the split discount rates. Thus, these two characteristics create in a mutually reinforcing way less favorable circumstances for the introduction of new clean energy technologies as compared to the social optimum, even if welfare losses from emissions are internalized. We discuss resulting policy implications with particular emphasis on the energy sector...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For power-plant investments, {{utilities}} rely after liberalisation {{on private}} financial markets, {{which are in}} general distorted. The (related) split of social and private <b>time-preference</b> <b>rates</b> provides a new reason for a welfare-enhancing policy intervention, complementary to environmental policy (Heinzel and Winkler 2007). This paper quantifies it and studies its relevance for the German power industry around 2015. The distortions remain moderate as compared to other investment subsidies. However, in contrast to environmental policy alone, its additional implementation makes nuclear power the first option even in the nuclear high-cost scenario. Both policies enhance ecological structural change, which end-of-pipe abatement delays...|$|R

An LTR person discounts the instantaneous marginal satisfaction from junk-food consumption by its implications for his survival probability. His change rate of health evaluation is increased (decreased) by junk-food consumption when health is better (worse) than a critical level. The moderating direct effects of age and relative price on junk-food consumption may be amplified, or dimmed, by the change in his health. The stationary health of a person ignoring his age declines with his <b>time-preference</b> <b>rate</b> and rises with the marginal effect of junk food on his intrinsic health-improvement rate. junk food, health food, relative price, relative taste, risk, natural recovery, full-capacity income, expected lifetime utility, rational consumption, health, health value...|$|E
40|$|I {{extend the}} Epstein-Zin-lognormal {{consumption}}-based asset-pricing model {{to allow for}} general i. i. d. consumption growth processes. Information about the higher moments—equivalently, cumulants—of consumption growth is encoded in the cumulantgenerating function (CGF). I express four observable quantities (the equity premium, riskless rate, consumption-wealth ratio and mean consumption growth) and the Hansen-Jagannathan bound {{in terms of the}} CGF, and present applications. Models in which consumption is subject to occasional disasters can be handled easily and flexibly within the framework. The importance of higher cumulants is a double-edged sword: those model parameters which are most important for asset prices, such as disaster parameters, are also the hardest to calibrate. It is therefore desirable to make statements which do not depend on a particular calibrated consumption process. First, I use properties of the CGF to derive restrictions on the <b>time-preference</b> <b>rate</b> and elasticity of intertemporal substitution that must hold in any Epstein-Zin-i. i. d. model which is consistent with the observable quantities. Second, I show that “good deal ” bounds on the maximal Sharp...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{the concept of}} waiting time for public housing is explored; the individual's decisionmaking process on whether to join the housing queue is modeled; how long he/she is {{prepared}} to wait for public housing is assessed; a methodology to evaluate {{the cost of this}} waiting time is proposed; and estimates of some likely values of this cost are made. The cost of waiting is of more than esoteric interest, impinging on several questions of policy, {{such as the use of}} waiting times as indicators in assessing need, the sale of council housing, and the efficiency of a nonprice method of resource allocation. The model predicts the maximum length of time a person will be prepared to wait, given his/her life expectancy in the authority's house, the relative cost to the person of alternative housing, and his/her <b>time-preference</b> <b>rate.</b> Risk preferences are also incorporated to assess the 'risk premium': the extra cost a person would sacrifice to be certain of obtaining public housing at a specified time. Estimates of the cost of waiting are derived from the model and also from a questionnaire survey of housing waiting-list applicants in North Tyneside Metropolitan Borough. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} {{that explains the}} mix between funded and unfunded pension systems. It turns out that total pension and the relative shares of the two systems may be explained and {{are determined by the}} population growth rate, technological growth, the <b>time-preference</b> discount <b>rate,</b> the relative risk aversion, the production function, and the degree of altruism. A fall in the population growth rate, even to negative values, will imply a reduction of the interest rate and an increase in the capital-output ratio, while the pension system will shift to more funding. A fall in the population growth rate will result in a reduction of average welfare and an increase in the income inequality between workers and retired people/individuals.

A fall in the population growth rate, even to negative values, will imply a reduction of the interest rate and an increase in the capital-output ratio. Whether the pension system will shift to more or less funding depends on the political weight of the elderly. If the elderly succeed in getting more weight in the political process if their population share increases, which is likely when the population shrinks, the accent on the PAYG- system will increase. A fall in the population growth rate will result in a reduction of average welfare. This reduction is more severe, the larger the political power of the elderly. old-age pensions, pay-as-you-go, intergenerational transfers, retirement benefits...|$|R
40|$|Nearly {{thirty years}} ago Frank Ramsey [13] pioneered in a new field of {{economic}} theory, which we now call optimal economic growth. In many respects his analysis was quite general and recently his model has been extended to cases of many capital goods, population growth, technological progress and uncertainty. 2 There has, however, been no modification of Ramsey's treatment of preferences. Ramsey made the remarkable postulate that each generation possesses what we shall call perfect altruism. By this we mean that each generation's preference for their own consumption relative to the next generation's consumption {{is no different from}} their prefer-ence for any future generation's consumption relative to the succeeding generation. This is a stationarity postulate: the present generation's preference ordering of consumption streams is invariant to changes in their timing. 3 Thus Ramsey did not admit the possibility that the current generation would assign its own consumption a place of importance some-what out of proportion to its proximity. In his analysis he allowed time preference only of an extraordinarily selfless kind: The pure <b>time-preference</b> or discount <b>rate</b> used in dis-counting the rate of utility from consumption t years hence is required to be constant wit...|$|R
40|$|Discounting {{occurs when}} an {{immediate}} benefit is systematically valued more highly than a delayed {{benefit of the}} same magnitude. It is manifested in physiological and behavioural strategies of organisms. This study brings together life-history theory and time-preference theory within a single modelling framework. We consider an animal encountering reproductive opportunities as a random process. Under an external hazard, optimal life-history strategy typically prioritizes immediate reproduction {{at the cost of}} declining fertility and increasing mortality with age. Given such ageing, an immediate reproductive reward should be preferred to a delayed reward because of both the risk of death and declining fertility. By this analysis, ageing is both a consequence of discounting by the body and a cause of behavioural discounting. A series of models is developed, making different assumptions about external hazards and biological ageing. With realistic ageing assumptions (increasing mortality and an accelerating rate of fertility decline) the <b>time-preference</b> <b>rate</b> increases in old age. Under an uncertain external hazard rate, young adults should also have relatively high time-preference rates because their (Bayesian) estimate of the external hazard is high. Middle-aged animals may therefore be the most long term in their outlook...|$|E
