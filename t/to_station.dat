5|$|Station <b>to</b> <b>Station</b> is {{the tenth}} studio album by English {{musician}} David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1976. Commonly {{regarded as one}} of his most significant works, Station <b>to</b> <b>Station</b> was the vehicle for his performance persona, the Thin White Duke. The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production.|$|E
5|$|Station <b>to</b> <b>Station</b> was {{released}} in January 1976 and reached No. 3 on Billboards Top LPs & Tape, remaining on the chart for 32 weeks. It became Bowie's highest-charting album in the US, until 2013's The Next Day. Station <b>to</b> <b>Station</b> was certified gold by the RIAA on 26 February 1976. In the UK, it charted for seventeen weeks, peaking at No. 5, serving as the last time one of Bowie's studio albums charted lower in his home country than in America.|$|E
5|$|Citizens {{were trained}} {{from the age}} of 12 <b>to</b> <b>station</b> {{themselves}} in the nearest bunker to repel invaders. Local Party cells organised families to clean and maintain their local bunkers, and civil defence drills were held at least twice a month, lasting for up to three days, in which civilians of military age of both sexes were issued with rifles (but no ammunition).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the green line was a Yokohama loop line. The Green Line is a stage in the planned line from Tsurumi <b>Station</b> <b>to</b> Hiyoshi <b>Station,</b> the current green line <b>to</b> Nakayama <b>Station,</b> <b>to</b> Futamatagawa <b>Station,</b> and on <b>to</b> Higashi-Totsuka <b>Station,</b> and <b>to</b> Kami-Ōoka <b>Station,</b> Negishi Station, and Motomachi.|$|R

5|$|In 1817, the General Assembly {{joined with}} two other Reformed denominations, the American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church (now the Reformed Church in America) and the Associate Reformed Church, to form the United Foreign Missionary Society. The United Society was {{particularly}} focused on work among Native Americans and inhabitants of Central and South America. These denominations also established a United Domestic Missionary Society <b>to</b> <b>station</b> missionaries within the United States.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} <b>to</b> <b>station</b> the Chinooks at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{located at the}} {{midpoint}} between the Army's main field formations based in the outskirts of Sydney in New South Wales and the north Queensland city of Townsville. Construction began on support facilities for the helicopters at Amberley shortly after the order for them was confirmed in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{announcements}} {{are frequently}} made to remind passengers to report suspicious activity {{and not to}} leave their belongings unattended. Digital closed-circuit cameras (CCTVs) have been upgraded with recording-capability at all stations and trains operated by SMRT Corporation. Trash bins and mail boxes {{have been removed from}} station platforms and concourse levels <b>to</b> <b>station</b> entrances, to eliminate the risk of bombs planted in them. Photography without permission was also banned in all MRT stations since the Madrid bombings, but it was not in the official statement in any public transport security reviews.|$|E
25|$|Opened in 1966, the Bloor–Danforth subway runs east-west under or near Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue. It {{replaced}} the Bloor streetcar line (which also served Danforth Avenue). Initially, the subway line ran between Keele <b>station</b> <b>to</b> Woodbine <b>station.</b> In 1968, {{the line was}} extended west <b>to</b> Islington <b>station</b> and east <b>to</b> Warden <b>station,</b> and in 1980, it was further extended west <b>to</b> Kipling <b>station</b> and east <b>to</b> Kennedy <b>station.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Yongsan Line (...) is {{a branch}} {{railroad}} of the Gyeongui Line, currently in {{service on the}} Gyeongui-Jungang Line. It connects Yongsan <b>Station</b> <b>to</b> Gajwa <b>Station</b> on the Gyeongui Line. The line was abandoned in 2005, but was reopened as an underground subway line in 2012 from Gajwa <b>Station</b> <b>to</b> Gongdeok <b>Station</b> and in 2014 from Gongdeok <b>Station</b> <b>to</b> Yongsan <b>Station.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} opening {{took place on}} 19 November 1927 by King Haakon VII. When the line opened there were 21 manned station on the line. Up to 70 people worked on the line, in addition <b>to</b> <b>station</b> employees. In 1932, the operations were rationalized, cutting costs from NOK426,000 to NOK310,000 per year. This involved removing the station masters at fifteen stations and replacing them with a clerk.|$|E
5|$|While Washington was {{inspecting}} the terrain {{to determine where}} it was best <b>to</b> <b>station</b> his troops, messengers alerted him that the British were advancing. Returning to his headquarters, he ordered the 2nd Connecticut Regiment under Joseph Spencer out to slow the British advance, and sent Haslet and the 1st Delaware Regiment, along with Alexander McDougall's brigade (Rudolphus Ritzema's 3rd New York Regiment, Charles Webb's 19th Continental Regiment, William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Regiment, and the 1st New York Regiment and 2nd New York Regiments) to reinforce Chatterton Hill.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} murder of a {{motorcycle}} dispatch-rider and the theft of his top-secret documents by a motorcycle-riding assassin. The rider was en route from SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, then located in Versailles, to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain in France. Since Bond is already in Paris, his superior, M, sends him to assist in the investigation in any way he can. Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey <b>to</b> <b>Station</b> F as the previous rider: as expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond. Bond, however, is ready and kills the assassin. He then uncovers the assassin's hidden base of operations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first section}} of the Hakubi Line to open was the {{northern}} section, initially named the Hakubihoku Line (lit. [...] "Hakubi North Line"), between Hōki-Mizoguchi and Hōki-Daisen on 10 August 1919. The northern section was then progressively extended south, <b>to</b> Ebi <b>Station</b> on 25 March 1922, <b>to</b> Neu <b>Station</b> on 30 July 1922, <b>to</b> Kurosaka <b>Station</b> on 10 November 1922, <b>to</b> Shōyama <b>Station</b> on 28 November 1923, <b>to</b> Kami-Iwami <b>Station</b> on 6 December 1924, and <b>to</b> Ashidachi <b>Station</b> on 1 December 1926.|$|R

5000|$|Trains from Oslo to Stavanger {{go through}} the entire Southern Norway region. There are trains from Oslo Central <b>Station</b> <b>to</b> Kristiansand <b>Station</b> and from Stavanger <b>Station</b> <b>to</b> Kristiansand <b>Station.</b> From Nelaug Station there is a local train going <b>to</b> Arendal <b>Station,</b> since the main {{railroad}} runs inland and not along the coast at Arendal.|$|R
5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity <b>to</b> <b>station</b> an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E
5|$|In 195 BC, Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the Roman {{commander}} in Greece, called a {{council of the}} Greek states at Corinth to discuss {{whether or not to}} declare war on Nabis. Among the states whose delegates participated were the Aetolian League, Macedon, Rome, Pergamum, Rhodes, Thessaly and the Achaean League. All the states represented favored war, except for the Aetolian League and Thessaly, both of which wanted the Romans to leave Greece immediately. These two states offered to deal with Nabis themselves, but they met opposition from the Achaean League, which objected to any possible growth in the Aetolian League's power. The modern historian Erich Gruen has suggested that the Romans may have used the war as an excuse <b>to</b> <b>station</b> a few legions in Greece in order to prevent the Spartans and the Aetolian League from joining the Seleucid King Antiochus III if he invaded Greece.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 10 April, leading {{elements}} of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon's anticipations, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fortè was staff work) {{proved to be an}} insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a sentence that called for Davout <b>to</b> <b>station</b> his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to move back to the city despite massive Austrian pressure.|$|E

5|$|On 17 February 1979, China retaliated against Vietnam's {{invasion}} of Kampuchea by attacking along the Sino-Vietnam border, and within ten days {{had reached the}} provincial capitals. Fighting bogged down due to the maze of tunnels the Chinese encountered; nevertheless, the Chinese army captured Cao Bằng on 2 March and Lạng Sơn on 4 March, reportedly advancing towards Hanoi at a high speed, though not on good terms with its supply lines. However, the following day, China {{announced that it would}} not move deeper into Vietnam, apparently after meeting fierce and unexpectedly harsh resistance by well trained and equipped Vietnamese forces, supplied with American technology left behind from the Vietnam War. Confident that the threat of invasion had been a success, the Chinese subsequently withdrew their forces. Although China failed to decisively win the 27-day conflict, the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a strong resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations, making it unavoidable for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription, and requiring Vietnam <b>to</b> <b>station</b> a large portion of its army along the Sino-Vietnamese border.|$|E
5|$|Station <b>to</b> <b>Station</b> was {{recorded}} in late 1975 at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised that it was cut—"in 10 days of feverish activity"—when Bowie decided {{that there was no}} hope of his producing a soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth. More recent scholarship contends that the album {{was recorded}} over a couple of months—with the sessions beginning in late September or early October 1975 and ending in late November—so that it was in the can before Bowie began his abortive sessions on the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher became closely {{aligned with}} the Cold War {{policies}} of US President Ronald Reagan, based on their shared distrust of Communism. A disagreement came in 1983 when Reagan did not consult {{with her on the}} invasion of Grenada. During her first year as Prime Minister she supported NATO's decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, permitting the US <b>to</b> <b>station</b> more than 160cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common, starting on 14 November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's nuclear forces at an eventual cost of more than £12billion (at 1996–97 prices). Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of 1985–86, when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had supported the Agusta deal, resigned in protest.|$|E

50|$|Although some syndicators of multi-topic, ad-supported {{talk shows}} may {{pay a fee}} <b>to</b> <b>stations</b> with very large Arbitron-verified listenership, the same syndicator will {{normally}} charge a fee <b>to</b> small <b>stations</b> and may charge nothing <b>to</b> <b>stations</b> with moderate listenership. Each arrangement depends on whether the station can deliver enough listeners to allow the syndicator to earn money from ad sales. Syndicated programs normally carry a number of their own advertisements that must be played during commercial breaks, but set aside time for local <b>stations</b> <b>to</b> play their own advertisements.|$|R
50|$|In 1909 {{it became}} part of the Nemuro Main Line from Asahikawa <b>Station</b> <b>to</b> Kushiro <b>Station,</b> but in 1913 it took its present name and covered the route from Asahikawa <b>Station</b> <b>to</b> Shimo-Furano <b>Station.</b> The {{eruption}} of Mount Tokachi on May 24, 1926, caused a protracted interruption of service between Biei and Kami-Furano. In 1942, Shimo-Furano Station changed its name <b>to</b> Furano <b>Station.</b>|$|R
5|$|The BDF and its {{superior}} headquarters, the Seventh Area Army, initially disagreed {{over where}} the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade should be deployed. In July 1944 the BDF {{believed that the}} Allies were likely to invade northern Borneo in January 1945 or later, and wanted <b>to</b> <b>station</b> the brigade in this area. However, the Seventh Area Army judged that Allied forces {{were more likely to}} attack the Brunei Bay region in western Borneo to support a drive on Singapore. Moreover, the area army believed that {{it would be difficult to}} transfer units from northern to western Borneo due to the island's rugged terrain. The BDF eventually won the debate, and the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade's units were landed in the Sandakan area of north-east Borneo as they arrived from Japan.|$|E
5|$|The German Navy {{had decided}} on a {{strategy}} of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast {{in an attempt to}} draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was <b>to</b> <b>station</b> itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. The Germans did not know that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey; they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Admiral Beatty's 1st BCS, now reduced to four ships, including Lion, as well as the 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts, was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.|$|E
