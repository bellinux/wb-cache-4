40|$|<b>This</b> short <b>insights</b> paper {{examines}} IT Supported Emergency Response {{systems from}} the perspective of the digital divide and access for disabled people. It is argued that inclusive design is often overlooked in the development of emergency systems and this can lead to increased marginalisation of certain societal groups, such as disabled people and older people. Given the importance of equality of provision in relation to emergency responses there is a need to examine accessibility policy in this area to determine whether it enables the equal participation of all. This is important both in relation to the ability to access key information in an emergency situation and to participate in crowdsourced data generation to help in the targeting of resources, both at the time of an emergency and in subsequent planning. <b>This</b> <b>insights</b> paper takes both a practical and theoretical approach and focuses upon key policies emanating from the EU and UK...|$|R

25|$|The term Zen {{is derived}} from the Japanese {{pronunciation}} of the Middle Chinese word 禪 (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of Dhyana ("meditation").

As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The recent {{innovation}} {{of modern}} cars has mainly {{been driven by}} the development of new as well as the con-tinuous improvement of existing electrical and electronic (E/E) components, including sensors, actuators, and elec-tronic control units. This trend has been accompanied by an increasing complexity of E/E components and their nu-merous interdependencies. In addition, external impact fac-tors (e. g., changes of regulations, product innovations) de-mand for more sophisticated E/E product data management (E/E-PDM). Since E/E product data is usually scattered over a large number of distributed, heterogeneous IT systems, application-spanning use cases are difficult to realize (e. g., ensuring the consistency of artifacts corresponding to differ-ent development phases, plausibility of logical connections between electronic control units). To tackle this challenge, the partial integration of E/E product data as well as corre-sponding schemas becomes necessary. This paper presents the properties of a typical IT system landscape related to E/E-PDM, reveals challenges emerging in this context, and elicits requirements for E/E-PDM. Based on <b>this,</b> <b>insights</b> <b>This</b> is an extended version of the paper Managing Complex Data fo...|$|R

Most analyses criticizing this model fail to account for the pecuniary external effects of both types of capital inherent in the model.|$|E

Simpson and his cohorts knew the general position of the British Government for any potential negotiations with the United States to end the Oregon boundary dispute.

25|$|In the 1940s1950s, Ellis Kolchin, Armand Borel, and Claude Chevalley {{realised}} {{that many}} foundational results concerning Lie groups {{can be developed}} completely algebraically, giving rise {{to the theory of}} algebraic groups defined over an arbitrary field. <b>This</b> <b>insight</b> opened new possibilities in pure algebra, by providing a uniform construction for most finite simple groups, as well as in algebraic geometry. The theory of automorphic forms, an important branch of modern number theory, deals extensively with analogues of Lie groups over adele rings; p-adic Lie groups play an important role, via their connections with Galois representations in number theory.|$|E
