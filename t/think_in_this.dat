2500|$|Albarn also {{attended}} a protest in November where he {{commented on the}} diversity of people in attendance, saying that [...] "It represents everybody. It's the voice in our democracy and that's why we should be listened to." [...] Speaking about the experience in 2008, Albarn stated:I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case {{the only reason we}} went to war was the result of our individual apathy in the end. You know, our inability to really express what was I think was a consensus that this was a terrifying idea and a very badly thought-out one.|$|E
2500|$|Farage said in 2014 {{that most}} legal tax {{avoidance}} was [...] "okay" [...] {{after he was}} questioned on why £45,000 of his income was paid into his private company rather than a personal bank account, saying that criticism of his actions was [...] "ridiculous". In {{the wake of the}} Panama Papers leak, Farage also said that the possibility of him releasing his tax return was a [...] "big no" [...] as [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country what people earn is regarded as a private matter", and criticised David Cameron for being hypocritical, especially with regards to his past comments about Jimmy Carr's tax avoidance.|$|E
2500|$|Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan {{said that}} {{the founders of the}} Austrian School [...] "reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a {{profound}} and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country". In 1987, Nobel Laureate James M. Buchanan [...] told an interviewer, [...] "I have no objections to being called an Austrian. Hayek and Mises might consider me an Austrian but, surely some of the others would not." [...] Chinese economist Zhang Weiying supports some Austrian theories such as the Austrian theory of the business cycle.|$|E

50|$|Jonathan Elukin is one {{historian}} who <b>thinks</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> vein, as elucidated {{in his book}} Living Together, Living Apart. He shows that during the Crusades, some Jews were hidden and protected from being attacked by Christians. Some Jews worked in Christian villages. There were also several cases of conversion to Judaism as well as interfaith marriages.|$|R

2500|$|Hume elaborates more on {{this last}} {{principle}} of cause and effect. When a person observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, it results in “an expectation that a particular event (a ‘cause’) {{will be followed by}} another event (an ‘effect’) previously and constantly associated with it." [...] Hume calls this principle custom, or habit, saying that “custom…renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past." [...] However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation. In other words, “experience cannot establish a necessary connection between cause and effect, because we can imagine without contradiction a case where the cause does not produce its usual effect…the reason why we mistakenly infer that there is something in the cause that necessarily produces its effect is because our past experiences have habituated us to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way." [...] Continuing this idea, Hume argues that “only in the pure realm of ideas, logic, and mathematics, not contingent on the direct sense awareness of reality, [...] causation safely…be applied – all other sciences are reduced to probability." [...] He uses this skepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Two most noble occupations!' said Herbert; 'but I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{world there}} is just as good a chance of being bullied by our {{children}} first, and paying their debts afterwards.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I agree," [...] said Sir Richmond presently. [...] "One DOES <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fashion. Something in this fashion. What one calls one's {{work does}} belong to {{something}} {{much bigger than}} ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Edith," [...] he had said, [...] "you {{know that}} I am unwilling to oppose you; but I <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> your {{feelings}} are carrying you too far." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I have {{no doubt}} of you, honest man," [...] said Dirk with a smile, [...] "for you have no mother and father to <b>think</b> of <b>in</b> <b>this</b> matter." ...|$|R
40|$|Jerry Fodor {{has argued}} that {{concepts}} ought to be public in order to figure in psychological explanations and in accounts of linguistic communication, and that no theory of concepts as structured abilities of categorization can account for publicity. Recently Andy Clark and Jesse Prinz opposed this latter claim, and suggested that the publicity constraint is less demanding than Fodor <b>thinks.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> paper I support Clark and Prinz’s position through disambiguating the publicity constraint, and arguing that linguistic communication enhances concept publicity rather than requiring it...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is anxiety, my boy, {{that has}} made you <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> wild fashion," [...] said Gildart. [...] "Did I not hear Mrs Niven say that the child gave her name as Emmie Wilson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It does," [...] and Ingleby laughed. [...] "There is room, I <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> Province for men {{who will}} take big risks, and boldly stake what they have on the {{advancement}} of its prosperity. I'm not sure there is any reason I shouldn't be one of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{young men}} I suppose equally so. Life {{ought to be}} a life of self-denial, no doubt. Perhaps it might be my duty to retire from this affair, if by doing so I should {{sacrifice}} only myself. The one person of whom I am bound to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> matter is the girl I love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He glances {{round at}} himself, and hesitates. 'I wouldn't mind if I didn't look so dirty and untidy,' he muses; 'people are so prone to <b>think</b> evil <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world.' ...|$|R
40|$|The author <b>thinks</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{paper over}} the useful {{contents}} of design codes for buildings and civil engineering structures. They of course should help, but not trouble the designer, but, implicitly, they should guarantee the safety, serviceability and durability of the work. And they must {{at the same}} time reflect the actual state of the society, of its exigencies and economical resources, of the development of technology and science. The symptom of our times seems to be the uncertainty – one should ask about its incidence on our design-praxis...|$|R
5000|$|Rafael Rojas <b>thinks</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> novel {{there is}} [...] "a {{multiple}} invention of writing, text, authorship and reader, trying {{to destabilize the}} poetic traditions of the Cuban literature of the last half century" ...|$|R
60|$|You can not <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> place {{any more}} than you can in any other in Palestine that would be likely to inspire reflection. Beggars, cripples and monks compass you about, and make you think only of bucksheesh when you would rather think of {{something}} more in keeping with the character of the spot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Brother, ye <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{way because}} you are content to remain where Bertha dwells. If Bertha were with Emma in bonny Scotland, your wits would be sharp enough to {{perceive}} that the voyage from Vinland to Scotland, with an unknown sea between, {{would be a more}} hazardous venture than a voyage from Greenland to Scotland, with Iceland between." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{might be}} a {{pleasant}} life enough, I should <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fine old Hall," [...] said Redclyffe; [...] "rather monotonous, however. Would you not like a relaxation of a few days, a pleasure trip, in all these thirty-five years? You old Englishmen are so sturdily faithful to one thing. You do not resemble my countrymen in that." ...|$|E
6000|$|He goes on like Saul, slaying his thousands, or, like David, his tens of thousands, {{with all}} the guns {{in the house to}} help him, till the keepers warn him he has killed as many grouse as they {{consider}} desirable; and then, having done his duty, as he <b>thinks,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect, he retires precipitately with flying colours to Brighton, Nice, Monte Carlo, or elsewhere. He must be always [...] "on the trek"; when he is buried, I believe he {{will not be able to}} rest quiet in his grave: his ghost will walk the world to terrify old ladies.|$|R
25|$|I <b>think</b> Muslims <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country {{need to take}} a long, {{hard look}} at {{themselves}} and decide what is their identity. Are they British or are they Muslim? I am a Muslim. Where I live, is irrelevant.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can raise}} the money right enough--Batley'll see to that; but I'd sooner do it another way. The interest's high enough to make one <b>think,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case I'm paying it on money he's putting into his pocket." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus much I {{could not}} refrain from saying, not that I think John Bull is very often {{right in his}} controversies with ourselves, but because I <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case, he is; and because I believe it far safer, in the long run, for a nation, or an individual, to have justice on his side, than always to carry his point.|$|E
60|$|It {{must not}} be {{supposed}} that these thoughts in their plainly-developed form passed through Linda's mind. It was not that she thought all this, but that she felt it. Such feelings are quite involuntary, whereas one's thoughts {{are more or less}} under command. Linda would not have allowed herself to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way for worlds; but she could not control her feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{whom do you}} <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> moment, husband? Of me and of my dead child, or of {{that lady}} who lives far across the sea? Nay, I will not ask. I have been happy in my love, it is enough. Now love and life must end together, and it is well for me, but for you I grieve. Say, shall I thrust away the stool?' ...|$|E
60|$|Quite so, my Lord, and I <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case your Lordship will be {{satisfied}} {{that there is}} no reason why probate should not issue. It is, humanly speaking, impossible that Mr. Meeson can have escaped the general destruction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, good-bye, uncle. If ever {{you go to}} the coast, and {{happen to}} see a storm and a shipwreck, you'll change your mind, I <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> regard to <b>this</b> matter." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{his tenure}} as OMB Director, Mulvaney has sought to {{influence}} President Donald Trump to make fiscally conservative policy changes. Mulvaney has said of himself: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> anyone <b>in</b> <b>this</b> administration {{is more of a}} right-wing conservative than I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At length, as we {{were passing}} a humble and solitary dwelling, the gentleman said to me, 'There is a young woman sick in this house; should {{you like to go}} in and see her?' 'Yes sir' said I, 'very much. She can have very few visiters I <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> lonely place, and if you think she would like to see us, I should like to go.' ...|$|E
60|$|An {{intelligent}} foreigner's {{testimony about}} our manners is always worth having, and I <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect {{the work of}} an eminent American, Mr. N. P. Willis is eminently valuable and impartial. In his 'History of Ernest Clay,' a crack magazine-writer, the reader will get an exact account of the life of a popular man of letters in England. He is always the lion of society.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall net {{complain}} now; I {{shall not}} care," [...] said Elizabeth. But {{she took the}} little bit of paper, and Christabel trusted that she would make use of it, knowing that in this lay her hope of cure; for whatever she might <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> first joy of relief, her little troubles were sure to seem quite as unbearable while they were upon her as if she had never feared a great one.|$|E
6000|$|... "By the sainted Ives!" [...] cried Du Guesclin at last, [...] "it is {{time that}} we spoke {{of what we are}} to do this night, for I cannot <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> wayside auberge there are fit {{quarters}} for an honorable company." ...|$|R
60|$|I do not <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> I {{confess to}} any unusual temperament. I {{think that the}} more closely mentally {{animated}} people scrutinize their motives the less is the importance they will attach to mere physical and brute urgencies and the more to curiosity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Sir Raffle, I cannot {{say that}} the Chancellor of the Exchequer {{detained}} me;--but there was business. As I've been here {{for the last two}} hours, I am happy to <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> instance the public service will not have suffered from my disobedience." ...|$|R
