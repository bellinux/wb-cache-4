50|$|From childhood, Riesener and Delacroix {{were friends}} and confidants. So {{different}} {{in life and}} character and so independent, they were preoccupied by the same artistic problems and enjoyed exchanging ideas, both having been formed by the 18th century and its neo-classical culture. They discussed their study of the classical world and they were both colourist painters searching for new techniques in <b>tonal</b> <b>division.</b> The difference in their temperaments expressed itself in their {{ways of looking at}} nature - Delacroix thought of drama, Riesener thought of sensuality. Delacroix bought Riesener's painting Ang√©lique as an exemplar for all painters and put it in his studio. On his death in 1863, Delacroix left Riesener his country house at Champrosay.|$|E
50|$|In July 1911, {{after an}} artistic epiphany on honeymoon in Concarneau, Brittany, he became {{influenced}} by modern French painting, his colour palette and style became post impressionist, and Wolmark jettisoned his early methods {{in favour of}} the pioneering 'colourist' path that he followed {{for the next two}} decades of his working life. He was one of the British fauves and pitched his <b>tonal</b> <b>divisions</b> to a higher key than any of his contemporaries.|$|R
50|$|Enchanted by {{the play}} of light and {{reflections}} which transformed the appearance of matter, Riesener began a new aesthetic that {{made him one of the}} precursors of impressionism. A passionate colourist, he researched all the nuances of colour and studied the techniques of ancient Greece and the Renaissance, including Titian, Veronese and Corregio. Impressed by his research into colour, he turned towards Rubens, which for him was the Shakespeare of painting. Very early in his career Riesener studied <b>tonal</b> <b>divisions,</b> well before the physician Chevreul discovered their scientific basis. His tactile taste led him to look for the most perfect expression of matter and particularly of skin. He put poetry into his painting {{by the play}} of shadow and he passionately admired nature, life and all the beauties they produced.|$|R
5000|$|The panduri is a three-stringed lute {{from the}} {{highland}} and lowland regions of eastern Georgia, usually played by strumming, and often for choral and rhythmic support of vocal melody. There {{are two kinds}} of panduri in Georgia: one is the traditional [...] "folk" [...] panduri, which typically has seven frets and more closely approximates the scale divisions in the non-Western Georgian scale system. The second kind is the [...] "chromatic" [...] panduri, which has the same <b>tonal</b> <b>divisions</b> as a guitar and is capable of reproducing all the half-steps of the tempered Western scale. It is also sometimes found in Western Georgia (Upper Imereti and Racha). The two-stringed panduri survives in Khevsureti. Sometimes the panduri is also mistakenly called a [...] "chonguri" [...] - but the chonguri is a completely different instrument which comes from western Georgia; it is fretless, and it has a fourth, half-length drone string.|$|R
