40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Gaussian Adaptive Resonance Theory Map (gARTMAP) incorporated to a multi-agent system (MAS) for building intelligent heat management system (IHMS), or the gARTMAP-MAS IHMS. The gARTMAP aims {{to maintain the}} desired space temperature defined by the building occupants (<b>thermal</b> comfort <b>management)</b> and improve energy efficiency by intelligently controlling the energy flow and usage in the building (building energy control) with minimal waste.

Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> applications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, micro pump plays a {{significant}} role in many fields, specifically in chemical, medical, and <b>thermal</b> <b>managements.</b> Since there are distinct requirements in each field, several types of micro pumps have been designed to meet those requirements. Fluid flow from these micro-pumps is delivered in a series of small discrete volumes, which make up a pulsating flow. In order to reduce the pulsating flow, the multiple micro-pumps should be actuated in parallel. Thus, in the present work, two piezo-electrical diaphragm type micro-pumps are operated in parallel with a microcontroller based sequential switching to maximize the flow rate and minimize the flow pulsation. Micro-pumps are switched in different phase shifts to study the flow pattern. The flow pulsation is measured in terms of pressure pulsation using pressure transducer. Flow pulsations are recorded for various drive frequencies in the range of 10 Hz to 40 Hz and for peak-to-peak drive voltage in range of 100 - 250 V. It is observed that the flow pulsation for both micro pumps is minimum at higher frequencies and lower drive voltages. Also the flow rate of combined micro pumps with and without offset is precisely measured and reported in the paper...|$|R

However, {{the effect of}} GNRs under shear strain, which {{is also one of}} the main strain effect, has not been studied systematically yet. In this work, we employ reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) to the systematical study of the thermal conductivity of GNRs (with model size of 4 [*]nm[*]×[*] 15 [*]nm) under the shear strain. Our studies show that the thermal conductivity of GNRs is not sensitive to the shear strain, and the thermal conductivity decreases only 12 – 16 % before the pristine structure is broken. Furthermore, the phonon frequency and the change of the micro-structure of GNRs, such as band angel and bond length, are analyzed to explore the tendency of thermal conductivity. The results show that the main influence of shear strain is on the in-plane phonon density of states (PDOS), whose G band (higher frequency peaks) moved to the low frequency, thus the thermal conductivity is decreased. The unique thermal properties of GNRs under shear strains suggest their great potentials for graphene nanodevices and great potentials in the <b>thermal</b> <b>managements</b> and thermoelectric applications...|$|R
