50|$|Following that point, <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> pressed their {{advantage}} {{but the two}} renegade Earth Lanterns unleashed reprogrammed Manhunters against them. In addition, <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> faced a renewed assault {{from the rest of}} <b>the</b> Green <b>Lantern</b> Corps who had been freed from the Sciencells. <b>The</b> cyborg Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> ended up fighting a renewed assault from both sides and saw them unite to defeat an amalgam composite of a massive Manhunter. Once destroyed, they continued their attack against Stewart and Gardner where they successfully managed to capture them. With the rogue Manhunters defeated, <b>the</b> cybernetic Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> proceeded to drain the Power Rings of <b>the</b> Green <b>Lantern</b> Corps of their charge where they intended to punish all <b>the</b> <b>Lanterns</b> for their dissent. With <b>the</b> Earth <b>Lanterns</b> captive, <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> proceeded with their judgement only for Varix to turn against his cybernetic brethren. He freed Stewart and Gardner whereupon the pair dismantled <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lantern</b> Corps and killed them. This left Varix <b>the</b> only Alpha <b>Lantern</b> left and he terminated himself as he believed he along with his comrades had disgraced <b>the</b> Green <b>Lantern</b> Corps. Afterwards, <b>the</b> bodies of Varix and <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> were interned in the Crypt of <b>the</b> Green <b>Lantern</b> Corps but were shown prior to their transformation into cyborgs.|$|R

50|$|In ancient times, <b>the</b> <b>{{lanterns}}</b> {{were fairly}} simple, {{and only the}} emperor and noblemen had large ornate ones. In modern times, lanterns have been embellished with many complex designs. For example, lanterns are now often made {{in the shape of}} animals. <b>The</b> <b>lanterns</b> can symbolize <b>the</b> people letting go of their past selves and getting new ones, which they will let go of the next year. <b>The</b> <b>lanterns</b> are almost always red to symbolize good fortune.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lantern</b> as {{a source}} of {{illumination}} in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio. Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May <b>the</b> <b>lantern</b> manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was connected}} to the electricity grid in 1940. German bombers targeted the lighthouse in August 1941, though only <b>the</b> <b>lantern</b> structure and optical system were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 {{management}} of the Tomaree National Park, in which the lighthouse is located, {{was transferred to the}} National Parks and Wildlife Service and the tower received some long due restoration, which completed in October 1998. At a cost of 85,000 the walls were cleaned and covered with a special waterproof membrane system, the cast steel staircase refitted and <b>the</b> <b>lantern</b> room resealed for waterproofing.|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the movie projector, European audiences gathered in darkened rooms to watch magic lantern presentations. Catholic priest Athanasius Kircher promoted <b>the</b> magic <b>lantern</b> by publishing <b>the</b> book Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae in 1680. Controversy soon followed as priests and masons used <b>the</b> <b>lanterns</b> [...] "to persuade followers of their ability to control both the forces of darkness and enlightenment" [...] and temperance groups used <b>the</b> <b>lanterns</b> to fight alcoholism. In the 1800s, missionaries such as David Livingston used <b>the</b> <b>lanterns</b> to present <b>the</b> Gospel in Africa. After movie theaters emerged, magic lanterns lost their popularity and disappeared from the public.|$|R

5|$|The Calais Lighthouse (Le phare de Calais) {{was built}} in 1848, {{replacing}} the old watch tower as the lighthouse of the port. The 55 metre high tower was electrified in 1883 and automated in 1992. The staircase has 271 steps leading up to <b>the</b> <b>lantern.</b> By day it is easily distinguishable from other coastal lighthouses by its white color and black lantern. The lighthouse was classified as a historical monument on 22 November 2010.|$|E

50|$|After the Sinestro Corps War, the Guardians {{create a}} new class of Green <b>Lantern</b> called <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns.</b> <b>The</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> are {{seasoned}} Corpsmen who have been fused with their Power Rings and Batteries. Boodikka, Varix, Kraken, Green Man, and Chaselon are all confirmed Alpha Lanterns; John Stewart was offered the chance to become an Alpha Lantern, but turned it down because he felt that he knew too little about the concept of <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> to accept <b>the</b> offer. Geoff Johns stated in an interview with IGN that <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> function as Internal Affairs for <b>the</b> Green <b>Lantern</b> Corps. <b>The</b> concept of <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lantern</b> Corps was conceived by Grant Morrison.|$|R
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{designed}} {{in the form of}} a Doric column. It is divided into four stories with a spiral stairway, and topped by a gallery carrying <b>the</b> <b>lantern.</b> The keeper's cottages are three one story cottages, sharing a roof. Other structures which still stand at the location are a circa 1930 privy and workshop built in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} home to a museum {{collection}} displaying furniture originally made for the tower, alongside paintings, prints and objects illustrating William Beckford’s life as a writer, collector and patron of the arts. Visitors can climb the spiral staircase to the restored belvedere below <b>the</b> <b>lantern</b> and experience panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, <b>the</b> <b>lantern</b> being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E

5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles.

50|$|Academic {{histories}} in China mentioned <b>the</b> Red <b>Lanterns</b> only in passing, {{even after}} 1949, when the Boxer movement {{was considered a}} patriotic uprising of the masses. But suddenly in 1967, <b>the</b> Red <b>Lanterns</b> became hot topics in the national media. The Cultural Revolution was at its most radical phase, and the radical student youth groups, the Red Guards, reached the heights of their fervor. Like them, <b>the</b> Red <b>Lanterns</b> were red, young and rebellious, and one Red Guard group chose <b>the</b> name “Red <b>Lantern</b> Fighting Force.” <b>The</b> Model Revolutionary Opera, <b>the</b> Red <b>Lantern,</b> produced by Mao Zedong’s wife, Jiang Qing, had no connection to the Boxer movement, but popularized <b>the</b> Red <b>Lantern</b> into a revolutionary symbol. A campaign in official Party newspapers saw a direct connection with <b>the</b> Red <b>Lanterns</b> of 1900. Official editorials attacked Liu Shaoqi, Mao’s former second in command, for detesting the Boxers, and called upon the Red Guards {{to carry on the}} spirit of <b>the</b> Red <b>Lanterns.</b>|$|R

5|$|The main tower's spire {{was removed}} during the Battle of Moscow {{to prevent the}} Luftwaffe from {{using it as a}} landmark. Shortly after the war ended in 1945, {{sections}} of the gardens were annexed for the building of an apartment block. A fire in 1956 caused the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>lantern</b> over the principal tower's dome. Existing tenants were slowly rehoused, and members of the Mosspetspromproyekt (Russian: Мосспецпромпроект) research institute took possession of the former church. The research institute dealt primarily with project drawings for industrial facilities, but also designed the Olympic cauldron used at Lenin Stadium for the 1980 Summer Games.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and <b>the</b> <b>lantern</b> made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E

50|$|Afterwards, {{they met}} with the Guardians of The Universe and newly {{promoted}} Sentinel Guy Gardner. The Oans whilst {{not happy with the}} decision ultimately decided to agree with <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> decision. Upon believing the Guardians approval, <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> wanted <b>the</b> Oans to collectively execute Stewart. This approach was refused and <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> offered an alternative of bringing in an offworld executioner. However, this approach was also refused in an angry outburst by Gardner who left but not before telling <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lantern</b> Corps to execute Stewart themselves if they had sentenced him to that fate. The Guardians did not condone Gardner's behavior but believed his words rang true and told <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> to conduct <b>the</b> sentence. Following that point, Gardner went to the Alpha Tower where he was escorted by Boodikka in order to provide a final meal to Lantern Stewart. Whilst being monitored, <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> did not anticipate a breakout attempt by the rest of <b>the</b> Green <b>Lantern</b> Corps where Stewart was taken. Whilst battling Green <b>Lanterns,</b> <b>the</b> Alpha <b>Lanterns</b> tapped into <b>the</b> Central Power Battery and forcibly removed the charge from their opponents Power Rings.|$|R
