5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E

5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements {{may have been a}} matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.|$|E

25|$|The British {{embassy and}} several American Zionist groups, {{including}} the American Jewish Committee {{and other political}} opponents sought to have Kook deported or drafted.

The United States IRS found no financial irregularities Among those <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Bergson Group's rescue activities were Stephen Wise, Nahum Goldmann and Congressman Blum.

25|$|The War of 1812 {{marked the}} final {{confrontation}} between major Indian forces <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> advance, with British aid. The British war goal included {{the creation of}} an independent Indian state (under British auspices) in the Midwest. American frontier militiamen under General Andrew Jackson defeated the Creeks and opened the Southwest, while militia under Governor William Henry Harrison defeated the Indian-British alliance at the Battle of the Thames in Canada in 1813. The death in battle of the Indian leader Tecumseh dissolved the coalition of hostile Indian tribes. Meanwhile, General Andrew Jackson ended the Indian military threat in the Southeast at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814 in Alabama. In general the frontiersmen battled the Indians with little help from the U.S. Army or the federal government.|$|E
25|$|The {{casualties}} {{on both sides}} were high. There are about 15,000 Germans buried in the cemetery at Halbe, making it the largest war cemetery in Germany from World War II.
