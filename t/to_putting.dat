5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E

25|$|Coal {{makes up}} the bulk of China's energy {{consumption}} (70% in 2005), and China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. As China's economy continues to grow, China's coal demand is projected to rise significantly.

25|$|Ranetti's literature, {{redolent of}} Caragiale and Anton Bacalbașa, was mostly ephemeral in nature, and often {{referenced}} {{the politics of}} his native Mizil. His articles, fables, sketch stories and plays, with their critique of Francization and affectation, earned him a following in the general public, but were regarded by critics and scholars as dated, overreaching, or overall inferior to the Caragiale model. His satire often had very precise targets, including King Carol I and his courtier Ioan Kalinderu, politician George D. Pallade, and actor Ion Brezeanu. In addition <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> out original texts, Ranetti was a noted translator and dramaturge, who adapted works by Georges Courteline and Paul Gavault.|$|E

Following civil disorder, Zia deposed Bhutto in a military coup and declared martial law on 5 July 1977. Bhutto was controversially tried by the Supreme Court and executed less than two years later, for authorising the murder of a political opponent.|$|E

25|$|Southern Senators {{continued}} to hold a hammerlock on Congress. Because of the Southern Democrats' disfranchisement of African Americans in Southern states {{at the start of}} the 20th century, Southern whites for decades had nearly double the representation in Congress beyond their own population. Southern states had Congressional representation based on total population, but essentially only whites could vote and only their issues were supported. Due to seniority achieved through one-party Democratic rule in their region, Southern Democrats controlled many important committees in both houses. Southern Democrats consistently opposed any legislation related <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> lynching under Federal oversight. As a result, Southern white Democrats were a formidable power in Congress until the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Gorrell was {{immediately}} {{assigned by the}} Army to assist Director of War Plans and Menoher Board member Maj. Gen. William G.

Gorrell's appearance in August 1919 with Patrick before the Frear Committee while still a member of the advisory board, to refute erroneous and polemic allegations made during earlier testimony, was well-remarked, but his second round of testimony on October 27, 1919, in which he returned to read into the record the just-issued report of the Menoher Board, is largely overlooked. In addition <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> forth the Army's arguments, the report bluntly opposed any independent role for the Air Service and averred that it could never become more than an auxiliary branch of the Army.|$|E

Shortly after his departure, his district was split in two; the southern part was assigned to Brig. Gen. Lawrence O'B. Branch, while the northern part was put in control of Henry A. Wise, whose command included Albemarle Sound and Roanoke Island, but not Pamlico Sound and its cities. It is also significant that Branch reported to Brig. Gen. Richard C.

25|$|The {{theme park}} {{sits on the}} site of a former berry farm {{established}} by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. Cordelia Knott's efforts in the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant were essential <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> Knott's Berry Farm on the map, and the ensuing crowds prompted the creation of even more tourist attractions. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property. Knott added several other attractions over the years, and began charging admission to the attractions in 1968. In 1983, Knott's Berry Farm added Camp Snoopy, which began the park's present-day association with the Peanuts characters.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{historians have}} {{estimated}} {{the size of}} Komnenian armies on campaign at about 15,000 to 20,000 men, but field armies with less than 10,000 men were quite common. In 1176 Manuel I managed to gather approximately 30–40,000 men, of which 25,000 were Byzantines and the rest were allied contingents from Hungary, Serbia, and Antioch, though this was for an exceptional campaign. His military resources stretched <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> another, smaller, army in the field simultaneously. After the death of Manuel I, the Byzantine army seemed to have declined in numbers. In 1186, Emperor Isaac II assembled 250 knights and 500 infantry from the Latin population of Constantinople, an equivalent number of Georgian and Turkish mercenaries, and about 1,000 Byzantine soldiers. This force of 2,500+ managed to defeat Alexius Branas' rebellion. The rebel army which could not have numbered much more than 3-4,000 men had been the field force sent against the Bulgarians. Another force of about 3-4,000 was stationed at the city of Serres.|$|E

Woods battled to win {{his first}} round match against Gonzalo Fernández-Castaño, 1-up, and then played Nick Watney in the second round. On the 18th hole, Woods had to make birdie to extend the match, however his 5-foot putt missed and he was knocked out of the tournament. Woods commented that his putting was {{hindered}} technically and required some work after battling with it throughout the round. The following week Woods teed off at the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Woods commented that he had referred back <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> basics instead of new technique he had been applying. Woods' putting over {{the first three days}} of tournament play was noticeably better, but the ball was struggling to fall into the hole. Tiger began the fourth round on 2-under par, 9 shots behind leader Rory McIlroy. After parring the first hole and being delayed by adverse weather, Woods returned and played the remaining 17 holes in 8-under par including two eagles and no bogeys. A birdie-eagle finish set up Woods to possibly claim the title, however McIlroy kept his cool and won the tournament. Tiger finished joint second, and the round also marked his lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March, Southampton hosted bottom-placed Queens Park Rangers, in a match {{which saw}} {{competing}} managers Mauricio Pochettino and former Saints manager Harry Redknapp share their birthday. Southampton {{got off to}} a strong start, enjoying the majority of chances for the opening minutes, but it was QPR who broke the deadlock with their first shot on goal in the 14th minute courtesy of a Loïc Rémy strike. A scrappy first half continued on, with the home side unable to equalise until {{the very end of the}} first period when QPR goalkeeper Júlio César parried a shot from substitute Jay Rodriguez into the path of Gastón Ramírez, who chipped the ball into the net for 1–1. The second period started equally scrappily, with the hosts pulling out in front early on when both José Fonte and Rodriguez came close <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> the Saints ahead in the opening action. Shaky defending from substitute left-back Luke Shaw and centre-back Maya Yoshida led to the visitors' second (and winning) goal, when Park Ji-sung crossed the ball in for a Jay Bothroyd tap-in past Artur Boruc. Robert Green replaced the injured Júlio César late on, and the move came good when he made an athletic save to deny Yoshida in the last few minutes, giving QPR only their third win of the season and leaving Saints in the relegation mix.|$|E
