25|$|After the disappointments of the 2006–2007 season, Weir {{made the}} {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> his training regimen by leaving the only coach he had ever had, Priscilla Hill, moving out of his family home and moving on his own to New Jersey to train with Ukrainian coach Galina Zmievskaya. He subsequently had a great start to his 2007–2008 season at the Cup of China where he skated two clean and strong programs, achieving new personal best scores for both his free skate and overall score and winning the gold medal over fellow American Evan Lysacek. He {{then went on to}} Cup of Russia and took the gold medal there, as well. The two first-place finishes secured him a spot at the 2007–2008 Grand Prix Final, where Weir competed with a recurring injury in his landing foot and stumbled in both his short and long programs but still managed to place 4th overall.|$|E
25|$|Landrith {{signed his}} {{contract}} for the 1961 season on February 11 for roughly $80,000. New general manager Alvin Dark warned veteran regulars {{that there would be}} battles for spots on the depth chart at every position for the upcoming season, and the catcher position was no exception. In February, Schmidt and Landrith had two new competitors thrown into the foray. Tom Haller and John Orsino were originally considered threats <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> the depth chart order. Haller was the strongest threat, going getting 10 hits, including 4 home runs, 2 doubles, and 2 triples in just his first 20 at-bats for spring training. Tom's impressive play continued through mid-April, earning him the opening day starting job over Schmidt and Landrith. Hobie retained his spot as the number two catcher, with Schmidt dropping all the way from first to third. Landrith played in only three games in April, but made the most of his season debut game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates were up 1-0 with 1 out {{in the bottom of the}} 11th when Landrith hit a game tying home run to deep right field off reliever Roy Face.|$|E

Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'.

500|$|Dutch {{journalist}} Michiel Jongsma {{suggests that}} Kieftenbeld's position {{of choice is}} as a holding midfielder {{in front of the}} defence, where he can best use his energy in recovering the ball. He is comfortable on the ball and able to distribute it, but can be careless in possession, and [...] "he really tries <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> things when the play has gone dormant. In that lies his weakness as wellhe can pick up silly fouls and cards from time to time." [...] With Groningen, he averaged eight yellow cards a season. According to Groningen's technical director Henk Veldmate, speaking in 2014, his battling style and never-say-die attitude made him the sort of player with whom supporters could identify. In a 2011 interview, Kieftenbeld described himself as a perfectionist who always wanted to improve, and said that he sometimes put too much pressure on himself.|$|E

500|$|Partway {{through his}} second season with the Hornets, the Red Wings {{recalled}} Stewart {{as part of a}} bid <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> their team which had been struggling. [...] He appeared in 32 games in his NHL rookie season of 1938–39, and immediately established himself as a physical presence. He played in all 48 games for Detroit in 1939–40; his lone goal on the campaign was the first of his career. Stewart and the Red Wings reached the Stanley Cup final in both 1941 and 1942, but lost to the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, respectively. In his fifth season, 1942–43, Stewart was named to the NHL First All-Star Team on defence and helped lead the Red Wings to the NHL regular season title. Reaching the final for the third consecutive season, Detroit defeated Boston to win the Stanley Cup. Stewart scored one goal, added two assists and had 35 penalty minutes in ten playoff games.|$|E

[...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the 2009–10 season, Bosh worked out under Ken Roberson, looking to add 20 pounds and bring his weight up to 250. Following {{the failure of the}} 2008–09 campaign, Colangelo knew that he had <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> the roster to persuade Bosh to stay, and the Raptors were one of the busiest teams in the {{pre-season}} market. They opened their season with a win against the heavily favored Cleveland Cavaliers, in which Bosh scored 21 points and pulled down 16 rebounds. Bosh went on a tear, averaging 25.4 points and 11.9 rebounds in the first 16 games, but the Raptors were only able to win seven of those games. The Raptors crossed into 2010 with a 16–17 record, and on January 3, 2010, Bosh overtook Vince Carter as Toronto's all-time leader in total points scored. After pulling together a string of wins, Toronto were [...]500 after 40 games. Bosh was the league leader in double doubles at the time, being only one of two players in the league who averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game. On January 20, 2010, he scored a career-high 44 points in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, while collecting his 220th career double double. That same month, Bosh was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team, and was Eastern Conference Player of the Week. After the All-Star break, the Raptors went on several losing streaks and an injury to Bosh exacerbated the situation. As the regular season came to a close, the Raptors went from being the fifth seed before the All-Star break to fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls. After recording his 44th double double on March 22, 2010, Bosh became the Raptors' all-time leader in number of double doubles in a season. On April 5, 2010, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, winning the honor for the seventh time in his career (tying Carter for the most in franchise history). However, Bosh was unable to play in a pivotal match against the Bulls on April 11, 2010. The blowout loss cost Toronto their tie-breaker and ultimately the eighth seed, as the Bulls finished with 41 wins to Toronto's 40.|$|E
500|$|Just as {{they had}} been in 2010 under their former guise as [...] – when the team won two stages and the overall {{classification}} with Charteau – the team was very successful at La Tropicale Amissa Bongo in Africa. Gène took the team's first win of the year (and accordingly, first under their new name) in stage 2, the only stage that finished outside the race's primary host nation of Gabon, winning a field sprint in Ebolowa in Cameroon. In stage 4, the event's defending champion Charteau figured into a winning breakaway. Though he finished 24 seconds back on stage winner Daniel Teklehaymanot, he assumed the race leadership. He had a lead of four seconds over the man in second place and seven seconds over the man in third, but a good two minutes over the man in fourth, meaning it was virtually certain that he would at the very least finish on the podium. The next day, Gène added a second sprint win, as most of the field finished together and Charteau retained his advantage in the overall. While the final stage had the potential <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> the overall standings, with three large groups finishing four seconds after one another, Charteau held on to win the race overall for the second straight year by finishing in the first of these groups. In February, at the Étoile de Bessèges, Haddou won the sprint finish to the race's titular stage finishing in Bessèges. Later in February, Voeckler won the first stage of the Tour Méditerranéen. He had instigated the morning breakaway with four others, and they stayed away by a margin of three seconds over the fast-charging peloton. Voeckler won the two-day Tour du Haut Var later in February. He finished one second down on Samuel Dumoulin in stage 1, but in the hillier second stage, he finished 29 seconds clear of any other riders, along with breakaway companion Julien Antomarchi. He allowed Antomarchi to take the stage win, knowing that he had the race overall won. The team entered another African race in February, the Tour of South Africa. After winning La Tropicale Amissa Bongo, Charteau was expected to be a top contender for victory, but he broke his collarbone after a stage 1 crash and had to leave the race. The squad did pick up a win, with Gène taking stage 3 from a breakaway sprint, but their best-placed overall finisher was Quemeneur over two minutes down on race champion Kristian House.|$|E
