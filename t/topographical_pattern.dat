Conversely, when substrates have <b>topographical</b> <b>patterns,</b> {{the orientation of}} cells cultured on these surfaces is influenced by these geometrical cues. For example, if a substrate has nano/microgrooves running parallel to each other, cells orient along the direction of these <b>topographical</b> <b>patterns.</b> Therefore, cells {{seem to be able}} to sense the morphological characteristics of their surrounding and consequently respond by adopting the orientation of topographical stimuli. A similar effect can be obtained when cells are cultured on flat surfaces with lines of proteins printed on top (to which cells can adhere), interspersed by repellent lines; also in that case, cells align along the patterns.It has been observed that the phenomenon of contact guidance on microgrooved surfaces is influenced by the groove width. For instance, osteoblast-like cells align along the nanogrooves only for grooves wider than 75 nm. A similar behavior has been observed with other cell types, such as fibroblasts, which align along these <b>topographical</b> <b>patterns</b> when the grooves are wider than 150 nm.

40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that strain-driven {{self-assembly}} via Stranski-Krastonov growth is a promising way to fabricate ordered quantum dot array. However, control of the morphology remains to be a critical issue. One approach towards controlled self-assembly is, but not limited to, epitaxial growth on patterned substrates or patterned epilayers. The possibility of controlling the growth morphology of quantum dots upon patterned substrates and patterned epilayers is explored by numerical studies of three-dimensional phase field simulation. The results indicate that, by creating appropriate patterns, such as <b>topographical</b> <b>pattern</b> created in the substrate or epilayer, and periodically strained substrate, etc, the initial strain distributions on the surfaces of the substrate or epilayer can be altered, and thus the subsequent evolution path of surface morphology under annealing can be controlled efficiently.

40|$|To define {{alterations}} of neuronal connectivity {{that occur}} during motor neuron degeneration, we characterized the function {{and structure of}} spinal circuitry in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) model mice.

These abnormalities occur {{at an early stage}} of disease in motor neurons innervating proximal hindlimb muscles and medial motor neurons innervating axial muscles, but only at end-stage disease in motor neurons innervating distal hindlimb muscles. Motor neuron loss follows afferent synapse loss with the same temporal and <b>topographical</b> <b>pattern.</b> Trichostatin A, which improves motor behavior and survival of SMA mice, partially restores spinal reflexes illustrating the reversibility of these synaptic defects.

40|$|Early {{atherosclerotic}} lesions {{develop in}} a <b>topographical</b> <b>pattern</b> that strongly suggests involvement of hemodynamic forces in their pathogenesis. We hypothesized that certain endothelial genes, which exhibit differential responsiveness to distinct fluid mechanical stimuli, may {{participate in the}} atherogenic process by modulating, on a local level within the arterial wall, the effects of systemic risk factors. A differential display strategy using cultured human endothelial cells has identified two genes, manganese superoxide dismutase and cyclooxygenase- 2, that exhibit selective and sustained up-regulation by steady laminar shear stress (LSS). Turbulent shear stress, a nonlaminar fluid mechanical stimulus, does not induce these genes. The endothelial form of nitric oxide synthase also demonstrates a similar LSS-selective pattern of induction. Thus, three genes with potential atheroprotective (antioxidant, antithrombotic, and antiadhesive) activities manifest a differential response to distinct fluid mechanical stimuli, providing a possible mechanistic link between endothelial gene expression and early events in atherogenesis. The activities {{of these and other}} LSS-responsive genes may have important implications for the pathogenesis and prevention of atherosclerosis...|$|E

Our strategy combines ELP cross-linking and assembly, and a variety of standard and novel micro/nanofabrication techniques to create self-supporting membranes down to â¼ 500 nm thick that incorporate both physical and biomolecular signals, which can be easily tailored for a specific application. In this study we used an ELP that included the cell-binding motif arginineâglycineâaspartic acidâserine (RGDS). Furthermore, fabrication processes were developed to create membranes that exhibited <b>topographical</b> <b>patterns</b> with features down to 200 nm in lateral dimensions and up to 10 Î¼m in height on either one or both sides, uniform and well-defined pores, or multiple ELP layers. A variety of processing parameters were tested in order to optimize membrane fabrication, including ELP and cross-linker concentration, temperature, reaction time and ambient humidity. Membrane micro/nanopatterning, swelling and stiffness were characterized by atomic force microscopy, nanoindentation tests and scanning electron microscopy. Upon immersion in phosphate-buffered saline and an increase in temperature from 25 to 40 Â°C, membranes exhibited a significant increase in surface stiffness, with the reduced Youngâs modulus increasing with temperature.

Here, we seek to determine whether Homer 1 a and Yotiao might be implicated in post-synaptic response to antipsychotics with affinity to different dopamine D(2) receptors: haloperidol (0. 8 mg kg(- 1)), risperidone (3 mg kg(- 1)), olanzapine (2. 5 mg kg(- 1)) and (-) -sulpiride (50 mg kg(- 1)). Homer 1 a expression was significantly induced by haloperidol compared to vehicle and to atypical antipsychotics in almost all striatal sub-regions. Atypical antipsychotics induced the gene in the lateral putamen and in the core of the accumbens only.

40|$|In {{non-human}} primates several brain areas contain neurons that {{respond to}} both vestibular and somatosensory stimulation. In humans, vestibular stimulation activates several somatosensory brain regions and improves tactile perception. However, less {{is known about}} the spatio-temporal dynamics of such vestibular-somatosensory interactions in the human brain. To address this issue, we recorded high-density electroencephalography during left median nerve electrical stimulation to obtain Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs). We analyzed SEPs during vestibular activation following sudden decelerations from constant-velocity (90 Â°/s and 60 Â°/s) earth-vertical axis yaw rotations and SEPs during a non-vestibular control period. SEP analysis revealed two distinct temporal effects of vestibular activation: An early effect (28 - 32 ms post-stimulus) characterized by vestibular suppression of SEP response strength that depended on rotation velocity and a later effect (97 - 112 ms post-stimulus) characterized by vestibular modulation of SEP <b>topographical</b> <b>pattern</b> that was rotation velocity-independent. Source estimation localized these vestibular effects, during both time periods, to activation differences in a distributed cortical network including the right postcentral gyrus, right insula, left precuneus, and bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex.

Surfaces having microscale features are rapidly being developed for applications ranging from microelectronics to biomaterials. In many cases, flowing fluids interact with or {{are used to}} create these features. Despite its importance, a fundamental understanding of fluid behavior in these situations is generally lacking. In this thesis, several problems are examined to advance that understanding. First, a linear stability analysis of flow of power-law fluids adjacent to deformable solids is presented. Fluid rheology significantly affects the conditions for instability and {{may serve as a}} mechanism for enhancing mixing within microfluidic devices. Second, the use of normally oriented electrostatic fields to create regular <b>topographical</b> <b>patterns</b> on the surfaces of thin polymer films is considered. Linear stability analysis and one-dimensional nonlinear simulations demonstrate how AC electrostatic fields may be used to control the width and height of the pillar-like structures that are formed by this process. Two-dimensional nonlinear simulations are carried out to determine how AC fields affect the arrangement of these pillars into their final patterns. As an extension, the use of trilayer films to create unique pillar-like structures is studied using linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations. Then, linear stability analysis is applied to study how tangentially oriented electrostatic fields may also be used to create <b>topographical</b> <b>patterns,</b> and the effect of gravity on stability is considered. Finally, a model addressing the stability of viscoelastic fluids under electric fields is proposed. All of these results shed light on how the stability of microscale fluid interfaces can be exploited to improve emerging technological applications...|$|R

40|$|Objective: There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on invasive technologies. fMRI is exceptionally suited for selecting implant sites since BOLD signals {{has been shown to}} correlate well spatially with electric potentials recorded from the brain surface. Previous studies show {{that it is possible to}} decode covertly directed visuospatial attention using fMRI. In the present study we increase the relevance of the fMRI analysis for surface-electrodes by only allowing voxels at the surface of the brain. Methods: We classify visuospatial attention directed to four different directions (left, right, up and down) using a support vector machine while enforcing several spatial restrictions on the voxels available for the classifier. All the spatial restrictions applied are based on how accessible the brain areas are for implanted surface electrodes. Results: The results show that fMRI signals from only the surface of the brain are sufficient for a good classification. Data also show that the <b>topographical</b> <b>pattern</b> is quite variable across subjects. Conclusions: A good control of BCI systems based on signals from surface electrodes can be achieved using visuospatial attention.

Methods: EEG power values were calculated across a 1. 00 - 25. 75 Hz frequency range during time intervals preceding and following REM onset of the first 4 sleep cycles of 10 normal subjects. Topographical changes were assessed through Fpz-A 1, Fz-A 1, Cz-A 1, Pz-A 1, Oz-A 1 recordings during NREM-REM-NREM transitions. Results: The temporal dynamics of REM onset is characterized by a specific <b>topographical</b> <b>pattern</b> of EEG changes with a relatively higher EEG activity at posterior sites: Oz does not show any clear change within the alpha and beta frequencies, at variance with the marked reductions of the other sites, while it shows reductions of power in the delta/theta and sigma frequency ranges of smaller size as compared to the other sites. REM offset does not appear as a mirror-image of REM onset, since the pattern of regional differences characterizing the NREM sleep preceding REM onset is not fully reached.

DESIGN: Data analysis from a prospective acute stroke registry (the Lausanne Stroke Registry, Lausanne, Switzerland) in a community-based primary care center. RESULTS: Among 3525 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to a primary care stroke center, 250 patients (7 %) had at least 2 MPCIs, with the following subgroups: large artery disease and a cardiac source of embolism (LAD + CSE) (43 %), small artery disease and CSE (SAD + CSE) (34 %), LAD + SAD (18 %), and LAD + SAD + CSE (5 %). Hypertension, cardiac ischemia, {{and a history of}} atrial fibrillation predominated in the LAD + SAD + CSE subgroup (P&lt;. 001), while cigarette smoking was more prevalent in the LAD + SAD subgroup (P&lt;. 05). A decreased level of consciousness and speech disorders were more common in the LAD + CSE subgroup (P&lt;. 001). Lacunar syndromes predominated in the LAD + SAD subgroup. Pure motor stroke was the most frequent lacunar syndrome in all subgroups, but sensory motor stroke predominated in the LAD + CSE subgroup (P&lt;. 05). The outcome at 1 month was worse in the LAD + CSE and SAD + CSE subgroups (P&lt;. 001). Other stroke characteristics and clinical features did not differ significantly between the 4 subgroups of patients with MPCI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that MPCIs are uncommon. The most frequent association is LAD + CSE. <b>Topographical</b> <b>patterns</b> of stroke and clinical characteristics in patients with MPCI only rarely allow emphasis of a preeminent cause.

40|$|It {{has been}} amply {{demonstrated}} previously that CO 2 lasers hold {{the ability to}} surface modify various polymers. In addition, {{it has been observed}} that these surface enhancements can augment the biomimetic nature of the laser irradiated materials. This research has employed a CO 2 laser marker to produce trench and hatch <b>topographical</b> <b>patterns</b> with peak heights of around 1 Î¼m on the surface of nylon 6, 6. The patterns generated have been analysed using white light interferometery, optical microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to determine the surface oxygen content. Contact angle measurements were used to characterize each sample in terms of wettability. Generally, it was seen {{that as a result of}} laser processing the contact angle, surface roughness and surface oxygen content increased whilst the apparent polar and total surface energies decreased. The increase in contact angle and reduction in surface energy components was found to be on account of a mixed intermediate state wetting regime owing to the change in roughness due to the induced <b>topographical</b> <b>patterns.</b> To determine the biomimetic nature of the modified and as-received control samples each one was seeded with 2 Ã 104 cells/ml normal human osteoblast cells and observed after periods of 24 hours and 4 days using optical microscopy and SEM to determine mean cell cover densities and variations in cell morphology. In addition a haeymocytometer was used to show that the cell count for the laser patterned samples had increased by up to a factor of 1. 5 compared to the as-received control sample after 4 days of incubation. Significantly, it was determined that all laser-induced patterns gave rise to better cell response in comparison to the as-received control sample studied due to increased preferential cell growth on those surfaces with increased surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|Tuberous {{sclerosis}} {{complex is}} a multisystem genetic syndrome often affecting {{the central nervous}} system. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to identify <b>topographical</b> <b>patterns</b> in the distribution specific to epileptogenic (n = 37) and nonepileptogenic (n = 544) tubers throughout the brain for a cohort of 23 tuberous sclerosis complex patients with a history of seizures. Tubers localized to the inferior parietal lobes, middle frontal lobes, middle temporal lobes, or central sulcus regions were associated with a high frequency of epileptogenic tubers. Epileptogenic tubers occurred statistically more frequently within the inferior parietal lobe and within the central sulcus region in children younger than 1 or between 1 and 3 years old, respectively. Results imply seizure activity in tuberous sclerosis complex patients can be associated with the location of cortical tubers...|$|R
