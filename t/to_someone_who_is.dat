25|$|In the {{language}} mode framework, language processing mechanisms and languages {{as a whole}} can be achieved to different extents. The relative activation state of language is called language mode, and it is influenced by many factors, such as the person spoken or listened to, users’ language proficiency, the nonlinguistic context and so on. Language users can be in a bilingual mode if they are talking to other bilinguals or reading text with mixed languages. However, if they listen <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> monolingual or is just speaking one language, the activation state would switch to a more monolingual mode. Based on this model, the bilinguals' language mode depends on {{the language}} users' expectation and by language environment.|$|E
25|$|As the Patriarch of Alexandria, Egypt, has {{historically}} also held {{the title of}} Pope, a person who, in opposition <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> generally accepted as a legitimate Pope of Alexandria, claims to hold that position may also be considered an Antipope. In 2006, the defrocked married Coptic lector Max Michel became an Antipope of Alexandria, calling himself Maximos I. His claim to the Alexandrine Papacy was dismissed by both the Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III and Pope Theodore II of the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Coptic Pope of Alexandria and the Greek Pope of Alexandria currently view one another, not as Antipopes, but rather as successors to differing lines of apostolic succession that formed {{as a result of}} christological disputes in the fifth century.|$|E
25|$|Video game {{culture is}} a {{worldwide}} new media subculture formed around video games and game playing. As computer and video games have increased in popularity over time, {{they have had a}} significant influence on popular culture. Video game culture has also evolved over time hand in hand with internet culture as well as the increasing popularity of mobile games. Many people who play video games identify as gamers, which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> passionate about it. As video games become more social with multiplayer and online capability, gamers find themselves in growing social networks. Gaming can both be entertainment as well as competition, as a new trend known as electronic sports is becoming more widely accepted. In the 2010s, video games and discussions of video game trends and topics can be seen in social media, politics, television, film and music.|$|E
5000|$|In {{pop culture}} and hip hop, shorty has {{multiple}} meanings.

500|$|Elsewhere, Hermione Norris {{returns as}} Ros Myers. The {{character}} was initially written {{off after the}} eighth episode of the sixth series due to the actress's pregnancy, however when the seventh series entered pre-production, Norris was asked to return and she accepted. Miranda Raison also returns as Jo Portman; the cliffhanger of the sixth series finale, where Jo was apparently killed, was to leave the audience wonder whether she survived. Raison stated that she realised the producers wanted her to return, {{and she wanted to}} return. Alex Lanipekun returns as Ben Kaplan, and was upgraded to a series regular from the last series. Lanipekun believed that the seventh series was [...] "kind of for Ben," [...] adding that there was an episode that would see his coming of age by dealing with his first undercover operation and his burdens, namely getting close <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> involved with the group he was sent to stop. Peter Firth, Gemma Jones and Hugh Simon returns as superior Harry Pearce, Connie James and Malcolm Wynn-Jones, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Skarði is {{a rather}} unusual name, but it appears in runic {{inscriptions}} in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

Examples include—Beings: well fed, sheltered, healthy; Doings: work, education, voting, participating in community life. It must also be noted that the freedom of choice is central—someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. during a religious fast) is quite different <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> hungry because they cannot afford to buy food.|$|E

40|$|I {{propose a}} comparison-induced {{distortion}} theory account of body-size judgments wherein verbal body-size comparisons (e. g., "Kimberly is thinner than Jane, " Choplin & Hummel, 2002, 2005) bias judgments of body-sizes. Two experiments tested predictions of this account. Unpredicted by previous models, Experiment 1 demonstrated that verbal comparisons affect body-size judgments {{even though the}} distribution of contextual body sizes was held constant. Experiment 2 found that verbal comparisons can sometimes bias judgments toward the values {{to which they are}} compared. An extremely thin woman was judged larger if she <b>was</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> much larger than her than if she <b>was</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> only slightly larger than her. These results demonstrate that research on body-size judgments cannot ignore the effects of verbal comparisons. Body-Size Judgments The goal {{of this paper is to}} propose and test a comparison-induced distortion theory (CID theory, Choplin & Hummel, 2002, 2005) account of body-size judgments. The application of CID theory to the problem of body-size judgments was inspired by research investigating the effects of media ideals on body-size judgments (Lavine, Sweeney...|$|R

2500|$|Hakham (or chakam(i), haham(i), hacham(i); [...] , [...] "wise") {{is a term}} in Judaism, {{meaning a}} wise or {{skillful}} man; it often refers <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a great Torah scholar. The word is generally used to designate a cultured and learned person: [...] "He who says a wise thing is called a hakham, even if he be not a Jew" [...] (Meg.16a). Hence in Talmudic-Midrashic literature wise and learned gentiles are commonly called hakme ummot ha-'olam [...] "wise men of {{the nations of the}} world".

2500|$|By the 1930s both {{fruit and}} fruitcake terms {{are seen as}} not only {{negative}} but also to mean male homosexual, although probably not universally. It {{should be noted that}} LGBT people were widely diagnosed as diseased with the potential for being cured, thus were regularly [...] "treated" [...] with castration, lobotomies, pudic nerve surgery, and electroshock treatment. Due to this, transferring the meaning of fruitcake, nutty, <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> deemed insane, or crazy, may have seemed rational at the time and many apparently believed that LGBT people were mentally unsound. In the United States, psychiatric institutions ("mental hospitals") where many of these procedures were carried out were called fruitcake factories while in 1960s Australia they were called fruit factories.|$|E

Beginning with [...] "You understand, then, my situation: I've told you how good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out", the speech {{proceeds}} to explain all the reasons why it is better to give your favor to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> [...] "more sick than sound in the head" [...] and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.|$|E
