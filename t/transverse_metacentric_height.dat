50|$|The <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> (GM) is a {{measurement}} of the initial static stability of a floating body. It is calculated as {{the distance between the}} centre of gravity of a ship and its metacentre. A larger <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> implies greater initial stability against overturning. The <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> also influences the natural period of rolling of a hull, with very large <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> being associated with shorter periods of roll which are uncomfortable for passengers. Hence, a sufficiently, but not excessively, high <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> is considered ideal for passenger ships.|$|R
40|$|Values of lateral and {{longitudinal}} <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> {{for various}} seaplanes were calculated {{by means of}} approximate formulae derived here.

For the lateral <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> GM = 13 +. 002 W and for longitudinal <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> GM = 15 +. 002 W, GM is in feet and the gross weight (W) is in pounds. Although only approximate, it is thought that the values indicated here are a reliable guide to current practice. It is recommended that the longitudinal and lateral <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> be made equal and of the value given by GM = 15 =. 002 W.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a probabilistic methodology {{for the analysis}} of the vulnerability of a ship to the risk of inception of pure loss of stability events. A pure loss of stability failure is modelled as the persistence of the <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> below a critical level for a too long time. The <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> is modelled as a stationary Gaussian process with a spectrum obtained from the sea elevation spectrum. The time dependent failure index is obtained under the assumption of filtered Poisson process for the occurrence of critical events. The analysis separates cases where the fluctuation of the <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> is narrow-band from those where the bandwidth of the spectrum is wide, with an intermediate blending. In case of narrow-band processes appropriate approximate solutions to the problem are provided, while in the wide-band cases an exponential distribution for the persistence time below the critical level is employed. A rational development for the critical persistence time is also provided considering an approximation of the roll dynamics during periods of time where the <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> is negative. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to check the developed approximate distributions for the persistence time, and examples of application are provided for a sample ship...|$|R

50|$|The righting {{couple on}} the ship is {{proportional}} to the horizontal distance between two equal forces.
