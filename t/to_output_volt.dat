40|$|The {{objective}} of this laboratory is to design a full state feedback controller for position {{the tip of a}} rotary flexible link as quickly as possible with minimal vibration mounted on the SRV- 02 DC servomotor. For this, we will use the state space model of the combined system (i. e., servomotor and flexible link) introduced in the Laboratory 9 (refer to [1]) and then tune the feedback gain matrix K to find the best position tracking while minimizing endpoint oscillation. 12. 2 Model From Section 9. 2 of the course textbook [1], the flexible link model is introduced. For this laboratory, the servo is used in the high gear ratio configuration (refer to Figure 3. 5 in the text-book [1]). The flexible link is described with a fourth-order system and is shown in Figure 1. The output that we are trying to control is the total deflection of the link (i. e., γ = θ+α). The motor shaft position (θ) is measured using an encoder. The angular deflection at the tip (α) is measured by a strain gauge analog sensor that is calibrated <b>to</b> <b>output</b> one <b>volt</b> per inch of deflection. Figure 1 : Flexible Link.

50|$|Voltage {{control in}} analog music synthesizers {{is similar in}} {{principle}} to how voltage is used in electronic analog computers, in which voltage is a scaled analog of a quantity {{that is part of}} the computation. For instance, control voltages can be added or subtracted in a circuit almost identical to an adder in such a computer. Inside a synthesizer VCO, an analog exponential function provides the 1 volt per octave control of an oscillator that basically runs on a volts/kHz basis. Positive voltage polarity raises pitch, and negative lowers it. The result is that, for example, a standard keyboard can have its <b>output</b> scaled <b>to</b> that of a quarter-tone keyboard by changing its <b>output</b> <b>to</b> one-half <b>volt</b> per octave, with no other technical changes.|$|R

40|$|This senior project report {{explains}} {{the construction and}} design of a small, portable water generator that converts kinetic energy flowing in small creeks to electrical energy as a renewable source of energy for the DC House. The DC House, in short, is a project to build a self-sustainable house for Third World countries that utilizes only DC electricity. The system consists of two converters and a charge controller for a 12 V lead-acid battery. The first converter converts the hydro generator voltage <b>output</b> <b>to</b> 15 <b>Volts</b> for safe and proper charging of the lead-acid battery by the charge controller. The second converter provides power output for the DC House by converting the 12 V lead-acid battery to 48 Volts at a maximum of 60 Watts. The charge controller contains a bi-directional connection to the 12 V lead-acid battery that can store the energy generated by the hydro generator for future use during light loads or deliver additional power during heavy loads. Since the system uses DC electricity, interfacing with the DC House eliminates costly and inefficient conversion from DC to AC, and vice versa, normally implemented in conventional methods. Also, assuming the user of the system owns a vehicle, the user can use his/her existing battery without having to buy additional expensive equipment. The Portable Nano-Hydro Power Generator provides a cheap and versatile renewable source of energy that can provide electricity to the unfortunates without depleting the earth’s natural resources...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two basic}} types of seismic sensors: {{inertial}} seismometers which measure ground motion relative to an inertial reference (a suspended mass), and strainmeters or extensometers which measure the motion of one point of the ground relative to another. Since {{the motion of the}} ground relative to an inertial reference is in most cases much larger than the differential motion within a vault 9 of reasonable dimensions, inertial seismometers are generally more sensitive to earthquake signals. However, at very low frequencies it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an inertial reference, and for the observation of low-order free oscilla-tions of the Earth, tidal motions, and quasi-static deformations, strainmeters may outperform inertial seismometers. Strainmeters are conceptually simpler than inertial seismometers al-though their technical realization and installation may be more difficult (IS 5. 1). This Chapter is concerned with inertial seismometers only. For a more comprehensive description of iner-tial seismometers, recorders and communication equipment see Havskov and Alguacil (2002).

The voltage of the net - net amounted to PLN 220 volts down to a step-down transformer to 16 volts, because the voltage required for charging the batteries is DC voltage and the voltage of the transformer is still streamy AC voltage, the voltage of the transformer is rectified by the diode.
