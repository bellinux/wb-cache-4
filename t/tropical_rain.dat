If the dire wolf originated in North America, the species likely dispersed into South America via the Andean corridor, a proposed pathway for temperate mammals to migrate from Central to South America {{because of the}} favorable cool, dry, and open habitats that characterized the region at times. This most likely happened during a glacial period because the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna, whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have consisted of <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> forest.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{reaction}} of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, {{according to the}} animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, {{making it difficult for}} the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.|$|E

5|$|Alloxylon flammeum, {{commonly}} known as the Queensland tree waratah or red silky oak, is a medium-sized tree of the family Proteaceae found in the Queensland <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> forests of northeastern Australia. It has shiny green elliptical leaves up to 18cm (7.2in) long, and prominent orange-red inflorescences that appear from August to October, followed by rectangular woody seed pods that ripen in February and March. Juvenile plants have large (up to 25cm (10in) long) deeply lobed pinnate leaves. Previously known as Oreocallis wickhamii, the initial specimen {{turned out to be a}} different species to the one cultivated and hence a new scientific name was required. Described formally by Peter Weston and Mike Crisp in 1991, A. flammeum was designated the type species of the genus Alloxylon. This genus contains the four species previously classified in Oreocallis that are found in Australasia.|$|E

40|$|The {{probability}} {{matching method}} (PMM) {{is used as}} a basis for estimating attenuation in <b>tropical</b> <b>rains</b> near Darwin, Australia. PMM provides a climatological relationship between measured radar reflectivity and rain rate, which includes the effects of rain and cloud attenuation. When the radar sample is representative, PMM estimates the rainfall without bias. When the data are stratified for greater than average rates, the method no longer compensates for the higher attenuation and the radar rainfall estimates are biased low. The uncompensated attenuation is used to estimate the climatological attenuation coefficient. The two-way attenuation coefficient was found to be 0. 0085 dB/km (mm/h) exp - 1. 08 for the <b>tropical</b> <b>rains</b> and associated clouds in Darwin for the first two months of the year for horizontally polarized radiation at 5. 63 GHz. This unusually large value is discussed. The risks of making real-time corrections for attenuation are also treated...|$|R

25|$|The {{climate in}} Southeast Asia is mainly tropical–hot and humid {{all year round}} with {{plentiful}} rainfall. Northern Vietnam and the Myanmar Himalayas are the only regions in Southeast Asia that feature a subtropical climate, which has a cold winter with snow. The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon. The <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season. The rain forest is the second largest on earth (with the Amazon being the largest). An exception {{to this type of}} climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region, where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape. Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert like.|$|E
25|$|Landforms {{present in}} this region include the upland terra firme (non-flooded) mostly on nutrient-poor {{lateritic}} soils, ancient alluvial plains (mostly non-flooded) on nutrient-rich soils, and present alluvial plains (várzea, seasonally flooded) of super-rich sediments renewed with each annual flood. Floristically, distinct lowland humid forest types occur {{on each of these}} landforms with the terra firme mature forests and late successional, seasonally flooded forest being the two major types. Permanent swamp forests are common on the alluvial plains. Pockets of nutrient-poor white sand soils are found here that host forests of lower height, a more open forest canopy, and lower alpha diversity, but with many endemics.
