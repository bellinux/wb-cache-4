40|$|Objective To {{examine whether}} <b>the</b> {{clinical}} <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> cervical dystonia (CD) significantly correlates with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT) findings {{as well as}} to determine the threshold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinical <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> CD for positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT study findings. Methods Forty-seven subjects with torticollis as one of the symptoms of CD were included. <b>The</b> clinical <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> CD was evaluated with the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) at the time of 18 F-FDG PET/CT. The correlation between <b>the</b> clinical <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> CD and <b>the</b> highest SUVmax was examined. The threshold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinical <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> CD necessary for positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings was determined using receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Results Thirty-three of the 47 subjects (70. 21 %) showed positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings. The ipsilateral splenius capitis/cervicis, oblique capitis inferior, and longus colli/capitis were the rotators most frequently involved. The highest SUVmax of 18 F-FDG PET/CT was significant correlated with the TWSTRS. Subjects with a total TWSTRS exceeding 39 showed positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings, with those having a total TWSTRS ≤ 22 showing negative 18 F-FDG PET/CT results. The cutoff value of the total TWSTRS for positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings was set at 27. 5 with 90. 9 % sensitivity and 64. 3 % specificity. Conclusion A significant correlation was evident between <b>the</b> clinical <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> CD and 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings, providing a threshold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinical <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> CD for acquisition of positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{histological}} <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> {{acute rejection}} in renal allografts was determined for 39 rejection episodes in 30 renal transplant recipients.

T cell subset ratios showed no correlation with <b>the</b> histological <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> rejection, nor with the reversibility of the rejection episode. The grade of histological rejection on biopsy was predictive of graft survival. We conclude that renal biopsy remains the best method for determining <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> and outcome <b>of</b> acute allograft rejection episodes...|$|R

5|$|Several scales {{exist to}} grade <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> acne vulgaris, but no single {{technique}} has been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard. Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 (0 being the least severe and 8 {{being the most}} severe). This scale {{was the first to}} use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> the acne from 1 (least severe) to 4 (most severe).|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E

40|$|Agency {{theories}} {{suggest that}} governance matters more when agency conflicts are potentially more severe. However, empirical studies {{often do not}} control for <b>the</b> potential <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> agency conflicts. I show that the marginal benefit of governance varies with the free cash flow level, a proxy for <b>the</b> potential <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> agency conflicts. As the free cash flow level increases, higher governance quality becomes incrementally more value-enhancing, and lower governance quality becomes incrementally more value-destroying. This {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that better governance helps resolve the agency conflicts in investment decisions when a firm has more free cash flows (Jensen, 1986). This study highlights the importance of controlling for <b>the</b> potential <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> agency conflicts in governance studies and provides an improved method to estimate the marginal benefit of a governance mechanism...|$|R
