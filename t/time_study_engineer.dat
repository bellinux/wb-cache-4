40|$|A {{great many}} papers {{have been written}} {{on the subject of}} human fatigue but the {{complaint}} is often made in industry that, while many of these studies may be of scientific value, {{it is very difficult to}} see how they may assist those who are concerned with the problem in industry, in particular the <b>time</b> <b>study</b> <b>engineers</b> whose job it is to assess the fatigue that work involves and to apply the appropriate allowances. The object of this paper is to consider the problem of these allowances (usually termed. Compensating Rest or C. R. allowances) in the light of scientific evidence. It is not proposed to refer to previous work that bears on this field in any specific way, since a paper which did so would run to considerable length, but rather to evaluate some of the most important material and to suggest the type of framework for C. R. allowances that would appear most rational in the light of available evidence. As this paper is written primarily for those in industry, knowledge of industrial practices and terminology is assumed...|$|R

50|$|Engineering {{studies is}} an {{interdisciplinary}} branch of {{social sciences and}} humanities devoted to the <b>study</b> of <b>engineers</b> and their activities. <b>Studying</b> <b>engineers</b> refers among other to the history and the sociology of their profession, its institutionalization and organization, the social composition {{and structure of the}} population of engineers, their training, their trajectory, etc. A subfield is for instance Women in engineering. Studying engineering refers to the study of their activities and practices, their knowledge and ontologies, their role into the society, their engagement.Engineering studies investigate how social, political, economical, cultural and historical dynamics affect technological research, design, engineering and innovation, and how these, in turn, affect society, economics, politics and culture.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} {{improvement of}} the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) of the autoclave process through the implementation of <b>time</b> <b>studies.</b> Two types of <b>time</b> <b>study</b> are employed where the initial <b>time</b> <b>study</b> conducted was the direct stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> used to validate the current OEE standard. Maynard's Operation Sequencing Technique (MOST) is then adopted to conduct the secondary <b>time</b> <b>study.</b> MOST study revealed the significant value added and non-value added activities at each sub process. MOST is {{used to evaluate the}} percentage of improvement contributed to the OEE. The paper significantly highlight problem in computing the OEE which is the inaccuracy of the data used and lack of a medium to evaluate the improvement ideas before it is implemented. MOST is an effective method to evaluate and shows the gain from the improvement ideas proposed without investing in costly implementations. The limitation of this study is mainly concerned with direct stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> performed during initial stage as it might varies from one person to another. The other concern is on operation steps performed might be different from one labor to another which might contribute to the variation of the <b>time</b> <b>studies</b> performed...|$|R

The <b>time</b> <b>study</b> techniques is applied under certain situation and the stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> is the best technique for manual production because human performance is not consistent from time to time. The stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> had been selected for the study because 70 percents of the production in ABC bearings Limited is handled manually by man power.

The ability to reliably manipulate, characterize, and engineer microbial biofilms will enable controlled studies of ecosystem dynamics and unprecedented design opportunities for biological sensors and actuators. Biofilms can be grown in the laboratory, and spatial structure, gene expression, and productivity (total biomass accumulation) can be observed and quantified as a function of time using confocal laser scanning microscopy.

40|$|Background: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an {{important}} eukaryotic workhorse in traditional and modern biotechnology. At present, only a few S. cerevisiae strains have been extensively used as engineering hosts.

This <b>study</b> <b>engineered</b> a natural S. cerevisiae strain with advantages in inulin utilization to produce ethanol from inulin resources by consolidated bioprocess. Rational engineering strategies were employed, including secretive co-expression of heterologous exo-and endo-inulinases, repression of a protease, and switch between haploid and diploid strains...|$|R
