Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated.

Allmusic called Still Life a [...] "formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies." [...] As explained by Åkerfeldt, Still Life is a concept album: [...] "The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith {{as the rest of}} the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years <b>to</b> <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his old 'babe.' The big bosses of the town know that he's back...

The formal leader was retired General Isidoro Dias Lopes, with others including Eduardo Gomes, Newton Estillac Leal, João Cabanas and Miguel Costa. The rebellion began well, with control of São Paulo being secured after the governor and forces loyal to him abandoned the city early on 9 July. The rebels in the city were put under siege by government forces, and prevented from linking up with other uprisings which were breaking out in places such as Bela Vista, Mato Grosso, Aracaju, Sergipe and Manaus. The city was then subjected to a several-week artillery and aerial bombardment, of which civilians bore the brunt. On 26 July, army aircraft dropped leaflets over the city warning the remaining civilians to leave so that loyalist forces would have a free hand against the rebels. [...] "Isidoro's various attempts at securing an accord with the government that would at least give the rebels amnesty were rebuffed.
