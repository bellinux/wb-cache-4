5|$|The synagogue's {{fortunes}} {{improved in}} the 1940s, but in 1946, its bank threatened to foreclose on its buildings, {{in anticipation of}} their sale to the local Catholic diocese, as the congregation had not paid <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> in many years. The congregation succeeded in convincing the bank to re-negotiate its mortgage, and reduce the outstanding loan, and Max Koeppel led a drive to pay it off completely.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} rent a home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} at a general meeting on 22 March 1895 that the club could finally {{afford to buy}} Goodison Park. Mahon revealed that Everton were buying Goodison Park for £650 less than the price of Anfield three years earlier, with Goodison Park having more land and a 25% larger capacity. The motion to purchase Goodison Park was passed unanimously. Dr. Baxter also lent the club £5,000 to redeem <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> early {{at a rate of}} 3½%. By this time the redrawing of political boundaries put Walton, and hence Goodison Park, inside the City of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Once Kennedy and Eddy {{had settled}} their {{financial}} affairs in May 1872, {{she was left}} with $6,000. Peel writes {{that at this point}} she had already written 60 pages of Science and Health. She was renting rooms in Lynn at 9 Broad Street, when 8 Broad Street came on the market. In March 1875 she purchased it for $5,650, taking in students to pay <b>the</b> <b>mortgage.</b> It was in the attic room of this house that she completed Science and Health.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in October 1889, Eddy {{closed the}} Massachusetts Metaphysical College; {{according}} to Bates and Dittemore, {{the state attorney}} was investigating colleges that were fraudulently graduating medical students. She also foreclosed <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> on the land in Boston the church had purchased, then purchased it herself for $5,000 through a middle man, though it was worth considerably more. She told the church they could have the land for their building on condition they formally dissolve the church; this was apparently intended to quash internal rebellions that had been bothering her. The following year she dissolved the National Christian Science Association. Wilson writes that the dissolutions allowed her to create a central church controlled by a five-person board of directors that answered only to her, which gave the church a stability that helped it survive her death.|$|E

50|$|From 1938 to 1968, <b>the</b> Federal National <b>Mortgage</b> Association (Fannie Mae) was {{the sole}} {{institution}} that bought mortgages from depository institutions, principally savings and loan associations, which encouraged more mortgage lending and effectively insured <b>the</b> value of <b>mortgages</b> by <b>the</b> US government. In 1968, Fannie Mae split into a private corporation and a publicly financed institution. The private corporation was still called Fannie Mae and its charter continued to support <b>the</b> purchase of <b>mortgages</b> from savings and loan associations and other depository institutions, but without an explicit insurance policy that guaranteed the value of <b>the</b> <b>mortgages.</b> <b>The</b> publicly financed institution was named <b>the</b> Government National <b>Mortgage</b> Association (Ginnie Mae) and it explicitly guaranteed the repayments of securities backed by mortgages made to government employees or veterans (<b>the</b> <b>mortgages</b> themselves were also guaranteed by other government organizations).|$|R
5|$|Flournoy {{relocated}} {{with his}} family to Charleston in 1890 during his father's second West Virginia Senate term. Flournoy was educated at Fishburne Military School, Hampden–Sydney College, and West Virginia University College of Law. He was admitted to the Kanawha County bar in 1911 and at various times during his law career, Flournoy was appointed special master, arbitrator, or commissioner for several high-profile court cases. In 1935, Flournoy was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for an at-large seat on the Charleston City Council. In 1937, Flournoy was selected by Governor Homer A. Holt {{as a member of the}} Charleston Civil Service Board, which regulated the appointments of police and fire personnel. Flournoy served as an incorporator of the New Homes Corporation of Charleston in 1931 and was later president of <b>the</b> <b>Mortgage</b> Exchange Corporation. He was involved in the establishment of a local mortgage business association in 1952. Flournoy died in Charleston in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 Dudley married Guildford's {{daughter}} Jane, who {{was four}} years his junior and his former classmate. The Dudleys belonged to the new evangelical circles of the early 1530s, and their 13 children were educated in Renaissance humanism and science. Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 without a written will. His only son having predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, asserted that his uncle had intended him to inherit. Dudley and his wife contested this claim. The parties went to court and Dudley, who had secured Thomas Cromwell's patronage, won the case. In 1532 he lent his cousin, John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley, over ₤7,000 on {{the security of the}} baronial estate. Lord Dudley was unable to pay off any of his creditors, so when <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> was foreclosed in the late 1530s Sir John Dudley came into possession of Dudley Castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Lhermitte {{was hired}} as a teacher. Shortly after {{beginning}} her new career, Lhermitte gave birth to her first child, Yasmine (b. August 13, 1992). Three years later, she delivered her second child, Nora (b. February 13, 1995). From June 1, 1995 to August 31, 1996, Lhermitte was granted leave from her teaching position due to postpartum depression. After the birth of Lhermitte's first child Yasmin, Schaar purchased a house for himself and the couple to live in, and he dedicated his apartment to his practice. In 1996, Schaar hired Moqadem to serve as his filing assistant part-time, then full-time in 1998. During this period, Schaar still covered most expenses, including vacations, house repairs, monthly allowances, and life insurance for each family member. Lhermitte gave birth to two more daughters, Miriam (b. April 20, 1997) and Mina (May 20, 1999), before the family's move from Brussels to the provincial town of Nivelles. Schaar paid <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> and lived on the second floor.|$|E

50|$|Beginning {{in summer}} 2007, {{the value of}} some {{financial}} instruments backed by U.S. subprime mortgages declined sharply as {{it became clear that}} many of the borrowers would default on <b>the</b> <b>mortgages.</b> This caused a crisis as the banks holding <b>the</b> <b>mortgages</b> saw their assets decline in value and rushed to foreclose the loans.

5|$|In 1994, {{several groups}} were {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} relocate the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from Minneapolis, Minnesota to New Orleans, Louisiana. The proposed relocation would have been the second involving a Minneapolis-based franchise in the span of two years, as Minneapolis had lost its National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to Dallas in 1993. Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner were considering selling the team due to problems with <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> on the Target Center, the team's arena that had been built only four years earlier as part of Minneapolis' 1989 entry into the NBA. The events of the attempted relocation resulted in Glen Taylor, businessman and former Minnesota State Senator, purchasing the team and keeping it in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Structurally, National Westminster Bank was {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group until January 2003, when {{ownership of the}} bank's entire issued ordinary share capital was transferred to The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, as holding company. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group is now the ultimate holding company of both banks. At that time the entire issued share capital of Lombard North Central Plc was transferred by the bank to the holding company. Ownership of National Westminster Home Loans Limited was passed to the holding company in December 2005; <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> portfolio and related funding were transferred back to NatWest in October 2012.

Des was instantly attracted to Daphne, but he tried to hide his feelings and became awkward around her. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, wrote that the local men queued up to date Daphne, but it was Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) who first caught her eye and they soon began a relationship.|$|E

This decree, being appealed from, was affirmed by the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals and the record was remanded to the Court of Chancery. The case is brought here by writ of error, and the errors assigned resolve themselves into the single error of sustaining the priority of the lien of the water rents over that of <b>the</b> complainant's <b>mortgages.</b>|$|R

The referee fixed the rental for the first year at $325, and ordered that for each subsequent year the rental be fixed by the court.

When AJ has to look after Masood's young son Kamil Masood (Arian Chikhlia), {{he admits that he}} is not good with children, and was scared when Aliyah wanted one, because he feels he cannot look after himself properly, let alone a child. However, he bonds well with his nephew. AJ is offered a job as an assistant manager at a garage in Birmingham. Although he initially wants to turn down the position, he eventually accepts the job offer. Shortly before he leaves Walford, AJ learns that his mother has died. Masood is angry with AJ when he explains that he cannot attend their mother's funeral. AJ then leaves for Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Cox falsified {{documents}} {{to make it}} appear that he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages on them for five to six times their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern US, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 400 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007 and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He is currently housed in a low-security prison in Florida. His story is well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> U.S. <b>mortgage</b> {{crisis of}} <b>the</b> late 2000s had a {{powerful}} impact on Richmond.

On average, homeowners with mortgages were indebted for about 45% more than the original value of their homes. McLaughlin mounted a unique and highly controversial effort to gain control of <b>the</b> <b>mortgages.</b> <b>The</b> city, in partnership with a private financing company, would seek to purchase mortgages from banks at fair market value and then allow the homeowners to refinance for a minimal fee. If the banks refused, the city would seize <b>the</b> <b>mortgages</b> using <b>the</b> legal power of eminent domain.|$|R

The {{complainants}} also claimed, under the stipulations of <b>the</b> <b>mortgages,</b> <b>the</b> amount of certain premiums of insurance paid by them. By an amended bill making the mayor and aldermen of Jersey City a defendant, the complainants alleged that the city claimed a lien on <b>the</b> <b>mortgaged</b> premises prior to that of <b>the</b> <b>mortgages</b> for certain water rents for supplying water to the occupants of {{the same for the}} year 1871, and from thence to the time of filing the bill; that this claim was made under an act of the legislature time of filing the bill; that this claim authorizing the construction of waterworks for the city, and the act revising the city charter, passed in March 1871. The bill denied the validity of this claim, and averred that those portions of the said acts which purported to give such a priority had the effect to deprive the complainant of its property in <b>the</b> <b>mortgaged</b> premises without due process of law, and were in violation of the Constitution of the United States {{as well as that of}} New Jersey, and the complainant prayed for a foreclosure and sale of the lot in question as against all the defendants.|$|R
