25|$|For {{the lower}} basses it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more control to turn quickly. Cleaning turns for a bassline can be rather easy. They should lead with the {{shoulder}} {{at the start of}} the turn and lock the other direction on a specified count. Setting a check-point can help. For instance, one should be flat front on count two of the turn. However, note that the turn should be smooth and not jerky. A common problem may result from not stopping the weight of the drum at the end of the turn and letting the momentum get the better of the player. The solution to that problem involves tightening the core (abdominals and back muscles).|$|E
25|$|The driverless tractor is {{considered}} controversial {{in terms of}} safety and public acceptance. A tractor operating without a driver makes some people nervous. Creating technology that stays safe in all scenarios where failure could possibly occur <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of programming and time. In terms of motion detection, the tractors have sensors to stop them if they detect objects in their path such as people, animals, vehicles or other large objects. In 2004, researchers from the Danish Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University published a paper in which they examined {{the safety of a}} driverless tractor in detail. With their driverless tractor, they had one person designated as a safety operator. This operator controlled a switch which could immediately shut down and halt the tractor. They also wired four emergency stop switches on each corner of the tractor.|$|E
25|$|Distanced from Portugal {{after the}} seventeenth century Goans, like the people of Macão and Timor, Goans had been left much to their own affairs with {{a higher degree of}} independence, {{although}} still a part of Portugal. Goans moved considerably {{to other parts of the}} Portuguese Empire, and metropolitan Portugal and it is possible to find Goans with roots in America, Africa, Europe as well as Asia. After 450 years of being a part of Portugal, during the first post-Liberation years, Goans found it difficult to embrace their new status as part of India and many emigrated to other nations (predominately western), a trend that often continues to date. However, Goan-Catholics in India today are proud of their Portuguese-Indian Catholic culture, their Konkani language and their role in modern multi-religious India. However many aspects of their social and religious life are deeply enshrined in their exquisite western heritage. For instance they celebrate Carnival (western practice) before lent and their religious scripture (Catholic church) is only written and conducted in the Latin script. Even their language <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> from Portuguese in terms of syntax or loan words.|$|E
