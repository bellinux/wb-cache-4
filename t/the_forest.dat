5|$|Adams and {{the lands}} {{surrounding}} it were initially set aside {{as part of}} the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve under the Department of the Interior in 1897. Eight years later, in 1905, the Bureau of Forestry, later <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> Service, was created under the Department of Agriculture and all <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> Reserves were transferred to the new agency. In 1907, <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> Reserves were renamed to National Forests and in 1908, the Rainier National Forest was divided among three Forests. The southern half became the Columbia National Forest. The name was changed in 1949 to honor the first Chief of <b>the</b> <b>Forest,</b> Gifford Pinchot. In 1964, the lands around Mount Adams were set aside as a wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators that live in <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species are present in <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E

They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> itself.

5|$|During 1166, Neville was {{in charge}} of Staffordshire for the general eyre {{undertaken}} in that year, and also tried the pleas of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> for Devonshire and Worcestershire, and perhaps elsewhere. The abbot of Battle Abbey in 1167 sent a monk to plead with Waleran of Meulan to intervene and stop Neville's exactions on the abbot's manors. After the Revolt of 1173–74, Neville {{was in charge}} of a forest eyre held from 1176 to 1178 which resulted in fines totaling 12,000 pounds from breaches of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> law during the revolt.

5|$|Elk (also {{known as}} wapiti), mule deer, and {{pronghorn}} (also called pronghorn antelope) {{are some of}} the most commonly seen large mammals. During winter, pronghorn that spend the summer in the Sawtooth Valley migrate south to the lower elevations on the Snake River Plain, and some sections of <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> are closed to motorized use to protect the elk winter range. Bighorn sheep are rare sights in <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> contains one-third of Idaho's mountain goat population, and they are commonly seen at high elevations in the Boulder, White Cloud, Pioneer, and Sawtooth mountains.

5|$|Forests {{were special}} areas {{of land in}} medieval England, owned by the Crown and subject to forest law. They were often {{selected}} because of their natural resources, and were expected to provide the Crown with a flow of money or raw materials. In 1195, <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> of Dartmoor extended across all of Devon, but in 1204 John curtailed {{the extent of the}} royal forest, removing much of Devon from Forest Law and leaving the area known in the modern period as Dartmoor. This reduced forest was still subject to <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> Laws, involving a specialised group of legal officials who met at Lydford Castle to impose fines and other punishments. Probably both Lydford Castle and <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> was given to the Sheriff of Devon, William Brewer, in 1216. The arrangement changed under Henry III, when the estates were given to Richard, the Earl of Cornwall in 1239. Legally, this meant that <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> of Dartmoor was converted to a chase, although the Earls of Cornwall continued to hold law courts at Lydford Castle, enforcing chase laws that closely resembled the former Forest Laws.|$|E
