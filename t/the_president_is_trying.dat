2500|$|El Señor Presidente uses surrealistic {{techniques}} and reflects Asturias' notion that Indian's non-rational awareness of reality {{is an expression}} of subconscious forces. Although the author never specifies where the novel takes place, {{it is clear that the}} plot is influenced by Guatemalan president, and well-known dictator, Manuel Estrada Cabrera's rule. Asturias's novel examines how evil spreads downward from a powerful political leader, into the streets and homes of the citizens. Many themes, such as justice and love, are mocked in the novel, and escape from the dictator's tyranny is seemingly impossible. Each character within the novel is deeply affected by the dictatorship and must struggle to survive in a terrifying reality. The story opens with the accidental murder of a high official, Colonel Parrales Sonriente. The President uses the Colonel's death to dispose of two men as he decides to frame them both for the murder. The tactics of the President are often viewed as sadistic, as he believes his word is the law which no one shall question. The novel then travels with several characters, some close to the President and some seeking escape from his regime. The dictator's trusted adviser, whom the reader knows as [...] "Angel Face", falls in love with a General Canales's daughter, Camila. Also, Angel Face, under the direct order of the President, convinces General Canales that immediate flight is imperative. Unfortunately, the General is one of the two men <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to frame for murder; the President's plan to make General Canales appear guilty is to have him shot while fleeing. The General is hunted for execution while his daughter is held under house arrest by Angel Face. Angel Face is torn between his love for her and his duty to the President. While the Dictator is never named, he has striking similarities to Manuel Estrada Cabrera.|$|E

5000|$|Colonel Graham then reveals to Cletus {{that the}} President and [...] "Wild Bill" [...] Donovan would like Cletus {{to set up}} a {{civilian}} airline in Argentina, using surplus aircraft from the Army Air Corps. Donovan hopes the assets of the airline will be available for OSS use; Cletus Frade suspects <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to put pressure on Pan American-Grace Airways, which has a near monopoly on South American air travel. He nevertheless is able to form the airline in relatively short order, but staffs it with Argentine pilots and staff under pressure from the Argentine government, which makes it unlikely to be usable by the OSS.|$|E

50|$|Hacker, seeking {{revenge on}} the President for {{shutting}} down his business, uses {{a software program}} ("Hacker Hellstorm") to activate missile silos across the country. The President learns that the signal causing the activation of the silos originated from Canada, and summons Hacker. Hacker offers to sell a program to the President that can cancel out the Hellstorm — for $1 trillion. With only six minutes left, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to figure out what's going on. Stuart, {{fed up with the}} President being too busy to give Hacker the money, realizes that Hacker, getting up to leave, is the one controlling the silos, not Canada, and, after storming up, takes the operating codes from him required to stop the Hellstorm (accidentally killing Hacker in the process). The President orders Stuart's arrest, despite his protests that he is now able to give the codes to the President so they could deactivate the missiles which are aimed at Moscow. As the launch time approaches the President pleads with Canadian Prime Minister Clark MacDonald (Wallace Shawn) over the phone to stop the launch.|$|E

[...] "I don't remember the story we were reading — was it about pigs?" [...] says Williams, 16. [...] "But I'll always remember watching his face turn red. He got really serious all of a sudden.

5000|$|On August 3, Jindal {{appeared}} {{at a national}} televised forum, where he expressed his disillusion with what he called President Barack Obama trying to divide the country along with liberals, insisting that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to transform [...] "the American dream into the European nightmare", a phrase that he was noted to have used commonly. Jindal did not qualify for the first Republican debate on August 6, averaging in 13th place in the polls {{used to determine the}} invited candidates. Despite this, Jindal was allowed to participate in the undercard debate, his performance being seen as favorable by Michele Bachmann who claimed on Twitter after the debate that the millennials she watched the debate with were favorable of Jindal. After Scott Walker unveiled his health care plan on August 18, Jindal insisted that it was similar to the Affordable Care Act and one of his staffers was reported to as saying that Walker collaborated with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on the plan. On August 21, Jindal boasted that he displayed what he called [...] "videos uncovered" [...] from Planned Parenthood and furthered, [...] "I'm here to tell you Planned Parenthood should not get another dime of our taxpayer dollars." [...] On August 30, Jindal claimed that he was the only candidate in the Republican field that had reduced the size of the government and said allowing immigrants to not [...] "come here legally, learn English, adopt our values, roll up our sleeves and get to work" [...] was invasive.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their legislative capacity, {{the members of the}} two houses of parliament have the authority to impeach <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> who <b>is</b> then <b>tried</b> before the Constitutional Court, serving as State Court, or call for a referendum to have <b>the</b> federal <b>president</b> removed from office. Exertion of these emergency powers is a two-step process: first the National Council requests <b>the</b> <b>president</b> to <b>be</b> impeached or subjected to referendum, then the members of the National Council and the Federal Council convene in joint session, thus forming the National Assembly, and decide on the National Council's motion. If a referendum <b>is</b> held, and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> not removed from office by popular vote, he is automatically considered re-elected for another six-year term (although he may still not serve for more than twelve consecutive years). The National Council will then be dissolved automatically and new general elections must be held.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2012, Mitchell Kusick {{was arrested}} by the U.S. Secret Service at his parents' {{suburban}} Denver home after his mental health therapist told police {{that he wanted to}} kill <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> and had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to keep track of his visits to the Denver area. Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Hosley stated that the Secret Service stated they arrested him because [...] "they were concerned for the community's safety". [...] "It's clear to the court that the defendant has a severe mental illness," [...] U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Kristin Mix said in denying a request from Kusick's attorney to allow him to be released on bond that he had been diagnosed as having bipolar disorder and posed a [...] "risk to the community." [...] In August 2013, Kusick pleaded guilty and was later sentenced for the threats. After nine months in federal prison, he was released on time served. Kusick's release agreement includes three years of supervision and comprehensive mental health treatment. He must also live with his parents, both of whom are psychotherapists.|$|R
