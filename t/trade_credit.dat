25|$|In {{addition}} to its own specialist manufacturing role, Birmingham retained its position as the commercial and mercantile centre for an integrated regional economy that included the more basic manufacturing and raw material production areas of Staffordshire and Worcestershire. The demand for capital to feed rapid economic expansion saw the town become a major financial centre with extensive international connections. During the early 18th century finance was largely provided by the iron merchants and by extensive systems of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> between manufacturers; it was an iron merchant Sampson Lloyd and major manufacturer John Taylor who combined to form the town's first bank – the early Lloyds Bank – in 1765. Further establishments followed and by 1800 the West Midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in Britain, including London. Birmingham's booming economy gave the town a growing professional sector, {{with the number of}} physicians and lawyers increasing by 25% between 1767 and 1788. It has been estimated that between a quarter and a third of Birmingham's inhabitants could be thought of as middle class {{in the last quarter of}} the 18th century and this fuelled a large growth in the demand for tailors, mercers and drapers. Trade directories reveal that there more drapers than edge tool makers in 1767, and insurance records from 1777 to 1786 suggest that well over half of local businesses were engaged in the trading or service sectors rather than directly in industry.|$|E

Made available by its creditors, the main function of <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> is to facilitate cross-border transactions of goods and services. This study finds that the reliance of imports on <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> varies across regions and income: {{towards the end of}} the 1990 s, the <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> to imports ratio ranged from 0. 20 for East Asia & the Pacific to 0. 87 for Africa, and from 0. 24 for high-income countries to 0. 79 for low-income countries. Applying panel and cross-country estimation, we find that past <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> help predict current imports, but past imports do not alter the future path of <b>trade</b> <b>credits.</b> Further, the positive association between <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> and imports is larger for countries more dependent upon <b>trade</b> <b>credits.</b> The findings support the notion that countries make debt repayments to avoid any potential disruption on the line of <b>trade</b> <b>credits.</b> We also find that the <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> penalty could materialize within less than two quarters.

This is surprising, as <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> are generally more expensive than bank credits and thus a costly substitute for bank financing. In this paper, we investigate the relation between <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> and bank credits for exporting firms.

Using panel data on German manufacturing firms, we provide supportive evidence for our theoretical predictions.

Related instruments were the provision of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> to suppliers {{in order to secure}} favored access to raw materials (Dutch merchants routinely bought up grain harvests in the Baltic area and grape harvests in France, important in the wine trade, [...] before they were harvested) and the financing of commodity trade with bills of exchange, which helped bind customers to the merchant.|$|E

From that base, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) [...] "founded, financed, trained and equipped Hezbollah to operate as a proxy army" [...] for Iran. Some analysts believe the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran was heavily involved in the bomb attacks and that a major factor leading it to orchestrate {{the attacks on the}} barracks was America's support for Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War and its extending of $2.5 billion in <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> to Iraq while halting the shipments of arms to Iran. A few weeks before the bombing, Iran warned that providing armaments to Iran's enemies would provoke retaliatory punishment. On September 26, 1983, [...] "the National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted an Iranian diplomatic communications message from the Iranian intelligence agency, the Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS)," [...] to its ambassador, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, in Damascus.

He was a determined enemy both to Roman influence and to French ascendancy. As {{he wrote in}} a memorandum in the summer of 1677 an English Minister must consider [...] only how England's interests stand, and all considerations including trade, religion [...] and public opinion pointed to the Dutch Republic, not France, as the desired [...] ally. He terminated the war with the Dutch Republic in 1674, and from that time maintained a friendly correspondence with William of Orange. In 1677, after two years of tedious negotiations, he overcame all obstacles, and in spite of James's opposition, and without the knowledge of Louis XIV, effected the marriage between William and Mary that was the germ of the Revolution and the Act of Settlement. This national policy, however, could only be pursued, and the minister could only maintain himself in power, by acquiescence in the king's personal relations with the king of France settled by the Treaty of Dover in 1670, which included Charles's acceptance of a pension, and bound him to a policy exactly opposite to Danby's, one furthering French and Roman ascendancy.|$|E
40|$|In {{advanced}} market economies, {{the use of}} <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> is {{an important}} way of short-term financing and generally considered as being part of normal business practice. Some transition economies, however, have experienced a rapid accumulation of <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> which have led to interlocking webs of arrears and collective bailouts by the government. In this paper, firm-level data is used to test whether <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> are just part of normal business practice comparable to more advanced market-economies or whether <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> represent a systematic phenomena supporting soft budget constraints of firms in transition. The results suggest that <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> are not just normal business practice but {{that they can have}} negative spill-over effects on other firms by worsening their financial situation.

40|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>credits</b> {{represent}} {{an important source}} of financing for all corporations. Rajan and Zingales (1995) report close to 40 % of debt financing occurs through the use of <b>trade</b> <b>credits.</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>credits</b> can be, however, a very expensive form of debt financing. The oft-mentioned 2 - 10 net 30 contracts (a 2 % discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise all is due in 30 days) represents an equivalent 45 % annual interest rate. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present a new theory as to why <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> are so expensive compared to bank financing, and why <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> are nonetheless such important sources of financing. Although bank financing is superior, it could happen that this source of financing is restricted so that firms in need of financing must look somewhere else. The theory I present is based on the assumption that non-financial firms are unable to commit credibly to auditing a borrower who declares bankruptcy in contrast to banks that can commit. In a world where entrepreneurs have private information as to the state of the world, I show that being unable to commit to verifying the true state of the world − which presumably resembles the situation of vendor financing − generates a higher interest rate on the loan than if the creditor could commit − which presumably resembles the situation of bank financing. Not only can the model predict why <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> bare a higher interest rate, it also supports predicst borrowers that rely on <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> use more outside financing...|$|R

They studied relevant data over time for seven countries for which data were available: Argentina, Brazil, Egypt,India, Kenya, Mexico, and Turkey.
