5|$|In 2004, {{video game}} website GameSpot {{reported}} that Duke Nukem Forever had {{switched to the}} Doom 3 engine. Many gaming news sites mailed Broussard, asking him to confirm or deny <b>the</b> <b>rumor.</b> After receiving no answer from him, they published <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> as fact, but Broussard explicitly denied <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> soon after. Soon after 3D Realms replaced the game's Karma physics system with one designed by Meqon, a relatively unknown Swedish firm. Closed-doors demonstrations of the technology suggested that the physics of Duke Nukem Forever would be a step up from the critically acclaimed Half-Life 2. Rumors suggested that the game would appear at 2005 E3. While 3D Realms' previously canceled Prey made an appearance, the rumors of Duke Nukem Forevers appearance proved false.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{was planned}} that some key {{scenes of the}} episode would be filmed without an {{audience}} {{in order to avoid}} leaks of plot spoilers, the producers decided not to worry about the issue and filmed it all in front of the live studio audience.

40|$|This article {{examines}} <b>the</b> <b>rumors</b> about President Barack Obama which {{accused him of}} being Muslim, unpatriotic, and a terrorist sympathizer. Despite ample evidence that <b>the</b> <b>rumors</b> were patently false, on Election Day, fully 10 % of the voters continued to believe that he was Muslim. In addition, many continued to harbor the pernicious racial, socio-ethnic, and religious biases that shaped <b>the</b> <b>rumors.</b> This article asks, and answers “why” <b>the</b> <b>rumors</b> persisted. This article provides an answer from a unique communication theory perspective. This article first mines the sources of <b>the</b> Obama <b>rumors,</b> and how those rumors were amplified in the media. Next, using semiotic concepts, the article illuminates how <b>the</b> Obama <b>rumors</b> played upon themes of patriotism, “American-ness,” race, and Islamophobia. This article then takes its most novel approach by setting forth <b>the</b> contours of <b>rumor</b> communication, and <b>the</b> central role quotidian hermeneutics played in embedding <b>the</b> Obama <b>rumors.</b> “Quotidian hermeneutics” is a method by which to analyze everyday conversations. Specifically, conversations amongst in-group members have an underappreciated impact on voters’ source of information and voting decisions. By examining the characteristics and conversational properties of rumors, this article demonstrates how peer groups engaged in quotidian discourse helped re-frame, mediate, and reinforce <b>the</b> Obama <b>rumors.</b> <b>The</b> value of this article lies in two facts: first, <b>the</b> <b>rumors</b> of Obama’s Muslim allegiances were believed in numbers sufficient to tip the election. Second, with regards to issue-based decision making, interpersonal communication represents a significant source of political information and voter influence. Thus, what likely voters discussed in everyday conversation, and how they discussed <b>the</b> Obama <b>rumors</b> provides one answer as to why <b>the</b> Obama <b>rumors</b> persisted...|$|R

Mills was secretly accessing the White House via the purported passage to meet with President Herbert Hoover.|$|E
5|$|Irwin was {{president}} of the American League of Professional Football (ALPF) for its lone season in 1894. The organization represented the first American professional soccer league. Teams in the league were named after their MLB counterparts in the same cities. Some of the active baseball managers served as coaches for the soccer teams, and fans were sometimes enticed by <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> of MLB players who might participate in the league. Irwin was also involved in an attempt to popularize roller polo.|$|E
2500|$|A 2004 book by Lauren Slater, {{entitled}} [...] {{caused a}} stir by mentioning <b>the</b> <b>rumors</b> that Skinner had used his baby daughter, Deborah, {{in some of his}} experiments, and that she had subsequently committed suicide.

5|$|Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player takes {{control of a}} group of characters exploring the fictional city of Sumaru. The camera follows the party from an adjustable angled overhead perspective. The city in general is navigated using an overworld map. A key element to the story and gameplay is <b>the</b> <b>Rumor</b> system: after the characters hear a rumor, they can spread that rumor around the city using certain characters, and those rumors can grant the characters special items or other positive or negative effects.|$|E
5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper financial benefits from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> was that McElhenny essentially took a pay cut {{when he left the}} university to play for the 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E
5|$|Cagney became {{president}} of the Screen Actors Guild in 1942 for a two-year term. He took a role in the Guild's fight against the Mafia, which had begun to take an active interest in the movie industry.

Cagney alleged that, having failed to scare off the Guild and him, they sent a hitman to kill him by dropping a heavy light onto his head. Upon hearing of <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> of a hit, George Raft made a call, and the hit was supposedly canceled.|$|E

5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted {{that he may have}} been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur from the town of Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded <b>the</b> <b>rumor,</b> and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, {{descendants}} of Edwin Booth {{reported that they}} obtained permission to exhume the Shakespearean actor's body to obtain DNA samples to compare {{with a sample of}} his brother John's DNA to refute <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> that John had escaped after the assassination. Bree Harvey, a spokesman from the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts where Edwin Booth is buried, denied reports that the family had contacted them and requested to exhume Edwin's body. The family hoped to obtain samples of John Wilkes's DNA from remains such as vertebrae stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland. On March 30, 2013, museum spokeswoman Carol Johnson announced that the family's request to extract DNA from the vertebrae had been rejected.|$|E
5|$|Major Francis L.

Dade, two companies of soldiers, and all of the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at Tampa Bay, the port designated for the commencement of the Indians' emigration. The Indians answered by concentrating all of their forces in the New River region. On December 28, 1835, Dade and 107soldiers were ambushed en route from Tampa Bay to Fort King, near present-day Ocala. Only three soldiers survived; the attackers lost only three men.|$|E

5|$|Some Gabonese mistakenly {{identified}} the United States as a co-conspirator in the coup. Time asserted that French officials helped spread <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> of American involvement.

5|$|With {{the release}} of Age Ain't Nothing but a Number, rumors {{circulated}} of a relationship between Aaliyah and R. Kelly. Shortly after, there was speculation about a secret marriage with {{the release of}} Age Ain't Nothing but a Number and the adult content that Kelly had written for Aaliyah. Vibe magazine later revealed a marriage certificate that listed the couple married on August 31, 1994, in Sheraton Gateway Suites in Rosemont, Illinois. Aaliyah, who was 15 at the time, was listed as 18 on the certificate; the illegal marriage was annulled in February 1995 by her parents. The pair continued to deny marriage allegations, stating that neither was married. One particular allegation among <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> was that Aaliyah wedded R. Kelly without her parents' knowledge.|$|E
5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} {{had left the}} county to search for armed resistance {{in other parts of}} Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by the arrests. It is likely that <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated claims by Republicans that the cabin was a fort. A structure that may have once been this cabin was rediscovered on July 13, 2007. In December 1864, the soldiers who left Columbia County went on to Clearfield County to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders.|$|E

5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E
5|$|Parkman also {{believed}} that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were stirring up the Native Americans {{in order to make}} trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. (<b>The</b> <b>rumor</b> of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years' War were still in circulation in some Native villages.) Rather than the French stirring up the Native Americans, some historians now argue that the Native Americans were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Native alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. All of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native—not French—objectives.|$|E
