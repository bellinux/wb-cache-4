In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H.

50|$|The Prescribed Rate of Interest Act now governs {{claims for}} {{the payment of}} {{interest}}. In terms of the Act, interest at the prescribed rate is payable on any debt that bears interest, unless the rate of interest {{is set in the}} contract or by a <b>trade</b> <b>custom.</b> The Act also provides for interest to run on unliquidated debts from the time of demand or summons, whichever is earlier. The amount on which the interest is calculated is the amount as finally determined by court or in arbitration. The Act also provides for payment of mora interest on judgment debts where such debts would ordinarily not be interest-bearing. Although it is possible and permitted to arrive at an independent interest rate in the contract, this is subject to the test of reasonableness.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} 13th century German {{settlers}} were recruited by Duke Leszek I the White to settle the Neumark. After he died in 1227, the Polish central government collapsed, allowing the Margraves of Brandenburg to expand eastwards. They acquired land east of the Oder and expanded their domain further east to the river Drawa and north to the river Persante. In 1257, John I founded the town of Landsberg (now called [...] ) as an alternative river crossng across the Warta, competing with the crossing in the Polish town of Santok, detracting from the considerable revenues Santok made from foreign <b>trade</b> (<b>custom</b> duties, fees from the market operation and storage fees), {{similar to the way}} Berlin had been founded to compete with Köpenick. In 1261, the Margraves purchased Myślibórz ( [...] Soldin) from the Knights Templar and began developing the town to their power center in the Neumark.|$|E

5000|$|To the Aztecs {{themselves}} the word [...] "aztec" [...] {{was not an}} endonym for any particular ethnic group. Rather it was an umbrella term {{used to refer to}} several ethnic groups, not all of them Nahuatl speaking, that claimed heritage from the mythic place of origin, Aztlan. In the Nahuatl language [...] "aztecatl" [...] means [...] "person from Aztlan". In 1810 Alexander von Humboldt originated the modern usage of [...] "Aztec" [...] as a collective term applied to all the people linked by <b>trade,</b> <b>custom,</b> religion, and language to the Mexica state and the Triple Alliance. In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H.

40|$|Since 1999, Serbia {{inhibited}} Kosovo’s {{independence in}} many ways: it issued Serbian passports for Serbs from the North; it deprived Prishtina from access to local land registers {{and other documents}} removed to Belgrade; it limited telecommunication services and electricity to Kosovo. Finally, following Kosovo’s independence in 2008, Serbia banned entrance to goods from Kosovo. All these acts had political consequences, for between daily technical issues and politics there is often only a moot distinction. Yet the import ban issue eventually turned into a political dispute par excellence. <b>Trade,</b> <b>custom</b> stamps and checkpoint control arguments are being (ab) used as alibi to cover for the real geopolitical interest of both sides: the North of Kosovo, a region populated by some 60, 000 Serbs constantly rejecting Prishtina’s authority...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to verify the}} hypothesis that Romanian exports to the Russian Federation are below their potential. We first looked at statistical data regarding bilateral <b>trade,</b> <b>custom</b> duties and foreign direct investment; the resulting conclusions support our hypothesis. Further, we use a gravity equation, in order to forecast Romanian exports {{to a number of}} 43 countries, accounting for a sizeable share of total exports, covering a world-wide area using data series {{over a period of time}} between 1993 and 2008. Based on the gravity equation, we calculated export potential of Romania to the Russian Federation, being interested in the long run trade dynamics potential. We made the comparison between potential and real trade for the year 2008, being in fact interested in what export would have been in 2008 if during all the period studied (1993 - 2007) trade would have followed the gravity patterns. We conclude that if the Romanian exports to the Russian Federation would have perfectly fitted the general “gravity pattern”, the level of exports to the country would stand at 2, 317 current billion dollars, which is 2. 58 times higher than the registered level. From an economic point of view, these results can be interpreted, in the context of our broader analysis, as a good indicator that the opportunities in the Russian Federation market are still undervaluated by Romanian exporters and the rest of stakeholders in the exportation process.

40|$|Anglophone African {{countries}} have been implementing reform and modernization initiatives in their Customs administrations. This paper outlines the progression of key reform and modernization initiatives in these countries since the early 1990 s, and assesses the gap between these reforms and those of more modern Customs agencies. The review suggests that Customs administration reform and modernization initiatives in Anglophone African countries generally lag behind international good practice and {{it is necessary to}} speed up implementation if revenue, trade facilitation, and trade chain security objectives are to be achieved. The findings also have implications on the design of reform programs and focus of potential technical assistance for the outstanding reform agenda.

Among their most important uses are analyzing developments in the trade balance, measuring foreign prices'' contribution to domestic inflation, and deflating nominal values of exports and imports for estimating the volume of gross domestic product. This paper discusses the main uses of trade indices and the data sources used to compile them.
