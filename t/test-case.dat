40|$|Abstract—The {{verification}} of a system-on-chip is challenging {{due to its}} high level of integration. Multiple components in a system can behave concurrently and compete for resources. Hence, for simulation-based verification, we need a methodol-ogy that allows automatic generation of <b>test-cases</b> for testing concurrent and resource-competing behaviors. We introduce the use of transfer-resource graph (TRG) {{as the model for}} test generation. From a high abstraction level, TRG is able to model the parallelism between heterogeneous interaction forms in a system. We show how TRG is used in generating <b>test-cases</b> of resource-competitions and how these <b>test-cases</b> are structured in event-driven test-programs. For coverage, TRG can be converted to a Petri-net, allowing the measurement of completeness of concurrency in simulation. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} for the verification of systems with unspecified components. In our approach, some model-checking problems concerning a component-based system are first reduced to the emptiness problem of an oracle finite automaton, which is then solved by testing the unspecified components on-the-fly with <b>test-cases</b> generated automatically from the oracle finite automaton. The generated <b>test-cases</b> are of bounded length, and with a properly chosen bound, a complete and sound solution is immediate. Particularly, the whole verification process {{can be carried out}} in an automatic way. In the paper, a symbolic algorithm is given for generating <b>test-cases</b> and performing the testings, and an example is drawn from an TinyOS application to illustrate our approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In testing {{software}} components, choosing appropriate <b>test-cases</b> is {{a difficult}} task. Not only input data must be identified that results in different behavior of the component under test, but also the resultant high number of <b>test-cases</b> must be handled. This work describes a method for selecting test input data by dividing the input parameter value domains into equivalence classes and {{reducing the number of}} resultant <b>test-cases</b> by applying a pair-wise coverage of parameters values. That way, a minimal number of testcases can be generated that already provides coverage of standard test methods to a high degree and finds a significant number of errors. The described method was implemented and used for automating the testing of automotive systems.

40|$|Abstract. The {{size of a}} test-suite has {{a direct}} impact on the costs and the effort of {{software}} testing. Especially during regression testing, when software is re-tested after some modifications, the size of the test-suite is important. Common test-suite reduction techniques select subsets of test-suites that achieve given test requirements. Unfortunately, not only the test-suite size but also the fault detection ability is reduced as a consequence. This paper proposes a novel approach where <b>test-cases</b> created with model-checker based techniques are transformed such that redundancy within the test-suite is avoided, and the overall size is reduced. As <b>test-cases</b> are not simply discarded, the impact on the fault sensitivity is minimal. ...|$|R

Most often, tuning is ad hoc and this makes it difficult to ensure that any comparison between methods is unbiased. We propose to consider the evaluation of the performance of a method with respect to its hyperparameters as a computer experiment, and to achieve tuning via global optimization based on Kriging and Expected Improvement. This approach is applied to several residual-evaluation (or change-detection) algorithms on classical <b>test-cases.</b> Simulation results show the interest, practicability and performance of this methodology, which should facilitate the automatic tuning of the hyperparameters of a method and allow a fair comparison of a collection of methods on a given set of <b>test-cases.</b> The computational cost turns out to be much lower than the one obtained with other general-purpose optimization methods such as genetic algorithms...|$|R
