5|$|Commentary on {{the album}} has {{included}} discussion of its minimal instrumentation and the interjection of unexpected sounds. Reviewers have described the lyrics on the songs as unconventional and dark, and noted the prominence of vocal harmonies between the Deal sisters. The reception of Title TK has been generally positive; appraisal has included commendation for Albini's contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album, and for how the recordings isolate individual instruments.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the song the sun slowly rises and the lyrics can be {{interpreted}} as a proclamation of the hope that as the sky clears after a difficult night, all the world's people will rise together to proclaim their survival <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church bells.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} Hope holds a broken lyre, {{based on an}} ancient Athenian wood and {{tortoiseshell}} lyre then {{on display in the}} British Museum. Although broken musical instruments were a frequently occurring motif in European art, they had never previously been associated with Hope. Hope's lyre has only a single string remaining, on which she attempts to play. She strains to listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single unbroken string, symbolising both persistence and fragility, and the closeness of hope and despair. Watts had recently shown interest in the idea of a continuity between the visual arts and music, and had previously made use of musical instruments as a way to invigorate the subjects of his portraits.|$|E
5|$|The Chimes {{shopping}} centre was built beside Uxbridge station in 2001, incorporating {{many of the}} existing buildings into the new structure. The centre was originally to be named St George's Centre in plans {{dating back to the}} early 1990s, though this name was eventually taken by another {{shopping centre}} in Harrow on the Hill. Instead, The Chimes was said to refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bells from the nearby market house on the High Street. An Odeon cinema opened as {{a major part of the}} centre, with the smaller cinema at the opposite end of the High Street closing. Some houses on Chippendale Way and the St George's car park were demolished to allow for the construction of the new shopping centre car park. The offices of the local building company Fassnidge were also included in the new development; built in the 19th century, they now house a Pizza Express restaurant. Preserved timber from earlier demolished buildings in Uxbridge was used in the construction of a new building beside the former offices of Fassnidge, designed to resemble a much older structure.|$|E

5|$|Weizsäcker {{took office}} {{for his second}} presidential term on 1 July 1989, {{and in the course}} of it he oversaw the end of the Cold War and the Reunification of Germany. Thereupon, Weizsäcker became the first all-German Head of State since Karl Dönitz in May 1945. At midnight on 3 October 1990, during the {{official}} festivities held before the Reichstag building in Berlin to mark the moment of the reunification of Germany, President Weizsäcker delivered the only speech of the night, immediately after the raising of the flag, and before the playing of the National Anthem. His brief remarks, however, were almost inaudible, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bells marking midnight, and of the fireworks that were released to celebrate the moment of reunification. In those remarks he praised the accomplishment of German unity in freedom and in peace. He gave a longer speech at the act of state at the Berliner Philharmonie later that day.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, due {{to years}} of wear and tear, the {{original}} concert stage floor was replaced {{at a cost of}} $250,000. In order to avoid any change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall, the new floor was built using same methods and materials as the original. These included tongue-in-groove, three-quarter inch, hard maple boards, a compressed wool underlayment and hardened steel cut nails, hammered in by hand. The vertical grain fir subfloor from 1899 was in excellent shape and was left in place. The nails used in the new floor were hand cut using the same size and construction as the originals and the back channelling on the original maple top boards was replicated as well.|$|E

25|$|The play {{concerns}} {{an aristocratic}} Russian landowner who {{returns to her}} family estate (which includes a large and well-known cherry orchard) just before it is auctioned to pay the mortgage. Unresponsive to offers to save the estate, she allows its sale to {{the son of a}} former serf; the family leaves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cherry orchard being cut down. The story presents themes of cultural futility – both the futile attempts of the aristocracy to maintain its status and of the bourgeoisie to find meaning in its newfound materialism. It dramatises the socio-economic forces in Russia {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, including the rise of the middle class after the abolition of serfdom in the mid-19th century and the decline of the power of the aristocracy.|$|E

Calcutta was forced to strike, but not before she had bought time for the convoy to escape. Moucheron was in the vicinity and sailed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guns. She then proceeded to cruise with Allemand’s squadron, which paid her no attention as she was flying an American flag. Moucheron counted the French ships and then, having completed her reconnaissance, sailed to notify Admiral Lord Cornwallis at Brest. However, by the time Cornwallis arrived {{at the spot where}} Moucheron had left Allemand, he had left.|$|E
