5|$|Since first {{coming to}} wide {{notice in the}} late 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>Harry</b> Potter book series by J. K. Rowling has engendered a number of legal disputes. Rowling, her various {{publishers}} and Time Warner, {{the owner of the}} rights to <b>the</b> <b>Harry</b> Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyrights, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves. The worldwide popularity of <b>the</b> <b>Harry</b> Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them. While these legal proceedings have countered a number of cases of outright piracy, other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised.|$|E

50|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Harrying</b> of <b>the</b> North Bedale {{was held}} by Torpin (Thorfinn), a patronym {{retained}} by the infamous Dick Turpin. The parish church also dates from this time (as evidenced by its crypt), before significant remodelling. The original 9th century church escaped destruction in <b>the</b> <b>Harrying</b> of <b>the</b> North and was recorded in the Domesday Book. The recent discovery of the Bedale Hoard provides further evidence of high-status Anglo-Saxon and Viking age activity in the area. The town was recorded as Bedell or Bedhal and derives from 'Beda's Halh' which means the corner or place of Beda.|$|R
