40|$|Experiences {{of verbal}} sexual {{coercion}} are common and have potential for negative consequences, yet {{are not well}} understood. This study used qualitative and descriptive statistics to examine verbal sexual coercion experiences among a community sample of 114 women and explored the role of sexual precedence in these experiences. Analyses revealed that sexual precedence {{plays an important role}} in determining how these experiences come about and why women acquiesce to unwanted intercourse. Verbal persuasion and persistence were the most commonly reported tactics. The valence of this verbal persuasion differed qualitatively <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>precedence</b> status, with those having a history of sexual precedence using negative persuasion (e. g., threats to relationship) and those with no precedence relying on positive messages (e. g., sweet talk). Most women used direct verbal resistance to indicate their unwillingness to have sex, regardless of precedence status. Women’s reasons for compliance and consequences differed qualitatively <b>according</b> <b>to</b> sexual <b>precedence</b> status. Legal statutes inmany states define rape as unwanted sexual intercourse that occurs as a result of force or threat of force or the inability of the victim to consent. In contrast, many women report unwanted or coerced sexual experiences in which theywerenot physically forcedbut rather chose to ca...|$|R

2500|$|Officials at Rideau Hall have {{attempted}} to use the Letters Patent of 1947 as justification for describing the governor general as head of state. However, the document makes no such distinction, nor does it effect an abdication of the sovereign's powers in favour of the viceroy, as it only allows the governor general to [...] "act on The Queen's behalf". Michael D. Jackson, former protocol officer for Saskatchewan, argued that Rideau Hall had been attempting to [...] "recast" [...] the governor general as head of state since the 1970s and doing so preempted both the Queen {{and all of the}} lieutenant governors. This caused not only [...] "precedence wars" [...] at provincial events (where the governor general usurped the lieutenant governor's proper spot as most senior official in attendance) and Governor General Adrienne Clarkson <b>to</b> <b>accord</b> herself <b>precedence</b> before the Queen at a national occasion, but also constitutional issues by [...] "unbalancing... the federalist symmetry".

The proposed approach is tested against six benchmark ALB problems suggested by Scholl and one real-world ALB problem.
