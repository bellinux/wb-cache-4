50|$|Most Pseudomonas spp. are {{naturally}} resistant to penicillin {{and the majority}} of related beta-lactam antibiotics, but a number are sensitive to piperacillin, imipenem, <b>ticarcillin,</b> or ciprofloxacin. Aminoglycosides such as tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin are other choices for therapy.|$|E
50|$|Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, or co-ticarclav, is a {{combination}} antibiotic consisting of <b>ticarcillin,</b> a β-lactam antibiotic, and clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor. This combination results in an antibiotic with an increased spectrum of action and restored efficacy against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria that produce certain β-lactamases.|$|E
50|$|Another {{development}} {{of the line of}} true penicillins was the antipseudomonal penicillins, such as carbenicillin, <b>ticarcillin,</b> and piperacillin, useful for their activity against Gram-negative bacteria. However, the usefulness of the β-lactam ring was such that related antibiotics, including the mecillinams, the carbapenems and, most important, the cephalosporins, still retain it at the center of their structures.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, <b>ticarcillin</b> {{is used to}} as {{an alternative}} to ampicillin to test the uptake of marker genes into bacteria. It prevents the appearance of satellite colonies that occur when ampicillin breaks down in the medium. It is also used in plant molecular biology to kill Agrobacterium, which is used to deliver genes to plant cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ticarcillin</b> is a carboxypenicillin. It {{is almost}} {{invariably}} sold {{and used in}} combination with clavulanate as Timentin. Because it is a penicillin, it also falls within the larger class of beta-lactam antibiotics. Its main clinical use is as an injectable antibiotic {{for the treatment of}} Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It {{is also one of the}} few antibiotics capable of treating Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple-week {{antibiotic}} therapies have cured actinomycotic infections {{caused by}} A. viscosus in every recorded case. Therapies include treatment with penicillin, sulfadimethoxine, flucloxacillin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and <b>ticarcillin.</b> A. viscosus is usually resistant to vancomycin, metronidazole, cefalexin, and dicloxacillin. Treatments last {{at least three}} weeks, with some exceptions. Although A. viscosus is difficult to distinguish from other closely related actinomycetes, the general determination of being an actinomycete is sufficient for treatment of infections.|$|E
50|$|S. maltophilia {{is not a}} virulent {{organism}} {{and removal}} of the infected prosthesis is frequently sufficient to cure the infection; antibiotics are only required if the prosthesis cannot be removed. Many strains of S. maltophilia are sensitive to co-trimoxazole and <b>ticarcillin,</b> though resistance has been increasing. It is not usually susceptible to piperacillin, and susceptibility to ceftazidime is variable. Tigecycline is also an effective drug. Polymyxin B may be effective treatment, at least in vitro, though not without frequent adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of BCC {{involves}} culturing {{the bacteria}} from clinical specimens, such as sputum or blood. BCC organisms are naturally resistant to many common antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and polymyxin B. and {{this fact is}} exploited {{in the identification of}} the organism. The organism is usually cultured in Burkholderia cepacia agar (BC agar) which contains crystal violet and bile salts to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive cocci and <b>ticarcillin</b> and polymyxin B to inhibit the growth of other Gram-negative bacilli. It also contains phenol red pH indicator which turns pink when it reacts with alkaline byproducts generated by the bacteria when it grows.|$|E
50|$|Carbenicillin {{is used in}} {{the clinic}} {{primarily}} because of its low toxicity and its utility in treating urinary tract infections due to susceptible Pseudomonas species. Its low potency, low oral activity, and susceptibility to bacterial beta-lactamases make it vulnerable to replacement by agents without these deficits. One contender in this race is ticaricillin. Its origin depended on the well-known fact that a divalent sulfur is roughly equivalent to a vinyl group (cf methiopropamine, sufentanil, pizotyline etc.).One synthesis began by making the monobenzyl ester of 3-Thienylmalonic acid, converting this to the acid chloride with SOCl2, and condensing it with 6-Aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA). Hydrogenolysis (Pd/C) completed the synthesis of <b>ticarcillin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{available}} parenteral antimicrobials {{for most}} infections are metronidazole, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, a penicillin (i.e. <b>ticarcillin,</b> ampicillin, piperacillin) and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e. clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam), and a carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, ertapenem). An antimicrobial effective against Gram-negative enteric bacilli (i.e. aminoglycoside) or an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin (i.e. cefepime [...] ) are generally added to metronidazole, and occasionally cefoxitin when treating intra-abdominal infections to provide coverage for these organisms. Clindamycin {{should not be}} used as a single agent as empiric therapy for abdominal infections. Penicillin can be added to metronidazole in treating of intracranial, pulmonary and dental infections to provide coverage against microaerophilic streptococci, and Actinomyces.|$|E
50|$|Antibiotics {{are almost}} {{universal}} in semen extenders, especially those {{being used for}} shipping or freezing semen. <b>Ticarcillin</b> (often used in combination with clavulanic acid under the designation timentin), amikacin sulfate, penicillin, and gentamicin are commonly used. The latter - gentamicin - has been noted to reduce sperm motility in the equine. In human semen extenders, antibiotics are required for regulatory reasons, so their use is almost universal in clinics, even though antibiotics can be detrimental to sperm. This is because in procedures such as IVF with frozen sperm the sperm {{do not need to}} swim up the reproductive tract on their own, and the detrimental effects of the antibiotics are not problematic. When private donors ship chilled semen outside of the formal regulatory environment, and fertilization is accomplished by allowing sperm to swim through the reproductive tract without the help of procedures such as IVF, then it is possible to achieve better results without antibiotics.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ticarcillin</b> {{has proved}} to be two- to {{fourfold}} more active than carbenicillin against most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although susceptibility of the Enterobacteriaceae to <b>ticarcillin</b> could be predicted from results obtained with carbenicillin disks, neither the 50 -μg nor the 100 -μg carbenicillin disk proved suitable for testing susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to <b>ticarcillin.</b> Forty-three percent of Pseudomonas strains judged to be resistant to carbenicillin by the 100 -μg carbenicillin disk were susceptible to <b>ticarcillin</b> by agar dilution studies. Results obtained with a 75 -μg <b>ticarcillin</b> disk showed excellent correlation between zone size and <b>ticarcillin</b> minimal inhibitory concentration values and produced good discrimination between resistant and susceptible strains of Pseudomonas as determined by agar dilution studies. Using a 75 -μg <b>ticarcillin</b> disk, a zone size of 12 to 14 mm was appropriate for designating intermediate susceptibility, and a zone {{greater than or equal to}} 15 mm was appropriate for designating susceptible strains of both P. aeruginosa and the Enterobacteriaceae...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} and human pharmacology of <b>ticarcillin,</b> a semisynthetic penicillin more active than carbenicillin against Pseudomonas, were compared. There {{has been no}} increase in resistance to <b>ticarcillin</b> of Pseudomonas strains over the past 5 years, but resistance of indole-positive Proteus and Serratia strains has been documented. After intramuscular (i. m.) injection of 1 g of <b>ticarcillin,</b> mean peak levels occurred at 1 h (26. 9 μg/ml) with a decline over 6 h (6. 8 μg/ml). Serum half-life was 84 min. Dilution of <b>ticarcillin</b> lidocaine reduced pain on i. m. injection but did not alter serum levels. Blood levels after 1 g i. m. are adequate to treat infections produced by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and some Enterobacter, but not Pseudomonas. After rapid intravenous infusion of 3 and 5 g, mean peak serum levels of <b>ticarcillin</b> were slightly lower for 1 h than those achieved with carbenicillin. Probenecid administered before infusion produced increases in blood levels, half-lives, and volume of distribution. The biological half-life of <b>ticarcillin</b> was 72 min compared to 66 min with carbenicillin. There was a larger volume of distribution for <b>ticarcillin</b> than carbenicillin (15 liters versus 14 liters). The <b>ticarcillin</b> half-life when administered with probenecid was 108 min. Urinary recovery of <b>ticarcillin</b> was 77 % against 95 % of carbenicillin.

40|$|An {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotic and carbenicillin or <b>ticarcillin</b> {{are widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} patients with gram-negative bacillus infections. This study evaluated the effect of time upon in vitro interaction between mixtures of four aminoglycosides at two concentrations with carbenicillin or <b>ticarcillin</b> at four concentrations. By linear regression analysis, the inactivation of each aminoglycoside was shown to be directly proportional to the concentration of carbenicillin (P < 0. 001). Inactivation was significantly (P < 0. 01) greater for gentamicin and tobramycin than for amikacin or netilmicin at all carbenicillin concentrations. At carbenicillin concentrations of 300 and 600 μg/ml, significantly (P < 0. 005) less inactivation of amikacin occurred when compared to netilmicin. <b>Ticarcillin</b> produced a significant (P < 0. 025) inactivation of gentamicin and tobramycin, with inactivation being directly proportional to <b>ticarcillin</b> concentration. No inactivation of amikacin or netilmicin activity occurred unless the <b>ticarcillin</b> concentration was 600 μg/ml. No significant change in aminoglycoside activity occurred when stored with <b>ticarcillin</b> or carbenicillin at concentrations ranging from 100 to 600 μg/ml at − 70 °C for 56 days. When an aminoglycoside and carbenicillin or <b>ticarcillin</b> are indicated in patients with renal failure, this study supports the use of <b>ticarcillin</b> with either amikacin or netilmicin...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and distribution}} of <b>ticarcillin</b> and clavulanic acid were studied in rats and rabbits after intravenous coadministration of the compounds. The elimination half-lives for <b>ticarcillin</b> and clavulanic acid were similar in both rats (<b>ticarcillin,</b> 0. 22 h; clavulanic acid, 0. 24 h) and rabbits (<b>ticarcillin,</b> 0. 38 h; clavulanic acid, 0. 31 h). Both compounds distributed widely throughout rat tissues, and the patterns of distribution {{were similar to those}} observed for other beta-lactams. Values for penetration into rat pleural, peritoneal, and subcutaneous fluids calculated from the equation (AUCfluid/AUCserum) X 100, where AUC is the area under the concentration-time curve, were between 83 and 93 % for <b>ticarcillin</b> and 86 and 103 % for clavulanic acid. Values for penetration into tissue cages in rabbits were 139 % +/- 45 % for <b>ticarcillin</b> and 109 % +/- 22 % for clavulanic acid. The penetration of clavulanic acid into rabbit cerebrospinal fluid was higher (P less than 0. 05) (4. 0 % +/- 0. 61 %) than that of <b>ticarcillin</b> (1. 3 % +/- 0. 53 %). Overall, the results show that <b>ticarcillin</b> and clavulanic acid distribute readily throughout body tissues and fluids and predict that the penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor would be present together at sites of infection...|$|E
40|$|The effectiveness, {{safety and}} {{tolerance}} of mezlocillin {{was compared to}} that of <b>ticarcillin</b> in 41 hospitalized adult patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.

40|$|The {{influence}} of dosing intervals on {{the activity of}} gentamicin and <b>ticarcillin</b> against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied in vivo. Granulocytopenic mice infected with P. aeruginosa in the thigh muscle were treated with l-hr or 3 -hr injections of gentamicin, <b>ticarcillin,</b> or gentamicin-ticarcillin.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that in vitro the {{combination}} of carbenicillin, <b>ticarcillin,</b> or other antipseudomonal penicillins with gentamicin, tobramycin, or other aminoglycoside antibiotics results in the inactivation of the antibacterial activity of the aminoglycoside. To assess the influence of the in vivo interaction of tobramycin and <b>ticarcillin</b> on experimental nephrotoxicity, male Fischer 344 rats were given either tobramycin alone (120 mg/kg per day), tobramycin (120 mg/kg per day) and <b>ticarcillin</b> (250 mg/kg per day) concomitantly, or the combination of these drugs at the same doses that had been preincubated for 24 h and at the time of delivery contained but 63 and 25 %, respectively, of the initial concentrations of tobramycin and <b>ticarcillin</b> as measured by conventional analytical procedures. Initial experiments were conducted to determine the concentrations of the antibiotics in serum achieved after administration of each test solution. After a single dose of the test solution, <b>ticarcillin</b> concentrations in serum were higher and more prolonged in rats given tobramycin plus <b>ticarcillin</b> than in rats given <b>ticarcillin</b> alone. After 7 days of exposure to the test solutions, inulin clearance in animals given tobramycin alone was 0. 15 +/- 0. 1 (mean +/- 2 standard errors) ml/min per 100 g of body weight as compared with 0. 53 +/- 0. 1 in rats given tobramycin and <b>ticarcillin</b> concomitantly, 0. 59 +/- 0. 1 in animals given the partially inactivated tobramycin-ticarcillin mixture, and 0. 79 +/- 0. 1 in control rats.
