5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

In a blog posting, she wrote, [...] "Apparently, <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a detailed transaction of every text message sent and received. Completely unnecessary." [...] She told a USA Today reporter, [...] "This is so silly, there's no reason they need to send you this much information."

50|$|To Muslims {{living in}} non-Islamic {{countries}} eager to wage jihad, Fadl says, I {{say it is}} not honorable to reside with people —— {{even if they were}} nonbelievers and not part of a treaty, if <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> permission to enter their homes and live with them, and if <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> security for yourself and your money, and if <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> the opportunity to work or study, or they granted you political asylum with a decent life and other acts of kindness —— and then betray them, through killing and destruction.

500|$|The {{game has}} had a {{positive}} reception, earning scores of 80/100 from the review aggregator Metacritic. Famitsu gave the game a score of 36 points out of 40, noted by IGN as being the highest score given by the magazine to a Shin Megami Tensei game up to that time. In their review, Famitsu praised the game's consistent balancing present throughout the game as well as commenting that while the player is having fun exploring, {{there is always a}} constant tension around. They also praised the demon combination system by saying that it was [...] "the greatest asset the game has -- <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> better results the more you use them" [...] as they allowed the battles to remain fresh and new. Famitsu also noted that [...] "The tutorial is helpful, and the mission goals are clear enough that you're never really lost." ...|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 985 feet long, {{was released}} on June 24, 1910. Advertisements played up {{the wreck of the}} $40,000 train car while a positive review in The Moving Picture World praised the well-managed production's prison and track wreck scenes, but remarked that the improbable story was purely fantastical. One of the more dramatic articles to appear in The Moving Picture World included reference to the film while playing up the dramatic element describe the footage and the filming of the wreck. It states: [...] "... The scenes were portrayals of a train crash and <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> startling before-and-after wreck views. They made you shiver when they showed you the fate that came to a car full of passengers - sudden, cruel and without warning. They made you shiver; ... And you thanked God that the thing before you was only a picture on the screen!" [...] Known advertisements for the film included theaters in Rhode Island and Indiana. Records show that film made it to Australia, with one Launceston, Tasmania newspaper showing an advertisement on January 30, 1911.|$|E
500|$|Willoughby's {{wardrobe}} {{was designed}} to reflect his [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "fashionable" [...] nature, while Fordham believed Edward was more suited to the eighteenth-century rural colours. With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character, his costumes were halfway between the two. His clothes were designed {{to be out of}} date and firm, using more heathers instead of the rural colours. The production had an emphasis on youth and passion, which Clapton incorporated into her work. The designer said, [...] "Ten years ago, female characters in 19th-century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise ringlets, all neat and perfect just like in the portraits. Now we're trying to achieve a more believable, natural look, especially when the Dashwoods are at home." [...] She added that the director had wanted the characters to [...] "feel more human." [...] Morrissey commented that the period costumes were [...] "slightly uncomfortable" [...] for modern life, {{but as soon as the}} cast were riding horses or walking across fields, they realised why they were made that way. He added, [...] "When you're dancing, they're quite restrictive, but that's quite good for posture – posture was different then, and that's important. But <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a feel for the character which is really an advantage to you as an actor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hermann Burchardt, a 19th-century German {{explorer}} and photographer, {{surmised that}} the Pirate Coast deserved its designation, {{and goes on}} to claim that piracy was the main occupation of the inhabitants who were infamous for their fanatacism and bloodthirstiness. A British customs official named John Malcolm who served in the Persian Gulf area from the 18th century to the 19th century wrote that when he questioned an Arab servant named Khudádád about the Jawasmi (the main pirate tribe in the Persian Gulf), Khudádád professed that [...] "their occupation is piracy, and their delight murder; and to make it worse, <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the most pious reasons for every villainy they commit".|$|E
2500|$|Espuelas said to The Industry Standard, [...] "As a kid I had {{to leave}} my home country, Uruguay, when my parents got {{divorced}} and my mother couldn't support herself.

It is not that these types of experiences make you a better person, but <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a different perspective on failure. I've seen people older than I go into panic mode and lose confidence in themselves because of tough market conditions, thinking that it's the end of the world.

2500|$|New South Wales {{selection}} bias is a perceived bias by selectors of the Australian cricket teams towards players from New South Wales. It was exemplified in a quote by former South Australian captain David Hookes who said that, [...] "when they give out the baggy blue cap in New South Wales, <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a baggy green {{one in a}} brown paper bag as well to save making two presentations". This is an example of confirmation bias and Hookes' comment came at a time when, especially during the 1980s, there was a public perception that strong performances by non-NSW players were often ignored by the Australian selectors in favour of seemingly under-performing NSW players who were selected for the Test and/or One-Day team. The claims persist {{in spite of the fact}} that no New South Welshman has occupied a position on the National Selection Panel since John Benaud in 1994.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better.
