40|$|<b>Telenzepine</b> is an {{analogue}} of pirenzepine with {{a higher}} potency and similar selectivity for M 1 -receptors in animals. In this placebo controlled, double blind, randomised study mean peptone stimulated gastric acid secretion (mean +/- SEM) of 10 male healthy subjects (58 +/- 6 mmol H+/ 3 h for placebo) was significantly and dose dependently inhibited by oral <b>telenzepine</b> (2 mg: 31 +/- 5, 3 mg: 23 +/- 5, 5 mg: 21 +/- 4 mmol H+/ 3 h). <b>Telenzepine</b> 3 and 5 mg were significantly stronger than pirenzepine 50 mg orally (37 +/- 8 mmol H+/ 3 h). Mean percentage acid inhibition was 37 % for pirenzepine, and 48, 61, and 64 % for 2, 3, and 5 mg <b>telenzepine,</b> respectively. Basal and peptone stimulated gastrin release was unaffected.

40|$|Although rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors {{can exist}} as both {{monomers}} and non-covalently associated dimers/oligomers, the steady-state proportion of each form and {{whether this is}} regulated by receptor ligands is unknown. Herein we address these topics for the M 1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a key molecular target for novel cognition enhancers, by employing Spatial Intensity Distribution Analysis. This method can measure fluorescent particle concentration and assess oligomerization states of proteins within defined regions of living cells. Imaging {{and analysis of the}} basolateral surface of cells expressing some 50 molecules. microm- 2 of the human muscarinic M 1 receptor identified an ~ 75 / 25 mixture of receptor monomers and dimers/oligomers. Both sustained and shorter-term treatment with the selective M 1 antagonist pirenzepine resulted in a large shift in the distribution of receptor species to favor the dimeric/oligomeric state. Although sustained treatment with pirenzepine also resulted in marked upregulation of the receptor, simple mass-action effects were not the basis for ligand-induced stabilization of receptor dimers/oligomers. The related antagonist <b>telenzepine</b> also produced stabilization and enrichment of the M 1 receptor dimer population but the receptor subtype non-selective antagonists atropine and N-methylscopolamine did not. In contrast, neither pirenzepine nor <b>telenzepine</b> altered the quaternary organization of the related M 3 muscarinic receptor. These data provide unique insights into the selective capacity of receptor ligands to promote and/or stabilize receptor dimers/oligomers and demonstrate that the dynamics of ligand regulation of the quaternary organization of G protein-coupled receptors is markedly more complex than previously appreciated.

40|$|The {{affinity}} of {{a number}} of 'selective' agonists and antagonists has been assessed at atrial or ileal muscarinic receptors by use of in vitro functional analysis. The most selective compound for ileal muscarinic receptors was silabenzhexol (approx. 50 fold), {{and to a lesser extent}} benzhexol (approx. 5 fold). Conversely, the most selective compound for the atrial muscarinic receptors was AF-DX 116 (approx. 6 fold). The novel M 1 -receptor antagonist, <b>telenzepine</b> and other antagonists such as propantheline and isopropamide did not distinguish between atrial and ileal receptors. Dicyclomine, adiphenine, hexahydroadiphenine and oxyphenonium exhibited competitive antagonism at atrial receptors but non-competitive antagonism at ileal receptors. No conclusions could, therefore, be drawn with regard to their selectivity. The agonists, arecaidine propargyl ester (APE), ethoxyethyltriethylammonium (EOE) and carbachol, exhibited some selectivity in potency but little difference in affinity. It is concluded that the study supports the existence of ileal and atrial muscarinic receptor subtypes.

40|$|Stimulation of acid {{secretion}} by muscarinic agents involves receptors with {{a higher}} apparent affinity to the M 1 -antagonists, pirenzepine and <b>telenzepine,</b> than those regulating heart rate and salivary secretion.

Studies with parietal cells isolated from several species indicate that parietal cells have a muscarinic receptor with low affinity for the M 1 -antagonists. Our studies with somatostatin cells isolated from canine fundic mucosa indicates that the muscarinic receptor inhibiting somatostatin release also is of low affinity for M 1 -antagonists.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} decade, striatal {{cholinergic}} interneurons (ChIs) have reemerged as key {{actors in the}} pathophysiology of basal-ganglia-related movement disorders. However, the mechanisms involved are still unclear. In this study, we address the role of ChI activity in the expression of parkinsonian-like motor deficits in a unilateral nigrostriatal 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesion model using optogenetic and pharmacological approaches. Dorsal striatal photoinhibition of ChIs in lesioned ChAT(cre/cre) mice expressing halorhodopsin in ChIs reduces akinesia, bradykinesia, and sensorimotor neglect. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) blockade by scopolamine produces similar anti-parkinsonian effects. To decipher which of the mAChR subtypes provides these beneficial effects, systemic and intrastriatal administration of the selective M 1 and M 4 mAChR antagonists <b>telenzepine</b> and tropicamide, respectively, were tested in the same model of Parkinson's disease. The two compounds alleviate 6 -OHDA lesion-induced motor deficits. <b>Telenzepine</b> produces its beneficial effects by blocking postsynaptic M 1 mAChRs expressed on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) at {{the origin of the}} indirect striatopallidal and direct striatonigral pathways. The anti-parkinsonian effects of tropicamide were almost completely abolished in mutant lesioned mice that lack M 4 mAChRs specifically in dopamine D 1 -receptor-expressing neurons, suggesting that postsynaptic M 4 mAChRs expressed on direct MSNs mediate the antiakinetic action of tropicamide. The present results show that altered cholinergic transmission via M 1 and M 4 mAChRs of the dorsal striatum plays a pivotal role in the occurrence of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:The striatum, where dopaminergic and cholinergic systems interact, is the pivotal structure of basal ganglia involved in pathophysiological changes underlying Parkinson's disease. Here, using optogenetic and pharmacological approaches, we investigated the involvement of striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and muscarinic receptor subtypes (mAChRs) in the occurrence {{of a wide range of}} motor deficits such as akinesia, bradykinesia, motor coordination, and sensorimotor neglect after unilateral nigrostriatal 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion in mice. Our results show that photoinhibition of ChIs in the dorsal striatum and pharmacological blockade of muscarinic receptors, specifically postsynaptic M 1 and M 4 mAChRs, alleviate lesion-induced motor deficits. The present study points to these receptor subtypes as potential targets for the symptomatic treatment of parkinsonian-like motor symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Perinatal {{adverse events}} such as {{limitation}} of nutrients or oxygen supply {{are associated with the}} occurrence of diseases in adulthood, like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. We investigated long-term effects of perinatal hypoxia on the lung circulation, with particular attention to the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. Mice were placed under hypoxia in utero 5 days before delivery and for 5 days after birth. Pups were then bred in normoxia until adulthood. Adults born in hypoxia displayed altered regulation of pulmonary vascular tone with higher right ventricular pressure in normoxia and increased sensitivity to acute hypoxia as compared to controls. Perinatal hypoxia dramatically decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by acetylcholine in adult pulmonary arteries (PA) but did not influence nitric oxide-mediated endothelium-independent relaxation. The muscarinic receptor M 3 was implicated in the relaxing action of acetylcholine and the muscarinic receptor M 1 (M 1 AChR) in its vasoconstrictive effects. Pirenzepine or <b>telenzepine,</b> two preferential inhibitors of M 1 AChR, abolished the adverse effects of perinatal hypoxia on acetylcholine-induced relaxation.

This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether mAChRs influence the growth of the chick sciera and, if so, which mAChR subtypes are involved. METHODS. Sciera and scleral chondrocytes from normal and form-deprived eyes of 10 - to 14 -day-old chicks were treated with a total of seven ligands: two agonists, carbachol (nonselective) and McN-A- 343 (selective for the Ml mAChR subtype); and five antagonists, atropine (nonselective), pirenzepine and <b>telenzepine</b> (Ml), gallamine (M 2), and 4 -diphenylacetoxy-iV-methylpiperidine methiodide (4 -DAMP; Ml and M 3). Incorporation of sulfate into glycosaminoglycans and of thymidine into DNA were quantified and normalized to sample DNA content. Possible toxicity of ligands at high doses was examined by analysis of cell number (by cell counting), viability (by trypan blue exclusion), and cellular metabolic activity (by dehydrogenase activity). RESULTS. Cellular proliferation and extracellular matrix production were inhibited by atropine in whole sciera and in its cartilaginous layer.

The muscarinic M 1 receptor agonist 4 -[[[(3 -Chlorophenyl) amino]carbonyl]oxy]-N,N,N,-trimethyl- 2 -butyn- 1 -amonium chloride (McN-A- 343, 10 − 7 – 10 − 4 [*]M) induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of rat jejunum. Relaxations induced by McN-A- 343 (10 − 5 [*]M) were inhibited by the M 1 receptor antagonist <b>telenzepine</b> (10 − 8 [*]M), and enhanced by the M 3 receptor antagonist para-fluoro-hexahydrosiladifenidol (p-F-HHSiD; 3 × 10 − 7 [*]M). The inhibitory responses induced by McN-A- 343 were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG; 10 − 4 [*]M) and Nω-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 3 × 10 − 5 [*]M), the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3,-a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ; 10 − 5 [*]M), and by tetrodotoxin (TTX; 3 × 10 − 7 [*]M). Guanethidine or hexamethonium did not affect inhibitory responses induced by McN-A- 343. In conclusion, McN-A- 343 induces nerve-dependent, nitrergic relaxations in rat jejunum, via activation of muscarinic M 1 receptors. Hence, selective muscarinic M 1 receptor agonists or antagonists might offer possibilities for pharmacological manipulation of the NO system...|$|E

However, a direct investigation of the receptors for acetylcholine (ACh) is still lacking in the prostate neuroendocrine cells. RPNECs were freshly isolated from the ventral lobes of rat prostate by using collagenase. Effects of ACh and various muscarinic antagonists on the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]c) were investigated by using the fura- 2 spectrofluorimetry. Single-cell RT-PCR analysis was applied to identify the transcripts for the muscarinic receptor subtypes. ACh (5 µM) induced a sharp transient increase in the [Ca 2 +]c of RPNECs, which was independent of the extracellular Ca 2 +. In the same RPNECs, high KCl (60 mM), phenylephrine (5 µM), UTP (P 2 Y 1 / 2 agonist, 50 µM), and α,β-meATP (P 2 X 1 / 3 agonist, 0. 5 µM) also increased the [Ca 2 +]c. The ACh-induced [Ca 2 +]c change (Δ[Ca 2 +]c) was blocked by atropine or by para-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol (M 3 antagonist, 0. 3 µM), but not by <b>telenzepine</b> (M 1 antagonist, 1 µM) and himbacine (M 2 and M 4 antagonist, 1 µM). The single-cell RT-PCR demonstrated the selective expression of mRNAs for M 3 in RPNECs. In summary, RPNECs express M 3 muscarinic receptors that {{are linked to the}} release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores.

40|$|In {{membranes}} {{of the rat}} frontal cortex, acetylcholine (ACh) {{and other}} cholinergic agonists were found to potentiate the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity elicited by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Oxotremorine-M, carbachol and methacholine were as effective as ACh, whereas oxotremorine and arecoline were much less effective. The facilitating effect of Ach was potently blocked by the M 1 antagonists R-trihexyphenidyl, <b>telenzepine</b> and pirenzepine and by the M 3 antagonists hexahydro-sila-difenidol and p-fluorohexahydro-sila-difenidol, whereas the M 2 and M 4 antagonists himbacine, methoctramine, AF-DX 116 and AQ-RA 741 were less potent. The mamba venom toxin MT- 1, which binds with high affinity to M 1 receptors, was also a potent blocker. The pharmacological profile of the muscarinic potentiation of CRH receptor activity was markedly different from that displayed by the muscarinic inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, which could be detected in the same membrane preparations. Moreover, the intracerebral injection of pertussis toxin impaired the muscarinic inhibition of cyclic AMP formation and reduced the Ach stimulation of [35 S]GTPgammaS binding to membrane G proteins but failed to affect the facilitating effect on CRH receptor activity. The latter response was also insensitive to the phospholipase C inhibitor U- 73122, the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and to the inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid.

40|$|International audienceThe acute {{effects of}} ethanol on the neurons of the striatum, a basal ganglia nucleus crucially {{involved}} in motor control and action selection, were investigated using whole-cell recordings. An intoxicating concentration of ethanol (50 mM) produced inhibitory effects on striatal large aspiny cholinergic interneurons (LAIs) and low-threshold spike interneurons (LTSIs). These effects persisted {{in the presence}} of tetrodotoxin and were due to an increase in potassium currents, including those responsible for medium and slow afterhyperpolarizations. In contrast, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) were directly excited by ethanol, which depolarised these neurons through the suppression of potassium currents. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) became hyperpolarized {{in the presence of}} ethanol, but this effect did not persist in the presence of tetrodotoxin and was mimicked and occluded by application of the M 1 muscarinic receptor antagonist <b>telenzepine.</b> Ethanol effects on MSNs were also abolished by 100 µM barium. This showed that the hyperpolarisations observed in MSNs were due to decreased tonic activation of M 1 muscarinic receptors, resulting in an increase in Kir 2 conductances. Evoked GABAergic responses of MSNs were reversibly decreased by ethanol with no change in paired-pulse ratio. Furthermore, ethanol impaired the ability of thalamostriatal inputs to inhibit a subsequent corticostriatal glutamatergic response in MSNs. These results offer the first comprehensive description of the highly cell-type specific effects of ethanol on striatal neurons and provide a cellular basis for the interpretation of ethanol influence on a brain area crucially involved in the motor and decisional impairment caused by this drug...|$|E

The role of trophic molecules produced by target and afferent cells {{as well as by}} glial cells has been extensively demonstrated. Literature data demonstrate that cAMP can modulate the survival of neuronal cells. Cultures of mixed retinal cells were treated with forskolin (an activator of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase) for 48 h. The results show that 50 µM forskolin induced a two-fold increase in the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the absence of exogenous trophic factors. This effect was dose dependent and abolished by 1 µM H 89 (an inhibitor of protein kinase A), 1. 25 µM chelerythrine chloride (an inhibitor of protein kinase C), 50 µM PD 98059 (an inhibitor of MEK), 25 µM Ly 294002 (an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase), 30 nM brefeldin A (an inhibitor of polypeptide release), and 10 µM genistein or 1 ng/ml herbimycin (inhibitors of tyrosine kinase enzymes). The inhibition of muscarinic receptors by 10 µM atropine or 1 µM <b>telenzepine</b> also blocked the effect of forskolin. When we used 25 µM BAPTA, an intracellular calcium chelator, as well as 20 µM 5 -fluoro- 2 '-deoxyuridine, an inhibitor of cell proliferation, we also abolished the effect. Our results indicate that cAMP plays an important role controlling the survival of RGCs. This effect is directly dependent on M 1 receptor activation indicating that cholinergic activity mediates the increase in RGC survival.

40|$|AIMS: Acetylcholine (ACh) is {{synthesized}} by Choline Acetyl-Transferase (ChAT) that exerts its physiological {{effects in}} airway epithelial cells via muscarinic receptor (MR) activation. We evaluate {{the effect of}} ACh stimulation on human bronchial epithelial cells (16 -HBE) and test whether cigarette smoke extract (CSE) can modify the basal cellular response to ACh affecting the non-neuronal cholinergic system signalling. MAIN METHODS: ACh stimulated 16 -HBE were tested for ACh-binding, Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) release and ERK 1 / 2 and NFkB pathway activation. Additionally, we investigated all the aforementioned parameters as well as ChAT and MR proteins and mRNA expression and endogenous ACh production in CSE-treated 16 -HBE. KEY FINDINGS: We showed that ACh induced in 16 -HBE, in a concentration-dependent manner, LTB(4) release via the activation of ERK 1 / 2 and NFkB pathways. The addition of Tiotropium (Spiriva®), Gallamine, <b>Telenzepine</b> and 4 -DAMP (muscarinic receptor antagonists), {{as well as of}} PD 098059 (MAPKK inhibitor) and BAY 117082 (inhibitor of IkBα phosphorilation), down-regulated the ACh-induced effects. Additionally, CSE treatment of 16 -HBE increased the binding of ACh, and shifted the LTB 4 release from the concentration ACh 1 μM to 10 nM. Finally, we observed that the treatment of 16 -HBE with CSE increased the expression of ChAT, M(2) and M(3) and of endogenous ACh production in 16 -HBE. Tiotropium regulated the LTB 4 release and ACh production in CSE treated 16 -HBE.

These results suggest that cigarette smoke might alter the expression of ChAT and MRs, promoting airway remodeling in COPD and that anticholinergic drugs, including tiotropium, might prevent these events...|$|E
