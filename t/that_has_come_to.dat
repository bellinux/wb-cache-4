25|$|The {{lawsuit was}} made {{possible}} by a 1997 executive order of U.S. President Bill Clinton that directed all branches of the US government to open their World War II records to scrutiny. The order came in the aftermath of evidence that Swiss banks were destroying evidence of deposit records by Jews. Fourteen European nations, Canada, and Argentina followed suit, but Vatican City did not. Much of the evidence <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> light since the executive order was not available to the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold before it disbanded, although Yugoslavia was among the recipients of restitution.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{mathematics}} {{itself is}} properly classified as science {{has been a}} matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science because it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic systems, rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be known as the scientific method. In general, mathematics is classified as formal science, while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical sciences.|$|E

25|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} of these mythological druids was Amergin Glúingel, a bard and judge for the Milesians featured in the Mythological Cycle. The Milesians were seeking to overrun the Tuatha De Danann and win the land of Ireland but, as they approached, the druids of the Tuatha Dé Danann raised a magical storm to bar their ships from making landfall. Thus Amergin called upon the spirit of Ireland itself, chanting a powerful incantation <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be known as The Song of Amergin and, eventually (after successfully making landfall), aiding and dividing the land between his royal brothers in the conquest of Ireland, earning the title Chief Ollam of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Soviet partisans {{had very}} little support from the Baltic countries' populations. Their {{involvement}} in controversial actions that affected the civilian population (for example, {{the killing of the}} Polish civilians in Kaniūkai, in an event <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be called the Koniuchy massacre, and the destruction of the village of Bakaloriškės). The anti-Soviet resistance movements in the Baltic states, known as the Latvian or Lithuanian partisans, (established just before the Soviet re-occupation in 1944), and local self-defence units often came into conflict with Soviet partisan groups. In Estonia and Latvia, almost all the Soviet partisan units, dropped by air, were either destroyed by the German forces or the local self-defense units.|$|E

25|$|The {{modern era}} of fifing in America began in about 1880, with the popularizing of {{civilian}} fife and drum corps {{in a musical}} tradition <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be known as Ancient fife and drum (or simply Ancient). The rise of these corps led to a demand for fifes that were superior in intonation and better suited for group playing than those used during the Civil War. This call was answered by the Cloos Company of Brooklyn, New York, and their Crosby Model fife. These fifes were one piece, cylindrical bore instruments with six irregularly sized and placed tone-holes. Compared to fifes made before this time, Cloos fifes were easier to play, better tuned, and produced a much louder sound.|$|E
25|$|The Revised Julian calendar, {{also known}} as the Milanković calendar, or, less formally, new calendar, is a calendar, {{developed}} and proposed by the Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković in 1923, which effectively discontinued the 340 years of divergence between the naming of dates sanctioned by those Eastern Orthodox churches adopting it and the Gregorian calendar <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> predominate worldwide. This calendar was intended to replace the ecclesiastical calendar based on the Julian calendar hitherto in use by all of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Revised Julian calendar temporarily aligned its dates with the Gregorian calendar proclaimed in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII for adoption by the Christian world. The calendar has been adopted by the Orthodox churches of Constantinople, Albania, Alexandria, Antioch, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Poland, and Romania.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, Montevideo's prosperous {{middle classes}} {{have tended to}} abandon the {{formerly}} fashionable downtown areas for the more modern high-rise apartment buildings of Pocitos, a beachfront neighborhood east of the center. Still farther east lies the expensive area of Carrasco, a zone of modern luxury villas <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> replace the old neighborhood of El Prado {{in the north of}} the city as home to the country's wealthy elite. Its beaches were less polluted than those closer to the center. Montevideo's Carrasco International Airport is located nearby, crossing the border to Canelones Department. The capital's principal artery, 18 July Avenue, was long the principal shopping street of Montevideo, but it has been hurt since the mid-1980s by the construction of a modern shopping mall strategically located between Pocitos and Carrasco.|$|E

25|$|Women {{artists have}} also been at the {{forefront}} of the hip hop movement since its inception in the Bronx. Nevertheless, as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music, there were many songs with misogynistic (anti-women) lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion. The negation of female voice and perspective is an issue <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> define mainstream hip hop music. The recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts, and when it does back them, often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities. Since the turn of the century (the beginning of the 2000s decade), female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention, with only a few, such as older artists like the female duo Salt N' Pepa to more contemporary ones like Lil' Kim and Nicki Minaj, reaching platinum status.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{features}} of Graf's game were her versatility across all playing surfaces, footwork and her powerful forehand drive. Graf's athletic ability and aggressive game played from the baseline have {{been credited with}} developing the modern style of play <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> dominate today's game. She won six French Open singles titles (second to Evert), seven Wimbledon singles titles, four Australian Open titles, and five U.S. Open singles titles. She is the only singles player (male or female) to have achieved a Grand Slam since hard court was introduced as a surface at the US Open in 1978. Consequently, Graf's Grand Slam was achieved on grass, clay, and hard court while the previous five Grand Slams were decided on only grass and clay. Graf reached thirteen consecutive Grand Slam singles finals, from the 1987 French Open through to the 1990 French Open, winning nine of them. She won 5 consecutive Majors (1988 Australian Open to 1989 Australian Open), and seven Majors out of eight, in two calendar years (1988 Australian Open to 1989 US Open, except 1989 French Open). She reached a total of 31 Grand Slam singles finals.|$|E
500|$|Ukiyo-e {{scholarship}} {{has tended to}} focus on the cataloguing of artists, an approach that lacks the rigour and originality <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be applied to art analysis in other areas. [...] Such catalogues are numerous, but tend overwhelmingly to concentrate on a group of recognized geniuses. [...] Little original research has been added to the early, foundational evaluations of ukiyo-e and its artists, especially with regard to relatively minor artists. [...] While the commercial nature of ukiyo-e has always been acknowledged, evaluation of artists and their works has rested on the aesthetic preferences of connoisseurs and paid little heed to contemporary commercial success.|$|E

500|$|Teresa Cristina {{has been}} given a less than {{prominent}} place in Brazil's history. Historian Aniello Angelo Avella said that the Empress, nicknamed [...] "by her contemporaries as 'Mother of the Brazilians'," [...] is [...] "completely unknown in Italy and little studied in Brazil". According to his view, the few existing sources relegate her to having [...] "lived in the shadow of her husband, dedicating herself to her daughters' education, to home affairs, to charity." [...] The resulting image [...] "is of a woman of limited culture, blank, silent, who compensated with kindness and virtues of the heart the lack of physical attributes." [...] And this is the view <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be enshrined in history and the popular imagination, despite being not quite a true representation of Teresa Cristina, since she was a well learned and willful woman.|$|E
500|$|WALL-E went undeveloped {{during the}} 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not {{confident}} enough yet {{to have a}} feature length film with a main character that behaved like Luxo Jr. or R2-D2. Stanton explained {{there are two types}} of robots in cinema: [...] "human with metal skin", like the Tin Man, or [...] "machine with function" [...] like Luxo and R2. He found the latter idea [...] "powerful" [...] because it allowed the audience to project personalities onto the characters, as they do with babies and pets: [...] "You're compelled ... you almost can't stop yourself from finishing the sentence 'Oh, I think it likes me! I think it's hungry! I think it wants to go for a walk!'" [...] He added, [...] "We wanted the audience to believe they were witnessing a machine <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> life." [...] The animators visited recycling stations to study machinery, and also met robot designers, visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to study robots, watched a recording of a Mars rover, and borrowed a bomb detecting robot from the San Francisco Police Department. Simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would make them feel human.|$|E

When Soma proceeds further into the castle, he meets the witch , who is present on the orders of the Roman Catholic Church. Yoko is looking for Graham, who she believes is dangerous and the inheritor of Dracula's powers. She clarifies the nature of Soma's powers, revealing that they are not necessarily evil, but inherent to Soma himself. Later, Soma encounters , a member of the United States Army ordered to come to the Hakuba shrine. He has forfeited his mission, however, in favor of selling goods. He becomes Soma's vendor, selling numerous goods to aid Soma's mission. A mysterious man then accosts Soma, asking about the nature of Soma's dark power. When Soma continues to converse with him, the man reveals that he has amnesia, and the only thing he remembers is his name starts with [...] "J".|$|E
