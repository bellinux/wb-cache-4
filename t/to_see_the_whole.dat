25|$|The {{first two}} years of the García {{government}} gave new hope to the people of Peru, with rising employment, production, and wages suggesting a clear turn for the better after so many years of increasing difficulties. It was hence doubly tragic <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> process unravel so quickly, once things started going wrong again. The first sign of trouble came, as it often had, from the balance of payments. The economic boom naturally raised imports swiftly, by 76 percent between 1985 and 1987. But the real exchange rate was allowed to fall by 10 percent in 1986 and by a further 9 percent in 1987. The boom pulled potential export supply into the domestic market, and the fall in the real exchange rate reduced incentives to earn foreign exchange. Exports fell slightly in 1985 and remained below that level through 1987. The external current account went from a surplus of US$127 million in 1985 to deficits of nearly US$1.1 billion in 1986 and nearly US$1.5 billion in 1987.|$|E
500|$|Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation both {{praised the}} story, with Famitsu saying it [...] "vividly portrays {{the fact that}} this is a deep, intense Final Fantasy experience, {{something}} beyond just a side story". Gaming website PlayStation LifeStyle's Heath Hindman was impressed by the darker presentation, calling it [...] "powerful and well done throughout", and was impressed with the characters despite some awkward introductory scenes. Erren Van Duine, writing for RPG Site, said that fans would appreciate the scale of the narrative, and praised the handling of the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. She did note that some plot points seemed only included for the sake of convenience, and that the ending forced a second playthrough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story.|$|E

Explaining her motivation, she said she would often connect images, childhood memories, emotions and fantasies to songs she {{was in the midst of}} composing, and that she [...] "wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head as that's what makes it mine". She highlighted the [...] "immersive experience" [...] of Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) as the principal influence for creating a body work that would mean [...] "people would hear things differently and [...] actually be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> vision of the album".|$|E

During the commentary for the episode, Steve Carell argued that the American version of The Office was more difficult to shoot because the British version was 29 minutes long, whereas the American version could only be 22 minutes.|$|E

[...] "We need more women leaders. Women tend <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> picture. For society to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels – local to global.

2500|$|The {{visit to}} Earth {{begins with a}} deeply pessimistic {{appraisal}} of humanity. [...] The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world. [...] On earth there were"111 kings [...] [...] [...] 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups."Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to {{have the power to}} return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men {{in this part of the}} world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the mocking voices of others.|$|E
2500|$|Discussion of the {{literary}} genre includes whether what is represented is a history, a parable, a myth, or compound of various genres. This relates {{to the reality of}} the encounter. Sometimes the temptation narrative is taken as a parable, reading that Jesus in his ministry told this narrative to audiences relating his inner experience {{in the form of a}} parable. Or it is autobiographical, regarding what sort of Messiah Jesus intended to be. Writers including William Barclay have pointed to the fact that there is [...] "no mountain high enough in all the world <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world" [...] as indication of the non-literal nature of the event, and that the narrative portrays what was going on inside Jesus' mind. Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas explained, [...] "In regard to the words, 'He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,' we are not to understand that He saw the very kingdoms, with the cities and inhabitants, their gold and silver: but that the devil pointed out the quarters in which each kingdom or city lay, and set forth to Him in words their glory and estate." ...|$|E
