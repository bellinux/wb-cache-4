Richards said the band's status as an opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, was something they saw as a challengeâ€”their intention was to win over fans who {{came to see the}} main act. However, he called the tour with <b>The</b> <b>Aliens</b> depressing; the bands played very different types of music, and the attendance at shows was small.

50|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{video game}} adaptations of <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> franchise, Alien: Isolation features a single alien creature that pursues the player {{over the course}} of <b>the</b> game. <b>The</b> <b>alien</b> creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> has <b>the</b> ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> finding <b>the</b> player. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract <b>the</b> <b>alien,</b> forcing <b>the</b> player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|R
