5|$|On 22 January 1153 Hugh {{was elected}} to the see of Durham by the cathedral chapter, in spite of the {{opposition}} of Henry Murdac, who excommunicated the chapter in response. Because of Murdac's opposition and refusal to confirm the election, Hugh only obtained consecration by making a personal visit to Rome, where the pope was able to over-rule the Archbishop of York. He was consecrated on 20 December 1153, by Pope Anastasius IV. Hugh was enthroned, or ceremonially installed as bishop in his cathedral, at Durham on 2 May 1154. King Stephen granted to Puiset as bishop of Durham, the mineral rights at Weardale, which included lead mines. Silver was also extracted from the lead ore mined <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> silver probably helped the bishops form their own mint.|$|E

25|$|Three {{chapters}} {{followed in}} 1850: Omicron (now Omicron Epsilon) at Princeton University, Sigma at the University of Pennsylvania, and Chi at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. The first two are still active, {{as was the}} Chi Chapter until 1988. In the early 1980s Colby College prohibited Fraternities on campus, despite the long and storied tradition they had enjoyed there. By 1988, ejected from campus and banned from any formal rush, the chapter quietly expired after over 130 years of existence. Problems beset other early chapters as well. The first Alpha chapter was founded in 1852 at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. But immediate resistance from the administration slowly wore upon the brothers <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> chapter became inactive in 1872, permitting its letter {{to be used for}} the later chapter founded at Columbia.|$|E

However, after the troops had left in June 1956 and the Egyptians nationalised the Canal a month later, Powell opposed the attempt to retake the canal in the Suez Crisis because he thought the British no longer had the resources to be a world power.|$|E
25|$|With {{air traffic}} {{congestion}} reaching an unacceptable threshold in Mumbai, the AAI put its age-old plan of reviving the Juhu airport {{on the fast track}} to ease some pressure off of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) in 2010. The AAI appointed consulting major KPMG to draw up a development plan for Juhu airport. It was envisioned that the Juhu airstrip could take up to 18% load off CSI Airport with turboprop ATR and Boeing 737 aircraft. The plan was to extend the runway to 2000 meters in phases, this would have ultimately seen the airstrip jutting into the sea and utilizing reclaimed parts of the Juhu beach and seafront. Permission for the expansion was denied by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2010. Instead, the ministry asked for conservation of the land around the airstrip, stating that no development should take place <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it should be conserved as a green space to compensate for the pollution caused by the airstrip.|$|E
25|$|Although Mirza Ghulam Ahmad aroused much {{opposition}} {{particularly from}} Muslim leaders owing to his messianic claims, opinion {{of him was}} not entirely negative. Many leading Muslim scholars, theologians and prominent journalists who were his contemporaries or had {{come into contact with}} him, had, despite differing with him in matters of belief, praised his personal character and acclaimed his works in the cause of Islam and the manner of his argumentation against proclaimants of other religions. The teachings that Jesus survived crucifixion, migrating towards the east in search of the Israelite tribes that had settled <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he died a natural death upon earth, as propounded by Ghulam Ahmad, have been a source of ongoing friction with the Christian church since they challenge the core beliefs of Christianity and would nullify the doctrines of vicarious atonement and resurrection, the two principal tenets of Christianity. Western scholars and historians have acknowledged this fact as one of the features of Ghulam Ahmad's legacy.|$|E

25|$|The {{transformation}} of the Liberator Army into the new Portuguese Army occurred by the organization established in July 1834. By this organization, the Army included the General Staff, the Staff Corps, the Engineering Corps (including a staff and the Sappers Battalion), the Artillery Corps (including a grand staff and two regiments), six regiments of cavalry, 12 regiments of infantry, four regiments of light infantry or caçadores and the military intendancy. The infantry regiments would form six brigades grouped in three divisions, the light infantry regiments would form two brigades grouped in a light division and the cavalry regiments would form three brigades. Each province continued to have a military governor, that commanded the troops stationed <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> were not assigned to a special purpose division. The artillery, cavalry, infantry and light infantry regiments would be numbered. Despite several of these regiments originated from units of the previous Liberator Army, they received numbers identical to those once used by the old disbanded regiments to whom they were not related. Besides the previous referred corps and units, the Army also included the fortresses staffs, the secretariats, the academies, the Military College, the arsenals and trains, the Telegraph Corps, training depots, the Veterinary School, veterans, invalids and fortress garrisons.|$|E
25|$|Following his March to the Sea, Major General William Tecumseh Sherman, {{commanding}} the Military Division of the Mississippi, moved his army northward through the Carolinas. The Union general in chief, Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant had ordered Sherman {{to bring his}} troops north to Virginia in order to battle the Army of Northern Virginia. However, Sherman argued {{that it would take}} too long to transport his troops <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> his army could destroy Confederate supply lines to Petersburg and defeat Confederate forces by marching through the Carolinas. During the late winter and early spring of 1865, Sherman's army cut a swath of destruction through South Carolina. On March 8, Union soldiers crossed into North Carolina as Confederate units attempted to concentrate their forces to defeat the enemy during the march. Sherman divided his command into two parts, a Left Wing (the Army of Georgia) commanded by Maj. Gen. Henry Warner Slocum and a Right Wing (the Army of the Tennessee) commanded by Maj. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard. The two wings marched separately toward Goldsboro beginning on March 13, with no one in the Union command expecting major resistance from Johnston.|$|E
