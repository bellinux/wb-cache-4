In a {{controlled}} experiment using Comrade, a computer-supported peer review system, student reviewers offered feedback to student authors on their written analyses {{of a problem}} scenario.

We found that the reviewers were sensitive to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>rating</b> prompts they saw and that their ratings of authors’ work were less discriminating with respect to writing composition than to problem-specific issues. In other words, when students gave each other feedback regarding domain-relevant writing criteria, their ratings correlated to a much greater extent, suggesting that such ratings are redundant...|$|R

We test these hypotheses using cross-sectional and time-series data on insurers and demonstrate that insurers subject to tighter price regulation maintain higher levels of leverage...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactive}} (hydrolysis) {{dissolution of}} a solid ester suspended in alkaline, aqueous solutions has been investigated with respect to the major operating variables, such as the agitation intensity, alkali concentrations, and, most significantly, the solid reactant's loading.

It has been shown that the experimentally obtained conversions of the solid reactant can be explained by invoking the notion of a declining area for solid-liquid mass transfer due to the suspended particles forming clusters or agglomerates. A semiempirical framework, for analyzing the experimental data, which utilizes a power law <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>rate</b> expression for the loss of interfacial area due to clustering, is used to provide quantitative support for the proposed hypothesis. Further qualitative evidence of cluster formation has been given in images of the suspended particles as seen under an optical microscope...|$|E

40|$|MOTIVATION: Many {{biochemical}} systems require stochastic descriptions. Unfortunately {{these can}} only be solved for the simplest cases and their direct simulation can become prohibitively expensive, precluding thorough analysis. As an alternative, moment closure approximation methods generate equations for the time-evolution of the system's moments and apply a closure ansatz to obtain a closed set of differential equations; that can become {{the basis for the}} deterministic analysis of the moments of the outputs of stochastic systems. RESULTS: We present a free, user-friendly tool implementing an efficient moment expansion approximation with parametric closures that integrates well with the IPython interactive environment. Our package enables the analysis of complex stochastic systems without any constraints on the number of species and moments studied and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>rate</b> laws in the system. In addition to the approximation method our package provides numerous tools to help non-expert users in stochastic analysis.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is to improve on existing savings rate and deposit volume models used for constructing replicating portfolios of non-maturing accounts (NMAs). Such accounts have proven difficult to model, especially, as they offer savings rates to clients that change infrequently and with discrete jumps. The thesis uses savings rate and deposit volume data from both the Netherlands and Germany for a period of eight years. The data was kindly provided by NIBC Bank N. V., a Dutch corporate bank. Savings rates are modeled with a latent process that governs when changes occur. The model of the deposit volumes is chosen with an iterative Box-Jenkins procedure from an ARIMA family of models. The research project is fully implemented in MATLAB and can be directly used with common approaches to constructing and valuating replicating portfolios of non-maturing accounts. The two main conclusions of the thesis are that the discrete jump process is flexible to the frequency and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>rate</b> change and that the current use of assumption-based volume amortization is conservative. This study recommends for risk practitioners to reexamine the savings rate models currently in use and to benchmark replicating portfolio components with those presented here...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of tax {{simplification}} on various indicators of {{the efficiency of the}} tax system and on the distribution of income. The analysis is based on a simulation model (FiFoSiM) using German income tax and household survey microdata. We model tax simplification as the abolition of a set of deductions from the tax base included in the German income tax system. We find that this form of tax base simplification leads to a reduction in the use of professional tax advice, a more equitable income distribution and an increase in tax revenue. If these measures are combined with a reduction of income tax rates to preserve revenue neutrality, the effects depend on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>rate</b> schedule adjustment. The combination with a flat rate tax implies redistribution in favour of very high incomes, and an overall increase in income inequality. Efficiency effects in terms of changes in marginal tax rates and labor supply effects are mixed. The combination with a rate schedule adjustment which preserves the directly progressive rate schedule yields a tax reform which reduces the inequality of after tax incomes. We conclude that tax simplification may improve the efficiency of the tax system without increasing inequality of after tax income.
