5|$|I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! (sometimes I Can See <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Room</b> and There's Nobody in It! {{or simply}} I Can See <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Room!)</b> is a 1961 {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is {{a painting of}} a man looking through a peephole. It formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Room...</b> and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E
500|$|We {{did three}} or four songs in {{three or four}} days. The way we was doing it, I had [...] down there along with me. We had <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> set up with candles, some nice wine a very good vibe. It was {{completely}} stripped down, like 'Mariah Carey Unplugged'. She stripped herself down to her talent. She was really trusting of me and my vision, and I was trusting of who she was.|$|E

60|$|Dominey felt {{as though}} he were {{breathing}} an atmosphere of turgid and poisoned sweetness. There was a flavour of unreality about <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> situation,--the <b>room,</b> this child woman, her beauty, her deliberate, halting speech and the strange things she said.|$|R
50|$|The Exhibition Room, 208, {{with its}} fine {{paneling}} and fireplace, {{was a gift}} from the builder at no cost to the citizens. The principal’ s office occupied <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of <b>Room</b> 202 It was beautifully paneled in dark red mahogany with a beamed ceiling and plaster medallions that were masterpieces of the plasterer’s art.|$|R
500|$|The work is {{an example}} of Lichtenstein's {{presentation}} of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It {{is considered to be a}} work on the subject of [...] "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of I Can See <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Room!</b> with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of I Can See <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Room!</b> should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as [...] "the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology.|$|E
500|$|Tesla {{theorized that}} the {{application}} of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted [...] "a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity," [...] wiring {{the walls of a}} schoolroom and, [...] "saturating [...] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.'" [...] The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.|$|E
500|$|Destiny Jones was in {{the studio}} when they were {{recording}} [...] "Daughters". [...] "We were in a big studio so Destiny was doing other things", Nas later told Vibe. [...] "She {{walked into the room}} where I was recording it and heard a few words and said, ‘What’s going on?’ <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> just started laughing and she kind of smiled and walked backwards out of the room. She didn’t know what it was about and she didn’t want to listen to it, but later on she heard the song." ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{end when}} they {{defeated}} Killian with the demon from Karl's curse, <b>the</b> Rabbit, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of <b>Room</b> 21 {{was stuck in}} Killian's lair {{even though he was}} defeated. It still looked as if they had their souls taken out as they couldn't get out as the portal closed. It looks like Room 21 will never get out.|$|R
6000|$|Below that name, {{decaying}} on the wall, {{we had the}} slow, uncanny {{feeling of}} some one {{standing there in the}} gleam and flicker from that paper torch. For a moment <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> shadowy <b>room</b> seemed full of forms and faces. Then the torch lied out, and our old guide, pointing through an archway with the blackened stump of it, said: ...|$|R
60|$|As she hovered at {{the door}} before entering, she could watch him while he walked <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room's</b> length away, and she felt a pang at sight of him. If she could have {{believed}} that he loved her, {{she could not have}} faced him, but must have turned and run away; and even as it was she grieved for him. Such a man would not have made up his mind to this step without a deep motive, if not a deep feeling. Her heart had been softened so that she could not think of frustrating his ambition, if it were no better than that, without pity. One man had made her feel very kindly toward all other men; she wished in the tender confusion of the moment that she need not reject her importunate suitor, whose importunity even she could not resent.|$|R
500|$|Sutcliffe {{was fascinated}} by the trio, but {{especially}} Kirchherr, and thought they looked like [...] "real bohemians". Bill Harry later said that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way, and that she always captivated <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room.</b> Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her and had tried to talk to Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool. (Note: Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Grafik und Werbung , although it is now called the University of Applied Sciences).|$|E
500|$|The picture teases {{the viewer}} who {{is given the}} feeling that he is in a dark room being viewed by the main subject of the {{painting}} who is a man that peeks {{through a hole in the}} door. The narrative element of the image, which included a speech bubble that presents the caption [...] "I Can See <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Room</b> and There's Nobody in It", clarifies that the man can not see anything in the room although he has a good look at it. The work is a satirical reference to abstraction because it can be imagined as a monochrome canvas that is affected by an actor that has inserted his finger as well as a narrative that also violates this imagining. This finger is also regarded as phallic.|$|E
60|$|The {{darkness}} {{began to}} tear at her nerves. She felt {{along the wall}} for the switch, and flooded <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> with light.|$|E
5000|$|Simon, Neil and Jay are sat in {{the common}} room when Carli, Simon's crush and {{childhood}} friend, inadvertently gives Simon an erection, to which Jay announces it to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> common <b>room,</b> to their amusement. Will sees {{this as an opportunity}} to make his first friend [...] "with the boy they now called 'boner'" [...] and saves Simon a seat for their next class as he is restrained by the crowd.|$|R
6000|$|... “‘We {{insist on}} seeing the editor or some {{responsible}} person,’ said the Prime Minister, and the deputation forced its way in. The boy had spoken truly; {{there was no}} one to be seen. In <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> suite of <b>rooms</b> there was no sign of human life.|$|R
50|$|On the January 26 {{episode of}} Raw, The Legacy {{came out with}} two lawyers and a therapist. Randy Orton then {{revealed}} that he suffers from IED, which causes him to experience violent outbursts when provoked, losing all control of his emotions and actions. According to Orton and his lawyers, Orton had told Stephanie McMahon that if fired, he would not only take DiBiase and Rhodes with him but <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> locker <b>room,</b> as he would bring in {{a lawsuit against the}} company.|$|R

60|$|Then {{next moment}} came a crash of thunder; {{but before the}} thunder a white light had filled <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> for a single split second.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see?" [...] said Chaffery, {{putting his}} hands under {{the tail of}} his coat. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> seemed {{snapping}} its fingers at Lewisham for a space.|$|E
60|$|The {{sitting room}} was a large apartment, which {{extended}} along <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> front of <b>the</b> house. The windows, of course, looked out towards the Jungfrau. There was a long table {{in the middle of}} the room, and one or two smaller ones in the back corners. At these tables two or three parties were seated, eating their dinners. In one of the front corners was a fireplace, with a small fire, made of pine wood, burning on the hearth. A young lady was sitting near this fire, reading. Another was at a small table near it, writing in her journal. Around the walls of the room were a great many engravings and colored lithographs of Swiss scenery; among them were several views of the Jungfrau. On <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> though perfectly plain and even rude in all its furniture and appointments, had a very comfortable and attractive appearance.|$|R
60|$|Windows are but half-way shifts at best. The true good-morning comes afield, {{and next}} to that is the thrill that greets <b>the</b> {{throwing}} your <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> wide to it. To let it trickle in at a casement is to wash in a dish. The true way {{is to take the}} sunshine with the shock of a plunge into the sea, and feel it glow and tingle all over you.|$|R
50|$|He {{then begins}} to paint <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> living <b>room</b> white, but {{finds that the}} {{bristles}} on his paintbrush are dried solid. He uses a hammer to attempt soften them, but when {{he goes into the}} living room and dips the brush into the paint, the bristles disappear into the paint, annoying Bean. In a cruel improvisation, he shoves the brush handle into Teddy's rear and uses his head to paint the walls. However, he manages to only get a few lines of paint done before accidentally dripping paint onto things.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> {{listened as}} Ruth recounted {{the trip to}} Chinatown, Mrs. Salisbury's party, and the hero {{who had once been}} a {{passenger}} in an aeroplane.|$|E
60|$|This game lasted us a {{full hour}}: {{a full hour}} by the clock sat <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> in intense silence, {{watching}} {{the man and the}} dog.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> {{was silent}} now, silent as death, {{with a dozen}} men on their feet with weapons in their hands, {{waiting to see if}} Raines would rise.|$|E
6000|$|... [Exeunt. The maskers surge {{into the}} {{foreground}} of the scene, and [...] their motions {{become more and}} more fantastic.

These also, with <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> ball- [...] <b>room,</b> gradually darken, and the music softens to silence.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely! He {{came all}} the way from Japan to confer with Fischer. Probably, if we knew <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> truth, those <b>rooms</b> at the Plaza Hotel, and the social {{partnership}} of your brother and Fischer, were arranged {{for no other reason than}} to provide a safe personality for Nikasti in this country, and a safe place for him to talk things over with Fischer." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr Shepherd was {{completely}} empowered to act; and {{no sooner had}} such an end been reached, than Anne, {{who had been a}} most attentive listener to <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> left <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said, with a gentle sigh, [...] "A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is your {{authority}} for that?" [...] Phil turned a large, bizarre ring round on his slender {{left little finger}} and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> waited, testing this positive-spoken outsider.|$|E
6000|$|... "He speaks our language," [...] quoth the Emperor at the last; and I swear {{there was}} such a relinquishment of held breaths that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> was one vast sigh.|$|E
6000|$|In his {{excitement}} Stinchfield turned off both light and current, and left <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> in darkness. Victor {{was on his}} feet crying out: [...] "She has fallen! She is dying!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Electrotyping {{was also}} used to produce entire {{printing}} plates directly from the formes composed from movable type and illustrations. In this application, electrotyping was a higher quality but more costly alternative to stereotyping, which involved casting of type metal into a mold prepared from the forme. Stereotyping had been invented around 1725, and was already well-established when electrotyping was invented in 1838. Both methods yielded plates that could be preserved in case of future needs, for example in the printing of novels and other books of unpredictable popularity. The movable type used to compose the original forme could then be re-used. Both methods {{could be used to}} prepared curved plates for rotary presses, which were used for the longest print runs. The widespread adoption of electrotyping for this use occurred after mechanical electrical generators (dynamos) became commonly available around 1872. These generators supplanted <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>rooms</b> of chemical batteries (Smee cells) that were previously used to provide electricity for electrotyping. Batteries did not have the electrical capacity needed to rapidly deposit the electrotype (or [...] "electro"). The advent of plating dynamos sped up electrotyping twenty times or more, so that an electrotype printing plate could be deposited in less than two hours. In addition, the chemical batteries gave off toxic fumes that had required their isolation in separate rooms.|$|R
60|$|While he {{considered}} this perplexing {{question and the}} others stood looking at him as their leader, a queer thing happened. The floor of the great circular hall on which they were standing suddenly began to tip. Instead of being flat and level, it became a slant, and the slant grew steeper and steeper until none of the party could manage to stand upon it. Presently they all slid down to the wall, which was now under them, and then it became evident that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> vast <b>room</b> was slowly turning upside down! Only Ugu the Shoemaker, kept {{in place by the}} bars of his golden cage, remained in his former position, and the wicked magician seemed to enjoy the surprise of his victims immensely.|$|R
40|$|Food has {{a number}} of {{functional}} properties that can support the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure and, theoretically, one of these is the thermic effect of food. Including high-protein foods in meals may be advantageous in contributing to energy expenditure but, in practice, the evidence needs to relate to specific foods and normal dietary conditions. Using <b>the</b> human <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> calorimeter facility, we conducted three studies to examine the effects of: (i) higher and lower levels of protein on energy expenditure; (ii) high-protein meals using different foods to deliver the protein; and (iii) omnivorous and vegetarian cuisines in meal tests before and after a period of dietary intervention for weight loss. The meal effect of protein does not appear to differ between foods, and while high-protein diets might support weight loss, {{it may be difficult to}} prove a metabolic cause in the free-living environment...|$|R
