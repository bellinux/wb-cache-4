500|$|In 1931 RKO Pictures offered Olivier a two-film {{contract}} at $1,000 a week; {{he discussed}} the possibility with Coward, who, irked, told Olivier [...] "You've no artistic integrity, that's your trouble; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> cheapen yourself." [...] He accepted {{and moved to}} Hollywood, despite some misgivings. His first film was the drama Friends and Lovers, in a supporting role, before RKO loaned him to Fox Studios for his first film lead, a British journalist in a Russia under martial law in The Yellow Passport, alongside Elissa Landi and Lionel Barrymore. The cultural historian Jeffrey Richards describes Olivier's look as an attempt by Fox Studios to produce a likeness of Ronald Colman, and Colman's moustache, voice and manner are [...] "perfectly reproduced". Olivier returned to RKO to complete his contract with the 1932 drama Westward Passage, which was a commercial failure. Olivier's initial foray into American films had not provided the breakthrough he hoped for; disillusioned with Hollywood, he returned to London, where he appeared in two British films, Perfect Understanding with Gloria Swanson and No Funny Business—in which Esmond also appeared. He was tempted back to Hollywood in 1933 to appear opposite Greta Garbo in Queen Christina, but was replaced {{after two weeks of}} filming {{because of a lack of}} chemistry between the two.|$|E

2500|$|Omar Ibn Said (c. 1770–1864) {{is among}} the best {{documented}} examples of a practicing-Muslim slave. He lived on a 19th Century North Carolina plantation and wrote many Arabic texts while enslaved. Born {{in the kingdom of}} Futa Tooro (modern Senegal), he arrived in America in 1807, one month before the U.S. abolished importation of slaves. Some of his works include the Lords Prayer, the Bismillah, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>How</b> <b>You</b> Pray, Quranic phases, the 23rd Psalm, and an autobiography. In 1857, he produced his last known writing on Surah 110 of the Quran. In 1819, Omar received an Arabic translation of the Christian Bible from his master, James Owen. Omar converted to Christianity in 1820, an episode widely used throughout the South to [...] "prove" [...] the benevolence of slavery. However, most scholars believe he continued to be a practicing Muslim, based on dedications to Muhammad written in his Bible.|$|E

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised the film, saying, [...] "Don't let anyone spoil the wildly hilarious surprises. Ferrell and Wahlberg will double your fun. Guaranteed." [...] Some critics praised The Other Guys as the best police film of the year, comparing the film to the critically panned Cop Out, with Richard Roeper stating, [...] "Note to Kevin Smith: <b>THIS</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> do a spoof of the buddy-cop genre," [...] and Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger said in his mixed review, [...] "Measured against this year's other police farce—remember Cop Out?—it looks absolutely heroic." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Rutgers, Díaz worked at Rutgers University Press as an {{editorial}} assistant. At this time Diaz also first created the quasi-autobiographical character of Yunior {{in a story}} he used {{as part of his}} application for his MFA program in the early 1990s. The character would become important to much of his later work including Drown and <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>How</b> <b>You</b> Lose Her. Yunior would become central to much of Diaz's work, Diaz later explaining how [...] "My idea, ever since Drown, was to write six or seven books about him that would form one big novel". He earned his MFA from Cornell University in 1995, where he wrote most of his first collection of short stories. Currently, Díaz teaches creative writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the Rudge and Nancy Allen Professor of Writing and is also the fiction editor for Boston Review. He is active in the Dominican American community and is {{a founding member of the}} Voices of Our Nation Arts Foundation, which focuses on writers of color.
