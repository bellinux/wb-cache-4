5|$|Cicero {{decided to}} stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a <b>time,</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> he perused Atticus's library, reading any and all books that dealt with {{overcoming}} grief. Unsatisfied with what he found, he relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. It was during this time that he also wrote the famed—and now lost—dialogue Hortensius. Cicero later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally, but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness.|$|E

5|$|After the German reunification, the East German {{football}} association {{joined the}} DFB. The East German women's national football team had played only one official international match, losing 0–3 to Czechoslovakia {{in a friendly}} match on 9 May 1990. The unified German team defended their title successfully at the 1991 European Championship. After winning all games in the qualifying group, Germany again met Italy in the semi-final, this time winning 3–0. On 14 July 1991, the German team once more faced Norway in the final. The game went to extra <b>time,</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> Heidi Mohr and Silvia Neid scored for Germany and secured the 3–1 victory.|$|E
5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Rihanna is walking towards a {{dressing}} room mirror while {{preparing for a}} show. This is intercut with scenes of Rihanna with her boyfriend in a restaurant. While they talk to each other, Rihanna's boyfriend leaves the table and is absent for some <b>time,</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> Rihanna watches the other tables.

Rihanna starts to sing the song's lyrics while she leaves the dressing room and approaches the stage, where she continues singing while a man plays a piano on the stage. The arena is empty and it appears as though Rihanna is rehearsing.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended <b>time</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E

5|$|First {{hinted at}} in December 1999, Resident Evil 4 {{underwent}} a long development <b>time</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> four proposed {{versions of the}} game were discarded. Initially developed for the PlayStation 2, the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him {{to create a new}} entry in the Resident Evil series. Nevertheless, it was decided to start development over again. The game was intended to be a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but a PlayStation 2 version was announced before the game was released for the GameCube. Resident Evil 4 was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and in downsized versions for iOS, Zeebo, and Android (exclusive to Samsung devices outside of Japan).|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} time in three years, Žigić was chosen as {{domestic}} player {{of the year in the}} captains' poll, and was also honoured by the Red Star Sport Association as best male athlete of 2005, an award open to athletes representing the club in any sport, not just in football. After Pantelić's departure for Hertha BSC, Red Star's goals were spread more evenly among the remaining forward players. In the league, Žigić and Boško Janković were joint-top scorers with 12, and Purović contributed one fewer, as the club won their 24th title. They completed the double with a defeat of city rivals OFK in the cup final, coming back from 2–0 down via Žigić's 67th-minute free kick under the defensive wall and Purović's equaliser to take the match into extra <b>time,</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> Žigić gave Red Star the lead with a header and Dušan Basta made the final score 4–2. After the match, Žigić refused to answer questions about his Red Star future.|$|E
5|$|The Fire {{then turned}} their {{attention}} to their second and final qualification match hosted by the San Jose Earthquakes at Buck Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Played on May 24, 2011, in front of 4,124 spectators, the hosts took a two-goal lead in the first half with Ellis McLoughlin and Justin Morrow scoring in the 14th and 43rd minutes, respectively. The Fire halved the deficit in the 61st minute with a goal from Orr Barouch. Fifteen minutes later the Fire tied the score with a strike from Yamith Cuesta. The score remained tied until the end of regulation, leading to extra <b>time,</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> Chicago's Gonzalo Segares was ejected for dissent. Despite the Earthquakes' man advantage, the two sides remained tied during overtime, prompting a penalty shootout. In the fifth round of penalties, with Chicago leading 5–4, San Jose's Scott Sealy missed his shot as it deflected off the crossbar, giving the Fire a second qualifier victory and a berth into the third round of the 2011 U.S. Open Cup tournament.|$|E

5|$|The referee {{added two}} minutes of injury time {{at the end of}} extra <b>time,</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> time Manchester United won another free kick, but Scholes' shot was {{straight}} at the Arsenal defensive wall. Then, with just seconds left in regulation time, Ronaldo made a break towards the Arsenal half, only to be cynically body-checked by Reyes. Referee Styles made no hesitation and showed Reyes a second yellow card, making the Spaniard the second player to be sent off in an FA Cup Final, after Manchester United's Kevin Moran in 1985. The full-time whistle went immediately after Reyes' dismissal, and the match finished at 0–0, making it the first FA Cup Final to result in a penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to {{the first generation of}} fixed installation surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) such as SA-2 and SA-3 was the development of the anti-radiation missile such as AGM-45 Shrike and other means to attack fixed SAM installations, as well as developing SEAD doctrines. The Soviet counter-response was the use of mobile SAMs such as SA-6 with intermittent use of radar. Thus, the SAM battery was only visible for a small period of <b>time,</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> it was also a significant threat to high-value Wild Weasel fighters. In 1982 Operation Mole Cricket 19 various means including UAVs and air-launched Samson decoys were used over suspected SAM areas to saturate enemy SAMs and to bait them to activate their radar systems, which were then attacked by anti-radiation missiles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first <b>time</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Observations {{show that}} nuptial flight {{does not occur}} before February. This is based on larvae {{spinning}} into cocoons by November, and by January, these cocoons could not produce adult workers or reproductive males and females. Queens are most likely fertilised by males sometime between February and April; however, scientists have seen alates engage in nuptial flight during March. Before emerging from their parent nest, queens will shed their wings inside the nest and mate with low-flying males nearby. After nuptial flight, a queen will isolate herself and form a small chamber underground, where she remains for seven to eight months. However, it is improbable that a queen can survive on her own storage of fat and wing-musculature for that long. During this time, the queen may emerge from her nest occasionally, but she will only lay eggs from October to November {{when there is a}} rich supply of food. While this may be the case, some queens will lay eggs after a month of isolation during winter. M.regularis is a semi-clasutral ant, meaning that a queen will go out and forage in order to feed her young. Queens will emerge from their nests from time to <b>time,</b> <b>during</b> <b>which</b> they will capture insects for their young or feed on sweet substances. If food sources are deprived, a queen will only rely on her fat to feed the larvae until she perishes or finds food, but the larvae will not be cannibalised, and remain alive until a week after the queen's death. An individual ant may take eight months to develop from an egg to an adult.|$|E
