40|$|Sequentially {{randomized}} {{designs are}} becoming common in biomedical research, particularlyin clinical trials. These trials are usually designed {{to evaluate and}} compare the effect ofdifferent <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes.</b> In such designs, eligible patients are first randomly assignedto receive one of the initial treatments. Patients meeting some criteria (e. g. no progressive diseases) are then randomized to receive one of the maintenance treatments. Usually, the procedure continues until all treatment options are exhausted. Such multistage treatment assignment results in dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> consisting of initial treatment, intermediate response and second stage treatment. However, methods for effcient analysis of sequentially randomized trials have only been developed very recently. As a result, earlier clinical trials reported results based only on the comparison of stage-specific treatments. We first propose to use accelerated failure time and proportional hazards models for estimating the effects of <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> from sequentially randomized designs. Based onthe proposed models, differences between <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> {{in terms of their}} hazards aretested. We investigate the properties of these methods and tests in a Monte Carlo simulationstudy. Finally the proposed models are applied to the long-term outcome of the high riskneuroblastoma study. We then extend the proportional hazards model to a generalized Cox proportional hazards model that applies to comparisons of any combination of any number of <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> regardless of the number of stages of treatment. Contrasts of dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> are tested using the Wald chi-square method. Both the model and Wald chi-square tests of contrasts are illustrated through a simulation study and an application to a high risk neuroblastoma study to complement the earlier results reported on this study. Chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases are major causes of mortality and morbidity in the United States and in the world. Sequentially randomized designs arecommonly used in clinical studies investigating treatments of chronic diseases such as cancer,AIDS, and depression. The public health significance of the methodologies proposed in thisresearch is to allow efficient analysis of data from such studies and thereby enhance thediscovery of efficient maintenance and eradication strategies for chronic diseases...|$|R

There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated {{due to a lack}} of good quality evidence. The optimal <b>treatment</b> <b>regime</b> may be a both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, tibial nerve stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy). A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.|$|E

By empirical examples, from stories by both therapists and patients, the article describes how the actors navigate between the two <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes,</b> to which the patients must necessarily adapt in their wish for acceptance and assistance from both sides.

40|$|Dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> operationalize the {{clinical}} decision {{process as a}} sequence of functions, one for each clinical decision, where each function takes as input up-to-date patient information and gives as output a single recommended treatment. Current methods for estimating optimal dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes,</b> for example Q-learning, require the specification of a single outcome by which the `goodness' of competing dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> are measured. However, this is an over-simplification of the goal of clinical decision making, which aims to balance several potentially competing outcomes. For example, often a balance must be struck between treatment effectiveness and side-effect burden. We propose a method for constructing dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> that accommodates competing outcomes by recommending sets of treatments at each decision point. Formally, we construct a sequence of set-valued functions that take as input up-to-date patient information and give as output a recommended subset of the possible treatments. For a given patient history, the recommended set of treatments contains all treatments that are not inferior according {{to any of the}} competing outcomes. When {{there is more than one}} decision point, constructing these set-valued functions requires solving a non-trivial enumeration problem. We offer an exact enumeration algorithm by recasting the problem as a linear mixed integer program.

40|$|In recent years, {{personalized}} medicine and dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> have drawn considerable attention and two-stage randomization {{is commonly used}} to gather data for making inference on dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes.</b> Meanwhile, more and more practitioners become aware of competing risk censoring, where subjects are exposed {{to more than one}} possible failure and the event of interest may be dependently censored by the occurrence of competing events. We aim to compare several <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> from a two-stage randomized trial on survival outcomes that are subject to competing-risk censoring. With the presence of competing risks, cumulative incidence function (CIF) has been widely used to quantify the cumulative probability of occurrence of the target event by a specific time point. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we propose non-parametric estimators for the CIF using inverse weighting, and provide inference procedures based on the asymptotic linear representation to help compare the CIFs from two different <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes.</b> Through simulation, we show the practicality and advantages of the proposed estimators and apply them to data from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial. Next, we propose a pattern-mixture type estimator for the CIF. Pattern-mixture models stratify data according to dropout patterns, make estimates of a certain parameter on each stratum, and obtain the final estimate by taking a weighted average of these estimates. We show that this approach can be borrowed for estimating the CIF under a two-stage randomization. We investigate its properties using simulation and apply it to the CALGB data. In the third part, we focus on regression analysis under a two-stage randomization setting. Even though extensive research is being carried out by researchers on the regression problem for dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes,</b> no research has been done on modeling the CIF when a two-stage randomization has been carried out. We extend the multi-state (Cheng et al., 1998), Fine and Gray (1999) and Scheike et al. (2008) regression models for modeling the CIF of dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> and provide ways to implement the proposed models in R using the existing packages.

40|$|Various methods {{exist for}} causal {{inference}} {{about the effects}} of different treatments from observational studies or randomized trials. A straightforward approach is to fit a regression model of the outcome {{as a function of the}} treatment they received along with observed patient characteristics. Other methods, such as inverse probability weighting, work by instead estimating a patient's probability of receiving treatment and weighting the outcomes by the inverse of this probability. Doubly Robust estimators use both models and provide unbiased estimates as long as either the probability of treatment or outcome is correctly modeled. These techniques can be extended to analyze and compare dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes,</b> that is, multiple stages of treatment punctuated by decision points concerning what the next treatment should be. This dissertation is concerned with developing more efficient doubly robust estimators for two-stage dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes,</b> first without and later, with data missing at random. First, we develop a new inverse probability of treatment weighted and doubly robust estimators for analyzing dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes.</b> Then we compare these methods to the corresponding existing methods for estimating the mean outcome of dynamic <b>treatment</b> <b>regimes</b> in a simulation. We utilize the new doubly robust estimator in the analysis of the STAR*D trial to estimate the mean outcome of patients on different <b>regimes</b> for the <b>treatment</b> of non-psychotic major depressive disorder. Finally we propose a modification of the new inverse probability of treatment weighted and doubly robust estimators in order to account for missing data...|$|R
