50|$|Linear Heat Detection (LHD) {{cable is}} {{essentially}} a <b>two-core</b> <b>cable</b> terminated by an end-of-line resistor (resistance varies with application). The two cores are separated by a polymer plastic, {{that is designed to}} melt at a specific temperature (commonly 68 °C for building applications), and without which causes the two cores to short. This {{can be seen as a}} change in resistance in the wire.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—it was {{important}} to study the shielded effectiveness to reduce the electromagnetic interference and to protect electronic components. in this paper, the boundary element equation of linear segment {{was derived from the}} two-dimension boundary integral equation and linear interpolating function, and the formulas of potential and electric field intensity were also given. To demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the LBEM (linear boundary element method), the influence of the deformation degree of shielded deformed coaxial cable compared with the multipole theory on the results were discussed. Taking the overhead shielded coaxial cable and the overhead shielded <b>two-core</b> <b>cable</b> of ring seam as the research objects. The influences of ring seam in shielded effectiveness were analyzed by applying the LBEM with Matlab. The engineering example results showed that for overhead shield <b>two-core</b> <b>cable,</b> the change of coupling capacitance was related with the ring seam in deep layer of overhead shield <b>two-core</b> <b>cable</b> at the location of parallel core distance; and the change tendency of coupling capacitor with the ring seam at the vertical core distance was almost the same as the ring seam at the parallel core distance. But, when the ring seam depth was quite deep, very likely one core was exposed, and then the coupling capacitor decreased rapidly. Therefore the study of coupling effectiveness was instructive for more effective to defense EMI and will improve the overhead shielded cable electromagnetic compatibility.

50|$|Residential {{dwellings}} {{almost always}} take supply {{from the low}} voltage distribution lines or cables that run past the dwelling. These operate at voltages of between 110 and 260 volts (phase-to-earth) depending upon national standards. A few decades ago small dwellings would be fed a single phase using a dedicated <b>two-core</b> service <b>cable</b> (one core for the active phase and one core for the neutral return). The active line would then be run through a main isolating switch in the fuse box and then split into one or more circuits to feed lighting and appliances inside the house. By convention, the lighting and appliance circuits are kept separate so the failure of an appliance does not leave the dwelling's occupants in the dark. All circuits would be fused with an appropriate fuse based upon the wire size used for that circuit. Circuits would have both an active and neutral wire with both the lighting and power sockets being connected in parallel. Sockets would also be provided with a protective earth. This would {{be made available to}} appliances to connect to any metallic casing. If this casing were to become live, the theory is the connection to earth would cause an RCD or fuse to trip—thus preventing the future electrocution of an occupant handling the appliance. Earthing systems vary between regions, but in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia both the protective earth and neutral line would be earthed together near the fuse box before the main isolating switch and the neutral earthed once again back at the distribution transformer.|$|R
