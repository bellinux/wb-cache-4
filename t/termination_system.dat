50|$|The {{process of}} {{transcriptional}} termination is less well understood in eukaryotes, which have extensive post-transcriptional RNA processing. Each {{of the three}} types of eukaryotic RNA polymerase has a different <b>termination</b> <b>system.</b> Eukaryotic termination factors bind to the termination signal region and disturb RNA polymerase II as it moves by, causing it to fall off the DNA strand within the next 300 base pairs.

These TTS valves are completely independent {{from the rest of}} the vehicle systems. The TTS also stops the laser in the ALHAT's Hazard Detection System from firing - since Type IV lasers are not eye safe.|$|E
5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem <b>termination</b> <b>systems</b> with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|R
