As such she was called to the witness box by Cecil Whiteley (who was Treasury Counsel at <b>the</b> <b>time)</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through her statement line by line. She was physically exhausted and fainted four times in the witness box; this and other interruptions meant that the initial hearing took four days.

The action in Atlas Shrugged takes place {{at a time when}} society has reached the stage of dictatorship.
