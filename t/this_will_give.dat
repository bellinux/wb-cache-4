The southern entrance at Station Street will form the main drop-off area for cars and taxis, allowing the existing drop-off area to be enclosed within the concourse. There are six voids above the railway tracks, and so {{as part of the}} proposals, the void adjacent to Queens Drive, to the east of the station, will be covered to create a new public square. A new walkway will be created from the Queens Drive entrance along the largest eastern void, {{around the back of the}} Odeon cinema to the Bull Ring. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> visitors a direct and signed link to Birmingham Moor Street railway station. Most of the parapet walls to the voids will be redecorated with new cladding or art features, with the exception of those adjacent to the Signal Box which can only be cleaned.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the basic}} {{indicator}} system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and variable-frequency drives.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} of those arrangements is when rooks are symmetric about {{the centre of}} the board. Let us designate with Gn the number of arrangements in which n rooks are placed on a board with n ranks and n files. Now let us make the board to contain 2n ranks and 2n files. A rook on the first file can be placed on any of the 2n squares of that file. According to the symmetry condition, placement of this rook defines the placement of the rook that stands on the last file − it must be arranged symmetrically to the first rook about the board centre. Let us remove the first and the last files and the ranks that are occupied by rooks (since the number of ranks is even, the removed rooks cannot stand on the same rank). <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> a board of 2n−2 files and 2n−2 ranks. It is clear that to each symmetric arrangement of rooks on the new board corresponds a symmetric arrangement of rooks on the original board. Therefore, G2n = 2nG2n−2 (the factor 2n in this expression comes from the possibility for the first rook to occupy any of the 2n squares on the first file). By iterating the above formula one reaches to the case of a 22 board, on which there are 2 symmetric arrangements (on the diagonals). As a result of this iteration, the final expression is G2n = 2n'n! For the usual chessboard (88), G8 = 244! = 1624 = 384 centrally symmetric arrangements of 8 rooks. One such arrangement is shown in Fig. 2.|$|E

While the bottle is held in place, the lid is removed, the user's mouth is placed on the bottle opening, and the user inhales as the bottle is pushed back down into the water.

500|$|The {{arguments}} for light rail were mainly {{related to the}} environment, urban development and reduction in road congestion. Light rail is estimated to increase {{the use of public}} transport from Fana, reducing both local and global pollution. The roads do not have capacity for further growth, and any increase in public transport would need to be taken along the light rail routes on buses—this would give higher operating costs for public transport or higher investment costs for roads. Around the stations, high-density commercial and residential centers can be established. Opponents of the project argued that it is unfair that public transport be funded by car drivers through toll roads. Protests from people in northern and western areas of the city have risen, since they are paying for the system but will not receive the benefits. Another issue has been speed: the line to Nesttun has 15 stops in , giving an average speed of [...] For people living south of Nesttun, <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> a longer travel time to the city center than with direct buses that do not make intermediate stops.|$|E
