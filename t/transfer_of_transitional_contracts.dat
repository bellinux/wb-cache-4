40|$|Backward-facing step heat <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> and {{turbulent}} flows {{occurs in}} many industrial applications. The heat <b>transfer</b> performances <b>of</b> different multiphase working fluids over a backward-facing {{step in the}} transitional and turbulent flow regimes, however, have not been fully investigated experimentally. Recently, highly crumpled few-layer graphene (HCFLG) with a high surface area has been introduced as a promising additive for preparing nanofluids for high performance heat transfer applications. In this work, the heat <b>transfer</b> properties <b>of</b> the HCFLG nanofluids were studied experimentally. The HCFLG was prepared by exfoliation of graphite {{in the presence of}} liquid-phase using microwave-assisted methods, which was shown to be industrially-scalable, cost-effective, and simple. Then the HCFLG was used for fabricating a new class of water-based graphene nanofluid for use in large-scale heat transfer equipment. The prepared water-based HCFLG nanofluids were shown to be stable with less than 2 % sedimentation after 30 days. In addition, the measured thermophysical properties indicated that the water-based HCFLG nanofluids have huge potential for high performance heat transfer applications. Finally, the water-based HCFLG nanofluids were shown to be significantly more effective in the duct with a backward-facing step in terms of overall thermal performance including the local Nusselt number (Nu), convective heat transfer coefficient, performance index, pumping power, and rheological properties such as effective viscosity in comparison to distilled water...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn New Caledonia, {{one third}} of the Island is {{composed}} of ultramafic rocks, and lateritic soils enriched in Fe, Ni and Cr. Open-cast mining occurs all around the Island, and processes of erosion and sedimentation, which occur naturally along the coastline, are strongly amplified by mining activities. Due to their position, at the interface between land and sea, mangroves receive extensive amounts of particles emanating from rivers through estuaries. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the distribution and partitioning <b>of</b> some <b>transitional</b> metals (Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr) in sediments and pore-waters in a mangrove swamp, which is situated downstream of a catchment characterized by lateritic soils that were exploited a century ago. Quantitative analyses on bulk and after selective extraction, were carried out on cores collected along a transect within the intertidal zone, i. e. beneath a Rhizophora stylosa stand, an Avicennia marina stand, and within a salt flat. Mean metal concentrations were (μmol g- 1) : Fe (1997) >Ni (44. 2) >Cr (31. 9) >Mn (8. 8). Thus, Ni, Cr and Fe concentrations in this study are substantially higher than mangrove world average. In addition, Ni concentrations are 10 to 100 times higher than in other New Caledonian mangrove developing downstream of a catchment not composed of ultramafic rocks. The studied mangrove is characterized by gradients of water and organic contents with depth and along the intertidal zone, which induced different redox conditions, and thus different metals partitioning. Transitional metals are deposited in the mangrove mainly as oxides and/or oxyhydroxydes, that are subsequently dissolved by bacteria for the decomposition of organic matter, and which leads to a strong increase of metals in the dissolved phase. Then, dissolved metals precipitated with organic and sulphide compounds. To conclude, organic diagenesis in mangrove sediments leads to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> metals from oxide form to organic and sulphide forms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{describes}} an experimental study on friction and heat <b>transfer</b> performances <b>of</b> a <b>transitional</b> airflow in a rectangular channel with stagger-arrayed short pin fins. Friction factors, average Nusselt numbers and overall thermal performances <b>of</b> the <b>transitional</b> flow are obtained. The experimental study has {{showed that the}} pin fins enhance the heat transfer performance significantly, however increasing the flow frictional resistance considerably. After comparing the experimental results with the published data in references, {{it can be concluded}} that, in the transitional flow region, the pin fin channels of the proposed geometrical configuration could lead to a significant improvement of an overall thermal performance; for instance, the convective heat transfer performance is increased by at least 68 %. By contrast, in the fully turbulent flow region, the ability of the proposed pin fin channels to increase heat transfer performances decreases as the Reynolds number increases. When Re > 6 000, the overall thermal performance becomes lower than the others...|$|R

40|$|The {{unsteady}} flow and temperature fields of an impinging hot jet at a Reynolds number of 1000 and a nozzle-to-plate distance of 6 jet diameters {{have been obtained}} by direct numerical solution of the compressible time-dependent three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations using highly accurate numerical methods. Effects of an external perturbation on the flow and heat <b>transfer</b> characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>transitional</b> impinging jet have been examined. Oscillatory behaviour induced by the external perturbation has been observed for the impinging jet. The external perturbation leads to the large-scale vortical structures in the primary jet stream, which subsequently lead to the strong oscillatory behaviour of the impinging jet. The vortical structures lead to flow transitional behaviour that enhances mixing of the hot jet with the ambient fluid. It has been observed that the wall boundary layer of the impinging jet is thin. Both the instantaneous and time-averaged wall shear and normal stresses and Nusselt number are examined. Although the external perturbation strongly affects the flow structures in the primary jet stream, {{it does not have}} significant effects on the wall stresses and heat <b>transfer</b> characteristics <b>of</b> the impinging jet due to the re-laminarization effect of the wall.

40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} reappraisal <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice through {{the study of}} the nature and {{function}} {{of the rule of law}} it conveys. As originally conceived, transitional justice embraces a concept of the rule of law that is sensitive to the conditions of the political transition, in which law is caught in inexorable tensions between the past and the future. Yet, the increasing use <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice to deal with armed conflicts and human rights violations irrespective of any political transition has created a conceptual and normative disorder, which leads to assimilating the use <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> mechanisms to that <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice. Should transitional justice apply to situations other than those of political transition? In what other transition-like situations is a sui generis concept of the rule of law justified? Can transitional justice mechanisms be used in situations other than political transitions? The author analyzes these questions bearing in mind that an enlarged and unjustified use <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice may render the concept <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice analytically, descriptively, and normatively meaningless to law. The case study of Colombia shows the perverse effects of conceptual vagueness and brings to light the practical impacts that using an enlarged conception <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice has upon the ordinary rule of law.

40|$|Please do not cite or {{circulate}} {{without permission}} of the author* The study <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice has benefited from extensive empirical analysis of accountability for atrocities. Specifically, the field of international relations has taken notice of the increasing institutionalization of international criminal law through ad hoc tribunals and the International Criminal Court (ICC), and the role that human rights norms and norm entrepreneurs have played in reconstructing deeply divided societies. But, how can international relations scholars theorize across the case studies <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice and give due attention to context? What do we make of the consistencies and inconsistencies <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice institutions? While the practice <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice does not represent a series of unrelated cases that are solely the result of domestic contexts and actors, can we {{go so far as}} to say that that this phenomenon of international relations constitutes a norm or an international institution? I argue that we can theorize about transitional justice as a normative structure: a systemic and systematic collection of norms that constrains and enables the decision makers <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> justice, and importantly, if not exclusively, constitute the corresponding institutional designs.

40|$|In-cylinder heat <b>transfer</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{critical}} physical behaviors which has a direct influence on engine out emission and thermal efficiency for IC engine. In-cylinder wall temperature has to be precisely controlled to achieve high efficiency and low emission. However, this cannot be done without knowing gas-to-wall heat flux. This study reports {{on the development of}} a technique suitable for engine in-cylinder surface temperature measurement, as the traditional method is “hard to reach. ” A laser induced phosphorescence technique was used to study in-cylinder wall temperature effects on engine out unburned hydrocarbons during the engine transitional period (warm up). A linear correlation was found between the cylinder wall surface temperature and the unburned hydrocarbons at mediate and high charge densities. At low charge density, no clear correlation was observed because of miss-fire events. A new auto background correction infrared (IR) diagnostic was developed to measure the instantaneous in-cylinder surface temperature at 0. 1 CAD resolution. A numerical mechanism was designed to suppress relatively low-frequency background noise and provide an accurate in-cylinder surface temperature measurements with an error of less than 1. 4 % inside the IC engine. In addition, a proposed optical coating reduced time delay errors by 50 % compared to more conventional thermocouple techniques. A new cycle-averaged (〖Re〗_s) ̅ number was developed for an IC engine to capture the characteristics of engine flow. Comparison and scaling between different engine flow parameters are available by matching the averaged (〖Re〗_s) ̅ number. From experimental results, the engine flow motion was classified as intermittently turbulent, and it is different from the original fully developed turbulent assumption, which has previously been used in almost all engine simulations. The intermittent turbulence could have a great impact on engine heat <b>transfer</b> because <b>of</b> the <b>transitional</b> turbulence effect. Engine 3 D CFD model further proves the existence <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> turbulence flow. A new multi zone heat transfer model is proposed for IC engines only. The model includes pressure work effects and improved heat transfer prediction compared to the standard Law of the wall model...|$|R

40|$|Writing {{is one way}} of {{communication}} that enables people to communicate with others through a written text. As a way {{of communication}}, writing must be effective; and one requirement of an effective writing is coherence. One way that can make a writing being coherent is by using transitional words that has a function to tie the ideas together. Dealing with the use <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words; this study tries analyzing the use <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words in five essays written by the students of English department of the state Islamic University of Malang and their contribution in achieving coherence within paragraph and between paragraphs. This study uses descriptive qualitative research because the researcher discussed, analyzed and found the phenomena which occur naturally; it is not controlled or based on laboratory research. In this research, the researcher firstly analyzes transitional words used in those essays and then classified them based on their types. After finding the transitional words used, the researcher analyzes their contribution in making coherence within paragraph or between paragraphs on each essays. The finding of the analysis is then discussed and presented in the form of words and table. After analyzing the data, it is found that there are seven types <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words used in the first essay. In the second essay, there are five types <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words. Moreover, the analysis on the third essay found that there are six types <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words and in the fourth essay, the writer uses five types <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words. Finally, the last essay uses five types <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words. Dealing with the second problem, it is found that, in the first essay, the transitional words used only contribute the achievement of coherence in the first paragraph. In addition, they do not support the achievement of coherence between paragraphs. In the second essay, the use <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> word adds the achievement of coherence in the second paragraph only. They also assist coherence achievement of the whole essay. In the third essay, the use <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words supports the achievement of coherence in the first paragraph only and do not contribute coherence achievement of the whole essay. Furthermore, in the fourth essay, the use <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words contributes the achievement of coherence in the first and fourth paragraph only. Finally, the use <b>of</b> <b>transitional</b> words in the fifth essay only adds the achievement of coherence in the first, fourth, and fifth paragraph.
