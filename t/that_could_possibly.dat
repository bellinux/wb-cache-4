5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was {{the first}} serious attempt by a {{biologist}} to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet {{in the solar system}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> support life, mainly {{because it was the only}} one in which water could exist in the liquid phase. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so. Einsteinium was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{characteristically}} intermittent eruptions {{of active}} volcanoes such as Lassen Peak, {{there is some}} threat from the volcanoes of the LVNP. Dacitic explosive eruptions have taken place within the last 50,000 years at Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and Sunflower Flat, and effusive eruptions of basalt have occurred at Tumble Buttes, Hat Mountain, and Prospect Peak. Pyroclastic flows and lahars could easily occur near glaciated areas and in river valleys like Hat Creek Valley. In addition to the volcanic hazards <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> occur, one volcano did erupt in the 20th century in LVNP: (Lassen Peak). Lassen's eruptions (1914-21, though most activity occurred between 1914-17) were very small compared to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} much debate about the {{symbolic}} meaning of the helmet's design. The griffin was the companion of Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance and fate. They were both seen as agents of death and were often linked with gladiatorial combat. The meaning of the face and headpiece are less clearly identifiable. Suggestions have ranged from the Greek god Attis and the hero Perseus, to the Roman gods Mithras and Jupiter Dolichenus, to a more general Eastern Mediterranean appearance <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have been meant to suggest a Trojan identity. The Phrygian cap was often used by the Romans as a visual motif representing the Trojans.|$|E
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} techniques, such as hazard mapping, {{displays a}} volcano's eruptive history in detail and speculates {{an understanding of}} the hazardous activity <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be expected in the future. A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada. The information has been collected in a lengthy, separate way from the support of several employees, such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists. Current knowledge is best established at Mount Meager in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt of southwestern British Columbia and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project. Knowledge at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is not as established, but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley, another volcano in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. An intensive program classifiying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts.|$|E

5|$|Upon investigation, {{the crew}} find that Worf's RNA has an unusual quantum {{signature}} and confirm {{that he is}} from a different universe. The crew theorizes that Worf, on his original return from the bat'leth tournament, passed through a time-space fissure, with the shuttlecraft's engines causing Worf to quantum flux between several parallel universes. Data determines that Worf's proximity to La Forge's VISOR caused Worf to shift between universes, and that each universe covers a different possibility. In effect, anything <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> happen has done so in a parallel universe, hence the believable changes in the reality that Worf is experiencing. The Enterprise returns {{to the location of}} the fissure, attempting to return Worf to his original universe. The Enterprise is then attacked by a Bajoran ship, which causes the fissure to destabilize and the various realities to merge, resulting in over 285,000 versions of the Enterprise appearing in the same area of space.|$|E

25|$|At one time, {{traditional}} spiritual {{practices were}} prohibited by authorities, still, some knowledge about these ways survived. The last shaman in Sireniki died around 1990. Since then {{there has been}} no shaman in the village. Scholars observed shamanic practices among the Sireniki in the early 20th century. A folklore tale text mentions a feast <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> include shamanic features.|$|E
25|$|Europa {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the locations in the Solar System <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> harbor microbial extraterrestrial life. Immediately following the Galileo spacecraft's discoveries, JPL conducted preliminary mission studies that envisioned a capable spacecraft such as the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (a $16B mission concept), the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (a $4.3B concept), an orbiter ($2B concept), and a multi-flyby spacecraft: Europa Clipper.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{eventually}} became a waiting game in which the Muslims {{did not want to}} attack an army <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be numerically superior and wanted the Franks to come out into the open. The Franks formed up in a thick defensive formation and waited for them to charge uphill. The battle finally began on the seventh day, as 'Abd-al-Raḥmân did not want to wait any longer with winter approaching.|$|E

25|$|In Laos, {{there is}} a planned dam across the Mekong River. This could {{threaten}} {{the existence of the}} endangered Irrawaddy Dolphins in downstream Cambodia. Lao's government decision is forge the dam upstream of the core habitat of the Irrawaddy Dolphins. This could precipitate the extinction of this specific species in the Mekong River. The dam builders' proposal is to use explosives to dig out the tons of rock. This will create strong sound waves <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> kill the Irrawaddy dolphins due to their highly sensitive hearing structures.|$|E
25|$|On January 18, 2012, {{a series}} of coordinated protests {{occurred}} against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). These followed smaller protests in late 2011. Protests were based on concerns that the bills, intended to provide more robust responses to copyright infringement (colloquially known as piracy) arising outside the United States, contained measures <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> infringe online freedom of speech, websites, and Internet communities. Protesters also argued that there were insufficient safeguards in place to protect sites based upon user-generated content.|$|E
25|$|Red dwarfs are {{far more}} {{variable}} and violent than their more stable, larger cousins. Often they are covered in starspots that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% {{for months at a}} time, while at other times they emit gigantic flares that can double their brightness in a matter of minutes. Such variation would be very damaging for life, as it would not only destroy any complex organic molecules <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> form biological precursors, but also because it would blow off sizeable portions of the planet's atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Physicist Sean M.

Psychokinesis would have to be either some form of one of these four forces, or a new force that has a billionth the strength of gravity, for otherwise it would have been captured in experiments already done. This leaves no physical force <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> account for psychokinesis.|$|E
