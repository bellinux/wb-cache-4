5|$|Saw {{was first}} {{screened}} on January 19, 2004. Lionsgate picked up <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> released {{the film in}} the United States and Canada on October 29, 2004. Critical responses were generally mixed and divided, but the film gained a cult following. Compared to its low budget, Saw performed very well at the box office, grossing more than $100 million worldwide and becoming, at the time, {{one of the most}} profitable horror films since 1996's Scream. The success of the film prompted a green-light of a sequel soon after Saw opening weekend, which was released the following October.|$|E
5|$|The actor John Payne {{attempted}} {{to take up}} the option on the film rights to the book in 1955, but nothing came of the attempt. The Rank Organisation also came to an agreement to make a film, but this likewise fell through. The novel was not one of Fleming's stories acquired by Eon Productions in 1961; in 1969 the company acquired <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> commissioned Gerry Anderson to produce and co-write a screenplay. Anderson and Tony Barwick prepared a 70-page treatment that was never filmed, but some elements were similar to the final screenplay of The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|Various filmmakers have {{expressed}} interest in doing new adaptations of The Fountainhead, although none of these potential films has begun production.

5|$|After the Norman invasion, the {{position}} of women in society changed. <b>The</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> roles of women became more sharply defined, in part {{as a result of}} the development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; some women benefited from this, while others lost out. The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the 12th century, clarifying the right of free women to own property, but this did not necessarily prevent women from being forcibly remarried against their wishes. The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour. As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with ploughing and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and dairy production becoming dominated by women.|$|E
5|$|By December 1989, Stone began {{approaching}} studios to {{back his}} film. While in pre-production on The Doors, {{he met with}} three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted {{him to make a}} film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> so Stone pitched JFK. Studio president and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and The Killing Fields. Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{undertook}} {{the central}} role in framing and writing the Petition of Right. The ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties, along with {{the rejection of the}} Resolutions seriously concerned the Commons. Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with the Commons in April 1628 in order to discuss a petition to the King confirming <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> liberties of royal subjects. The Commons immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding the Commons from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle that members of the Commons could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Using {{simultaneous}} multiple cross-sectional imaging, we imaged four cross sections, {{including the}} mandibular midline <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left temporomandibular joints, to observe one movement of mouth {{opening and closing}} and analyze {{the movement of the}} mandible and temporomandibular joints. Materials and Methods: Four cross sections, including the midsagittal section of the mandible, the sagittal sections of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left temporomandibular joints and the horizontal section containing <b>the</b> heads of <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left emporomandibular joints, were imaged simultaneously. The imaging was conducted in 10 male and female volunteers. Results: In all volunteers, the relationship of the mandibular movement on the median line with <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left temporomandibular joints was observed. Images of the volunteers with trismus indicated the condition in which <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left temporomandibular joints did not move in keeping with each other but moved independently from each other. Conclusion: Complex movement of the temporomandibular joint was first evaluated by simultaneous multiple cross-sectional MRI for the movement of mandible and temporomandibular joints...|$|R

5|$|Gowariker {{had always}} aspired {{to make a}} romantic comedy and was {{inspired}} to adapt Rye's novel into a feature film after watching a play {{based on the same}} source material. Later, he bought <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> co-wrote the screenplay with playwright Naushil Mehta. In the process, several plot changes were made for the cinematic adaptation, notably the similarity between the twelve girls, and the ending. Since Gowariker was against using prosthetics to create the twelve characters, Chopra worked on her body language and her voice to make them distinct. Principal photography was extensively done at sixty-seven locations across Mumbai, and partly in Baroda and Chicago. The soundtrack, consisting of thirteen songs, each representing an astrological sign and one compilation, was composed by Sohail Sen, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar.|$|E
5|$|In remaking {{the film}} {{from a new}} perspective, Farhan Akhtar wanted to give a {{contemporary}} style and treatment to the original film and make a film that he believed would be perfectly suited to modern times. The director later bought <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> conceived his adaptation as an homage to the original film and its cast and crew, and to the 1970s era in general. He co-wrote the screenplay with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original script with Salim Khan. He kept the basic plot but introduced some changes that included an international setting and a different ending. Principal photography commenced in Mumbai, before moving to Malaysia, where 80% of the filming was done. The soundtrack was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar.|$|E
5|$|Michael Ryan, {{director}} of The YoungCuts Film Festival, {{noted that there}} was a precedent for the film in the Air Pirates lawsuit, in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an underground comix parody in which Mickey Mouse and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> release the film itself, which it could easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a monopsony on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, Escape from Tomorrow would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone else and the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke would take some of the satiric edge off.|$|E
