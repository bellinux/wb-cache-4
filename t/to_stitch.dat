To earn money, Johnson began <b>to</b> <b>stitch</b> books for his father, {{and it is likely}} that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E
5|$|If a cat so chooses, {{they can}} take a {{different}} calling in life {{as that of a}} medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used <b>to</b> <b>stitch</b> deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E

500|$|De Havilland and {{her sister}} Joan Fontaine are the only {{siblings}} to have won Academy Awards in a lead acting category. According to biographer Charles Higham, the sisters always had an uneasy relationship, starting in early childhood when Olivia had trouble accepting {{the idea of having}} a younger sister, and Joan resenting her mother's favoring Olivia. Olivia would rip up the clothes that her sister was given to wear as hand-me-downs, forcing Joan <b>to</b> <b>stitch</b> them together again. [...] This tension was made worse by Fontaine's frequent childhood illnesses, which led to her mother's overly protective expression, [...] "Livvie can, Joan can't." [...] DeHavilland was the first to become an actress, and for several years Fontaine was overshadowed by her sister's accomplishments.

500|$|Others {{have argued}} that the film is itself a metaphor for filmmaking, and that the filmgoing {{experience}} itself, images flashing before one's eyes in a darkened room, is akin to a dream. Writing in Wired, Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film-watching and sleeping. In both, the visual cortex is highly active and the prefrontal cortex, which deals with logic, deliberate analysis, and self-awareness, is quiet. Paul argued that the experience of going to a picturehouse is itself an exercise in shared dreaming, particularly when viewing Inception: the film's sharp cutting between scenes forces the viewer to create larger narrative arcs <b>to</b> <b>stitch</b> the pieces together. This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, {{on the part of the}} audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious. At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding facing mirrors underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in la Croix asked [...] "Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?" ...|$|E
500|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection, with doctors {{able to do}} little more than ease pain. [...] Only seventeen years previously, Dr. Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound. [...] To increase the lighting, sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician; {{towards the end of the}} surgery, a better light was rigged. [...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as retractors. [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed with his finger and hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's back muscles. [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good. [...] He used black silk thread <b>to</b> <b>stitch</b> the incision and wound, without drainage, and covered the area with a bandage. [...] As the operation concluded, Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5:20, McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken. [...] He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance. [...] The First Lady had not been told of the President's shooting; once the surgery was complete, the presidential physician, Presley M. Rixey, gently told her what had occurred. [...] Ida McKinley took the news calmly; she wrote in her diary, [...] "Went to Niagra [...] Falls this morning.

50|$|The {{stitching}} of laminates in the through thickness direction with a {{high strength}} thread has proven a simple, low-cost method for producing 3-D composites.
