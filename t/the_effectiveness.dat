5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are strength, <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|E

5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. <b>The</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
