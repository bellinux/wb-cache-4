5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E

On December 22, 2011, the NHTSA also subjected a modified Volt {{to the same}} test {{that led to the}} original fire, with no signs of the damage that {{is believed to have been}} the cause. The NHTSA said “the preliminary results of the crash test indicate the remedy proposed by General Motors today should address the issue of battery intrusion” though its investigation remained open.

25|$|The {{greatest}} indigenous {{influence on}} the Jindyworobaks was literature which had been taken down by white folklorists and anthropologists. Written, as opposed to transcribed, indigenous literature did not appear in print until the 1920s when David Unaipon, a Christian from Point McLeay mission, South Australia, published {{a large body of}} work. Unaipon was publishing into the 1950s, by which time the Jindyworobaks were in decline. Unaipon was the sole published Indigenous Australian writer during their heyday, and indeed {{it was not until the}} 1960s that a second was published - Oodgeroo Noonuccal (Kath Walker). Unaipon, despite coming from South Australia, is not mentioned in the works of the Jindyworobaks, so it is hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of an influence, Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines was.|$|E
25|$|On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further {{expanded}} the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper {{using the new}} Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy {{as much of the}} debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, {{according to the most recent}} data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.|$|E

Field notes indicate that while several major artifacts, including baskets, sandals, painted wood fragments, digging sticks, arrow heads, and crushed pots {{were found at}} the great house, the whereabouts of most of these items is [...] "one of the great archaeological mysteries of the Southwest". He ascribes the [...] "almost total disappearance" [...] of the Chetro Ketl artifacts, which were viewed as unimpressive in comparison to those found at Pueblo Bonito, {{as a consequence of}} Hewett's flippant treatment of the collection. The Museum of New Mexico holds several items excavated from Chetro Ketl, including pieces of turquoise, a black-on-white pottery canteen, and a fourteen-foot-long stone and shell necklace.|$|E

It also begins with Timberlake and Timbaland chanting [...] "hey" [...] to one another. The video proceeds with Timberlake dancing {{to the beat of}} the song. Timbaland then begins singing the first verse of the song, which then is proceeded by Timberlake. This is immediately followed with [...] "My Love" [...] playing; the first verse of the song, [...] "Ain't another woman that could take your spot my", plays. Timberlake comes floating toward the camera, down the faulty fluorescent tube. Once Timberlake stops floating, he begins singing the main verse of the song, which violins begin to float swirling gently around him, for [...] "If I wrote you a symphony / Just <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you mean to me". The scene then changes with Timberlake and various dancers dancing accordingly in a choreographed style. When Timberlake begins the second verse, [...] "Now if I wrote you a love note / And made you smile at every word I wrote", pens and paper begin to float. This later exceeds with Timberlake singing [...] "This ring here represents my heart" [...] with a ring swirling into the camera. T.I. is then seen in the shot. T.I. begins rapping his lines in the song. After T.I. finishes his verse, Timberlake is then seen dancing with a female back-up dancer. Though, as they continue dancing, the female then leaves the shot, leaving Timberlake to dance {{to the end of the}} song. In the closing moments, the camera swirls around him, proving, conclusively, from every angle, that everyone has gone.|$|E

Ultimately, Thurow implies, the tax department is the arbiter of the profit volume, because it determines depreciation allowances and other costs which capitalists may annually deduct in calculating taxable gross income.|$|R

He said, [...] "It would be nice not to have to loan or contribute to your own campaign... If other people are making sacrifices, I sure have to as well. It’s not a dream come true.

2500|$|Modern scholars, {{working from}} the fragments, {{emphasize}} {{the influence of the}} major Roman artist of the day, Pietro Cavallini, who was also patronized by Cardinal Stefanesci, and of the Late Antique and Early Medieval works to be seen in Rome. [...] According to John White: [...] "The relatively schematic, linear quality of much late-thirteenth- and early-fourteenth-century work is wholly absent. [...] The impressionistic technique and range of colour both derive from the fifth century. It is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> this technique reflects the ideas of Giotto himself and how much those of the skilled mosaicists working under him. The two heads are, however, closely related both to the work of Cavallini, whose art still dominated the Roman scene, and to the basic type of physiognomy developed {{on the walls of the}} Arena Chapel." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, the Palm Beach Post {{newspaper}} broke a {{story in}} which it suggested the DVLMF was in serious financial trouble. The memorial foundation was running a deficit of almost $255,000, the newspaper said, and had more than $2 million in unpaid debts. The paper suggested that the foundation's spending was the problem. Nonprofit [...] "watchdog" [...] groups said charities should spend 75 percent on their mission program, 15 percent on administration, and just 10 percent on fundraising. But the DVLMF was spending 88 percent of its money on fundraising. The memorial foundation was strongly criticized on this point by watchdog groups. Charity Navigator Sandra Miniutti said her group gave the foundation zero out of four stars (its lowest rating) and scored DVLMF's operations: [...] "Their finances are out of whack, and it appears they are not adhering to their mission". Charity Brands Marketing, a group which helps match donors to charities, was also highly critical. Their chief executive officer, Stephen Adler, warned DVLMF was spending too heavily on fundraising: [...] "The numbers tell the story, and that's not an acceptable number for a nonprofit". The Palm Beach Post also reported that Lois Pope had used money from her LIFE Foundation to keep the DVLMF afloat. The DVLMF was $267,089 in deficit {{by the end of}} 2001, and the LIFE Foundation's 2002 donation of $3.5 million had kept it afloat. Rick Fenstermacher, an DVLMF consultant, admitted that Pope had pledged even more, but declined <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the additional donation was worth.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the question whether the utility of a commodity can be measured or not. At one time, {{it was assumed that}} the consumer was able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>much</b> utility he got from the commodity. The economists who made this assumption belonged to the 'cardinalist school' of economics. Today utility functions, expressing utility {{as a function of the}} amounts of the various goods consumed, are treated as either cardinal or ordinal, depending on whether they are or are not interpreted as providing more information than simply the rank ordering of preferences over bundles of goods, such as information on the strength of preferences.|$|R
