40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between the internationalisation strategies <b>of</b> SMEs and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> affect firms, and this in turn will influence the internationalisation strategy adopted. Using a sample of Spanish SMEs, our results show that internationalisation is negatively related to family ownership and positively related to corporate ownership. We have also observed that the presence of a corporate blockholder in family firms encourages internationalisation. These results support the idea that ownership type influences the decision to internationalise.

However, the details about the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> may not be specified in the contract. Sometimes, signing buyer(s) may direct a lawyer preparing the deed separately what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> to list on the deed and may decide to add a joint owner(s), such as a spouse, to the deed. For example, types of joint ownership (title) may include tenancy in common, joint tenancy with right of survivorship, or joint tenancy by the entireties.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{proposed}} to analyse legal regimes for integrated management of estuaries {{with the help}} of institutional legal theory and the Schlager & Ostrom framework for <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> Estuaries are highly valued and valuable and therefore need protection. The problem is that they qualify as multiple-use and multiple-user common pool resources. To be able to analyze the legal regimes governing the estuaries, you must be able to take the position of governmental actors and NGO's into account. For this purpose a first attempt has been made in this paper to adapt the Schlager & Ostrom framework to accomodate for these problems.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects <b>of</b> {{different}} <b>types</b> and concentration <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> on performance using {{a population of}} firms in a model transition economy after mass privatization. Specifications based on first-differences and unusual instrumental variables show that contrary to conventional wisdom, the effects of privatization and different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> are limited and many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> private owners do not generate performance {{that is different from}} that of firms with state ownership. Concentrated ownership has a positive effect but only in some instances and a positive effect <b>of</b> foreign <b>ownership</b> is detectable primarily for majority ownership and foreign industrial firms. The effects <b>of</b> concentrated <b>ownership</b> support the agency theory and go against theories stressing the positive effects of managerial autonomy. Our results are also consistent with managers or stockholders “looting” the firms. The state as a holder of the golden share has a positive effect on employment and in some specifications also on output and profitability.

Notably, though, this relationship does not occur randomly, which shows statistical significance in the sense of QAP. Especially, after the establishment of SASAC in 2003, the odds for listed companies <b>of</b> the same <b>ownership</b> to construct interlocking relations improved significantly, and the boundaries between different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> become clearer. For instance, in 2003, the odds between companies whose largest shareholders are <b>of</b> the same <b>ownership</b> constructing interlocking directorate networks are 21 % higher than companies with different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> This relationship shows statistical significance in regard to QAP. In 2008, this number reached 43 %, which also shows statistical significance regarding QAP (see Table  3). In short, these results support hypothesis 2, i.e., from the perspective of convergence of organizational behavior companies with the same ownership are more likely to constitute interlocking directorate networks.|$|R

The corporation is jointly owned by all the owners, and charges them fees for general maintenance and major repairs. Freehold townhouses are exclusively owned, without any condominium aspects.

The results show that foreign direct investment and collectively-owned enterprises have better environmental performances in terms of water pollution discharge intensity, while state-owned enterprises and privately owned enterprises in China are the worst performers. The results also suggest that collectively-owned enterprises in China do internalize environmental externalities.
