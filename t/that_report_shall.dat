40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the debates regarding the conservatism principle, the concept experienced a significant development. As {{it is one of the}} most controversial and violated accounting principle, we started to seek how can we help one of the auditor’s challenge in the audit mission: to identify and evaluate the risks from the financial statement level. The most affected accounting principle in Romania is the conservatism principle. After a long time of debates, it was stated that the conservatism principle, considered to be complementary to the “fair view” concept, which means <b>that</b> financial <b>reports</b> <b>shall</b> be required to submit information so impartial and in such a manner as to enable the reader to understand them clearly. Considered as a risk that should be identified, this study demonstrates a relationship between the violation of the conservatism principle and the analysis of the financial indicators, such as: Long-Term-Debt-to-Equity Ratio; Debt-to-Equity Ratio; Global Solvency Ratio; Operating Margin Ratio; Current Finance Ratio; Period of Activity Indicator and Auditor Indicator. Based on a quantitative method, this analyze was realized through three econometric model performed on annual financial statements of the companies from Bucharest Stock Exchange. After validating the sample and analyzing the factorial variables, we selected the best model: the probit model. In conclusion, as can be seen in the paper, the econometric function is efficient, reliable and can be applied to assess the risk likelihood for violating the conservatism principle by a Romanian company...|$|R

By order of Reich Chancellor Leo von Caprivi on 1 April 1890, responsibility for the colonial service was with the Colonial Department (Kolonialabteilung), still as a subsection in the German Foreign Office (Auswärtiges Amt), but led by a head of section answerable to the Chancellor. By the law of 18 July 1896 the department further co-supervised the colonial military or protection force, the Schutztruppe, with its headquarters (Kommando der Schutztruppen) formerly billeted in the Imperial Naval Office (Reichsmarineamt).

40|$|This chapter {{develops}} {{an extension}} of Doignon and Falmagne’s knowledge structures theory by integrating it into a competence-performance conception. The aim is to show one possible {{way in which the}} purely behavioral and descriptive knowledge structures approach could be structurally enriched in order to account for the need of explanatory features for the empirically observed solution behavior. Performance is conceived as the observable solution behavior of a person on a set of domain-specific problems. Competence (ability, skills) is understood as a theoretical construct accounting for the performance. The basic concept is a mathematical structure termed a diagnostic, that creates a correspondence between the competence and the performance level. The concept of a union-stable diagnostic is defined as an elaboration of Doignon and Falmagne’s concept of a knowledge space. Conditions for the construction and several properties of union-stable diagnostics are presented. Finally, an empirical application of the competence-performance conception in a small knowledge domain is <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>shall</b> illustrate some advantages of the introduced modeling approach...|$|R

40|$|The global {{livestock}} {{sector is}} changing rapidly. Livestock production is intensifying and industrializing, and is {{heavily dependent on}} {{a small number of}} high-yielding breeds. Biotechnologies are revolutionizing animal breeding. International trade in live animals, genetic materials and livestock products has grown substantially with globalization and trade liberalization. In the North, these developments have caused the loss of many breeds. Losses in the South are still limited, but many breeds are at risk, and the rising demand for meat, milk and eggs furthers the expansion of industrial livestock production, triggering a “Livestock Revolution”. These developments have stimulated international efforts in breed conservation. FAO is guiding the compilation of a global State of the World <b>Report</b> <b>that</b> <b>shall</b> lead to a global action plan for breed conservation. However, international negotiations so far have failed adequately to include the livestock keepers who are the originators of the breeds.
