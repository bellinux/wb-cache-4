When it finally did, the justices suggested they would clarify once and for all the extent to which opinions could be expressed without fear of being held libellous. The actual decision, however, was regarded as having confused the issue somewhat instead. Several state courts have responded by recognizing an opinion privilege in some way in their own jurisprudence.|$|E

Under current law, anyone who objects to a DNRC decision regarding new water rights (those filed after 1982) must seek redress in a Montana District Court. But District Court judges expressed concern over this provision, because they lacked experience with water rights. The proposed bill would change the venue for this lawsuit to the Water Court.

25|$|Moore v. Dempsey was {{the first}} case <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> the court in the 20th century related to the {{treatment}} of African Americans in the criminal justice systems of the South, where they lived in a segregated society that had disenfranchised them. The case resulted from prosecution of twelve men for the death of a white man associated with the Elaine Race Riot in Phillips County, Arkansas. A white railroad security employee died on September 30, 1919 after shots were exchanged outside a church where a black tenant farmers union was meeting. With rumors of black insurrection, Governor Charles Hillman Brough led a deployment of federal troops into the rural county, arresting hundreds of blacks. Other blacks were allowed to be in public only with military passes. In the week after the shooting, roving bands of whites and federal troops killed upwards of 200 blacks.|$|E

Patton remained in Sicily {{for the rest}} of the year. Marshall and Stimson not only supported Eisenhower's decision, but defended it. In a letter to the U.S. Senate, Stimson stated that Patton must be retained because of the need for his [...] "aggressive, winning leadership in the bitter battles which are <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> final victory." [...] Stimson acknowledged retaining Patton was a poor move for public relations but remained confident it was the right decision militarily.|$|E
500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} the practice is based on Biblical commentator Nahmanides's (1194–1270) interpretation of the scriptural verse [...] "And all those that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel" [...] (...) [...] In his commentary on the Torah (the Five Books of Moses), Nahmanides contends that Moses asked each Jew <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> him to be counted. This personal appearance of the Jew before Moses, the tzadik (Jewish holy man), foreshadowed the ceremony of the giving of a kvitel by the Hasid to his Rebbe.|$|E
500|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Hand shared {{the dismay of}} his compatriots about Stalinism and {{the onset of the}} Cold War. At the same time, he was {{sensitive}} to the domestic problems created by what he saw as a hysterical fear of international Communism. Already in 1947, he noted that [...] "the frantic witch hunters are given free rein to set up a sort of Inquisition, detecting heresy wherever non-conformity appears". Hand was distressed by the crusade against domestic subversion that became part of American public life after the war. He particularly despised the anti-Communist campaign of Senator Joseph McCarthy that began in 1950 and which became known as McCarthyism. Though Hand expressed his horror of McCarthyism privately, he hesitated to do so publicly because cases arising from it were likely <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> his court.|$|E

500|$|Word of the {{incident}} reached Eisenhower, who privately reprimanded Patton and insisted he apologize. Patton apologized to both soldiers individually, {{as well as to}} doctors who witnessed {{the incident}}s, and later to all of the soldiers under his command in several speeches. Eisenhower suppressed the incident in the media, but in November journalist Drew Pearson revealed it on his radio program. Criticism of Patton in the United States was harsh, and included members of Congress and former generals, Pershing among them. The views of the general public remained mixed on the matter, and eventually Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson stated that Patton must be retained as a commander because of the need for his [...] "aggressive, winning leadership in the bitter battles which are <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> final victory." ...|$|E

Scripts written by Gilligan, Shiban, and Spotnitz would later go on to be humorously referred to as creations of a [...] "John Gillnitz"—a portmanteau of the three writers' names. According to Spotnitz, the script for [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was [...] "not particularly well-loved at the time". Spotnitz later noted, however, that the episode became [...] "one of [...] favorite monster shows". Originally, the episode [...] "Never Again" [...] was supposed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> the episode. Vince Gilligan explained, [...] " [...] really wanted to grab viewers who had never seen us before , and we knew {{the best way to}} do that would be with a really creepy stand-alone monster story."

In response to the perceived threat of Japanese attack, the Dutch laid down a coastal defense ship, , and eight destroyers of the , while beginning plans for other ships. In addition, a submarine for the colony was approved in 1911. Four coast defense ships were projected in one of the two major bills <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> the House of Representatives in 1912. Specifications for these ships included an armament of four 280-mm (11-inch) and ten 102-mm (4-inch) guns and three torpedo tubes and they would have been armored with a belt of 152-mm (6-inch) and turret armor of 203mm (8inches). Two triple-expansion engines generating 10,000indicated horsepower would drive the ships through the water at [...] One ship of this design was very close to being authorized in 1912, but it was felt by experts and the House of Representatives that the Netherlands would be better served by constructing dreadnoughts of a type similar to the Spanish [...] Further plans for coast-defense ships were shelved pending the findings of a Royal Commission, formed on 5 June 1912. Its goal was to assess the steps needed to improve the defenses of the East Indies.|$|E

When a Duke approached him before a case [...] "to help the judge understand {{a case that}} was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> him", Hale {{said that he would}} only hear about cases in court. In another case, he was sent venison by a party. After noticing the man's name and verifying that he had indeed sent Hale some venison, Hale refused to let the case proceed until he had paid the man for the food. When Sir John Croke, suspected in engaging in a conspiracy, sent him some sugar loaves to excuse his absence from a case, Hale remarked that [...] "I cannot think that Sir John believes that the King's Justices come into the country to take bribes. Some other person, having a design to put a trick upon him, sent them in his name". Hale returned the loaves, and refused to continue until Croke appeared before him. Hale was noted during this period for giving latitude to those accused of religious impropriety, and through doing so [...] "secured the confidence and affection of all classes of his countrymen".

[...] When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions. Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings – where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation – might be more reflective of her speeches. Sotomayor defended her position in Ricci as following applicable precedent. [...] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law. [...] On July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Sotomayor's nomination; the 13–6 vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and only one Republican supporting her. On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. [...] The vote was largely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and nine Republicans supporting her.|$|E
