60|$|Homer's world, {{restricted}} {{to less than}} a drummer's circuit, was nevertheless immense, surrounded by a thin veneer of universe--the Stream of Ocean. But how it has shrunk! To-day, precisely charted, weighed, and measured, a thousand {{times larger than the}} world of Homer, it is become a tiny speck, gyrating to immutable law through a universe the bounds of which have been pushed incalculably back. The light of Algol shines upon it--a light which travels at one hundred and ninety thousand miles per second, yet requires forty-seven years to reach its destination. And the denizens of this puny ball have come to know that Algol possesses an invisible companion, three and a quarter millions of miles away, and that the twain move in their respective orbits at rates of fifty-five and twenty-six miles per second. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> that beyond it are great chasms of space, innumerable worlds, and vast star systems.|$|E

60|$|It is {{the same}} throughout. Want of {{imagination}} makes people exaggerate the difficulties and dangers of every new scheme, because they can't picture constructively to themselves the details of its working. Men with great picturing power, like Shelley or Robespierre, are always very advanced Radicals, and potentially revolutionists. The difficulty they see is not the difficulty of making the thing work, but the difficulty of convincing less clear-headed people of its desirability and practicability. A great many Conservatives, who are Conservative from selfishness, would be Radicals if only they could feel for themselves that even their own petty interests and pleasures are not really menaced. The squires and the dukes can't realise how much happier even {{they would be in}} a free, a beautiful, and a well-organised community. Imaginative minds can picture a world where everything is so ordered that life comes as a constant æsthetic delight to everybody. They know that that world could be realised to-morrow--if only all others could picture it to themselves as vividly as they do. But <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> that it can only be attained in the end by long ages of struggle, and by slow evolution of the essentially imaginative ethical faculty. For right action depends most of all, in the last resort, upon a graphic conception of the feelings of others.|$|E
60|$|Again, we {{certainly}} {{do not expect to}} see the Royal Society inquiring into second sight, or clairvoyance, or thought transference. When the Royal Society was first founded several of its members, Pepys, F.R.S.; Mr. Robert Boyle, F.R.S.; the Rev. Joseph Glanvill, F.R.S., went into these things a good deal. But, in spite of their title, they were only amateurs. They had no professional dignity to keep up. They were well aware that they, unlike the late Mr. Faraday, did not know, by inspiration or by common-sense, the limits of the possible. They tried all things, it was such a superstitious age. Now men of science, or the majority of them, for there are some exceptions, know what is, and what is not possible. They know that germs of life may possibly come down on meteorites from somewhere else, and they produced an argument for the existence of a bathybius. But <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> that a man is not a bird to be in two places at once, like Pythagoras, and that nobody can see through a stone wall. These, and similar allegations, they reckon impossible, and, if the facts happen, so much the worse for the facts. They can only be due to imposture or mal-observation, and there is an end of the matter. This is the view of official science. Unluckily, not many years ago, official science was equally certain that the ordinary phenomena of hypnotism were based on imposture and on mal- observation. These phenomena, too, were tabooed. But so many people could testify to them, and they could be so easily explained by the suggestive force of suggestion, that they were reluctantly admitted within the sacred citadel. Many people, sane, not superstitious, healthy, and even renowned as scientific specialists, attest the existence of the still rarer phenomena which are said, in certain cases, to accompany the now more familiar incidents of hypnotism. But these phenomena have never yet been explained by any theory which science recognises, as she does recognise that suggestion is suggestive. Therefore these rarer phenomena manifestly do not exist, and cannot be the subject of legitimate inquiry.|$|E

[...] My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb [...] Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran [...] With supple joints, as lively vigour led: [...] But who I was, or where, or from what cause, [...] 270 [...] Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake, [...] My Tongue obey'd and readily could name [...] What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, [...] And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, [...] Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, [...] And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, [...] Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? [...] Not of my self; by some great Maker then, [...] In goodness and in power praeeminent; [...] Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, [...] 280 [...] From whom I have that thus I move and live, [...] And feel that I am happier then I know. [...] While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, [...] From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld [...] This happie Light, when answer none return'd, [...] On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours [...] Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep [...] First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd [...] My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought [...] I then was passing to my former state [...] 290 [...] Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: [...] When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, [...] Whose inward apparition gently mov'd [...] My Fancy to believe I yet had being, [...] And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, [...] And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, [...] First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd [...] First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide [...] To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd.

[...] She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd [...] To find her, or for ever to deplore [...] Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: [...] 480 [...] When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, [...] Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd [...] With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow [...] To make her amiable: On she came, [...] Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, [...] And guided by his voice, nor uninformd [...] Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: [...] Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, [...] In every gesture dignitie and love. [...] I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. [...] 490 [...] This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd [...] Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, [...] Giver of all things faire, but fairest this [...] Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see [...] Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self [...] Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man [...] Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe [...] Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; [...] And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. [...] She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, [...] 500 [...] Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, [...] Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, [...] That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, [...] Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, [...] The more desirable, or to say all, [...] Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, [...] Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; [...] I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, [...] And with obsequious Majestie approv'd [...] My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre [...] 510 [...] I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, [...] And happie Constellations on that houre [...] Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth [...] Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; [...] Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires [...] Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings [...] Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, [...] Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night [...] Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr [...] On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. [...] 520 [...] Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought [...] My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss [...] Which I enjoy, and must confess to find [...] In all things else delight indeed, but such [...] As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, [...] Nor vehement desire, these delicacies [...] I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours, [...] Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here [...] Farr otherwise, transported I behold, [...] Transported touch; here passion first I felt, [...] 530 [...] Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else [...] Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake [...] Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. [...] Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part [...] Not proof enough such Object to sustain, [...] Or from my side subducting, took perhaps [...] More then enough; at least on her bestow'd [...] Too much of Ornament, in outward shew [...] Elaborate, of inward less exact. [...] For well I understand in the prime end [...] 540 [...] Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind [...] And inward Faculties, which most excell, [...] In outward also her resembling less [...] His Image who made both, and less expressing [...] The character of that Dominion giv'n [...] O're other Creatures; yet when I approach [...] Her loveliness, so absolute she seems [...] And in her self compleat, so well to know [...] Her own, that what she wills to do or say, [...] Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; [...] 550 [...] All higher knowledge in her presence falls [...] Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her [...] Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; [...] Authoritie and Reason on her waite, [...] As one intended first, not after made [...] Occasionally; and to consummate all, [...] Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat [...] Build in her loveliest, and create an awe [...] About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. [...] To whom the Angel with contracted brow. [...] 560 [...] Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; [...] Do thou but thine, and be not diffident [...] Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou [...] Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, [...] By attributing overmuch to things [...] Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st. [...] For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so, [...] An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well [...] Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, [...] Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; [...] 570 [...] Then value: Oft times nothing profits more [...] Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right [...] Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st, [...] The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, [...] And to realities yeild all her shows; [...] Made so adorn for thy delight the more, [...] So awful, that with honour thou maist love [...] Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. [...] But if the sense of touch whereby mankind [...] Is propagated seem such dear delight [...] 580 [...] Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't [...] To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be [...] To them made common & divulg'd, if aught [...] Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue [...] The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. [...] What higher in her societie thou findst [...] Attractive, human, rational, love still; [...] In loving thou dost well, in passion not, [...] Wherein true Love consists not; love refines [...] The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat [...] 590 [...] In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale [...] By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend, [...] Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause [...] Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. [...] To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd. [...] Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught [...] In procreation common to all kindes [...] (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, [...] And with mysterious reverence I deem) [...] So much delights me, as those graceful acts, [...] 600 [...] Those thousand decencies that daily flow [...] From all her words and actions, mixt with Love [...] And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd [...] Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; [...] Harmonie to behold in wedded pair [...] More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. [...] Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose [...] What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, [...] Who meet with various objects, from the sense [...] Variously representing; yet still free [...] 610 [...] Approve the best, and follow what I approve. [...] To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist [...] Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide; [...] Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; [...] Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love [...] Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix [...] Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? [...] To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd [...] Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, [...] Answer'd. Let it suffice thee that thou know'st [...] 620 [...] Us happie, and without Love no happiness. [...] Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st [...] (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy [...] In eminence, and obstacle find none [...] Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: [...] Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace, [...] Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure [...] Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need [...] As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. [...] But I can now no more; the parting Sun [...] 630 [...] Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles [...] Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. [...] Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all [...] Him whom to love is to obey, and keep [...] His great command; take heed least Passion sway [...] Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will [...] Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons [...] The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware. [...] I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, [...] And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall [...] 640 [...] Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. [...] Perfet within, no outward aid require; [...] And all temptation to transgress repel. [...] So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus [...] Follow'd with benediction. Since to part, [...] Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, [...] Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. [...] Gentle to me and affable hath been [...] Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever [...] With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind [...] 650 [...] Be good and friendly still, and oft return. [...] So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n [...] From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre.|$|E
