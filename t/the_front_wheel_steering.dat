40|$|Steering and braking {{control is}} applied to avoid {{rollover}} of road vehicles. The control concept presented is composed of three feedback loops: Continuous operation steering control, emergency steering control and emergency braking control. In continuous operation the roll rate and the roll acceleration are fed back by velocity scheduled gains to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angle. Thereby, the vehicle's roll damping is robustly improved {{for a wide range}} of speed and height of the center of gravity. The latter may change for example with a truck from ride to ride. A rollover coe #cient is defined that basically depends on the lateral acceleration at the center of gravity of the vehicle's sprung mass. For critical values of this variable the emergency steering and braking system is activated. The rollover coe #cient is also used for nonlinear feedback to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angle. The control concept is evaluated by linear sensitivity analysis and by simulations. Additionally, absolute [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Road traffic crashes {{have been}} {{the leading cause of}} death among young people. Most of these {{accidents}} occur when the driver becomes distracted and a loss-of-control situation occurs. Steer-by-Wire systems were recently proposed as an alternative to mitigate such accidents. This technology enables the decoupling of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angles from the driver hand wheel angle and, consequently, the measurement of road/tire friction limits and the development of novel control systems capable of ensuring vehicle stabilization and safety. However, vehicle safety boundaries are highly dependent on tire characteristics which vary significantly with temperature, wear and the tire manufacturing process. Therefore, design of autonomous vehicle and driver assistance controllers cannot assume that these characteristics are constant or known. Thus, this paper proposes a Guaranteed Cost Model Predictive Controller Driver Assistance System able to avoid front and rear tire saturation and to track the drivers intent up to the limits of handling for a vehicle with uncertain tire parameters.

The {{development of}} steer-by-wire involves an increased amount of possibilities for control in future cars. For example, the experimental vehicle available has both {{front and rear}} wheel steering. This enables a simultaneous multivariable control of both the yaw rate and the side slip angle. The today existing control approach is designed in the time domain {{and it has a}} decoupled control structure, where the yaw rate is controlled by <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angle, and the side slip angle is controlled by the rear wheel steering angle. With this approach there are some major difficulties, such as constraint handling and lack of robustness to plant uncertainties, to time delays and to actuator or sensor failure. To solve these problems, a multivariable control scheduling system can be used that has already been applied to robotics, satellite attitude control and ship control but is a novelty for the field of automotive control. It is a coupling control approach, based on Individual Channel Design in the frequency domain, ICD, and considers the internal cross-coupling of the plant. It has been shown that meeting the requirements is not trivial, and a tradeoff has to be done between high performance and entirely meeting the specifications. However, the design shows a considerable degree of both robustness and integrity, which has been verified in theory as well as in simulations, but has to be further checked in real experiments...|$|E
