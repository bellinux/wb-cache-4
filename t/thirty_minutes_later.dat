5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather {{within a}} persistent, broad trough across the southwestern Caribbean organized into the nineteenth tropical {{depression of the}} season by 06:00UTC on October20 about 195mi (315km) north of Cabo Gracias a Dios. The depression was slow to organize at first, affected by dry air and moderate shear from a trough over the Southeast United States and western Atlantic, but eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Richard by 12:00UTC on October21 as it curved south and then west. Upper-level winds slackened over subsequent days, allowing the cyclone to attain hurricane intensity early on October24 and reach peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) by 00:00UTC the next day. Richard moved ashore near Gales Point, Belize, <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> The system weakened rapidly once inland, degenerating into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on October26.

Unfortunately, despite officers and other ranks wearing yellow recognition panels and carrying orange umbrellas to identify themselves, C Company was bombed and strafed by the bombers, causing a number of casualties. As a result, a Forward Air Controller attached to the battalion ordered a halt to all further bombing runs on the battery.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable was {{assigned}} to the BPF in November and she arrived in Colombo, Ceylon on 10 December where she joined the 1st ACS. Together with the other carriers of the BPF, she attacked oil refineries in Sumatra in January 1945 (Operation Lentil and Operation Meridian) before sailing to Sydney to prepare for operations in the Pacific. The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet at Ulithi on 20 March and attacked airfields on the Sakishima Islands, south of Okinawa, beginning on 26 March, as part of the preparations for Operation Iceberg. During these operations, Indefatigable became the first British carrier to be hit by a kamikaze when one penetrated the combat air patrol (CAP) and struck the base of her island on 1 April. The bomb carried by the kamikaze did not detonate and this limited casualties to 21 men killed and 27 wounded. Damage to the ship was minimal and the flight deck was back in operation <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> After Okinawa had been secured, the BPF arrived back at Sydney on 7 June and Indefatigable was delayed rejoining operations as she required repairs to her machinery. She departed Manus on 12 July and reached the coast of Japan eight days later. Her aircraft began attacking targets in the Inland Sea on 24 July. Most of the BPF withdrew as planned on 10 August to prepare for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu scheduled for November, but Indefatigable and several other ships remained to represent Britain at the end of operations. The ship's aircraft flew missions on 13 and 15 August; during the last of these missions, her Seafires shot down eight of twelve Mitsubishi A6M Zeros while losing one of their own and an Avenger gunner shot down another Japanese aircraft. After the ceasefire, her aircraft continued to fly CAP and flew reconnaissance missions looking for Allied prisoners of war.|$|E

They then retired to Maler, unknowingly being followed by the Turks. At 23:30 the 1st Light Horse Brigade reported movement to their front, and <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> shots were exchanged at Mount Meredith and Hod El Enna. The regiment had just settled down for the night and were ordered to stand to. At 02:15 4 August, fighting broke out along the front line and two hours later the 1st Light Horse Brigade carried out a fighting withdrawal. At dawn the regiment was the brigade reserve behind the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments. By 05:00 the Turkish force was outflanking both their defences and the ANZAC Mounted Division headquarters, which was co-located at the regiment's position. Two hours later they were ordered to gallop to the front line. Riding through rifle and machine-gun fire, they moved to the left and rear of the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments. Once the regiment's position was established, the Australian regiments pulled back to form a line with them. As the Turks advanced and occupied the ridge line previously held by the light horse, they brought artillery and machine-gun fire down onto the division's rear areas. The situation appeared serious, and the regiment's clerks were ordered to burn all their papers. Just before 10:00 reinforcements, consisting of a yeomanry regiment, two Scottish infantry companies and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, arrived and began attacking the Turkish left. By 18:00 they had captured the position. The regiment's casualties during the day were twenty-four wounded.|$|E

40|$|What {{could be}} easier than overexpressing an E. coli protein in E. coli? You don’t {{have to be an}} old hand at protein {{expression}} to know that this can often be more difficult than it sounds. We tested our skills recently with DsbA, a 20 kDa protein that catalyzes disulfide bond formation in the E. coli periplasm. The wildtype DsbA expressed well in LB medium, and also in a Bio-Express-supplemented 13 C 15 N labeling medium. Likewise, the DsbA C 33 S mutant expressed well in LB. But when we first tried to label C 33 S, our luck ran out [...] we saw no expression at all. Today we are producing 13 C 15 N DsbA C 33 S at a yield of 100 mg per liter. Here’s our top ten tips for expressing recalcitrant proteins. 10. Stop the leaks. Leaky expression (i. e. expression in the absence of inducer) of a “toxic ” protein or even a “less-than-healthful ” mutant protein can slow cell growth, resulting in a suboptimal level of expression.

German defensive policy did not include planning for defending rear areas in depth. There were no antitank ditches or mines, barbed wire, or trenches on the route to Remagen. The few defensive obstacles that had been constructed were too weak to block tanks or had been placed in open terrain, and the roadblocks they had built usually allowed plenty of room for vehicles to pass. The only defense that slowed the Americans down was a machine gun manned by infantry over the town square, which two of the Pershings quickly dispatched.
