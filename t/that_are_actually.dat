5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E

25|$|Membrane {{filters are}} widely used for {{filtering}} both drinking water and sewage. For drinking water, membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2μm—including giardia and cryptosporidium. Membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry, for limited domestic purposes, or before discharging the water into a river {{that is used by}} towns further downstream. They {{are widely used}} in industry, particularly for beverage preparation (including bottled water). However no filtration can remove substances <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> dissolved in the water such as phosphorus, nitrates and heavy metal ions.|$|E
25|$|The {{abstract}} {{properties of}} covering {{have been studied}} by mathematicians for over a century. However, direct application of these results has not generally been possible. Closed-form mathematical solutions, especially for probability distributions, often cannot be readily evaluated. That is, they involve inordinately large amounts of computer time for parameters characteristic of DNA sequencing. Stevens' configuration is one such example. Results obtained {{from the perspective of}} pure mathematics also do not account for factors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> important in sequencing, for instance detectable overlap in sequencing fragments, double-stranding, edge-effects, and target multiplicity. Consequently, development of sequencing theory has proceeded more according to the philosophy of applied mathematics. In particular, it has been problem-focused and makes expedient use of approximations, simulations, etc.|$|E
25|$|The CLCN2 gene encodes a {{chloride}} {{channel protein}} that is heavily expressed in brain regions inhibited by GABA. It {{is believed to}} be important in maintaining a proper chloride reversal potential needed in inhibitory neurotransmission by GABA. There are three known mutations in CLCN2 associated with JME, M200fsX231, 74_117del, and G715E. Neither the M200fsX231 nor the 74_117del mutation yield current when expressed in cells. Since these channels are responsible for the removal of intracellular chloride, these mutations are expected to lead to increased chloride concentrations and, thus, altered chloride reversal potential (ECl). As chloride is conducted through the normally inhibitory GABA receptors, this alteration in ECl may lead to either decreased GABAergic currents or GABAergic currents <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> excitatory. The G715E mutation, on the other hand, produces normal sized currents but has altered voltage dependent activation. For this mutant, activation occurs at more positive potentials compared to wild-type channels. This may cause increased neuronal excitability.|$|E

Around that time, he began {{creating}} darker and more realistic fantasy films that did not feature the Muppets and displayed [...] "a growing, brooding interest in mortality." [...] With 1982's The Dark Crystal, which he co-directed with Frank Oz and co-wrote, Henson said he was [...] "trying to go toward a sense of realism—toward a reality of creatures <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> alive [...] it's {{not so much a}} symbol of the thing, but you're trying to [...] the thing itself." [...] To provide a visual style distinct from the Muppets, the puppets in The Dark Crystal were based on conceptual artwork by Brian Froud.|$|E
500|$|Cobb {{has also}} been active in formulating his own {{theories}} of religious pluralism, partly in response to another Claremont Graduate University professor, John Hick. [...] Cobb's pluralism has sometimes {{been identified as a}} kind of [...] "deep" [...] pluralism or, alternately, as a [...] "complementary" [...] pluralism. [...] He believes that there are actually three distinct religious ultimates: 1) God, 2) Creativity/Emptiness/Nothingness/Being-itself, and 3) the cosmos/universe. [...] Cobb believes that all of these elements are necessary and present in some form in every religion but that different faiths tend to stress one ultimate over the others. [...] Viewed in this way, different religions may be seen to complement each other by providing insight into different religious ultimates. [...] Cobb's pluralism thus avoids the criticism of conflating religions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> very different (for instance, Buddhism and Christianity) while still affirming the possible truths of both.|$|E
500|$|In {{the study}} of how RNA {{molecules}} fold to form their structure, the standard form of nucleic acid secondary structure can be described diagrammatically as a chain of bases (the RNA sequence itself), drawn along a line, together {{with a collection of}} arcs above the line describing the basepairs of the structure. That is, although these structures actually have a complicated three-dimensional shape, their connectivity (when a secondary structure exists) can be described by a more abstract structure, a one-page book embedding. However, not all RNA folds behave in this simple way. [...] have proposed a so-called [...] "bi-secondary structure" [...] for certain RNA pseudoknots that {{takes the form of a}} two-page book embedding: the RNA sequence is again drawn along a line, but the basepairs are drawn as arcs both above and below this line. In order to form a bi-secondary structure, a graph must have maximum degree at most three: each base can only participate in one arc of the diagram, in addition to the two links to its neighbors in the base sequence. Advantages of this formulation include the facts that it excludes structures <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> knotted in space, and that it matches most known RNA pseudoknots.|$|E

500|$|Generally {{short and}} shiny, the coat varies in colour {{according}} to subspecies. The western hartebeest is a pale sandy-brown, but {{the front of}} the legs are darker. The red hartebeest is a reddish-brown, with a dark face. Black markings can be observed on the chin, the back of the neck, shoulders, hips and legs; these are in sharp contrast with the broad white patches that mark its flanks and lower rump. The Lelwel hartebeest is a reddish tan. Coke's hartebeest is reddish to tawny in the upper parts, but has relatively lighter legs and rump. Lichtenstein's hartebeest is reddish brown, though the flanks are a lighter tan and the rump whitish. The Tora hartebeest is a dark reddish brown in {{the upper part of the}} body, the face, the forelegs and the rump, but the hindlegs and the underbelly are a yellowish white. The Swayne's hartebeest is a rich chocolate brown with fine spots of white <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> the white tips of its hairs. Its face is black save for the chocolate band below the eyes. The shoulders and upper part of the legs are black. Fine textured, the body hair of the hartebeest is about [...] long. The hartebeest has preorbital glands (glands near the eyes) with a central duct, that secrete a dark sticky fluid in Coke's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and a colourless fluid in the Lelwel hartebeest.|$|E
500|$|After Shao Kahn's {{invasion}} of Earthrealm is halted by Raiden's forces of light, Raiden blasts and sends Kahn through a portal. At {{exactly the same}} time on Earth, Superman stops Darkseid's Apokoliptian invasion by blasting Darkseid with his heat vision as he enters a boom tube. These acts do not destroy either of them, but merge them into Dark Kahn, and causes the DC and Mortal Kombat universes to merge. As this happens, the characters' abilities fluctuate, causing violent [...] "rage" [...] outbreaks <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> the feelings of Dark Kahn being infused in the characters from afar. Because of this, certain characters gain either strength or vulnerability. This allows for such things [...] as the possibility of Superman being defeated due to his vulnerability to magic, and giving the Joker the ability to fight skilled martial artists such as his nemesis Batman and Deathstroke. With each world thinking that the other {{is responsible for the}} merger, they fight each other until only one fighter from each side remains: Raiden and Superman. In the final battle, the two fight while Dark Kahn feeds on their rage. Both realizing that the other is not working with Dark Kahn, they overcome their rage for each other and defeat their fused enemy, restoring the two worlds to their normal separation. While everyone else has been sent to their original universe, Darkseid and Shao Kahn have been switched and are both rendered powerless. In the end, they both face eternal imprisonment in the other's universe; Darkseid is restrained in the Netherealm, while Shao Kahn is trapped in the Phantom Zone.|$|E
