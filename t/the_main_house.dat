5|$|Media {{accounts}} {{had reported}} that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house</b> from the ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls {{and then into the}} house. As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house,</b> that Osama bin Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house</b> was cleared from the top down.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, snipers in the {{hovering}} Razor 2 helicopter {{shot and killed}} Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{when he came to}} the door of the guest house firing an AK-47. One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him. The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house</b> with explosives. As the Razor 2 team entered <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house,</b> al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.|$|E

5|$|Thatched House Lodge was the London home of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower {{during the}} Second World War. Since 1963 {{it has been}} the {{residence}} of Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. The residence was originally built as two houses in 1673 for two Richmond Park Keepers, as Aldridge Lodge. Enlarged in 1727, the two houses were joined and renamed Thatched House Lodge in 1771 by Sir John Soane. The gardens include an 18th-century two-room thatched summer house which gave <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house</b> its name.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican parish {{church of}} St Peter was {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid 13th century and had a three-stage tower added in the 15th, however it was extensively restored when <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house</b> {{was built in the}} late 17th century. The church consists of a north and south aisle, chancel and south west porch with the tower to the west. In the south aisle are encaustic tiles dating from the 13th century. The font is Norman while the pulpit is Jacobean. There is also a 16th-century Flemish altar triptych.|$|E

30|$|Field {{monitoring}} {{has been}} taken in generator unit # 4 of Dagangshan Hydropower Station. Two monitoring holes has been constructed, and the splitting phenomenon of the rock masses between <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house</b> and transformer chamber has been monitored through the borehole TV, sliding extensometer and WDA- 1 deformation resistivity instrument. According to the displacement monitoring results, the displacement of the rock masses decreases with the distance between <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house</b> and transformer chamber increasing at the beginning, and when the distance is over 41  m, the displacement is increasing again. The maximum displacement near <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house</b> is 18.53  mm (2  m away {{from the surface of}} the downstream sidewall of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house),</b> and that near the transformer chamber is 4.08  mm (5  m away {{from the surface of the}} upstream sidewall of the transformer chamber). The monitoring result also shows that the depth of the splitting zone of downstream sidewall of <b>main</b> power <b>house</b> is larger than that of upstream sidewall. And the depth of the downstream sidewall of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house</b> is approximately 13 – 15  m, and that of the upstream sidewall of the transformer chamber is approximately 5  m.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the large}} size of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house,</b> {{significant}} disturbing {{effect on the}} surrounding rock is caused by excavations of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> displacement of the key points near the downstream surface of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house</b> is much larger than that near the upstream surface of the transformer chamber. According to the field monitoring, the maximum displacement of surrounding rock, 18.53  mm, as measured near {{the surface of the}} downstream sidewall of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> displacement of surrounding rock masses decreases with the distance {{from the surface of the}} downstream sidewall of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house</b> to <b>the</b> key points. The displacement curve has a turning point when the distance between the monitoring points and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> workshop is approximately 15  m. After that, the descending of displacement is becoming insignificant, whereas the displacement is approaching a constant. The displacement of surrounding rock masses begins to be gradually increased when the monitoring points from the surface of the downstream sidewall of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> power <b>house</b> is approximately 41  m that is 5  m from the surface of the upstream sidewall of the transformer chamber. The displacement curve reaches a peak when the monitoring point from the surface of upstream sidewall of the transformer chamber is approximately 2  m away. After the completion of excavation for the eighth step of <b>main</b> power <b>house,</b> <b>the</b> maximum displacement measured at this position is 4.08  mm.|$|R

5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment over the door. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>house</b> originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house</b> and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The chimney was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits behind the house.

5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house</b> as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house,</b> and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E

5|$|However, the King did {{not want}} the house himself, and he offered it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to the high cost of maintenance. Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house</b> would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} {{eastern side of}} the house is an orangery, which was built as a {{greenhouse}} in 1701 and has a glazed roof which was added around 1800 by Humphrey Repton. The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>house.</b> The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to eat on the days when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E
