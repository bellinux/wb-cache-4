5|$|According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{man-made}} {{sources of}} <b>thallium</b> pollution include gaseous emission of cement factories, coal burning power plants, and metal sewers. The {{main source of}} elevated <b>thallium</b> concentrations in water is the leaching of <b>thallium</b> from ore processing operations.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{removing}} <b>thallium</b> (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs <b>thallium.</b> Up to 20g per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the stool. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove <b>thallium</b> from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize <b>thallium</b> from the tissue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thallium</b> {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some <b>thallium,</b> but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other <b>thallium</b> minerals, containing 16% to 60% <b>thallium,</b> occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of <b>thallium.</b> The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where <b>thallium</b> was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of <b>thallium,</b> and it is a source for several rare <b>thallium</b> minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thallium</b> {{is found}} in the {{minerals}} crookesite TlCu7Se4, hutchinsonite TlPbAs5S9, and lorándite TlAsS2. <b>Thallium</b> also occurs as a trace element in iron pyrite, and <b>thallium</b> is extracted as a by-product of roasting this mineral for the production of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} that the annual worldwide production of <b>thallium</b> is about 10metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. <b>Thallium</b> is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected {{at the end of}} the smelting process. The raw materials used for <b>thallium</b> production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The <b>thallium</b> is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The <b>thallium</b> is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At the end it is converted to <b>thallium</b> sulfate and the <b>thallium</b> is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates. The production of <b>thallium</b> decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15metric tonnes to about 10tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high <b>thallium</b> content, it would be possible to increase the production if a new application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|A mercury–thallium alloy, {{which forms}} a {{eutectic}} at 8.5% <b>thallium,</b> {{is reported to}} freeze at−60°C, some 20°C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as <b>thallium</b> trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. <b>Thallium</b> is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble <b>thallium</b> salts are added to gold plating baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>thallium</b> is a {{modestly}} abundant {{element in}} the Earth's crust, with a concentration estimated to be about 0.7mg/kg, mostly in association with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granites, <b>thallium</b> is not generally economically recoverable from these sources. The major source of <b>thallium</b> for practical purposes is the trace amount that is found in copper, lead, zinc, and other heavy-metal-sulfide ores.|$|E
5|$|As both {{scientists}} discovered <b>thallium</b> {{independently and}} {{a large part of}} the work, especially the isolation of the metallic <b>thallium</b> was done by Lamy, Crookes tried to secure his priority on the work. Lamy was awarded a medal at the International Exhibition in London 1862: For the discovery of a new and abundant source of <b>thallium</b> and after heavy protest Crookes also received a medal: <b>thallium,</b> for the discovery of the new element. The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|Nihonium is {{expected}} to be much denser than <b>thallium,</b> having a predicted density of about 16 to 18g/cm3, due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of its 7s and 7p1/2 orbitals. This is because calculations estimate it to have an atomic radius of about 170pm, {{the same as that of}} <b>thallium,</b> even though periodic trends would predict it to have an atomic radius larger than that of <b>thallium</b> due to it being one period further down in the periodic table. The melting and boiling points of nihonium are not definitely known, but have been calculated to be 430°C and 1100°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and <b>thallium,</b> following periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thallium</b> and its {{compounds}} {{are extremely}} toxic, and should be handled with care. There are numerous recorded cases of fatal <b>thallium</b> poisoning. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for <b>thallium</b> exposure in the workplace as 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 15mg/m3, <b>thallium</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thallium</b> has 25 {{isotopes}} {{which have}} atomic masses {{that range from}} 184 to 210. 203Tl and 205Tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural <b>thallium.</b> 204Tl is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 3.78 years. It is made by the neutron activation of stable <b>thallium</b> in a nuclear reactor. The most useful radioisotope, 201Tl (half-life 73 hours), decays by electron capture, emitting X-rays (~70–80keV), and photons of 135 and 167keV in 10% total abundance; therefore, it has good imaging characteristics without excessive patient radiation dose. It {{is the most popular}} isotope used for <b>thallium</b> nuclear cardiac stress tests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thallium</b> is {{malleable}} and sectile {{enough to}} be cut with a knife at room temperature. It has a metallic luster that, when exposed to air, quickly tarnishes to a bluish-gray tinge, resembling lead. It may be preserved by immersion in oil. A heavy layer of oxide builds up on <b>thallium</b> if left in air. In the presence of water, <b>thallium</b> hydroxide is formed. Sulfuric and nitric acid dissolve <b>thallium</b> rapidly to make the sulfate and nitrate salts, while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium(I) chloride layer.|$|E
5|$|The Manufacture of <b>Thallium,</b> British Association, 1864.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). <b>Thallium</b> will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. <b>Thallium</b> is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time <b>thallium</b> compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thallium</b> is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, by <b>thallium,</b> the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that <b>thallium</b> conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thallium</b> is the {{heaviest}} stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At {{the bottom of}} the periodic table, the inert pair effect is quite strong, because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and <b>thallium</b> compounds with <b>thallium</b> in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl+ (164pm), K+ (152pm) and Ag+ (129pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 periodic table. (Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put <b>thallium</b> in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank.) However, <b>thallium</b> also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium. While Tl+ is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the <b>thallium</b> halides (except TlF) are quite insoluble in water, and TlI has an unusual structure {{because of the presence of}} the stereochemically active inert pair in <b>thallium.</b>|$|E
5|$|A <b>thallium</b> atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged}} in the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence <b>thallium,</b> like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of the improved method of flame spectroscopy by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff and the discovery of caesium and rubidium in the years 1859 to 1860, flame spectroscopy became an approved method to determine the composition of minerals and chemical products. William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy both started to use the new method. William Crookes used it to make spectroscopic determinations for tellurium on selenium compounds deposited in the lead chamber of a sulfuric acid production plant near Tilkerode in the Harz mountains. He had obtained the samples for his research on selenium cyanide from August Hofmann years earlier. By 1862, Crookes was able to isolate small quantities of the new element and determine the properties of a few compounds. Claude-Auguste Lamy used a spectrometer that was similar to Crookes' to determine the composition of a selenium-containing substance which was deposited during the production of sulfuric acid from pyrite. He also noticed the new green line in the spectra and concluded that a new element was present. Lamy had received this material from the sulfuric acid plant of his friend Fréd Kuhlmann and this by-product was available in large quantities. Lamy started to isolate the new element from that source. The fact that Lamy was able to work ample quantities of <b>thallium</b> enabled him to determine the properties of several compounds and in addition he prepared a small ingot of metallic <b>thallium</b> which he prepared by remelting <b>thallium</b> he had obtained by electrolysis of <b>thallium</b> salts.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{widespread}} application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, {{was the main}} substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This isotope of <b>thallium</b> can be generated using a transportable generator {{which is similar to}} the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of <b>thallium</b> with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, <b>thallium</b> is {{produced}} not from potassium ores, {{but as a}} byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores. Approximately 60–70% of <b>thallium</b> production {{is used in the}} electronics industry, and the remainder is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, nontoxic amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to <b>thallium</b> in the boron group. Nihonium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and <b>thallium,</b> and behave as a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them. Unlike all the other p-block elements, it may be able to involve its d-electrons in bonding, although these predictions are disputed.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and <b>thallium.</b> Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, <b>thallium,</b> and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of <b>thallium,</b> but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E
5|$|Organothallium {{compounds}} {{tend to be}} thermally unstable, in concordance {{with the}} trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also {{the lowest in the}} group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R2TlX. <b>Thallium</b> forms the stable + ion in aqueous solution: like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and 2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like indium, <b>thallium</b> cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).|$|E
5|$|<b>Thallium</b> {{tends to}} oxidize to the +3 and +1 {{oxidation}} states as ionic salts. The +3 state {{resembles that of}} the other elements in group 13 (boron, aluminium, gallium, indium). However, the +1 state, which is far more prominent in <b>thallium</b> than the elements above it, recalls the chemistry of alkali metals, and thallium(I) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores, and (when ingested) are handled in many ways like potassium ions (K+) by ion pumps in living cells.|$|E
5|$|The RIKEN team {{produced}} a further atom on 2 April 2005, although the decay data were slightly {{different from the}} first chain, perhaps due to either {{the formation of a}} metastable state or an alpha particle escaping from the detector before depositing its full energy. In 2004, the RIKEN team also studied the 205Tl(70Zn,n)274Rg reaction, retaining the zinc beam and impinging it on a <b>thallium</b> rather than a bismuth target, in an effort to directly produce 274Rg in a cross-bombardment as the immediate daughter of 278Nh. However, the <b>thallium</b> target was weak compared to the more commonly used lead and bismuth targets, and it deteriorated significantly and became non-uniform in thickness; hence no atoms of 274Rg were observed. This reaction was repeated in 2010 with upgraded equipment, but again without success. The reasons for this weakness are still unknown, given that <b>thallium</b> has a higher melting point than bismuth.|$|E
5|$|The odorless and {{tasteless}} <b>thallium</b> sulfate {{was once}} widely used as rat poison and ant killer. Since 1972 this use has been prohibited in the United States due to safety concerns. Many other countries followed this example in subsequent years. <b>Thallium</b> salts {{were used in}} the treatment of ringworm, other skin infections and to reduce the night sweating of tuberculosis patients. This use has been limited due to their narrow therapeutic index, and the development of improved medicines for these conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores {{from the}} mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They {{dissolved}} the minerals pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. Reich, who was color-blind, employed Richter {{as an assistant}} for detecting the colored spectral lines. Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain <b>thallium,</b> they searched for the green <b>thallium</b> emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E
5|$|Only a few {{compounds}} with metals {{have been}} reported, {{in the form}} of astatides of sodium, palladium, silver, <b>thallium,</b> and lead. Some characteristic properties of silver and sodium astatide, and the other hypothetical alkali and alkaline earth astatides, have been estimated by extrapolation from other metal halides.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thallium</b> iodide is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} additive in metal-halide lamps, often together {{with one or two}} halides of other metals. It allows optimization of the lamp temperature and color rendering, and shifts the spectral output to the green region, which is useful for underwater lighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} use of <b>thallium</b> {{was the use}} as poison for rodents. After several accidents the use as poison {{was banned}} in the United States by Presidential Executive Order 11643 in February 1972. In subsequent years several other countries also banned its use.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known metals—common metals such as iron, copper, and tin, {{and precious}} metals such as silver, gold, and platinum—are heavy metals. From 1809 onwards, light metals, such as magnesium, aluminium, and titanium, were discovered, {{as well as}} less well-known heavy metals including gallium, <b>thallium,</b> and hafnium.|$|E
5|$|The maximum nickel {{concentration}} in Mahanoy Creek is 895 micrograms per liter and the maximum silver concentration is 0.9 micrograms per liter. The concentration of <b>thallium</b> does not exceed 0.02 micrograms per liter and {{the concentration of}} vanadium does not exceed 1 microgram per liter. The maximum concentration of zinc is 3.2 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|Other {{heavy metals}} noted for their {{potentially}} hazardous nature, usually as toxic environmental pollutants, include manganese (central nervous system damage); cobalt and nickel (carcinogens); copper, zinc, selenium and silver (endocrine disruption, congenital disorders, or general toxic effects in fish, plants, birds, or other aquatic organisms); tin, as organotin (central nervous system damage); antimony (a suspected carcinogen); and <b>thallium</b> (central nervous system damage).|$|E
5|$|A {{saturated}} solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water {{is known as}} Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colourless upon reducing the concentration of the <b>thallium</b> salts. With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E
5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and <b>thallium</b> (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E
5|$|Bell was an {{energetic}} and skilful entrepreneur {{as well as}} an innovative metallurgist. He was involved in multiple partnerships with his brothers to make iron and alkali chemicals, and with other pioneers including Robert Stirling Newall to make steel cables. He pioneered the large-scale manufacture of aluminium at his Washington works, conducting experiments in its production, and in the production of other chemicals such as the newly discovered element <b>thallium.</b> He was a director of major companies including the North Eastern Railway and the Forth Bridge company, then the largest bridge project in the world.|$|E
