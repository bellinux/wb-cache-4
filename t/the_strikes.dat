5|$|On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard {{joined the}} strike, under the {{leadership}} of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by <b>the</b> <b>strikes,</b> from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of <b>the</b> <b>strikes,</b> with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes). More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.|$|E
5|$|The Workers and Socialist Party (WASP) was {{launched}} on Human Rights Day 2013 by {{leaders of the}} independent mineworkers' strike committees that led <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> in the mining industry in 2012, {{before and after the}} Marikana massacre, and the Democratic Socialist Movement (DSM).|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> at Otoka and Dvor, Bosnian Serb forces {{continued}} to target NATO aircraft with surface-to-air missiles, while advancing against the Bihać enclave. On 24 November, Serb forces fired radar-guided missiles at two British Tornado F3 aircraft. The next day, Serb forces fired on two NATO F-16s. In {{response to this}} growing SAM threat, and the UNPROFOR hostages, NATO suspended flights in Bosnian airspace on 2 December.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> had {{a strong}} unifying effect on staff, {{bringing}} them together across race, class and employment category. During <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> Professor Dasarath Chetty, director of public relations, circulated emails to staff threatening to dock pay for time spent not at work, and instructing them not {{to speak to the}} press about <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Students also joined in on <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> with approximately 1000 students participating during one day on the Pietermaritzburg campus. On 16 February 2006, two weeks after the start of <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> unions and management reached agreement and issued a joint press release suspending <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> release also pledged to [...] "develop processes for the full engagement of all issues raised" [...] during <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Congress, too, {{was active}} in <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> [...] Each chamber of Congress passed {{non-binding}} resolutions urging Truman to use the Taft-Hartley Act to end <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> while also introducing or passing various bills to permit the president to end <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Ultimately, however, Congress did not act before <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> ended.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{years after}} <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> {{newspapers}} had still not recovered the lost circulation from <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s rising shore costs, dock workers strikes, {{restrictive}} practices {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic, and subsidised competition from American shipping lines, persuaded Manchester Liners to switch its future fleet to container ships only. An example of the delaying effect of <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> in the Canadian ports, with consequent impact on operating costs, was an extended ninety-day return voyage to Quebec City in early 1967 by the new Manchester Progress.|$|E
5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. They were much weaker than <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. <b>The</b> <b>strikes</b> were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, Czesław Kiszczak, the Minister of Internal Affairs, {{declared}} {{on television}} {{that the government}} was willing to negotiate, and five days later he met with Wałęsa. <b>The</b> <b>strikes</b> ended the following day, and on November 30, during a televised debate between Wałęsa and Alfred Miodowicz (leader of the pro-government trade union, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions), Wałęsa scored a public-relations victory.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> and <b>the</b> public was, by and large, opposed to <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> as well. Several of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> and in maintaining the calm during <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> itself.|$|R
5000|$|But when <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> persisted, <b>the</b> sheriff—in {{collusion}} {{with mine}} owners—recruited {{a force of}} 1,300 hooligans to become deputies and break <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Although <b>the</b> mine owners and union had reached an agreement ending <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> deputies remained in Cripple Creek.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{publications}} were created or benefited from <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> New York Review of Books was created during <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> issuing its first copies on February 21, 1963, with circulation reaching 75,000 during <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> before retreating to between 50,000 and 60,000 following <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> Brooklyn Eagle saw circulation grow from 50,000 to 390,000 before shrinking to 154,000 {{before it was}} hit with a deliverers' strike on June 27, 1963.|$|R
5|$|On Tuesday 3 November a YouGov poll {{conducted}} for The Daily Telegraph appeared {{to show that}} {{public support for the}} industrial action had dropped in comparison to a similar {{poll conducted}} two weeks earlier. However, Richard O'Hagan of the Daily Mail argued that there was little support for <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> due to the economic climate of Britain at the time.|$|E
5|$|The strike action led to {{a backlog}} of tens of {{millions}} of items of undelivered mail, with an estimated 30 million letters and parcels affected after the first wave of walkouts, and rising to in excess of 50 million following the second. Businesses in London were forced to lay off staff, or defer paying them, generally because they were unable to dispatch goods or couldn't receive payment for them. However, <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> had less of an impact outside the capital.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, {{operations}} moved towards {{securing the}} borders with Kenya {{in the provinces}} of Afmadow and Badhadhe in the Lower Juba region. Ethiopian aircraft and attack helicopters struck the town of Doble (Dhoobley) in Afmadow province, {{not far from the}} Kenyan border. <b>The</b> <b>strikes</b> were presumably to hit ICU elements attempting to cross the border. Fighting tailed off after midnight.|$|E
50|$|The unions {{appealed to}} President Theodore Roosevelt on May 7, {{asking him to}} {{investigate}} the causes of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> unions also requested that the president refuse to send troops to Chicago before investigating the status of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> first. On May 10, Dold, Shea and other strike leaders met with Roosevelt personally in Chicago. Roosevelt refused to mediate an end to <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> denounced <b>the</b> use of violence in <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> and warned <b>the</b> labor leaders to settle <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> quickly before federal military intervention was needed.|$|R
25|$|Early in 1934, Bridges and the Albion Hall {{group and}} militants in other ports began {{planning}} a coast-wide <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> Roosevelt administration tried {{to head off}} <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> by appointing a mediation board to oversee negotiations, but neither side accepted its proposed compromise. Bridges was elected chairman of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> committee. <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> began on May 9. While the elected local officers were the nominal leaders of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> at its outset, Bridges led the planning of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> along with his friend Sam Kagel. They recruited rank-and-file opposition to the two proposed contracts that the leadership negotiated and the membership rejected during <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> and <b>the</b> dealings with other unions during related events.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> also {{affected}} Walt Disney. Before <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> he (and <b>the</b> other employees) {{felt as if}} they were [...] "one big family", but during and after <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> Walt felt betrayed and he was not sure whether he could trust anyone. Walt eventually recovered for the most part but never quite forgave the people who had been part of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5|$|As a {{manufacturing}} center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, {{known as the}} Pittsburgh Railway Riots. Militia and federal troops were called {{to the city to}} suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by <b>the</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the {{relatively}} low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>strikes.</b> From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E
50|$|However, in September 2004, local unions 2102 and 3267 won both <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> and <b>the</b> unfair labor {{practice}} charges. All of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> steel {{workers were}} returned to their jobs, and the company was forced to repay a record amount of back pay to all of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> steel workers for the seven years of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Some have called this a significant win for labor and the many families affected by <b>the</b> seven-year <b>strike.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{colliery}} {{was on the}} South Yorkshire coalfield and {{was part}} of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> Yorkshire region of the National Union of Mineworkers, whereas most miners in the Nottinghamshire region worked through <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Two miners from Manton Colliery made headlines in 1984 by challenging <b>the</b> <b>strike's</b> legitimacy under <b>the</b> NUM's constitution, and winning a verdict that <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> was illegal. <b>The</b> miners at Manton had overwhelmingly voted against <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> but police had advised {{that they could not}} guarantee the safety of working miners against pickets.|$|R
50|$|On July 28, {{the third}} day of <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> <b>the</b> Greek {{government}} issued an emergency order informing <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> truck drivers that they must return to work by Thursday July 29, or risk losing their truck driving licenses. The union ignored this order, and continued <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5|$|Harp and Mayer {{conducted}} an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> on airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, a {{coalition}} of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|E
50|$|Throughout <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> {{there were}} {{as many as}} 10,000 workers, which {{included}} people from all trades {{in the city of}} Akron, that picketed around the many gates to the Goodyear factory. The leaders of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> were able to maintain strong moral amongst <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> workers during <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> largely due to the playing of music. There are a couple of known attempts to break <b>the</b> picket <b>strike</b> by using force, the first of which was by the police. The sheriff's force consisted of around 150 deputies as the force approached <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> workers. At <b>the</b> last possible second, the sheriff's force deciding against attempting to break up <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> workers due to number of people that they would be confronting.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> began August 4, 1997, and was <b>the</b> largest <b>strike</b> {{in terms}} of <b>striking</b> workers that <b>the</b> country had seen thus far. Almost 100 percent of UPS workers {{who were members of}} the Teamster Union were {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> UPS losses were over $600 million.|$|R
50|$|After {{two weeks}} the Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Limerick, Phons O'Mara, and the Catholic bishop Denis Hallinan called for <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> to end, and <b>the</b> <b>Strike</b> Committee issued a {{proclamation}} on 27 April 1919 stating that <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> was over.|$|R
5|$|In late 2013 {{multiple}} copyright strikes {{were issued}} by Youtube against Dunne's videos {{for use of}} his own music, as well as against other users who had used his music in their videos with permission. All of <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> were initiated by INDMUSIC, on behalf of TuneCore, the company that distributed Miracle of Sound's songs at the time. Though the incident was resolved successfully, Dunne commented that although TuneCore {{was trying to help}} artists, their efforts did more damage than good and that he depends on let's plays and gaming videos to spread and popularize his music by word of mouth.|$|E
5|$|Italian Tornado IDS and ECR {{aircraft}} {{participated in}} the enforcement of a UN no-fly zone during the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Various coalition aircraft operated from bases in Italy, including RAF Tornados. Italian military aircraft delivered a combined 710 guided bombs and missiles during <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> against Libyan targets. Of these Aeronautica Militare Tornados and AMX fighter-bombers released 550 guided bombs and missiles, and Italian Navy AV-8Bs delivered 160 guided bombs. Italian Tornados launched 20 to 30 Storm Shadow cruise missiles with the rest consisting of Paveway and JDAM guided bombs.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{were not}} through with Phou Pha Thi. The {{combined}} TACAN/TSQ-81 site was, by January, controlling 55 percent of Rolling Thunder strikes in northern North Vietnam and 20 percent of <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> in the Barrel Roll area. On 11 March, Lima Site 85 {{was struck by}} an attack spearheaded by the sappers of the 41st Dac Cong Battalion {{and supported by the}} 923rd PAVN Infantry Battalion and the site was quickly overrun. Five of the Air Force technicians manning the site managed to escape, but 11 more were never heard from again and were carried as missing in action.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> {{was widely}} supported. A group of {{politicians}} in Ticino, the canton in which Bellinzona is located, launched a solidarity fund to provide {{financial support for}} <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> received political support from the Ticino canton government and the bishop of Ticino, who also coordinated financial assistance. Solidarity committees across Ticino raised {{more than one million}} francs (600,000 euros) in support of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> was {{met with}} heavy-handed {{repression}} from the authorities. Seeking to quash <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> Interior Ministry and the Railways Directorate threatened to replace Iraqi workers with Indian labourers and cut the water supply to the workers' living quarters in Bagdhad. These moves prompted solidarity actions and the spread to <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> to Samawah on April 16, Basra on April 18 and Mosul on April 19. The members of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> committee were arrested. The Railway Workers Union was banned. However, <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> continued. In <b>the</b> end the Railway Directorate agreed to a 20-30% salary hike.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the weapons}} {{traditionally}} wielded by already-established unions is strike action. Some companies may decline entirely {{to negotiate with the}} union, and respond to <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> by hiring replacement workers. This may create a crisis situation for strikers [...] - [...] do they stick to their original plan and rely upon their solidarity, or is there a chance that <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> may be lost? How long will <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> last? Will strikers' jobs still be there if <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> fails? Are other strikers defecting from <b>the</b> <b>strike?</b> Companies that hire strikebreakers typically play upon these fears when they attempt to convince union members to abandon <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> and cross <b>the</b> union's picket line.|$|R
