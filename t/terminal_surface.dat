We discuss {{for the first time}} to the best of our knowledge, in the framework of classical electrodynamics, a simple link between the Quasi Normal Modes (QNMs) and the Natural Modes (NMs) for one-dimensional (1 D), two-sided, open cavities. The QNM eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions are calculated for a linear Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity. The first-order Born approximation is applied to the same cavity in order to compare the first-order Born approximated and the actual QNM eigenfunctions of the cavity. We demonstrate that the first-order Born approximation for an FP cavity introduces symmetry breaking: in fact, each Born approximated QNM eigenfunction produces values below or above the actual QNM eigenfunction value on the <b>terminal</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the same cavity. Consequently, the two error-functions for an approximated QNM are not equal in proximity to the two <b>terminal</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the cavity.

40|$|We study {{constant}} speed coplanar successive pursuit of E 1 and E 2 by a faster P. A capture of Ei occurs if the distance |PEi | becomes less {{or equal to}} a given Ri ≥ 0; see [1]–[3] for identical speed of the evaders and Ri = 0, and [4, 5] for Ri> 0, i = 1, 2. P strives to capture {E 1, E 2 } in a succession of catches that provides minimal total time. Thus, a successive pursuit game is naturally divided into two stages. Only the first stage is of interest. At this stage P must eventually choose a <b>terminal</b> <b>surface</b> M 1 = {z: |z 1 −zp | = R 1 } orM 2 = {z: |z 2 −zp | = R 2 } where zp, z 1, and z 2 are positions of P, E 1, and E 2 in the plane, z is the state vector (zp, z 1, z 2).

40|$|Presented is a {{new method}} for calculating the time-optimal {{guidance}} control for a multiple vehicle pursuit-evasion system. A joint differential game of k pursuing vehicles relative to the evader is constructed, and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation that describes {{the evolution of the}} value function is formulated. The value function is built such that the terminal cost is the squared distance from the boundary of the <b>terminal</b> <b>surface.</b> Additionally, all vehicles are assumed to have bounded controls. Typically, a joint state space constructed in this way would have too large a dimension to be solved with existing grid-based approaches. The value function is computed efficiently in high-dimensional space, without a discrete grid, using the generalized Hopf formula. The optimal time-to-reach is iteratively solved, and the optimal control is inferred from the gradient of the value function. Comment: Updated to correct some minor typos.

40|$|A {{differential}} game {{approach is}} presented {{for studying the}} response of a gyro by treating the controlled angular velocity about the input axis as the evader, and the bounded but uncertain angular velocity about the spin axis as the pursuer. When the uncertain angular velocity about the spin axis desires to force the gyro to saturation a differential game problem with two <b>terminal</b> <b>surfaces</b> results, whereas when the evader desires to attain the equilibrium state the usual game with single terminal manifold arises. A barrier, delineating the capture zone (CZ) in which the gyro can attain saturation and the escape zone (EZ) in which the evader avoids saturation is obtained. The CZ is further delineated into two subregions such that the states in each subregion can be forced on a definite target manifold.
