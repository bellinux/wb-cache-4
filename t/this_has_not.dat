5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka {{separated the}} Himalayan {{population as a}} third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus. A Pleistocene form from Europe {{was similar to the}} extant subspecies, and is sometimes categorised as P.g.vetus.|$|E
5|$|Two temples {{dating to}} Late Chikanel times had masonry-walled {{superstructures}} {{that may have}} been corbel-vaulted, although <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been proven. One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a scrollwork background, painted in yellow, black, pink and red.|$|E

5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> always been the case. For {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.|$|E
5|$|B. Lance Armstrong was {{declared}} winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005. However, in October 2012 he {{was stripped of}} all titles by the UCI due {{to the use of}} performance-enhancing drugs. The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that if this happened, there would be no alternate winners for those years, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet been made official.|$|E
5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet been studied, however.|$|E

5|$|Bethune's episcopal acta, or his {{decisions}} {{and other documents}} relating to his episcopal career, {{have been published in}} the English Episcopal Acta series, in the volume relating to the diocese of Hereford. A medieval catalogue of works at Llanthony Priory also recorded that they owned a collection of letters by Bethune, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> survived.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females have short, {{straight}} fur that is relatively dense and without spots or patterns. Both sexes are generally a reddish-brown dorsally and colored a dirty cream ventrally. When in rut, they may have an orange coloration to their abdomen from a reddish substance secreted by a chest gland secretions, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been consistently observed by all researchers. The tail tends to be lighter in coloration than the sides. Juveniles are either gray or nearly white.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, {{although it is not}} clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E

5|$|Carter also {{reflects}} on the intriguing possibility, however remote, that a discovery in an unexplored library might one day bring some of this missing music to light. As of 2015 <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> occurred; however, a setting of Rinuccini's libretto by the British composer Alexander Goehr was performed at London's Royal Opera House on 15 September 1995, under the title Arianna. Goehr worked from Rinuccini's original script and, {{as a tribute to}} the historic opera, incorporated sections of Monteverdi's setting of the lament into his score.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{death in}} 952 is {{recorded}} by the Irish annals, who enter it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm's death. The last of Constantine's certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, ConstantineIII (Constantín mac Cuiléin). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amlaíb mac Gofraid {{was married to a}} daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, but like the name of his wife, or wives, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been recorded.|$|E
5|$|During Operation Guardian II a {{squadron}} was deployed {{to protect the}} March 2002 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in south-east Queensland. During this, the Australian Defence Force pilots were given permission to destroy any hostile aircraft. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> happened {{at any time during}} Australian peace time, but was deemed necessary because of the 11 September 2001 attacks six months earlier.|$|E

5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{confluence}} of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers may have been a zone of hybridization between these two species, although no conclusive results have indicated current interbreeding. In general, the Antainambalana River appears to isolate the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, V. v. subcincta. The subspecies V. v. variegata can be found further south, and V. v. editorum is the southernmost subspecies. The ranges of these two southern subspecies overlap and intermediate forms are reported to exist, although <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the University of Chicago claimed 133,155 living alumni. While the university's first president, William Rainey Harper {{stressed}} the importance of perennial theory over practicality in his institution's curriculum, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> stopped the alumni of Chicago from being amongst the wealthiest in the world.|$|E

5|$|More than 5000 {{cases of}} {{poisoning}} {{occur in the}} United States each year. Those affected are often adults and male. Deaths from ethylene glycol have been reported as early as 1930. An outbreak of deaths in 1937 due to a medication mixed in a similar compound, diethylene glycol, resulted in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 in the United States which mandated evidence of safety before new medications could be sold. Antifreeze products sometimes have a substance to make it bitter added to discourage drinking by children and other animals but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{been found to be}} effective.|$|E
5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists now know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania IBA #33is on the Allegheny Front, {{which is}} along a prime migratory path {{for a variety}} of birds of prey. The golden eagle, bald eagle, osprey, and {{northern}} harrier pass through the area during their annual migration periods. It is possible that the bald eagle may nest within the IBA, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been confirmed. Raptors which do nest in the forests of the IBA include the northern goshawk, red-shouldered, broad-winged, red-tailed, sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks.|$|E
