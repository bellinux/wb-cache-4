Although the calculated water use via <b>thermal</b> <b>dissipation</b> probing of some tropical plants such as bamboos correlates strongly with measured water use found by tracking D2O movement, the exact values are not the same. In fact, with leguminous tree species Gliricidia sepium, which produces a heartwood, transpired water did not even correlate strongly with injected D2O concentrations, which would further complicate water use measurements from direct injections. This possibly occurred because heartwoods could accumulate heavy water rather than move the water directly through xylem and to leaves.|$|E

40|$|Active {{control of}} heat flux can be {{realized}} with transformation optics (TO) thermal metamaterials. Recently, {{a new class of}} metamaterial tunable cells has been proposed, aiming to significantly reduce the difficulty of fabrication and to flexibly switch functions by employing several cells assembled on related positions following the TO design. However, owing to the integration and rotation of materials in tunable cells, they might lead to extra thermal losses as compared with the previous continuum design. This paper focuses on investigating the thermodynamic properties of tunable cells under related design parameters. The universal expression for the local entropy generation rate in such metamaterial systems is obtained considering the influence of rotation. A series of contrast schemes are established to describe the thermodynamic process and thermal energy distributions from the viewpoint of entropy analysis. Moreover, effects of design parameters on <b>thermal</b> <b>dissipations</b> and system irreversibility are investigated. In conclusion, more <b>thermal</b> <b>dissipations</b> and stronger thermodynamic processes occur in a system with larger conductivity ratios and rotation angles.

40|$|Greenhouse {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare stress effects caused by Verticilliumdahliae and drought on gas exchange, chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence and photosynthetic pigments of pepperplants. Three treatments were compared: Verticillium inoculated plants (+V), non-inoculated well-watered plants (âˆ’V) and non-inoculated plants subjected to progressive drought (D). Gas exchange, fluorescence and photosynthetic pigments were measured and represented along a gradient of relative water content (RWC) and stomatal conductance (gs). Net photosynthesis (A) and electron transport rate (ETR) decreased, as RWC and gs declined, similarly in both +V and D plants. However, dark respiration (RD) and photorespiration (RL) tended to increase in inoculated plants compared to those subjected to soil drought, as gs decreased. Photoinhibitory damage was not observed in infected or in droughted plants. Soil drought decreased intrinsic PSII efficiency (Î¦exc.), which seemed to result in part from enhanced xanthophyll cycle- and/or lutein-related <b>thermal</b> energy <b>dissipation.</b> Nevertheless, the fact that 1 âˆ’Î¦exc. increased in D only at high values of the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle (DPS) suggests that Î”pH could be the major factor controlling <b>thermal</b> energy <b>dissipation</b> in this treatment. By contrast, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin and lutein, as well as Î¦exc., were not markedly affected in +V.

40|$|Unfavorable soil {{conditions}} in crops and natural habitats include limited availability {{of water and}} nutrients, presence of salts, {{as well as an}} excess of essential nutrients and heavy metals. When plants are exposed to such stresses, rates of photosynthetic carbon fixation decrease for a variety of reasons, while plants continue gathering sunlight. As a consequence of the resulting imbalance between light absorption and energy utilization, plants experience what the research community has termed photoinhibition, which {{is considered to be a}} reflection of either photoprotection mechanisms or photodamage. Data reported to date suggest that under unfavorable {{soil conditions}}, photoprotection mechanisms are far more important than photodamage. Plants under stress generally dissipate thermally, i. e., as heat, a large part of the light absorbed by photosystem II in a process mediated by âˆ†pH, xanthophyll pigments (particularly zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin), and the photosystem II subunit S (PsbS) protein. Changes in <b>thermal</b> energy <b>dissipation</b> under unfavorable soil conditions are summarized here. Very high levels of <b>thermal</b> energy <b>dissipation</b> are frequently, but not always, accompanied by decreases in leaf chlorophyll concentration, such as those found under N and Fe deficiency, excess Al, or water stress in some species.

40|$|The {{response}} of photoprotection mechanisms to a short-term water stress period followed by rewatering, to simulate common episodic water stress periods occurring in Mediterranean areas, was studied in 10 potted plants representative of different growth forms and leaf habits. During water stress and recovery, relative water content, stomatal conductance, leaf pigment composition, electron transport rates, maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F v/Fm), <b>thermal</b> energy <b>dissipation</b> and photorespiration rates (Pr) were determined. All the species analyzed {{proved to be}} strongly resistant to photoinactivation of PSII under the imposed water stress conditions. The responses of the analyzed parameters did not differ largely among species, suggesting that Mediterranean plants have similar needs and capacity for photoprotection under episodic water stress periods regardless of their growth form and leaf habit. A general pattern of photoprotection emerged, consisting in maintenance or increase of Pr at mild stress and the increase of the <b>thermal</b> energy <b>dissipation</b> at more severe stress. Adjustments in pigment pool sizes were not an important short-term response to water stress. The increase of <b>thermal</b> energy <b>dissipation</b> because of water stress depended mostly on the de-epoxidation state of xanthophylls, although the slope and kinetics of such relationship strongly differed among species, suggesting species-dependent additional roles of de-epoxidated xanthophylls. Also, small decreases in Fv/Fm at predawn during water stress were strongly correlated with maintained de-epoxidation of the xanthophylls cycle, suggesting that a form of xanthophyll-dependent sustained photoprotection was developed during short-term water stress not only in evergreen but also in semideciduous and annual species.
