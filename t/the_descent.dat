5|$|The Lunar Module (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. <b>The</b> <b>descent</b> stage contained storage for <b>the</b> <b>descent</b> propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E
5|$|The breakaway's {{lead was}} reduced to {{less than two minutes}} {{at the foot of the}} first climb. Howes {{attacked}} alone, with Madrazo following. On <b>the</b> <b>descent,</b> however, Howes fell. He was passed by Madrazo and by the peloton, which had caught the remainder of the breakaway. On the flat section that followed the climb, several groups, including that of Chaves, came back together. Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step) attacked, but was soon caught and passed by his teammate Gianluca Brambilla, who was part of a four-man group that formed on the final ascent of the day. Tom Dumoulin attempted to control the peloton on the climb, but there were attacks from various riders including some of the general classification favourites. After <b>the</b> <b>descent,</b> the groups came back together and the lead group was formed of approximately 40 riders.|$|E

40|$|The satisfiability (SAT) {{problem is}} a basic problem in {{computing}} theory. Presently, an active area of research on SAT problem is to design efficient optimization algorithms for finding a solution for a satisfiable CNF formula. A new formulation, the Universal SAT problem model, which transforms the SAT problem on Boolean space into an optimization problem on real space has been developed [31, 35, 34, 32]. Many optimization techniques, such as <b>the</b> steepest <b>descent</b> method, Newton's method, and <b>the</b> coordinate <b>descent</b> method, {{can be used to}} solve the Universal SAT problem.
