40|$|Stream {{networks}} {{have recently been}} discovered to be major but poorly constrained natural greenhouse gas (GHG) sources. A fundamental problem is that several measurement approaches have been used without cross-comparisons. Flux chambers represent a potentially powerful methodological approach if robust and reliable ways to use chambers on running water can be defined. Here we compare the use of anchored and freely drifting chambers on various streams with different flow velocities. The study clearly shows that (1) anchored <b>chambers</b> enhance <b>turbulence</b> under the <b>chambers</b> and thus elevate fluxes, (2) drifting chambers have a very small impact on the water <b>turbulence</b> under the <b>chamber</b> and thus generate more reliable fluxes, (3) the bias of the anchored chambers greatly depends on chamber design and sampling conditions, and (4) there is a promising method to reduce the bias from anchored chambers by using a flexible plastic foil collar to seal the chambers to the water surface, rather than having rigid chamber walls penetrating into the water. Altogether, these results provide novel guidance on how to apply flux chambers in running water, which will have important consequences for measurements to constrain the global GHG balances.

40|$|Ion current {{measurements}} {{can give}} information useful for controlling the combustion stability in a multi-cylinder engine. Operation near the dilution limit (air or EGR) {{can be achieved}} {{and it can be}} optimized individually for the cylinders, resulting in a system with better engine stability for highly diluted mixtures. This method will also compensate for engine wear, e. g., changes in volumetric efficiency and fuel injector characteristics. Especially in a port-injected engine, changes in fuel injector characteristics can lead to increased emissions and deteriorated engine performance when operating with a closed-loop lambda control system. One problem using the ion-current signal to control engine stability near the lean limit is the weak signal resulting in low signal-to-noise ratio.

The study for this type of engine, which has not being reported in the literature, shows a promise of the present method and reveals that above 60 per cent of maximum load the whole effect is beneficial concerning specific fuel consumption and smoke reduction. The examination of gaseous pollutant levels shows an involved relation with respect to load and fuel proportions.

40|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} from lean burn natural gas engines {{may not always}} be as low as the potential permits, especially engines with open-loop lambda control. These engines can produce much higher emissions than a comparable diesel engine without exhaust gas aftertreatment. Even if the engine has closed-loop lambda control, emissions are often unacceptably high for future emission regulations. A three-way catalyst is, today, the best way to reduce hazardous emissions. The drawback is that the engine has to operate with a stoichiometric mixture and this leads to; higher heat losses, higher pumping work at low to medium loads, higher thermal stress on the engine and higher knock tendency (requiring lower compression ratio, and thus lower brake efficiency). One way to reduce these drawbacks is to dilute the stoichiometric mixture with EGR. This paper compares lean burn operation with operation at stoichiometric conditions diluted with EGR, and using a three-way catalyst. The results show that nitric oxides (NOdx) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are several orders of magnitude lower than at lean operation. Higher loads can be achieved, and brake efficiency is higher than lean operation optimized for low NOdx production.

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of {{turbulence}} on particles in a particulate two-phase flow, {{it is important to}} be able to measure the three-dimensional (3 D) positions and velocities of particles. While such experimental capability has been lacking in the past, Holographic PIV (HPIV) is emerging as a 3 D measurement technique to fill in this blank. The development of HPIV was originally motivated from the need to map out turbulent flow fields. We demonstrate that besides giving flow velocity field on 3 D grids as a result of correlation (spatial averaging), our off-axis HPIV technique can further provide positions and velocities of individual particles, whether seeded or inherent in the flow. Such information on individual particles opens a new arena for the utility of the HPIV technique â€“ a 3 D diagnostics tool for the disperse phase. In the present experiment, an isotropic turbulent flow was generated using eight identical fans in an airtight turbulent chamber, and aluminum powder of 20 microns was added in the chamber as particles. A fully automated off-axis HPIV system based on an injection-seeded dual-pulsed YAG laser and 3 D data processing software was used to measure the particulate phase in the chamber. The validity of particle centroid finding and velocity extraction was established via computer-generated particle images dispersed in a rotating flow. Results show that the holographic system is capable of processing a huge number of particles with high accuracy. In the actual holographic measurement of the <b>turbulence</b> <b>chamber,</b> 3 D individual particle positions, shapes, and velocities were obtained by analyzing a pair of instantaneous holographic images recorded in rapid succession.

40|$|This {{research}} addresses turbulent gas flows {{laden with}} fine solid particles at sufficiently large mass loading that strong two-way coupling occurs. By two-way coupling we {{mean that the}} particle motion is governed largely by the flow, while the particles affect the gas-phase mean flow and the turbulence properties. Our main interest is in understanding how the particles affect the turbulence. Computational techniques have been developed which can accurately predict flows carrying particles that are {{much smaller than the}} smallest scales of turbulence. Also, advanced computational techniques and burgeoning computer resources make it feasible to fully resolve very large particles moving through turbulent flows. However, flows with particle diameters of the same order as the Kolmogorov scale of the turbulence are notoriously difficult to predict. Some simple flows show strong turbulence attenuation with reductions in the turbulent kinetic energy by up to a factor of five. On the other hand, some seemingly similar flows show almost no modification. No model has been proposed that allows prediction of when the strong attenuation will occur. Unfortunately, many technological and natural two-phase flows fall into this regime, so there is a strong need for new physical understanding and modeling capability. Our objective is to study the simplest possible turbulent particle-laden flow, namely homogeneous, isotropic turbulence with a uniform dispersion of monodisperse particles. We chose such a simple flow for two reasons. First, the simplicity allows us to probe the interaction in more detail and offers analytical simplicity in interpreting the results. Secondly, this flow can be addressed by numerical simulation, and many research groups are already working on calculating the flow. Our detailed data can help guide some of these efforts. By using microgravity, we can further simplify the flow to the case of no mean velocity for either the turbulence or the particles. In fact the addition of gravity as a variable parameter may help us to better understand the physics of turbulence attenuation. The experiments are conducted in a <b>turbulence</b> <b>chamber</b> capable of producing stationary or decaying isotropic turbulence with nearly zero mean flow and Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers up to nearly 500. The chamber is a 410 mm cubic box with the corners cut off to make it approximately spherical. Synthetic jet turbulence generators are mounted in each of the eight corners of the box. Each generator consists of a loudspeaker forcing a plenum and producing a pulsed jet through a 20 mm diameter orifice. These synthetic jets are directed into ejector tubes pointing towards the chamber center. The ejector tubes increase the jet mass flow and decrease the velocity. The jets then pass through a turbulence grid. Each of the eight loudspeakers is forced with a random phase and frequency. The resulting turbulence is highly Isotropic and matches typical behavior of grid turbulence. Measurements of both phases are acquired using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The gas is seeded with approximately 1 micron diameter seeding particles while the solid phase is typically 150 micron diameter spherical glass particles. A double-pulsed YAG laser and a Kodak ES- 1. 0 10 -bit PIV camera provide the PIV images. Custom software is used to separate the images into individual images containing either gas-phase tracers or large particles. Modern high-resolution PIV algorithms are then used to calculate the velocity field. A large set of image pairs are acquired for each case, then the results are averaged both spatially and over the ensemble of acquired images. The entire apparatus is mounted in two racks which are carried aboard NASA's KC- 135 Flying Microgravity Laboratory.

40|$|The sediment-water {{interface}} is {{an important}} region where biological, chemical, and physical processes occur. Fluid flow determines the ability of organisms to utilize the bottom sediments for food, shelter, and reproduction, the amount and rate of mass transfer between the sediment and bulk fluid, and the deposition, re-suspension and transport of sediment. Field experiments carried out in three medium sized basins, one a heavily polluted lake {{and the other two}} drinking water reservoirs, are used to describe typical turbulence levels during the mid to late stratified season (July through October) in a low energy lacustrine bottom boundary layer. Using these measurements, a <b>turbulence</b> <b>chamber</b> was developed for use in turbulent scalar flux studies. The chamber was characterized using particle image velocimetery (PIV), characterizing the near bed turbulence and dissipation levels. The chamber successfully reproduces the range of turbulent energy levels observed in the field, allowing a more direct comparison of results obtained in field and laboratory studies of scalar fluxes. Results from the two reservoirs were used in laboratory cohesive sediment erosion and resuspension tests of a mono-disperse kaolin clay and natural sediment cores obtained from various bottom and shore locations in one of the reservoirs. This testing showed the small bed stresses typical of the lacustrine bottom boundary layer were not sufficient to erode or resuspend significant quantities of sediment. Higher stress levels caused erosion and resuspension, but it was heterogeneous in nature and appeared to be tied to flow structures associated with the facility used to carry out the experiments. Even at higher stress levels, very short settling times (only 1 - 2 hours) were needed for observable erosion to occur. A method for estimating erosion utilizing images of the sediment-water interface and tracking the interface as an intensity peak over time was developed. Initial results show this is a reliable means to gauge the sediment-water interface position when optical access is available...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of soil-atmosphere {{gas exchange}} {{is essential for}} understanding the magnitude and controls of greenhouse gas emissions. We used an automatic closed dynamic chamber system to measure the fluxes of CO 2 and CH 4 for several years at the ombrotrophic Mer Bleue peatland near Ottawa, Canada and found that atmospheric <b>turbulence</b> and <b>chamber</b> deployment period had a considerable influence on the observed flux rates. With a short deployment period of 2. 5 min, CH 4 flux exhibited strong diel patterns and both CH 4 and nighttime CO 2 effluxes were highly and negatively correlated with friction velocity as were the CO 2 concentration gradients in the top 20 cm of peat. This suggests winds were flushing the very porous and relatively dry near surface peat layers, altering the concentration gradient and resulting in a 9 to 57 % underestimate of CH 4 flux {{at any time of}} day and a 13 to 21 % underestimate of nighttime CO 2 fluxes in highly turbulent conditions. Conversely, there was evidence of an overestimation of ~ 100 % of CH 4 and nighttime CO 2 effluxes in calm atmospheric conditions possibly due to enhanced near-surface gas concentration gradient by mixing of chamber headspace air by fans. These problems were resolved by extending the deployment period to 30 min. After 13 min of chamber closure, the flux rate of CH 4 and nighttime CO 2 became constant and were not affected by turbulence thereafter, yielding a reliable estimate of the net biological fluxes. The measurement biases we observed likely exist to some extent in all chamber flux measurements made on porous and aerated substrate, such as peatlands, organic soils in tundra and forests, and snow-covered surfaces, but would be difficult to detect unless high frequency, semi-continuous observations are made...|$|R

40|$|Sediment {{resuspension}} is initiated {{through a}} variety of mechanisms across the wave breaking, run-up, and run-down stages that occur in the wave breaking, surf, and swash zones. When a wave breaks offshore, the plunging jet rarely reaches the bed directly; however, this injection of momentum generates turbulence that propagates through the water column, creating local stresses as turbulent eddies interact with the seafloor. When these stresses are sufficient to resuspend sediment from the bed, the sediment can become entrained in the flow, and thus both turbulence and sediment are advected shoreward during onshore directed phases of the wave cycle. It is at this time that the fluid is highly turbid, filled with sediment and debris. As the flow enters the swash zone, it runs upshore and slows, and the sediment settles out of entrainment and is deposited onshore. Then, as this relatively clear fluid flow retreats and regains speed in flowing down the beach face, sediment is again resuspended into the flow. But upon careful observation, the turbid region is constrained {{to the base of the}} water column due to shear-dominated resuspenions as a boundary layer grows. The resuspension during the latter event can be attributed to an increased bed shear stress, due to the uniform mean flow along the sediment bed. This mechanism for resuspension is well-understood, as thorough experimental research has led to well-characterized parameters such as the Shields Curve that identify requisite shear stresses for sediment resuspension. However, the former mechanism, in which sediment is resuspended due to the interaction of large-scale turbulent motions, has seen far less research, because of the difficulty in isolating this particular flow in the laboratory and identifying meaningful parameters of the flow necessary for incipient particle motion from the bed. We have chosen to isolate the phenomenon of sediment resuspension by turbulence absent mean shear in the laboratory to better understand this fundamental process. By adapting a <b>turbulence</b> <b>chamber</b> in the DeFrees Hydraulics Lab developed by Variano & Cowen (2008), in which a Randomly Actuated Synthetic Jet Array (RASJA; Variano and Cowen, 2008) is suspended above a tank of water, with jets directed downward, we have a nearly ideal facility for examining decaying horizontally homogeneous isotropic turbulence above a bed. The jets fire according to a specified random algorithm to generate homogeneous isotropic turbulence without inducing mean flows. With a solid glass bottom boundary in place, data were collected with Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements to characterize profiles of the mean flow, turbulence intensity, and kinetic energy. Statistics such as spatial and temporal spectra and parameters of mean flow strength were computed to understand the nature of the turbulence in the facility, revealing a well developed inertial subrange and very weak mean flows [...] The glass was then replaced with a sediment bed, and the tests were repeated to make a direct comparison between the solid and sediment beds. During the sediment tests, resuspension was observed intermittently. We were surprised to find that a rippled pattern quickly evolved in the sand bed, even with relatively few visible resuspension events. Preliminary tests have been performed to examine the relationships between the forced turbulence levels and the mechanisms of resuspension, and we have also performed qualitative studies to investigate the influence of the presence of solid boundaries and turbulence on bed morphology. In order to quantitatively analyze the nec- essary stresses and fluid structures present, a conditional quadrant analysis is performed on the Reynolds stresses. A small project was included to test the performance of a Nortek Aquadopp High Resolution Profiler in the facility. Though the profiler is designed to capture large-scale environmental flows that are uniform across its beams at a given elevation from its transducer face, this investigation was performed to test the instrument's capability to capture high levels of turbulence in a small facility where this assumption breaks down. Direct comparisons were made to simultaneous PIV measurements, and measurements from the Profiler were included in the overall tank characterization...|$|E

By measuring the decrease in CO 2 Concentration inside the box, the exact CO 2 efflux could be calculated. The CO 2 efflux rates measured by the chambers could then be compared with the efflux rates calculated from the box. The error of the closed-chamber system ranged from an underestimate of 19 % to an overestimate of 21 %. The errors were most likely caused by a combination of underestimated chamber volume, causing an underestimation Of CO 2 efflux, and <b>turbulence</b> within the <b>chamber,</b> which increased the flax by disturbing the boundary layer above the surface. The open-chamber system always overestimated the CO 2 efflux. Disturbing the boundary layer alone was believed to cause a 17 % increase in efflux. Increasing negative pressure difference caused a mass flow of CO 2 -rich air into the chamber. At a pressure difference of - 0. 15 Pa, the error was 11 to 40 %, depending on air-filled soil volume. Accordingly, soil-water content, a parameter to which soil CO 2 efflux is often related, was found to substantially affect the measurements made by both tested systems. These results point to the need of calibrating systems used for measuring soil CO 2 efflux is measured against a known flux, to elucidate the limits and applicability of each system...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{chambers}} for {{measurement of}} soil CO 2 efflux were compared against known CO 2 fluxes ranging from 0. 32 to 10. 01 molCO 2 mâˆ’ 2 sâˆ’ 1 and {{generated by a}} specially developed calibration tank. Chambers were tested on fine and coarse homogeneous quartz sand with particle sizes of 0. 05 â€“ 0. 2 and 0. 6 mm, respectively. The effect of soil moisture on chamber measurementswas tested by wetting the fine quartz sand to about 25 %volumetricwater content. Non-steady-state through-flow chambers either underestimated or overestimated fluxes fromâˆ’ 21 to+ 33 % {{depending on the type}} of chamber and the method of mixing air within the chamberâ€™s headspace. However, when results of all systems tested were averaged, fluxes were within 4 % of references. Non-steady-state on-through-flow chambers underestimated or overestimated fluxes from â€“ 35 to + 6 %. On average, the underestimation was about 13 â€“ 14 % on fine sand and 4 % on coarse sand. When the length of the measurement period was increased, the underestimation increased due to the rising concentration within the chamber headspace, which reduced the diffusion gradient within the soil. Steady-state through-flow chambers worked almost equally well in all sand types used in this study. They overestimated the fluxes on average by 2 â€“ 4 %. Overall, the reliability of the chambers was not related to the measurement principle per se. Even the same chambers, with different collar designs, showed highly variable results. The mixing of air within the chamber can be a major source of error. Excessive <b>turbulence</b> inside the <b>chamber</b> can cause mass flow of CO 2 from the soil into the chamber. The chamber headspace concentration also affects the flux by altering the concentration gradient between the soil and the chamber...|$|R
40|$|The Siwek 20 -L chamber {{is widely}} used {{throughout}} the world to evaluate the explosibility of dusts. This research evaluated the quality of dust dispersion in the Siwek 20 -L chamber using Pittsburgh coal, Gilsonite, and purple K dusts. A Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) optical dust probe {{was used to measure}} optical transmittance through the dust cloud at various locations within the chamber. A total of 540 tests were performed, with triplicate tests at five nominal dust concentrations and six locations. The two standard dispersion nozzles (rebound and perforated annular nozzle) were compared. The transmissions corresponding to the normal ignition delay period were used to: (a) determine variations in spatial uniformity of dispersion obtained with both nozzles; (b) make comparisons between the experimental transmission data and those calculated from theory for the three dusts; and (c) make comparisons with transmission data measured in the PRI, 20 -L and Fike 1 -m 3 dust explosion chambers. The uniformity of dispersion for the three dusts was similar with both nozzles, despite the differences in nozzle geometry and mode of operation. Transmission data of the three dusts were all significantly lower than those calculated from theory. This was discovered to be, in part, due to significant reduction in particle size that occurred during dispersion. By measuring particle sizes before and after dispersion, values of 60 %, 50 %, and 20 % reduction in particle size (based on the surface weighted mean diameter) were obtained for Pittsburgh coal, Gilsonite, and purple K, respectively. Transmission data from the PRL 20 -L, Fike 1 -m 3 and the Siwek 20 -L chambers indicated comparable results in terms of uniformity of dispersion. However, transmission data from the Siwek 20 -L chamber were significantly lower than those of the PRL and Fike chambers. Again, this was attributed, in part, to the significant reduction in particle size that occurred during dispersion in the Siwek chamber. The design of the outlet (dispersion) valve of the Siwek 20 -L apparatus charge vessel was largely responsible for the particle break-up. The contribution to particle break-up by the dispersion nozzles and the high level of <b>turbulence</b> in the <b>chamber</b> were found to be minimal. This is a significant finding in that the dust particle size tested for explosibility in the Siwek chamber is considerably smaller than the original dust sample...|$|R
40|$|Dense media {{separation}} (DMS) {{plays an}} integral part in coal processing {{as well as in}} the upgrade of low grade ore bodies prior to further processing like flotation and leaching. Various separating vessels are used in DMS; of which the dense media (DM) cyclone is the most common. However, the limited materials of construction available for DM cyclones leave the industry with little choice. In addition, the DM cyclones available moved away from the basic principles of classification hydrocyclones which is to reduce the turbulence in the feed chamber in order to achieve improved efficiency. The ceramic tiled DM cyclones available in the market have ceramic tiles installed perpendicular to each other in the feed chamber, which increase the turbulence in the feed chamber at the expense of longer equipment life. For that reason, a research project was initiated to establish the current installed base of DM cyclones in Southern Africa and to develop and evaluate a DM cyclone with a laminar spiral feed chamber design to reduce the turbulence when feeding the cyclone, whilst achieving the same or superior wear properties. Because Cavex is well proven in hard rock mining and coal classification, it was used as basis for the development of a DM cyclone. Individual moulds were developed and produced in order to fabricate a Cavex DM cyclone with the exact laminar spiral feed chamber that exists when moulded out of rubber. Afterwards, the Cavex ceramic tiled (CVXT) cyclone was manufactured, installed and commissioned. Using the basic operating principles of hydrocyclones, the predicted results were achieved. The 650 CVXT results confirmed that a DM cyclone and a classification cyclone are inherently the same piece of equipment; it is the selection criteria and material of construction that differ. There is a definite benefit in focussing on metallurgical efficiency in conjunction with wear properties, rather than equipment life (wear life) as the only parameter during equipment fabrication. A simple way to achieve improved performance is to reduce the turbulence in the feed chamber. Further work must include the evaluation of the Cavex CVXT DM cyclone in near gravity coal circuits and to investigate whether the same lower operating pressures (6 D compared to conventional 9 D) will result in improved coal yield, as was illustrated successfully in the separation of fluorspar by DMS, whilst achieving the desired ash contents. The work must include detailed studies on the effect of feed pressure vs. yield/recovery, when the <b>turbulence</b> the feed <b>chamber</b> is reduced. Overall energy savings should be quantified by reducing the cyclone feed pressure...|$|R
40|$|The present review {{discusses}} the current views on methods to minimise dioxins, namely polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), formation in MSW incineration systems. The structure {{of this group}} of compounds is discussed initially and then the toxic equivalence scale is presented for the most common isomers and congeners in the dioxin family. The current status on dioxin limits imposed in various countries and by various organisations is presented. A {{detailed analysis of the}} theories leading to dioxin formation in MSW incineration is given, since, this {{has been one of the}} most controversial areas of dioxin chemistry for the past 20 years. Three dioxin formation theories were considered possible for a long timed (i) from PCDD/PCDFs originally present in the furnace feedstock; (ii) from precursor compounds (foundation formatting molecules which could react rapidly with other groups in the system to form dioxins) in the MSW feed; (iii) from de novo synthesis of smaller, relatively innocuous chemical molecules combining together to form the dioxins. Methods (ii) and (iii) are based on heterogeneously catalysed reactions. Some researchers are considering possible homogeneous thermal reaction formation of dioxin. This review demonstrates that with the advanced modem MSW combustion systems, option (i) is a most unlikely route and also methods (ii) and (iii) are quite feasible. Based on thermodynamic and kinetic data in the literature, the rate and extent of the formation of dioxins and their precursors by certain mechanisms can definitely be contributing to routes (ii) and (iii). Since even the most advanced MSW combustion systems do not produce complete combustion, predominantly because of inadequate feed preparation and turbulence, some de novo synthesis of precursors can also take place. These `de novo precursors' could be carried through the combustion unit adsorbed or absorbed on particulate material such as soot and dust, but also these precursors could be formed during the cooling process by heterogeneous catalytic reactions and go on to form dioxins. The maximum rate of formation of PCDD/PCDFs from both sources lies in the temperature range 300 - 400 degreesC. This knowledge of formation rates and mechanisms provides the basis of designing combustion systems. A two stage approach is adopted firstly, system design to achieve complete combustion and minimise formation; secondly, end-of-pipe treatment systems to remove dioxins. In the first case, combustion temperature should be above 1000 degreesC, combustion residence time should be greater than 1 s, combustion <b>chamber</b> <b>turbulence</b> should be represented by a Reynolds number greater than 50, 000, good MSW feed preparation and controlled feed rate are also critical. In the second category, very rapid gas cooling from 400 to 250 degreesC should be achieved, semi-dry lime scrubbing and bag filtration coupled with activated carbon injection adsorption as end-of-pipe treatments can all play a role in prevention or minimisation of dioxins in the final flue gas emission to the atmosphere, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.
