40|$|M. Cur. Suctioning of endotracheal tubes, in {{premature}} {{infants with}} respiratory distress syndrome, who are undergoing mechanical ventilation, {{is viewed as}} a necessary nursing practise to prevent tube obstruction. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether preoxygenation by hyperoxygenation prevents <b>transcient</b> hypoxaemia, during endotracheal tube suctioning, of ventilated neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. An extensive literature survey confirmed that endotracheal tube suctioning, results in <b>transcient</b> hypoxaemia and demonstrates that this is reflected in the brain, by vasodilatation and deoxygenation : predisposing to the genesis of intra-ventricular haemorrhages and neurodevelopmental problems. The survey further indicated that these effects are preventable by preoxygenation before endotracheal tube suctioning. Twelve premature babies were then used in the study to determine whether preoxygenation by hyperoxygenation prevents <b>transcient</b> hypoxaemia, during endotracheal tube suctioning. The following conclusions during suctioning with preoxygenation were reached, by statistically processing the results : Bradycardia still occurred but at a significantly lesser degree. Significantly less desaturation. Smaller increase in mean blood pressure. Significantly faster recovery to baseline heart rate, transcutaneous oximeter saturation and respiration and a markedly faster recovery to baseline mean blood pressure. The mean arterial blood gas and partial pressure of oxygen showed a slight increase after suctioning. Nursing guidelines were established for beneficial suctioning techniques for premature babies and recommendations were made for further research...|$|E

The limiters consist of half circle or short arc segments in the poloidal direction. They are oscillated locally in the scrape-off layer.

40|$|WRKY {{proteins}} {{are one of}} {{the largest}} transcription factor families in higher plants and play diverse roles in various biological processes. Previous studies have shown that some WRKY members act as negative regulators of secondary cell wall formation in pith parenchyma cells. However, the regulatory mechanism of pith secondary wall formation in tree species remains largely unknown. In this study, PtrWRKY 19 encoding a homolog of Arabidopsis WRKY 12 was isolated from Populus trichocarpa. PtrWRKY 19 was expressed in all tissues tested, with highest expression in stems, especially in pith. PtrWRKY 19 was located in the nucleus and functioned as a transcriptional repressor. Ectopic expression of PtrWRKY 19 in an atwrky 12 mutant successfully rescued the phenotype in pith cell walls caused by the defect of AtWRKY 12, suggesting that PtrWRKY 19 had conserved functions for homologous AtWRKY 12. Overexpression of PtrWRKY 19 in poplar plants led to {{a significant increase in the}} number of pith parenchyma cells. qRT-PCR analysis showed that lignin biosynthesis-related genes were repressed in transgenic plants. In <b>transcient</b> reporter assays, PtrWRKY 19 was identified to repress transcription from the PtoC 4 H 2 promoter containing the conserved W-box elements.

We have investigated the effects of the brominated diterpene O(11) 15 - cyclo- 14 -bromo- 14, 15 -dihydrorogiol- 3, 11 -diol (that we have named VLC 5), extracted from the Mediterranean red algae Laurencia glandulifera. METHODS: The pure extract was tested on primary afferent calcium signals induced by high concentration of KCl, <b>transcient</b> receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) 1 (capsaicin) or TRPV 4 agonists, histamine, or protease-activated receptor- 2 (PAR(2)) agonist. It was also tested in mice in a model of mustard oil-induced colonic hypersensitivity. KEY RESULTS: VLC 5 was inhibited PAR(2) agonist or histamine-induced calcium mobilization in mouse primary afferents, but did not modify calcium signals induced by high concentrations of KCl, TRPV 1 or TRPV 4 agonists. The effect of VLC 5 on histamine-induced calcium signal in primary afferent was inhibited by pertussis toxin pretreatment and was dependent on the activation of mu- or kappa-opioid receptor agonists, as it was inhibited by selective antagonists of those two receptors, but not by selective antagonist of the delta-opioid receptor. Intraperitoneal treatment of mice with VLC 5 (10 mg kg(- 1)) significantly reduced visceral pain behaviors induced by the intracolonic administration of mustard oil, in an opioid receptor-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: We have demonstrated significant analgesic properties for the algal metabolite VLC 5, which is able to signal directly to primary afferents, through a mechanism dependent on the activation of opioid receptors. This identifies a new natural compound capable of activating peripheral opioidergic systems, exerting analgesic properties...|$|E

We compared 1 year clinical outcome after rotational atherectomy following by either DES or Bare Metal Stents (BMS) implantation. MethodsSingle centre registry including all consecutive cases of rotational atherectomy use. Clinical follow-up was obtained in all patients. Propensity score for being treated with a DES was calculated using 18 clinical, angiographic and procedural variables. Comparison was adjusted on 4 strata of the propensity score. ResultsBetween 2002 and 2008, 223 patients were treated: 114 with BMS and 110 with DES. Most of the patients with BMS between 2002 and 2004 and later with DES. No significant difference was observed in clinical characteristics between groups: age 70 years, reference diameter 2. 40 ± 0. 60 mm, lesion length 10 ± 9 mm. Two cases of coronary perforation occurred, 7 lesion failure, and 12 <b>transcient</b> no-reflow. The use of GP 2 b 3 a inhibitors was similar in both groups, but, compared with BMS, patients in the DES group had longer duration of combination of aspirin and Clopidogrel. At one year, significantly lower rates of vessel revascularisation (2 % vs 12 %, p= 0. 005), of all cause mortality (5 % vs 14 %, p= 0. 05) and of MACE (10 % vs 22 %, p= 0. 02) were observed in the DES than in the BMS group. Adjustment on the strata of the propensity score did not change significantly these results (figure). ConclusionsDespite propensity score adjusted, this comparison has limitations.

40|$|UnrestrictedProtein drug {{delivery}} {{is limited to}} needle injection associating with pain, inconvenience, and non- compliance. Therefore, protein drug with oral dosage form is preferred. We used transferrin (Tf) receptor mediated transcytosis and Tf-based recombinant fusion protein approach to achieve oral delivery of human growth hormone (hGH). Plasmid constructs expressing the fusion proteins were established by fusing coding sequences of both hGH and Tf in frame. Fusion proteins were produced in serum free media by <b>transcient</b> transfection of human embryonic kidney cells. The SDS-PAGE of conditioned media showed that fusion proteins expressed at ~ 90 % abundance and 100 kDa molecular weight; the Western blot analysis with anti-hGH and anti-Tf antibodies verified the identity. The Nb 2 cell proliferation and TfR binding assays demonstrated that fusion proteins retained bioactivity for both hGH and Tf, respectively. To minimize inter-domain interference, we inserted 2 copies of helical linker as a spacer between hGH- and Tf-domain, and discovered that it not only enhanced the bioactivity but also led to high-level expression (30 - 50 mg/L, in select fusion protein). Three fusion proteins (GT, GHT and THG) were assessed in hGH-deficient hypophysectomized rats for in vivo biological activity, with both subcutaneous and oral administration. 7 -day s. c. administration in rats showed both GHT and THG fusion proteins promoted ~ 16 g body weight gain, whereas GT fusion protein led to ~ 12 g increase. However, when administered orally, only GHT fusion protein led to a small weight gain. We also investigated tryptic and chymotryptic stability of fusion proteins and found that these fusion proteins were highly susceptible to both enzymes, while Tf was resistant. 7 -day oral coadministration of GHT fusion protein with soybean trypsin inhibitor resulted in modest body weight gain, with better consistency.; In conclusion, Tf-based recombinant fusion protein approach has a potential for oral delivery of protein drugs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of European erotic death imagery {{produced}} in the Death and the Maiden (D&M) genre in two time periods. It compares and contrasts D&M imagery produced by the Germanic-speaking proto/early-Reformation artists, Hans Baldung (alias Grien) (c 1484 – 1545), Niklaus Manuel (known as Deutsch) (c 1484 – 1530) and Sebald Beham (known as Hans Sebald Beham) (1500 – 1550) which highlighted the folly, futility and transience of earthly vanities during the transition from Roman Catholic to Protestant Christianity, with contemporary calendar art produced by Cofani Funebri (from 2003) and Lindner (from 2010) which advertise coffins manufactured in the increasingly secular countries of Italy and Poland. Drawing on Biblical narrative, Augustinian theology and European socio-cultural perceptions of gender, this paper argues that these D&M images are highly eroticised and place woman as signifiers of <b>transcient</b> life (vanitas) and earthly pleasure (voluptas), juxtaposing her with a masculine/male representation of death; Death being imaged as an individual in the sixteenth century, and as a coffin in the contemporary works. The paper also contextualises the imagery in terms of traditional European Christian notions of life and death, as informed by the Biblical Fall narrative, with its elucidations of sin, concupiscence and punishment. It thus asserts that both socio-cultural and religious attitudes towards gender are highly significant in D&M imagery and indeed {{in terms of the}} artworks, argues that the masculine signifier of Death can be placed as Adam, whilst the Maiden, as fecund life, represents Eve. However, the overt eroticism of both sets of artworks also allows for a reading that draws on Messaris' [(1997). Visual persuasion; the role of images in advertising. London: Sage] notion that visual images ‘make a persuasive communication due to iconicity; the emotional response to the visual image presented’. Thus, this paper contrasts D&M imagery produced over 400 years apart to examine consciously erotic gendered thanantological allegories of women as vanitas and voluptas, and the male/masculine as representations of Death...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{describe}} {{our initial}} experience of total laparoscopic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Material and methodsBetween February 2002 and September 2003, we performed 30 total laparoscopic AAA repairs in 27 men and 3 women. Median age was 71. 5 years (range, 46 - 85 years). Median aneurysm size was 51. 5 mm (range, 30 - 79 mm). American Society of Anesthesiologists class of patients was II, III and IV in 10, 19, and 1 cases, respectively. We performed total laparoscopic endoaneurysmorrhaphy and aneurysm exclusion in 27 and 3 patients, respectively. We used the laparoscopic transperitoneal left retrocolic approach in 27 patients. We operated on 2 patients via a tranperitoneal left retrorenal approach and 1 patient via a retroperitoneoscopic approach. ResultsWe implanted tube grafts and bifurcated grafts in 11 and 19 patients, respectively. Two minilaparotomies were performed. In 1 case, exposure via a retroperitoneal approach was difficult and, in another case, distal aorta was extremely calcified. Median operative time was 290 minutes (range, 160 - 420 minutes). Median aortic clamping time was 78 minutes (range, 35 - 230 minutes). Median blood loss was 1680 cc (range, 300 - 6900 cc). In our early experience, 2 patients died of myocardial infarction. Ten major nonlethal postoperative complications {{were observed in}} 8 patients: 4 <b>transcient</b> renal insufficiencies, 2 cases of lung atelectasis, 1 bowel obstruction, 1 spleen rupture, 1 external iliac artery dissection, and 1 iliac hematoma. Others patients had an excellent recovery with rapid return to general diet and ambulation. Median hospital stay was 9 days (range, 8 - 37 days). With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 0. 5 - 20 months), patients had a complete recovery and all grafts were patent. ConclusionThese preliminary results show that total laparoscopic AAA repair is feasible and worthwhile for patients once the learning curve is overcome. However, prior training and experience in laparoscopic aortic surgery are needed to perform total laparoscopic AAA repair. Despite these encouraging results, a greater experience and further evaluation are required to ensure the real benefit of this technique compared with open AAA repair...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Ankle sprains affect 200 ' 000 persons/year in Switzerland. Most incidences are {{successfully}} {{treated by}} conservative measures but 20 % require reconstruction for symptomatic chronic lateral ankle instability. This study evaluates the functional outcome after a modified Broström-Gould technique {{as measured by}} different clinical scores and compares the functional outcome of this technique with other surgical treatments of ankle instability. Methods: This retrospective cohort study evaluates 47 patients who underwent a modified Broström-Gould procedure using suture anchors to refix the lateral ankle capsuloligamentary structures at our institution from 2005 to 2009 with a minimum follow-up of one year (13 - 72 Mo). All patients were operated by one single surgeon and evaluated by an independent examiner. The function was assessed using 4 scores including: the AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society's Score) hindfoot score; the FAAM (Foot and Ankle Ability Measurement); the CAIT (Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool); the CAIS (Chronic Ankle Instability Scale). Results: Six patients were excluded leaving 41 patients for examination. 34 patients (83 %) thought that their ankle was more stable after the surgery, 7 (17 %) did not feel any difference. 27 patients were very satisfied, 11 satisfied and 3 not satisfied. Reasons for non satisfaction included persistent instability and pain. Ankle mobility returned to normal in 93 % of patients. Five patients had <b>transcient</b> hypoesthesy {{in the area of}} the superficial peroneal nerve. One patient suffered from a superficial infection treated successfully by local measures. 80 % had the perception of a normal ankle, 20 % thought to be below normal. At follow-up the AOFAS was 89 / 100 (37 - 100), the FAAM 85 / 100 % (35 - 100 %), the CAIT 20 / 30 (5 - 30), and the CAIS 74 / 100 % (27 - 100 %). Conclusions: The modified Broström-Gould procedure, which belongs to the anatomic ankle stabilizations is relatively simple and offers good outcome that satisfied 93 % of the patients in the present study. No active stabilisator is sacrificed. Preservation of the ankle mobility is better and the complication rate is lower than after non-anatomical procedures described in the literature. The CAIT appeared as the most severe score compared to the other scales used in our study...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNumerical {{simulation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used tools for the study of gun firing phenomenology, in terms of knowledge and performance evaluation. Modelling codes have to describe accurately the internal ballistics cycle, from the ignition of the propellant charge to the dynamics of the gun powder and projectile motion. The ignition behaviour of the solid propellant bed influences significantly the ignition delay and propagation of the combustion wave. Ignition models for gun propellants currently used are generally based on a threshold in terms of temperature or heat generation in the solid or gas phase. This kind of ignition model is challenged by the thermal behaviour of the new generation insensitive gun propellants. Modelling the ignition of such propellant requires improvement of the ignition model. In particular, this model should provide a better description of the response of the material to the energetic stimuli from the igniter. An internal ballistics code has been developed within the framework of a cooperation between NEXTER Munitions and the PRISME Laboratory. It focuses on the description of the heat and mass transfers between gas and porous media. This code takes into account solid phase decomposition kinetics and gas phase reaction mechanisms. It aims at describing the propellant behaviour in the early stages of the internal ballistics cycle. Depending on the hypotheses made A numerical tool for evaluating solid propellants ignition models on the heat and mass transfer correlations and the description of the thermal behaviour of both the solid and gas phases, an ignition model or criterion can be determined. The Figure 1 illustrates some of the current abilities of the code : modelling the propagation of the hot gases released by the igniter through the solid propellant bed. The grains are heated by convective and radiative fluxes, and start reacting when the ignition threshold of 400 K is reached at their surface. In the present work, the code and its hypotheses are first described. The model of compressible porous flow through a bed of inert powder is compared to compressible 1 D and 2 D test cases, and a submodel of temperature conduction in the solid phase at the vicinity of the propellant grain surface is added and validated by reproducing semi infinite wall <b>transcient</b> conduction theoretical behaviour. The addition of solid phase decomposition kinetics and gas phase reaction mechanisms to the code allows describing the ignition of the solid propellant bed. In conclusion, different ignition models are compared in terms of ignition delay through the computed evolution of the breech pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of B cells producing autoantibodies {{is a common}} feature of many autoimmune conditions. The pathogenic role of the autoantibodies is often unclear, but they often serve as diagnostic markers and {{may be used as}} prognostic tools in some diseases. This thesis addresses the production of anti-Ro 52 antibodies in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, and their pathogenic effect in the fetus after transplacental transport during pregnancy. The autoimmune inflammation in Sjögren's syndrome targets exocrine organs. Lymphocytic infiltrates develop in the salivary glands, and within these infiltrates germinal center-like structures may develop. In the initial studies of this thesis the molecular requirements for lymphocyte recruitment to the salivary glands, as well as morphological and functional properties of the germinal center-like structures were investigated. Chronically inflamed salivary glands exhibited an increased expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM- 1, VLA- 4, ICAM- 1 and LFA- 1), detected on endothelium an infiltrating mononuclear cells. In addition, B and T cell-attracting chemokines (CXCL 1 3, CCL 21 and CXCL 12) were expressed by epithelial cells in the glands, and the chemokine receptor (CXCR 5) was detected on infiltrating lymphocytes. Networks of follicular dendritic cells were demonstrated throughout the large infiltrates, while autoantibody-producing plasma cells and apoptotic cells were mainly localized to the margins of these infiltrates. The presented studies provide a molecular basis for lymphocyte-recruitment to the target organ and demonstrate functional ectopic germinal centers with local autoantibody production in the target organ. These structures might actively promote chronic inflammation, and differences in the microenvironment and structure compared to ordinary germinal centers might contribute to a disturbance in the selection process allowing autoreactive clones to develop more frequently. During pregnancy Ro 52 antibodies are tranfered to the fetus, which may lead to development of congenital heart block. Although rare, the condition is often fatal and the majority of live borns require a pacemaker at an early age. To elucidate the pathogenic importance of anti-Ro 52 antibodies in the course of congenital heart block, their role was investigated in vivo in pregnant women and in a murine model for the disease, as well as in vitro in primary rat cardiomyocyte cultures. Seropositive pregnant women were prospectively followed and fetal progression monitored using Doppler echocardiography. One-third of the fetuses developed a <b>transcient</b> AV block 1, demonstrating that fetal affection is far more common than previously appreciated. The study also revealed congenital heart block develops gradually, a finding essential for therapeutic decisions and understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanism. Thorough epitope mapping of the humoral response in pregnant women with anti-Ro 52 antibodies revealed a specific serologic marker associated with fetal heart block, a finding enabling risk assessment and increasing the chances for early detection of block and successful fetal outcome. The specific antibodies associated with block were cloned and demonstrated to bind to the cell surface of neonatal cardionryocytes in vitro, dysregulating Ca 21 homeostasis, leading to accumulating intracellular levels of Ca 2 + and eventually inducing apoptosis. The pathogenic effect of the antibodies was verified in a murine model for congenital heart block. In conclusion, our results have led to the proposal of a mechanism for development of congenital heart block in which specific maternal anti-Ro 52 antibodies have a central pathogenic role through interaction with fetal cardiomyocytes, affecting their function and resulting in a permanent cardiac insult...|$|E
