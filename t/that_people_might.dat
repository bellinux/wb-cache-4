GAG frequently cited other fires in tower blocks when it warned of the hazards at Grenfell.|$|E
25|$|A popular {{notion is}} <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> not share {{extremely}} intense emotional events {{because they are}} simply inexpressible. Along with this idea, psychologists initially hypothesized that the extreme nature of such experiences would {{play an important role}} in determining whether an emotional event is shared or not. Additionally, they thought that people would be motivated not to deliberately revisit such events because they would reactivate the extreme negative emotions that accompanied the events. However, their studies revealed that there was no difference in the average emotional intensity between events that were shared compared to those that were kept secret.|$|E

25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also suggests <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} in the film, Dante {{attempted}} to involve his audience in the story by making it seem as if the gremlins had taken control of the theatre where Gremlins 2 was showing. The film strip appears to be broken by the gremlins, who then engage in shadow puppetry over a white screen before replacing the reel with the vintage nudie film Volleyball Holiday. Hulk Hogan then makes a cameo appearance as an audience member and intimidates the gremlins into running the rest of Gremlins 2. This joke was inspired by a similar stunt in William Castle's film The Tingler (1959). The studio feared <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> leave the theatre if they thought the film had broken; Dante therefore secured the inclusion of the sequence by assembling some people for a preview of the film. When the scene was shown, the real-life audience found it enjoyable and stayed in the theatre. Dante later described this scene {{as one of the most}} widely enjoyed jokes in Gremlins 2. When the film made its debut on home video, the filmmakers replaced the scene, to make it seem as if the viewer's VCR had been broken by the gremlins. In this version, the gremlins do their shadow puppetry over white noise before changing the VCR's channels. Their antics stop at a broadcast of Chisum, where John Wayne forces the gremlins into continuing the film, although voice impersonation was needed since Wayne had been dead since 1979; actor Chad Everett was recommended by Wayne's son Patrick Wayne. Notably, a clip from Falling Hare, a film released in 1943 featuring Bugs Bunny and a gremlin, appears in this version. These sequences occur in lieu of the Hulk Hogan sequence which also featured Paul Bartel; home video audiences would not see these sequences until the DVD release (which includes the reworked VHS scene as a bonus feature).|$|E

500|$|From 1996 until 2000, Laurer dated fellow wrestler Paul [...] "Triple H" [...] Levesque. They {{initially}} hid {{their relationship}} from their co-workers because Laurer felt <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> think she [...] " [...] {{her way to}} the top". The duo also lived together for some time. There is some debate {{as to whether or not}} Levesque started his relationship with Stephanie McMahon while still with Laurer. However, after Laurer's death, her sister Kathy Hamilton told Bleacher Report that the couple disagreed about having children (Levesque wanted children while Laurer did not), and Laurer's addictions and mental health problems also contributed to their breakup.|$|E
500|$|Reginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, {{noted that}} disciples of Swaminarayan cut across all castes, and even {{included}} Muslims. He writes [...] "they all pray to one God with no difference of castes. They live {{as if they}} were brothers." [...] Furthermore, in a meeting with Swaminarayan, he noted that [...] " [...] did not regard the subject as of much importance, but that he wished not to give offense (to ancient Hindu system); <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> eat separately or together in this world, but that above [...] "oopur" [...] pointing to heaven, those distinctions would cease." [...] Swaminarayan worked thus to dispel the myth that moksha (salvation) was not attainable by everyone. He taught that the soul is neither male nor female, nor yoked to any specific caste.|$|E

[...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him. I love the tone of his voice. I think the contrast of his voice and mine would be something special. I always like to do collaborations <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> think are different." ...|$|E

500|$|The album, {{released}} {{on the same}} day in both the UK and US, failed to chart in the UK, but peaked at number 10 in the US. It was released to quash any bootleg versions that Lennon was sure would leak onto the market. US editions of the album wrongly stated that the album was recorded in England. The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon's In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, and Ono's Grapefruit books. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of their Lennon's and Ono's experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: [...] "They said 'This is garbage, we're not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and you doing this sort of live stuff.' And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them <b>that...</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> buy this." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said that Capitol [...] "were on the [...] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they thought that I was just an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like Toronto, they didn't want to put out, because they didn't like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to some contradicting sources, {{the title}} of the album (or lack thereof) is debated. Travis Barker, in his memoir Can I Say, writes that [...] "Some people think it's a {{untitled}} album, called Blink-182, but Mark [...] has always insisted it was actually untitled." [...] A 2003 interview and article from MTV News discussing the naming of the pending album repeatedly refers to the release as the [...] "untitled album," [...] while a press release from that time period confirms the same. Despite this, several critics have used the terms [...] "eponymous", [...] "untitled", and [...] "self-titled" [...] in describing the album. In a 2009 MTV News article, James Montgomery refers to the album as self-titled, joking, [...] "Or untitled … It's never really been clear." [...] The title for the album was originally rumored to be Use Your Erection I & II, a parody of the Guns N' Roses albums Use Your Illusion I and II, but was revealed to be a joke Barker made to [...] "get a rise out of people." [...] DeLonge, in reference to previous joke album titles (such as Enema of the State), stated, [...] "We didn't want to label it with a joke title <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> expect." [...] As such, a Billboard article from the week of the album's release lists three rejected joke titles: Diarrhea de Janeiro, Vasectomy, Vasect-a-you and [...] "Our Pet Sounds".|$|E

50|$|Cryopreservation {{of people}} or large animals is not {{reversible}} with current technology.

Before the Day of the Lord, Malachi declares that Elijah (who [...] "ascended in a whirlwind into heaven [...] [...] [...] [...] " [...] 2 Kings 2:11) will return to earth in order <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> follow in God's ways.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to counter the {{fighting}} reputation of pit bull-type dogs, in 1996 the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals renamed pit bull terriers to [...] "St. Francis Terriers", so <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> {{be more likely to}} adopt them. 60 temperament-screened dogs were adopted until the program was halted, after several of the newly adopted pit bulls killed cats. The New York City Center for Animal Care and Control tried a similar approach in 2004, relabeling their pit bulls as [...] "New Yorkies", but dropped the idea in the face of overwhelming public opposition.|$|E
2500|$|Goyen {{began to}} sketch {{parts of the}} novel during World War II, when he served on the {{aircraft}} carrier USS Casablanca. After the war he and Navy friend Walter Berns moved to Taos, New Mexico, where they lived near benefactor Frieda Lawrence (widow of D.H. Lawrence) to pursue writing. Publications of several short stories followed, and Goyen was awarded the Southwest Review Literary Fellowship in 1949, which supported his continuing work on the book. It is an autobiographical work, {{but not in the}} sense <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> usually think of autobiography. Goyen once remarked, “Everything is auto-biography for me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{primitive}} Church had {{no knowledge}} of the origin of the practice. Origen says: [...] "The reasons for this, I think, are not easily discovered by anyone." [...] Although the general custom among Jews was to pray towards the temple in Jerusalem, Clement of Alexandria, Origen's older contemporary, says that the custom of praying eastward was general even among non-Christians: [...] "In correspondence with the manner of the sun's rising, prayers are made looking towards the sunrise in the east. Whence also the most ancient temples looked towards the west, <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> be taught to turn to the east when facing the images." ...|$|E
