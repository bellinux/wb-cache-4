In this work, the non-edible part of the plant (straws) of triticale (<b>Triticosecale</b> Wittmack 'Pronghorn') was fractionated using the Feedstock Impregnation Rapid and Sequential Steam Treatment (FIRSST). Fractionation was performed using both a one and a two-step steam process leading to the isolation of the different macromolecular fractions from lignocellulose.

After isolation, the C 6 carbohydrates from the hemicellulosic fractions were fermented to ethanol after being first hydrolyzed using a non-enzymatic approach.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} can {{be minimized}} either mechanically or biologically, using plant species with vigorous root systems. An experiment {{was carried out}} with soybean (Glycine max) in rotation with triticale (X <b>Triticosecale)</b> and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) in fall-winter associated with pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) in spring. Crop rotation under no-till was compared with mechanical chiseling. The experiment {{was carried out in}} Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil. Soil quality was estimated using the S index and soil water retention curves (in the layers of 0 - 0. 05, 0. 075 - 0. 125, 0. 15 - 0. 20, 0. 275 - 0. 325, and 0. 475 - 0. 525 m deep). Crop rotation and chiseling improved soil quality, increasing the S index to over 0. 035 to a depth of 20 cm in the soil profile. The improved soil quality, as shown by the S index, makes the use of mechanical chiseling unnecessary, since after 3 years the soil physical quality under no-tilled crop rotation and chiseling was similar...|$|E
