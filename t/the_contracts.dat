5|$|On May 26, 1952 twelve {{members of}} the TSO board met to review their {{decision}} not to renew <b>the</b> <b>contracts.</b> Nine of the members {{voted in favor of}} the decision while three voted against it. It was decided that <b>the</b> <b>contracts</b> would not be renewed, but if the United States immigration officials would issue entry permits to the six musicians by September 1, the TSO would renew <b>the</b> <b>contracts.</b> This decision created a controversy and a split within the TSO board, which eventually led to the resignation of two members, Mrs. Edmund Boyd and Mrs. R.

5|$|Prior to Baxter, {{the leading}} case on {{derivative}} governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd. In Bradken, the High Court upheld {{a claim for}} derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if <b>the</b> <b>contracts</b> and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to <b>the</b> <b>contracts</b> and arrangements.|$|E
40|$|Classically, {{the root}} of <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> is <b>the</b> {{agreement}} of <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> parties.

However, <b>the</b> agreement is not <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> <b>The</b> both are different. In fact, if for <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> parties there is a contract after an agreement, for the law there is a <b>contract</b> when <b>the</b> agreement of <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> parties respects <b>the</b> frame previewed by the law.

5|$|Initially, twelve {{ships were}} ordered {{based on the}} P-class design. The ships were ordered under the {{provisional}} names P1 through P12; <b>the</b> <b>contracts</b> were awarded {{to a number of}} German shipyards, including Deutsche Werke in Kiel, Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, and the KM Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven. However, Plan Z was reduced in size, and the number of armored ships was pared down to only eight vessels. This caused several of <b>the</b> <b>contracts</b> to be shifted around amongst the various shipbuilding companies. The first keel was set to be laid on 1 Feb 1940. The revised version of Plan Z, approved on 27 July 1939, removed the P-class ships from the construction queue. Instead, {{the decision was made to}} build the O-class battlecruisers only.|$|E

50|$|In law, {{severability}} (sometimes {{known as}} salvatorius, from Latin) {{refers to a}} provision in a contract which states that if parts of <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> should still apply. Sometimes, severability clauses will state that some provisions to <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> are so essential to <b>the</b> <b>contract's</b> purpose {{that if they are}} illegal or unenforceable, <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> as a whole will be voided. However, in many legal jurisdictions, a severability clause will not be applied if it changes the fundamental nature of <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> and that instead <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> will be void; thus, often this is not explicitly stated in the severability clause.|$|R

50|$|A {{contract}} award can be challenged {{and set aside}} if a protester can prove that either <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> agency or <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> awardee did not {{comply with the requirements}} of the solicitation.

50|$|Two other {{techniques}} to prevent <b>the</b> assignment of <b>contracts</b> are rescission clauses or clauses creating a condition subsequent.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A {{contract}} requires two or {{more people}} to come to an agreement with regards to the requirements of such a <b>contract</b> with <b>the</b> intention of following the practice of whatever is set out in <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> <b>the</b> main intention being to deliver a performance by both parties. When two parties sign a contract they are thus agreeing to stick to the terms of <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> that they are signing, as it becomes effective upon signature. <b>The</b> <b>contract</b> is then rendered to be in place and binding from that moment thereon. This implies that any condition that is not complied with in <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> that might take place after signing <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> will have penalty imputed on the guilty party as per stipulated in <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> <b>The</b> <b>contract</b> must also provide the detailed measures that will be taken in the case of either party failing to honour the necessary conditions that were stated at the inception of <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> Failure to adhere to the conditions in <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> is called breaching the terms of <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> and thus <b>the</b> company found guilty of breaching <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> will be liable to pay the penalties agreed to by the parties that have entered into that contract.
