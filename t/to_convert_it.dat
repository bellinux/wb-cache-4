5|$|Middlesex County Council bought Ickenham Hall and its {{grounds in}} 1948 in order <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a youth centre. In 1968 a theatre was built behind the hall, later named the Compass Theatre by the Theatre Director John Sherratt. A new {{building}} connecting the two {{was built in}} 1976.|$|E
5|$|Proctor's Theater: A 1914 {{theater on}} Fourth Street transitioned {{smoothly}} between live-entertainment and motion-picture eras.

5|$|A short {{distance}} to the south-west of the castle is a barracks block and associated storage buildings, constructed soon after 1718. Built to replace the original barrack accommodation within the castle when it was redeveloped <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a magazine, it has changed little externally in the last 300 years. It is a rare surviving example of an 18th-century building of this type {{and was one of}} the first distinct barracks to be built in England.|$|E

5000|$|Ernst Mayr's {{opinion was}} even more clear-cut: Patrick Matthew {{undoubtedly}} had the right idea, just like Darwin did on September 28, 1838, {{but he did not}} devote the next twenty years <b>to</b> <b>converting</b> <b>it</b> into a cogent theory of evolution. As a result it had no impact whatsoever.|$|R
5|$|After {{the sale}} the {{building}} was mainly used for storage whilst planning applications <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a hotel were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The coroner's court was the last to vacate the premises, in 1998. In 2001, {{the building was}} placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register. By 2004 it was in steep decline, and momentum was building for the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels, to act.|$|E
5|$|By one {{day after}} the storm, power {{companies}} restored electricity to 151,000 customers. Citizens in Montegut circulated a petition for a class-action lawsuit in response to the levee failure. The American Red Cross set up a church in Reserve as an emergency shelter. Only five people stayed the first night, resulting in the organization <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> to a family services center. Over 100families asked for food assistance. The Red Cross also set up a shelter in Houma, where 14people stayed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Louis in 1979, the Horch family sold the Master Building to a real estate investor, Sol Goldman, {{who was then the}} city's largest private landlord. Goldman {{continued}} to operate the building as rental apartments until 1982 when he formed a company, Manhattan Master Apartment Associates, <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> to a housing co-operative. The conversion was completed in 1988 when that company transferred control to a new organization, Master Apartments, Inc.|$|E

5|$|From {{the mid-1990s}} Preston North End started a {{complete}} rebuilding of Deepdale <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> {{into a modern}} all-seater stadium.

5|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> from iron to steel. It was {{repeatedly}} reinforced throughout its existence. When Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley line in 1977, {{the stability of}} the trestle had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail had tried to sell the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the trestle was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.|$|E

5|$|On {{the death}} of Alphonso Vincent in 1932, his son George {{inherited}} the property. He lived at the site in an old lorry {{until his death in}} 1973. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries, who intended <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In 1976, the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale. Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979, and plans for restoration were made. The consortium consisted of Mark Barnard, Charles Dolman, Peter Dolman, David Pearce and Chris Seago. The derelict mill and an acre of land cost £6,000.|$|E
5|$|Regularly {{travelling}} to London {{to visit}} friends, one notable comrade was Stuart Piggott, another influential British archaeologist who succeeded Childe as Abercromby Professor at Edinburgh. Another was Grahame Clark, whom Childe befriended and encouraged in his research. The trio were elected onto the {{committee of the}} Prehistoric Society of East Anglia. At Clark's suggestion, in 1935 they used their influence <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a nationwide organisation, the Prehistoric Society, of which Childe was elected president. Membership of the group then grew rapidly; in 1935 it had 353 members, and this had increased to 668 in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E

5|$|The Palladium cinema {{was opened}} as the Empire in 1913 in a {{building}} which had previously been a brewery. It closed in 1993 and various {{attempts were made to}} turn it into a club and shop, before Wetherspoons announced in January 2015 that they had acquired the site and intended to seek planning and licensing permission <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> to a pub. The town was left without cinema for almost two decades. Cinema was brought back to the town under the Palladium name in 2012 with a new community cinema at the Town Hall. In 2013, permanent cinema equipment was installed in the building and there are now regular film screenings of both modern and classic films.|$|E
5|$|The cellar of the {{building}} contained a barber's shop, a grocery store and a butcher shop. The remaining premises were used as apartments for rent. When Dimitri Orlov died in 1911 while building a railroad in the Russian Far East, his widow, left with five children, had to sell off the house to pay her family's debts. In 1983, renovation works were started on {{the building}} <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a hotel. Since {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union in 1991, various reconstruction works have been largely unsuccessful. As of 2009, the Castle of Richard the Lionheart still stands empty and fenced off in renovation.|$|E
5|$|Urban sprawl, air {{and water}} pollution, noise, light pollution, {{and a range of}} habitat {{restricted}} by human infrastructure put stress on the park's mammals and other animals, but the most serious immediate threat to them is roadkill. About 50,000 vertebrates a year die on the park's roads when they are hit by a vehicle. The RMD has few roads, but Picture Rocks Road, an east–west commuter highway crossing the TMD, is highly dangerous to wildlife. Attempts in 2002 <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> to a hiking trail failed after the proposal met with stiff public resistance.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City's {{stadium is}} the City of Manchester Stadium, {{also known as}} Eastlands and the Etihad Stadium since July 2011 because of {{sponsorship}} commitments. The stadium is situated in East Manchester and {{is part of a}} 200-year operating lease from Manchester City Council after the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The stadium has been City's home {{since the end of the}} 2002–03 season, when the club moved from Maine Road. Before moving to the stadium, Manchester City spent in excess of £30million <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> to football use. The field of play was lowered by several metres, adding another tier of seating around the entire pitch. A new North Stand was also built. The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match. In August 2015, a 7,000 seat third tier on the South Stand was completed, in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season. Current capacity stands at 55,097. A North Stand third tier has planning approval and work on it is expected to begin by 2017, increasing capacity to around 61,000.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1932, the California State Highway Commission {{received}} a recommendation {{to purchase the}} road {{and was able to}} invest $418,000USD by 1936. However, the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right-of-way of part of the route, and opposed the purchase. This resulted in congressional actions to establish a clear title deed for the route. House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the toll road in order <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a toll-free highway. He argued that having only one toll road to travel in order to reach the Golden Gate Bridge would benefit commuters; he also cited the ten and seventh-tenths-mile difference in distance between the toll road and a route through Napa. A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26, 1938. The highway then became signed as State Route 48 until the 1964 renumbering.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the closure}} of the chapel in the 1980s, the size of the {{congregation}} had declined and the fabric of the building was deteriorating. In 1978 the decorative plaster ceiling was replaced with a suspended ceiling of acoustic tiles, with further repairs carried out under the Manpower Services Commission. During the course of these repairs, discussions took place {{about the future of the}} building and its dwindling congregation. None of the ideas for developing the building came to fruition, and worship in the chapel ended in December 1985. Permission to demolish the building was refused because of its listed status. It was bought by a private individual in 1987, but the plan <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a nightclub was declined. The building was acquired by the Bethesda Heritage Trust in 2000. After the Bethesda Heritage Trust failed to raise sufficient finance to continue worship, in 2002 it passed into the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, an organisation which aims to find community uses for the buildings in its care.|$|E
