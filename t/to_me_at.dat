25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

He said, 'What do you reckon to this?' It meant nothing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the time, but it ended up as 'You Really Got Me'." ...|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 1905, Potter {{sent the}} {{illustrations}} to Warne for his review, writing, [...] "I think it promises to make a pretty book."

I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, but I think I can get it right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it before we have proofs.

500|$|The {{novel was}} {{published}} by Chapman and Hall in the UK on 19 July 1957, and by Little, Brown in the US on 12 August. The Daily Telegraph had partly revealed the book's principal theme three months earlier: [...] "The publishers hope to establish 'Pinfold' as a household word meaning 'half round the bend'." [...] This comment followed closely on the release of Muriel Spark's first novel, The Comforters, which also dealt with issues of drug-induced hallucination. Although {{it would have been}} in Waugh's commercial interests to have ignored or downplayed Spark's book, he reviewed it generously in The Spectator on 22 February 1957: [...] "a complicated, subtle and, <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> least, an intensely interesting first novel".|$|E
500|$|John Hurt plays Harold [...] "Ox" [...] Oxley, Mutt's {{surrogate}} {{father and}} Indiana's old friend. Frank Darabont had suggested Hurt while writing the screenplay. The character {{is inspired by}} Ben Gunn of Treasure Island. Hurt read the script before agreeing to his role, unlike other cast members who came on [...] "because Steven— you know, 'God'— was doing it. And I said, 'Well, I {{need to have a}} little bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it.' So they sent a courier over with the script from Los Angeles, gave it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> three o'clock in the afternoon in London, collected it again at eight o'clock in the evening, and he returned the next day to Los Angeles." ...|$|E

500|$|Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim {{described}} von Neumann as the [...] "fastest mind I ever met", and Jacob Bronowski wrote [...] "He was the cleverest man I ever knew, without exception. He was a genius." [...] George Pólya, whose lectures at ETH Zürich von Neumann attended as a student, said [...] "Johnny was {{the only}} student I was ever afraid of. If {{in the course of}} a lecture I stated an unsolved problem, the chances were he'd come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper." [...] Eugene Wigner writes: [...] ""Jancsi," [...] I might say, [...] "Is angular momentum always an integer of h? He would return a day later with a decisive answer: [...] "Yes, if all particles are at rest."... We were all in awe of Jancsi von Neumann".|$|E
500|$|A reclusive gifted {{musician}} and writer, Daniel changed his surname from Pinter to Brand, the maiden {{name of his}} maternal grandmother, before Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved; while according to Fraser, his father couldn't understand it, {{she says that she}} could: [...] "Pinter is such a distinctive name that he must have got tired of being asked, 'Any relation? [...] Michael Billington wrote that Pinter saw Daniel's name change as [...] "a largely pragmatic move on Daniel's part designed to keep the press... at bay." [...] Fraser told Billington that Daniel [...] "was very nice <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> a time when it would have been only too easy for him to have turned on me... simply because he had been the sole focus of his father's love and now manifestly wasn't." [...] Still unreconciled {{at the time of his}} father's death, Daniel Brand did not attend Pinter's funeral.|$|E
500|$|Peart {{has often}} been {{categorized}} as an Objectivist and an admirer of Ayn Rand. This is largely based on his work with Rush in the 1970s, particularly the song [...] "Anthem" [...] and the album 2112; the latter specifically credited Rand's work. However, in his 1994 Rush Backstage Club Newsletter, while contending the [...] "individual is paramount in matters of justice and liberty," [...] Peart specifically distanced himself from a strictly Objectivist line. In a June 2012 Rolling Stone interview, when asked if Rand's words still speak to him, Peart replied, [...] "Oh, no. That was forty years ago. But it was important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the time in a transition of finding myself and having faith that what I believed was worthwhile." [...] Peart has also ascribed to a philosophy that he has called [...] "Tryism," [...] which means that anything that one tries to attain will be attained if one tries hard enough.|$|E

500|$|After this, Bond's next {{role was}} Phœbe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888–89). [...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert gave it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual {{on the first night}} of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard on me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in my bed. [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... until I was almost as demented as he was. [...] At last I turned on him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' He gave me a final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{role was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese, noting [...] "Who would you rather make the argument [...] for mankind than John Cleese?" [...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I {{had to be able to}} write the equation, because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years. I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> all. In A Fish Called Wanda, I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to Germany, Lody settled in Berlin, living in what he {{described}} as [...] "well to do circumstances". He stayed in the Adlon, the city's most fashionable luxury hotel, while his sister Hanna lived with her doctor husband in the prosperous suburb of Westend in Charlottenburg. As tensions grew across Europe {{in the first half of}} 1914, German naval intelligence – the Nachrichten-Abteilung, or [...] "N" [...] – set out to recruit potential agents. Lody already had links with the service. During his time with the Imperial German Navy, Lody had served under Arthur Tapken, who later became N's first director. The German Imperial Admiralty Staff, or Admiralstab, listed Lody as a possible recruitment target before the outbreak of war. The naval authorities regarded Hamburg America Line (HAL) employees such as Lody as ideal recruits because of their expertise in naval matters and presence in ports worldwide. The HAL had collaborated with the Admiralstab since the 1890s. The relationship became so close that in July 1914, just before the outbreak of the war, the HAL's director Albert Ballin told the Admiralstab that he would [...] "place myself and the organisation subordinate <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> your Excellency's disposal as best as possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Scheduled for a January 2008 release, Popular was {{promoted}} with {{five months of}} concert performances by Hunt, press coverage, {{and the release of}} promotional copies, including the four-song EP The Popular Machine (2007) and advance CDs for the media and radio people. However, weeks before its scheduled release, the album was shelved by Blue Note, with whom Hunt had been experiencing differences, and they subsequently parted ways. Blue Note had felt that the album was not profitable enough to release. Hunt could not release Popular himself without repaying the project's costs back to EMI and obtaining rights to the album's master recordings. According to him, EMI requested twice the original costs, and in his opinion, the money for promoting Popular was not [...] "strategically spent well" [...] by the label. Hunt discussed the situation in an interview for Creative Loafing, saying that [...] "They opted to not sell it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> a price that I could afford. They've got it and I'm sure they'll come out with it when they deem it necessary and profitable." [...] Of his decision to relocate to Los Angeles, he later quipped, [...] "Here I am, and the relationship has done much better than the career." ...|$|E
500|$|In Haygarth's Cricket Scores and Biographies, Roe is {{described}} as a [...] "fine, free hitter with excellent defence", who could also [...] "bowl a very useful medium-paced ball". He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather was so cold that catches were difficult to take. George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. [...] "C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I felt certain I should not make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!" [...] Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University {{at the end of the}} season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue—the awarding of the Cambridge [...] "colours" [...] to sportsmen—by appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets. In all, during his time at Cambridge, Roe played 13 first-class matches for the university, scoring 246 runs at an average of 11.18, with just one score greater than 50. He also took ten wickets at 15.60.|$|E
500|$|Lody {{stated that}} he had been sent to the UK [...] "to remain until the first [...] {{encounter}} had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E
