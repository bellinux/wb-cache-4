25|$|The ADR 79/01 vehicle {{standard}} (Australian Design Rule 79/01 – Emission Control for Light Vehicles, 2005) is the Australian {{equivalent of}} OBD-II. It {{applies to all}} vehicles of category M1 and N1 with a gross Vehicle Weight rating of 3500kg or less, registered from new within Australia and produced since January 1, 2006 for petrol (gasoline) engined cars and since January 1, 2007 for diesel engined cars. For newly introduced models, the regulation dates applied a year earlier – January 1, 2005 for petrol and January 1, 2006 for diesel. The ADR 79/01 standard was supplemented by the ADR 79/02 standard which imposed tighter emissions restrictions, applicable to all vehicles of class M1 and N1 with a {{gross vehicle weight rating}} of 3500kg or less, from July 1, 2008 for new models, July 1, 2010 for all models. The <b>technical</b> <b>implementation</b> of this standard is essentially the same as OBD-II, with the same SAE J1962 diagnostic link connector and signal protocols being used.|$|E
