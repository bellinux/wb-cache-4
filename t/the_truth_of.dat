5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> the first thesis but rejecting strongly <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> the second.|$|E

Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley does not accept her as a combat partner due to her lack of combat experience.

Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Leá Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley's past. This casts suspicion on Ashley's behalf, as Riskbreakers always work alone.|$|E

Black believes he can connect with Calloway, and is allowed to enter the church. Calloway is initially hostile, but Black is able to talk him down, convincing Calloway that his faith has not been lost, but simply tested—despite all that has happened, Calloway has never lost his belief in God.

Without telling Stephen, she flees, returning to her family home and the one constant in her life: her sister Jeanne. Later, Isabelle's father makes a deal with Azaire for her return to maintain her honour; Isabelle is forgiven but soon regrets leaving her true love, Stephen. However, she does not reach back out to Stephen.|$|E
5000|$|One needs, first, to get clear {{just what}} is meant by the claim that logic is {{revisable}} - and, equally importantly, what is not meant by it. What I mean, at any rate, is not that <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> <b>of</b> logic might have been otherwise than they are, but that <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> <b>of</b> logic might be other than we take them to be, i.e. we could be mistaken about what <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> <b>of</b> logic are, e.g. in supposing that the law of excluded middle is one such.So a better way to put the question, because it makes its epistemological character clearer, is this: does fallibilism extend to logic? Even this formulation, however, needs further refinement, for the nature of fallibilism is often misunderstood.|$|R
60|$|Thus, <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> <b>of</b> {{number are}} true of all things, and depend only {{on their own}} laws; the science, therefore, of Number, {{consisting}} of Arithmetic and Algebra, may be studied without reference to any other science. <b>The</b> <b>truths</b> <b>of</b> Geometry presuppose <b>the</b> laws of Number, and a more special class of laws peculiar to extended bodies, but require no others: Geometry, therefore, can be studied independently of all sciences except that of Number.|$|R

5|$|The {{mention of}} those princes who were {{publicly}} {{supposed to be}} Christians, as we find it in an epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria (ap. Euseb. l. vii c. 10.), evidently alludes to Philip and his family; and forms a contemporary evidence, that such a report had prevailed; but the Egyptian bishop, who lived at an humble distance from the court of Rome, expresses himself with becoming diffidence concerning <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> the fact.|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on the knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E

50|$|As {{members of}} the family of fuzzy logics, t-norm fuzzy logics {{primarily}} aim at generalizing classical two-valued logic by admitting intermediary truth values between 1 (truth) and 0 (falsity) representing degrees <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> propositions. <b>The</b> degrees are assumed to be real numbers from the unit interval 1. In propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, propositional connectives are stipulated to be truth-functional, that is, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> value <b>of</b> a complex proposition formed by a propositional connective from some constituent propositions is a function (called <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connective) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constituent propositions. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> functions operate on <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> degrees (in <b>the</b> standard semantics, on the 1 interval); thus <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> function <b>of</b> an n-ary propositional connective c is a function Fc: 1n &rarr; 1.
