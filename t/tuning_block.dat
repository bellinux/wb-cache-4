40|$|A novel fragile {{watermarking}} {{technique is}} proposed for hiding logo information into an image by <b>tuning</b> <b>block</b> pixels {{based on a}} bitmap parity checking approach. A secure key and a random number generator are used to hide the logo information in a secret, undetectable, and unambiguous way. The characteristics of the mean gray value and the bitmap in a block are exploited for performing the embedding work efficiently and for hiding a logo into an image imperceptibly. The logo can be extracted without referencing the original image. The proposed method is useful for authentication of original digital products. The extracted logo not only {{can be used to}} identify tampered locations in digital images but also can resist JPEG compression to a certain degree.

40|$|Abstract. We {{previously}} developed {{building blocks}} to enable end-users to construct customized sensor-based embedded systems to help monitor and control a users ' environment. Because design objectives, like battery lifetime, reliability, and responsiveness, vary across applications, these building blocks have software-configurable parameters that control features like operating voltage, frequency, and communication baud rate. The parameters enable the same blocks {{to be used}} in diverse applications, in turn enabling mass-produced and hence low-cost blocks. However, <b>tuning</b> <b>block</b> parameters to an application is hard. We thus present an automated approach, wherein an end-user simply defines objectives using an intuitive graphical method, and our tool automatically tunes the parameter values to those objectives. The automated tuning improved satisfaction of design objectives, compared to a default general-purpose block configuration, by 40 % on average, and by as much as 80 %. The tuning required only 10 - 20 minutes of end-user time for each application. ...|$|E

40|$|The ScaLAPACK {{numerical}} {{library for}} MIMD distributed-memory parallel computers comprises highly efficient and robust parallel dense linear algebra routines, implemented using explicit message passing.

While HPF can ease parallelization of many applications, it still does not make sense to re-program existing libraries like ScaLAPACK. Rather, programmers should have the opportunity to use them from within HPF programs. HPF interfaces to routines in the ScaLAPACK library are presented which are simplified considerably through exploitation of Fortran 90 array features. Substantial performance benefits from interfacing to efficient ScaLAPACK routines are also demonstrated via a comparison with equivalent HPF-coded functions.

40|$|Abstract — One of the {{problems}} with on-chip active-RC filters is that in order to satisfy tight specifications accurately, they need to be fine-tuned. This becomes more difficult with increasing filter order. In this paper, we introduce a simplified tuning method which is obtained by a new structure consisting of a filter section of second- or third-order (Biquad or Bitriplet which is referred to as a 'tuning block'), in cascade with a ladder-RLC filter (passive LC, or simulated-active RC). The cut-off frequency of the resulting filter can be simply tuned by adjusting one component of the <b>tuning</b> <b>block.</b> The new ladder tuning-block (LTB) is compared with two conventional structures, a cascade of Biquads and a single-ladder filter. Fine tuning these two structures is considerably more complicated. It is shown that beside the advantage of ease of tuning, the sensitivity to component tolerances of the new structure is lower than that of the two conventional ones, {{for the price of a}} slightly higher filter order.

40|$|Data {{inherently}} including memory {{can be compressed}} {{using either}} equal or variable length coding. This paper proposes a novel method to compress the data with memory by using equal length code words while maintaining the error correction capability. The main drawback of variable length coding (VLC) {{is that because of}} the boundary problem, it is very sensitive to errors, which results in many cases in long burst errors due to error propagation. However, VLC is optimal in the sense of minimizing the expected length of the codeword. To reduce the compression rate using equal length code, a technique called multiple label mapping (MLM) is employed in this paper. Furthermore, MLM is extended with a fine <b>tuning</b> <b>block</b> to achieve compression rates as close to the Shannon limit as possible. Simulation results for symbol error rate (SER) evaluation as well as EXIT analysis indicate that the proposed technique can achieve compression rates very close to the VLC performance while maintaining the error correction capability. Furthermore, it is shown that the SER performance of the proposed joint source-channel coding scheme is very close to the Shannon limit...|$|E

The combined common-mode feedforward and common-mode feed-back circuit ensures the input and output common-mode stability. The gain performance could be maintained by combining an equivalent negative resistor circuit at the output nodes. Transcon-ductance tuning {{can be achieved by}} adjusting the bulk voltage by using the deep-NWELL technology. The modified automatic tuning circuit relaxes the speed requirement of the <b>tuning</b> <b>blocks.</b> Through the use of the operational transconductance amplifier as a building block with the automatic tuning scheme, the filter 3 dB cutoff frequency is 1 GHz with the group delay less than 4 % variation up to 1. 5 fc frequency.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} the TRIPS prototype chip’s block predictor. The prototype is the first implementation of the block-atomic TRIPS architecture, wherein the unit of execution is a TRIPS hyperblock. The TRIPS prototype predictor uses a two-step prediction process: it first predicts the exit from the current hyperblock and uses the predicted exit in conjunction with the current hyperblock’s address to predict the next hyperblock. SPECint 2000 and SPECfp 2000 benchmarks record average misprediction rates of 11. 5 % and 4. 3 %, respectively, on the prototype chip. Simulation-driven analysis identifies short history lengths, inadequate offset bits in the branch target buffers, and aliasing in the exit and target predictors as the main reasons for the predictor inefficiency. If the above issues are addressed, block misprediction rates can be reduced by 15 % for SPECint 2000 and 22 % for SPECfp 2000. Using a perceptron-based analysis, we show that there is significant loss in correlation in our current hyperblocks. We conclude that while carefully <b>tuned</b> <b>block</b> predictors can achieve relatively lower misprediction rates, new predictor designs and correlation-aware hyperblock formation are necessary {{to bridge the gap between}} block prediction accuracies and branch prediction accuracies. ...|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{was a part}} of an {{academic}} research projecta where the target is to design an integrated circuit (IC) to dynamically tune the operating frequency of a transmitter antenna. A multiport antenna model was provided by Prof. Viikari’s group who recently presented a novel idea of multiport antenna tuning. In this concept the multiport antenna feeds are excited with weighted signals having certain amplitudes and phases, thus leading to antenna tuning at the desired operating frequency. However, it is not feasible to dynamically scale the antenna feeding signal amplitudes and phases with discrete electronics. Therefore, the system on chip solution (SoC) approach was studied in this thesis. Initially, the concept was studied on theoretical level and with circuit simulations. The tuning analysis framework was developed to scrutinize the antenna weighted signal characteristics. This analysis provides the two most important specifications for the IC i. e., the accuracy required for on-chip amplitude and phase tuning. For the antenna under consideration, the on chip phase and amplitude tuning system have 6 bit and 3 bit scaling resolutions respectively. The tuning system is designed for a 4 -port reconfigurable antenna where each antenna feed has a separate phase tuning and amplitude <b>tuning</b> <b>block.</b> The tuning system was simulated along the 4 -port antenna at 2 GHz, and the simulation result validates the multiport tuning concept.
