5|$|In The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all <b>these</b> <b>complex</b> processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{limitations}} of computer hardware aside, in principle {{it is possible}} to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance. Strong solutions, i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position, are known for some simple games such as Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and crosses (draw with perfect play) and Connect Four (first player wins). Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games, such as checkers (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and Go, have not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified <b>these</b> <b>complex</b> games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted {{to meet their}} dietary requirements {{in a variety of}} ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment <b>these</b> <b>complex</b> substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require {{little in the way of}} specialized digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.|$|E

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of <b>these</b> <b>complex</b> sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} two major topics that involve spectroscopic studies of (a) divalent group 10 metals and (b) silver(I) -phosphine complexes. The {{scope of the}} work involved the delineation of the electronic structure of <b>these</b> <b>complexes</b> in different environments and their use in electronic devices. The first topic {{is a look at}} the luminescence of tetrahedral silver(I) -phosphine complexes. Broad unstructured emissions with large Stokes shifts were found for <b>these</b> <b>complexes.</b> Computational analysis of the singlet and triplet state geometries suggests that this emission is due to a Jahn-Teller type distortion. The second topic represents the major thrust of this research, which is an investigation into the electronic structure of M(diimine) X 2 (M= Pt(II), Pd(II), or Ni(II); X = dichloro, or dithiolate ligands) complexes and their interactions with an electron acceptor or Lewis acid. Chapter 3 assesses the use of some of <b>these</b> <b>complexes</b> in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); it is shown that <b>these</b> <b>complexes</b> may lead to a viable alternative to the more expensive ruthenium-based dyes that are being implemented now. Chapter 4 is an investigation into donor/acceptor pairs involving this class of complexes, which serves as a feasibility test for the use of <b>these</b> <b>complexes</b> in organic photo-voltaics (OPVs) and thin-film field-effect transistors (OTFTs). The mixing of a donor Pt molecule with an electron deficient nitrofluorenone gives rise to new absorption bands in the NIR region.
