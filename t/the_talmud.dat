5|$|Some {{put forth}} that this intermixing of species {{is against the}} teachings of <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> and thus against Jewish Law and nonkosher. Others argue that the one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance, and that the foreign gene {{accounts}} for the less than 1/60 of the animal and thus the modified salmon is kosher.|$|E
5|$|From 1947 to 1950 {{he studied}} <b>the</b> <b>Talmud,</b> {{philosophy}} and literature at the Sorbonne, {{where he was}} influenced by the existentialists, attending lectures by Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Buber. He also taught Hebrew, and worked as a translator for the Yiddish weekly Zion in Kamf. In 1948, when he was 19, he was sent to Israel as a war correspondent by the French newspaper L'arche, and after the Sorbonne became chief foreign correspondent of the Tel Aviv newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Leiden Jerusalem <b>Talmud</b> {{also known}} as <b>the</b> Leiden <b>Talmud</b> is a medieval copy of <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud.</b> <b>The</b> {{manuscript}} was written in 1289 CE, meaning it is the oldest complete manuscript of <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud</b> in <b>the</b> world. The manuscript is also the only surviving complete (non-printed) manuscript of <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud.</b> <b>The</b> manuscript receives {{its name from the}} University of Leiden where it has been kept since the nineteenth century.|$|R
25|$|There are {{significant}} differences between <b>the</b> two <b>Talmud</b> compilations. <b>The</b> language of <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud</b> is a Western Aramaic dialect, which differs from the form of Aramaic in <b>the</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud.</b> <b>The</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud</b> is often fragmentary and difficult to read, even for experienced Talmudists. The redaction of <b>the</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, is more careful and precise. The law as laid down in the two compilations is basically similar, except in emphasis and in minor details. <b>The</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud</b> has not received much attention from commentators, and such traditional commentaries as exist are mostly concerned with comparing its teachings to those of <b>the</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud.</b>|$|R
50|$|Of all the Tractates in Seder Zeraim, only Berakhot has a {{corresponding}} Gemara in <b>the</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud.</b> However, {{many of the}} mishnayot of Seder Zeraim are addressed throughout <b>the</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud.</b> <b>The</b> Tractates of Seder Zeraim are included in <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} with Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians {{did not exist}} in Israel between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned from the Bible and <b>the</b> <b>Talmud.</b> The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with Jubal: the ugab (pipes) and kinnor (lyre). Other instruments of the period included the tof (frame drum), pa'amon (small bells or jingles), shofar, and the trumpet-like hasosra.|$|E
5|$|The Black Hebrews {{believe they}} are descended {{from members of the}} Tribe of Judah who were exiled from the Land of Israel after the Romans {{destroyed}} the Second Temple in 70 CE. The group incorporates elements of African-American culture into their interpretation of the Bible. They do not recognize rabbinical Jewish interpretations such as <b>the</b> <b>Talmud.</b> The Black Hebrews observe Shabbat and biblically ordained Jewish holidays such as Yom Kippur and Passover.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{carried out}} extensive charity campaigns during the Passover season; by 1905 the congregation was distributing wagon-loads of matzos to poor Jews {{so they could}} celebrate the holiday. By 1907–1908 membership had risen to 500 (up from 160 in 1900), <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> Torah had 250 students, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $25,000 (today $). The congregation ran into financial difficulties of its own in 1908, and in October of that year raised funds by selling a number of its Torah scrolls in a public auction.|$|E
50|$|According to <b>the</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud,</b> <b>the</b> current {{prohibition}} is of rabbinic origin, {{and this}} verse {{is only a}} asmachta (hint) to a rabbinic law, rather than {{the source of a}} Biblical law. However, <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud</b> states that while the prohibition to venture further than 2000 cubits (one mil) is rabbinic, venturing a distance over 12 mil is Biblically forbidden. Maimonides rules according to <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud,</b> while others rule according to <b>the</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud.</b>|$|R

5|$|The merged congregations {{adopted the}} current name, a {{combination}} of the two previous names, and, with the assistance and encouragement of Goldfarb and synagogue president Harris Copland founded a sisterhood. Nevertheless, the combined membership was still not large; in 1911, the year the congregation renovated the recently acquired synagogue building, <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> Torah had only 45 students, 10 of them the children of non-members.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known Black Hebrew {{organization}} is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations. The group {{was founded by}} F. S. Cherry in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1886, and it later moved to Philadelphia. Theologically, the Church of the Living God mixed elements of Judaism and Christianity, counting the Bible — including the New Testament — and <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> as essential scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Among several {{projects}} for memorials, Zvi Hecker designed the solemn Page Memorial (1996) with Micha Ullmann and Eyal Weizman. This site-specific memorial commemorates the Jewish community of Kreuzberg, and their Lindenstrasse synagogue {{which was designed}} in 1891 by architects Cremer & Wolffenstein. What was {{once one of the}} largest religious buildings in Berlin, with a capacity of 1800; was ruined by the Nazis in the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. On the original floor plan, the benches of the synagogue were recreated in concrete, and where the bimah stood, trees are now planted. The designers conceived of the benches as sentences on the pages of <b>the</b> <b>Talmud.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud</b> connects <b>the</b> name Iscah to an Aramaic verbal rooting meaning [...] "to see", {{connecting}} the name with prophetic foresight. Modern scholars are not convinced by <b>the</b> <b>Talmud's</b> explanation, and Iscah's etymology is currently regarded as uncertain.|$|R

5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women {{as long as there}} is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body. Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by <b>the</b> <b>Talmud.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|The name Efa first appears during Roman rule, {{some time}} {{after the end of}} the 1st century, when a Roman {{fortress}} and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona. Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in <b>the</b> <b>Talmud,</b> a work central to Judaism. Hefa or Hepha in Eusebius of Caesarea's 4th-century work, Onomasticon (Onom. 108, 31), is said to be another name for Sycaminus. This synonymizing of the names is explained by Moshe Sharon, who writes that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis. References to this city end with the Byzantine period.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E
5|$|King Kalākaua trusted Rosenberg's {{skill as}} a fortune teller, {{perhaps because the}} way Rosenberg chanted in Hebrew {{reminded}} him of ancient Hawaiian rites. In January 1887, the king—who had become increasingly autocratic and was facing several scandals—granted Rosenberg a private audience at the palace. The king and Rosenberg became close, and routinely visited each other for several {{days at a time}} and held long conversations. During the audiences, Rosenberg told Bible stories and read from <b>the</b> <b>Talmud.</b> He began to teach the king basic Hebrew, and gave him an ornate Torah and yad that he had brought with him to Hawaii. He also claimed to have found references to Hawaii in ancient Hebrew texts, a statement that encouraged the king to restore aspects of Hawaiian religion. The king had previously sought instruction from several people he regarded as prophets and had established a society dedicated to the revival of native Hawaiian traditions. Finally, the king declared Rosenberg his kahuna-kilokilo, a royal soothsayer.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} four centuries, the Mishnah {{underwent}} discussion and debate in both of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and Babylonia). The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into <b>the</b> two <b>Talmuds,</b> <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud</b> (<b>Talmud</b> Yerushalmi) and <b>the</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud</b> (Talmud Bavli). These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud</b> records <b>the</b> {{opinions}} of the rabbis of Israel {{as well as of}} those of Babylonia, while <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud</b> seldom cites <b>the</b> Babylonian rabbis. The Babylonian version contains the {{opinions of}} more generations because of its later date of completion. For both these reasons it is regarded as a more comprehensive collection of the opinions available. On the other hand, because of the centuries of redaction between the composition of the Jerusalem and <b>the</b> Babylonian <b>Talmud,</b> <b>the</b> opinions of early amoraim might be closer to their original form in <b>the</b> Jerusalem <b>Talmud.</b>|$|R
25|$|Wilovsky freely used {{a copy of}} <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> Yerushalmi {{which the}} Vilna Gaon had annotated. After {{studying}} <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> Yerushalmi for thirty years and working steadily on his commentaries for seventeen years, Wilovsky began the publication of an edition of <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> Yerushalmi which included, besides his own, all the commentaries incorporated in former editions.|$|E
25|$|Full-scale {{attacks on}} <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> {{took place in}} the 13th century in France, where Talmudic study was then flourishing. In the 1230s, Nicholas Donin, a Jewish convert to Christianity, pressed 35 charges against <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> to Pope Gregory IX by {{translating}} a series of blasphemous passages about Jesus, Mary or Christianity. There is a quoted Talmudic passage, for example, where Jesus of Nazareth is sent to Hell to be boiled in excrement for eternity. Donin also selected an injunction of <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> that permits Jews to kill non-Jews. This led to the Disputation of Paris, which took place in 1240 at the court of Louis IX of France, where four rabbis, including Yechiel of Paris and Moses ben Jacob of Coucy, defended <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> against the accusations of Nicholas Donin. The translation of <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> from Hebrew to non-Jewish languages stripped Jewish discourse from its covering, something that was resented by Jews as a profound violation. The Disputation of Paris led to the condemnation and the first burning of copies of <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> in Paris in 1242. The burning of copies of <b>the</b> <b>Talmud</b> continued.|$|E
