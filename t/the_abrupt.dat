5|$|<b>The</b> <b>abrupt</b> {{abolition}} of slavery which Rio Branco had warned against eventually occurred eight years later.

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed <b>the</b> <b>abrupt</b> {{fall of the}} Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may {{reflect the fact that}} the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was {{to have a chance to}} succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{historian}} Josiah Bunting III {{noted that}} Grant was never {{put on his}} guard when Secretary Belknap came to the White House in a disturbed manner or even asked why Belknap wanted to resign in the first place. Bunting argues that Grant should have pressed Belknap into an explanation for <b>the</b> <b>abrupt</b> resignation request. Grant's acceptance of the resignation indirectly allowed Belknap, after he was impeached by the House of Representatives for his actions, to escape conviction, since {{he was no longer}} a government official. Belknap was acquitted by the Senate, escaping with less than the two-thirds majority vote needed for conviction. Even though the Senate voted that it could put private citizens on trial, many senators were reluctant to convict Belknap since he was no longer Secretary of War. It has been suggested that Grant accepted the resignation in a Victorian impulse to protect the women involved.|$|E

By later in the day, Debbie had begun to restrengthen. It resumed Category 3 intensity on August 20, despite a minor oscillation in magnitude during the day.

5|$|Psoriasis vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following <b>the</b> <b>abrupt</b> withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E

Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if {{that could be done}} at the expense of an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, so much the better. They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. <b>The</b> <b>abrupt</b> manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNitrogen and argon {{isotopes}} in air {{trapped in}} a Greenland ice core (GISP 2) show two prominent peaks in the interval 11, 800 – 10, 800 B. P., which indicate two large <b>abrupt</b> warming events. <b>The</b> first <b>abrupt</b> warming (10 ± 4 °C) is the widely documented event {{at the end of}} the Younger Dryas. Here, we report on <b>the</b> second <b>abrupt</b> warming (4 ± 1. 5 °C), which occurred at the end of a short lived cooler interval known as the Preboreal Oscillation (11, 270 ± 30 B. P.). A rapid snow accumulation increase suggests that the climatic transition may have occurred within a few years. The character of the Preboreal Oscillation and <b>the</b> subsequent <b>abrupt</b> warming is similar to the Dansgaard–Oeschger (D/O) events in the last glacial period, suggestive of a common mechanism, but different from another large climate change at 8, 200 B.

5|$|The conquering Spanish {{carried out}} several {{operations}} to relocate the Manche to Alta Verapaz, with their relocation being completed in 1697, {{a short time}} after the Spanish finally defeated their Itza Maya neighbours to the northwest. Most of the surviving Manche Ch'ol were forcibly resettled in the Guatemalan Highlands, in the villages of El Chol and Belén, in the Urran Valley near Rabinal. The resettled Manche Ch'ol suffered from <b>the</b> <b>abrupt</b> change of climate from tropical lowland rain forest to the cold highlands. They were often not provided with suitable clothing by their Spanish overlords, and many died. The depopulation of the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ol lands, and the resulting collapse of long-standing trade routes, resulted in the gradual impoverishment of colonial Verapaz.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnificent}} coronation of James II in 1685 saw the College revived as {{an institution}} of state and the monarchy. However, <b>the</b> <b>abrupt</b> end of his reign saw {{all but one of}} the heralds taking the side of William of Orange and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution. The period from 1704 to 1706 saw not a single grant of arms being made by the College; this nadir was attributed to the changes in attitude of the times. The Acts of Union 1707 between England and Scotland, in the reign of Anne did not affect the jurisdiction or the rights of the College. The College of Arms and the Court of the Lord Lyon were to exist side by side in their respective realms. However, in the matter of precedence; the Lord Lyon, when in England, was to take immediate precedence behind Garter King of Arms.|$|E

5|$|The northward {{movement}} {{also sent}} Danielle into somewhat increased shear, which {{allowed it to}} begin to weaken. However, the weakening was gradual at first as the waters remained fairly warm. <b>The</b> <b>abrupt</b> northerly turn meant that, for a while on August 17, the Azores were threatened by Danielle in the long-range forecast, as a weakened tropical storm or extratropical cyclone. Danielle weakened to a Category1 hurricane {{on the evening of}} August 17 as shear continued to increase. Danielle began to turn to the northeast early on August 18, and at that point, the weakening trend accelerated. Some of the deep convection was being removed from the system due to wind shear, and that morning, Danielle weakened to a tropical storm. The rapid weakening trend continued that afternoon, and Danielle weakened to a low-end tropical storm with 45mph (75km/h) winds late that evening. However, the intensity levelled off early on August 19 and Danielle remained a tropical storm for the next couple days over moderately warm water of around 78°F (just under 26°C) while south-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Thơ's {{approach}} to removing Diệm supporters from positions of influence drew criticism from both supporters {{and opponents of}} the deposed president. Some felt he was not vigorous enough in removing pro-Diệm elements from authority, whereas others felt that {{the magnitude of the}} turnover of public servants was excessive and bordering on vengeance. A number of officials suspected of having engaged in corruption or Diệmist oppression were indiscriminately arrested without charge, most of whom were later released. Đính and the new national police chief, General Mai Hữu Xuân, were given control of the interior ministry. The pair were accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty. Not all officials under Diệm could automatically be considered pro-Diệm, yet there were calls for further removals of the old guard. The government was criticised for firing large numbers of district and provincial chiefs directly appointed by Diệm, causing a breakdown in law and order during <b>the</b> <b>abrupt</b> transition of power. One high profile and heavily criticised non-removal was that of General Đỗ Cao Trí, the commander of the ARVN I Corps who gained prominence for his particularly stringent anti-Buddhist crackdown in the central region around Huế. Trí was simply transferred to the II Corps in the Central Highlands directly south of the I Corps region.|$|E
5|$|Tokyopop's {{localized}} volumes {{appeared on}} ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. The Rozen Maiden manga has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network praised Peach-Pit's works as always {{being able to}} evoke excitement or laughter from its readers but was critical about Rozen Maidens lack of plot and criticized how the dialogue or layout can be vague. Comic Book Bin wrote that while Rozen Maiden was not a splendid manga, its emphasis on psychology and emotion was something American comics should follow to expand their readership. Active Anime praised several aspects of the series: the combination of mystery, comedy, and cuteness with a balance of fantasy and drama; the visual esthetics of the images and characters; and a broadness that extends towards teens and adults. Initially, Anime Land praised the balance between comedic daily life and the underlying {{dark side of the}} plot. In later volumes though, Anime Land criticized the story's pacing and <b>the</b> <b>abrupt</b> ending. In their review of the sequel, Anime Land wrote they were surprised by the dark tone and how the plot was confusing even with knowledge from the first series. Manga-News also praised the story's alteration between moments of peace and conflict but panned the latter volumes for being rushed and losing the story's complexity. In their review of the sequel, Manga-News praised the introduction for being interesting and accessible to new readers.|$|E
