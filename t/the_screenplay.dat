5|$|Original film {{producer}} Sean S. Cunningham claims that Miller wrote <b>the</b> <b>screenplay</b> for Friday the 13th as a work-made-for-hire for the Manny Company. Under copyright law, an employer {{is considered the}} statutory author and copyright holder if a work {{is made in the}} employee's scope of employment. If, as Cunningham contends, Miller wrote <b>the</b> <b>screenplay</b> as the Manny Company's employee, he never held a copyright to <b>the</b> <b>screenplay</b> to transfer or reclaim. A lawsuit seeking the parties' declaration of rights is currently pending in a federal court in Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>screenplay</b> for Ruma Maida {{was written}} by Ayu Utami, her first such work; mainly known for her novels, she had avoided screenplays as she thought they were {{generally}} too commercially oriented. She wrote <b>the</b> <b>screenplay</b> {{over a period of}} six months beginning in 2008, when Lamp Pictures – which produced the film with Karuna Pictures– requested that she write a story about nationalism; according to the director Teddy Soeriaatmadja, who was brought in while <b>the</b> <b>screenplay</b> was still on its first draft, he and Utami read seven drafts of <b>the</b> <b>screenplay</b> before they agreed on the story. Considering <b>the</b> <b>screenplay</b> a way to encourage the younger generation to study Indonesian history, which she said could be fun, Utami decided to focus on education, diversity, and history.|$|E
5|$|Writing <b>the</b> <b>screenplay</b> {{took about}} six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, and {{although}} he passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on <b>the</b> <b>screenplay</b> was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on <b>the</b> <b>screenplay.</b> <b>The</b> <b>screenplay</b> made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the back story was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and {{the greater part of}} the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia. Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke was made more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. <b>The</b> <b>screenplay</b> was finished just after Wise completed work on West Side Story.|$|E

5|$|Spielberg first {{contacted}} screenwriter David Self {{to adapt}} the story into a feature film.
