6000|$|... "Nay, sir, {{conversation}} is better," [...] says the Doctor. [...] "I can read for myself, or hear {{you at the}} theatre.

And Doc Schergan--fine bright man the doc, very able and cultured and educated--he's crazy to meet you. We were talking about you just this morning--read about your heading this way, in the Indianapolis paper.

Reynolds writes:Eddie ... would often talk about his village and about his own land, which he assured us would always be there when he returned because everyone knew it belonged to his family. His face shone when he talked of his village and his land.So intense and so obvious was his attachment to his land that I began to worry about whether he had any idea at all about his legal circumstances. ... I said something like: [...] "You know how you've been <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> land and how everyone knows it's Mabo land? Don't you realise that nobody actually owns land on Murray Island? It's all crown land."He was stunned. ...

But it's like this: I don't understand life to-day. There's the labor unions an' employers' associations, an' strikes', an' hard times, an' huntin' for jobs, an' all the rest. Things wasn't like that in the old days. Everybody farmed, an' shot their meat, an' got enough to eat, an' took care of their old folks. But now it's all a mix-up that I can't understand.

40|$|Background Maternity {{care reform}} {{plans have been}} {{proposed}} at state and national levels in Australia, but {{the extent to which}} these respond to maternity care consumers’ expressed needs is unclear. This study examines open-text survey comments to identify women’s unmet needs and priorities for maternity care. It is then considered whether these needs and priorities are addressed in current reform plans. Methods Women who had a live single or multiple birth in Queensland, Australia, in 2010 (n 3, 635) were invited to complete a retrospective self-report survey. In addition to questions about clinical and interpersonal maternity care experiences from pregnancy to postpartum, women were asked an open-ended question “Is there anything else you’d like to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> having <b>your</b> baby?” This paper describes a detailed thematic analysis of open-ended responses from a random selection of 150 women (10...|$|R

40|$|Brief biography: Dr. Eugenia Etkina, born in Moscow, Soviet Union. Professor in the Physics Department, at Rutgers University, USA. Has 30 {{years of}} {{teaching}} experience in physics and astronomy instruction at middle school, high school and university levels. She earned her Ph. D. in physics education from Moscow State Pedagogical University. In 1995 - 1997 she taught physics courses for students at-risk at Rutgers university (New Jersey, USA), for which she together with Dr. Horton developed a highly successful approach. Her main research interest is in the cognitive and epistemological aspects of learning physics, acquisition and transfer of scientific abilities and the process of constructing physics teacher. Her doctoral students earn Ph. D. s in Learning Sciences, Ed. D. s in Science Education in the GSE and Ph. D. s in Physics Education Research in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Questions for professor Etkina. 1. Can you <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> a little <b>about</b> <b>your</b> education as a physics teacher? 2. What kind of things helps a person become a better physics teacher? 3. Why do you use the word “magic” to talk about physics teaching? 4. What that’s mean for you “didactic physics”? 5. What kind of knowledge does a physics teacher need? 6. What would you say to pre service physics teachers, in order to improve their future practice...|$|R
6000|$|The count now {{explained}} the plans {{that had been}} adopted for their escape. [...] "It would," [...] he said, [...] "seem the natural course to aid you, as we have done the warder, by driving you far into the country. But the descriptions of you are sure {{to be sent to}} every place within fifty miles. I know no one to whom I could safely entrust you, and the doctor says that it is impossible that our friend Dick should walk for any distance for {{the next two or three}} days. The doctor has fortunately received orders to-day to start at daybreak this morning with a convoy going back to Sebastopol. No doubt the new commandant had heard that he was prepared to give evidence at the court-martial contradicting the governor's statement that you were prisoners on parole, and therefore wished to get him out of the way. There are several of my carts which have been requisitioned for the service, in the convoy. I have here peasants' dresses for you. These you will put on, and when the carts come along from the chateau half an hour before daybreak it is arranged that you will take the places of two of the drivers, who will at once return home. There will be no loading to do, as the carts will be laden with flour for the army before they leave to-night, so you will only have to go along with the others, and take your places in the convoy. After starting the doctor will come along the line, and seeing Dick limping, will order him to take his place in one of the carts under his immediate charge, with medicines and bedding for the hospitals. One driver more or less in a team of some hundreds of wagons all following each other along a straight road will not be noticed. So you will journey south for a week or so, until Dick has thoroughly recovered his strength. You had then, we think, better make to the west by the Odessa road. The doctor will take two uniforms, there are plenty obtainable in the hospital, for you to put on. You must of course run the risk of questioning and detection by the way, but this cannot be avoided, and at least you will be beyond the range of search from here, and will be travelling by quite a different road from that which you would naturally take proceeding hence. And now <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> affair with the governor. We have only so far heard his version of the affair, which of course we knew to be false; but why he should have attacked you in the way he did, we cannot quite understand." ...|$|R
