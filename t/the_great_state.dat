500|$|Prayer {{and private}} offerings are {{generally}} called [...] "personal piety": acts that reflect {{a close relationship}} between an individual and a god. Evidence of personal piety is scant before the New Kingdom. Votive offerings and personal names, {{many of which are}} theophoric, suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods. But firm evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in the New Kingdom, reaching a peak late in that era. Scholars disagree about the meaning of this change—whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions. Egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples. They recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on stelae. They gave offerings of figurines that represented the gods they were praying to, or that symbolized the result they desired; thus a relief image of Hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility. Occasionally, a person took a particular god as a patron, dedicating his or her property or labor to the god's cult. These practices continued into the latest periods of Egyptian history. These later eras saw more religious innovations, including the practice of giving animal mummies as offerings to deities depicted in animal form, such as the cat mummies given to the feline goddess Bastet. Some of the major deities from myth and official religion were rarely invoked in popular worship, but many of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>state</b> gods were important in popular tradition.|$|E

60|$|And {{since the}} Fabian socialists {{have created a}} {{widespread}} belief that in their projected state every man will be necessarily a public servant or a public pupil because the state {{will be the only}} employer and the only educator, it is necessary to point out that <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>State</b> presupposes neither the one nor the other. It is a form of liberty and not a form of enslavement. We agree with the older forms of socialism in supposing an initial proprietary independence in every citizen. The citizen is a shareholder in the state. Above that and after that, he works if he chooses. But if he likes to live on his minimum and do nothing--though such a type of character is scarcely conceivable--he can. His earning is his own surplus. Above the basal economics of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>State</b> we assume with confidence there will be a huge surplus of free spending upon extra-collective ends. Public organisations, for example, may distribute impartially and possibly even print and make ink and paper for the newspapers in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>State,</b> but they will certainly not own them. Only doctrine-driven men have ever ventured to think they would. Nor will the state control writers and artists, for example, nor the stage--though it may build and own theatres--the tailor, the dressmaker, the restaurant cook, an enormous multitude of other busy workers-for-preferences. In <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>State</b> of the future, as {{in the life of the}} more prosperous classes of to-day, the greater proportion of occupations and activities will be private and free.|$|E
