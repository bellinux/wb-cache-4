2500|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{that was}} performed indicates research {{studies conducted in}} PGD underscore future research. This is due to positive attitudinal survey results, postpartum follow-up studies demonstrating {{no significant differences between}} those who had used PGD and those who conceived naturally, and ethnographic studies which confirmed that those with a previous history of negative experiences found PGD as a relief. Firstly, in the attitudinal survey, women with a history of infertility, pregnancy termination, and repeated miscarriages reported having a more positive attitude towards preimplantation genetic diagnosis. They were more accepting towards pursuing PGD. Secondly, likewise to the first attitudinal study, an ethnographic study conducted in 2004 found similar results. Couples with a history of multiple miscarriages, infertility, and an ill child, felt that preimplantation genetic diagnosis was a viable option. They also felt more relief; [...] "those using the technology were actually motivated to not repeat pregnancy loss". In summary, although some of <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> due to their retrospective nature and limited samples, the study's results indicate an overall satisfaction of participants for the use of PGD. However, the authors of the studies do indicate that these studies emphasize the need for future research such as creating a prospective design with a valid psychological scale necessary to assess the levels of stress and mood during embryonic transfer and implantation.|$|E

50|$|The most studied {{factors are}} biological. Studies {{beginning}} with Zhou in 1995 {{have found that}} trans women's brain structure (volume and density of neurons) is similar to cisgender (cis) women's and unlike cis men's, and trans men's is similar to cis men's, even when controlling for hormone use. A 2002 study by Chung suggested significant sexual dimorphism in the BSTc did not become established until adulthood, theorizing that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density and other factors which later lead to the observed differences in BSTc, or the differences {{are affected by the}} generation of a gender identity inconsistent with assigned sex. Studies in 2004 (Swaab), 2006 (Gooran), 2008 (Garcia-Falgueras), and 2010 (Rametti) confirmed earlier research finding that gender identity is influenced by brain structure. However, some of <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> as they include a small number of tested individuals. (Brain structure differences have also been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and lesbian and heterosexual women as part of extensive research on biology and sexual orientation.) Studies have also found that both androphilic and gynephilic trans women's brain function and responses are like cis women's and unlike cis men's, or are intermediate between the two. Likewise, studies such as Rametti's have found that trans men have male-like white matter patterns (even before using hormones), regardless of sexual orientation.|$|E

30|$|The first {{limitation}} of this review was the availability {{of only a few}} prospective comparable studies. The majority of the included studies were retrospective cohort studies and case series. The conclusions that can be drawn from <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> by the lack of adequate control groups, and post-treatment complications are likely to be underestimated due to the retrospective design.
