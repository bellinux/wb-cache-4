5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> people with AD.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> {{humans and}} other {{primates}} contain the same structures as <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> other mammals, but are generally larger {{in proportion to}} body size. The encephalization quotient (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species. It {{takes into account the}} nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. <b>The</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> galagos.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> {{all species}} are {{composed}} primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. Glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform {{a number of}} critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain.|$|E
60|$|In like manner, <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> a human foetus, at {{the fifth}} month, may {{correctly}} {{be said to}} be, not only <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> an ape, but that of an Arctopithecine or marmoset-like ape; for its hemispheres, with their great posterior lobster, and with no sulci but the sylvian and the calcarine, present the characteristics found only {{in the group of}} the Arctopithecine Primates. But it is equally true, as Gratiolet remarks, that, in its widely open sylvian fissure, it differs from <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> any actual marmoset. No doubt it would be much more similar to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> an advanced foetus of a marmoset. But we know nothing whatever of <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> in <b>the</b> marmosets. In the Platyrrhini proper, the only observation with which I am acquainted is due to Pansch, who found in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> a foetal Cebus Apella, in addition to the sylvian fissure and the deep calcarine fissure, only a very shallow antero-temporal fissure (scissure parallele of Gratiolet).|$|R

5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> mammals and other vertebrates is {{in terms of}} size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size.|$|E
5|$|Expression of Hsp90A also {{correlates}} with disease prognosis. Increased levels of Hsp90A {{are found in}} leukemia, breast and pancreatic cancers {{as well as in}} patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This repression was found to be further exacerbated in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|He was {{particularly}} interested in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic differences in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E

5|$|The first {{vertebrates}} appeared over 500million {{years ago}} (Mya), during the Cambrian period, {{and may have}} resembled the modern hagfish in form. Sharks appeared about 450Mya, amphibians about 400Mya, reptiles about 350Mya, and mammals about 200Mya. Each species has an equally long evolutionary history, but <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> modern hagfishes, lampreys, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of these brains contain {{the same set of}} basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part (the telencephalon) is greatly elaborated and expanded.|$|E

5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{invertebrates}} have notably complex brains: arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others), and cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and similar molluscs). <b>The</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend {{through the body}} of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain, the supraesophageal ganglion, with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing. Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their {{toothed whale}} counterparts, baleen whales {{are hard to}} study because of their immense size. Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their bulk and lack of body {{language}} makes a reaction impossible to be definitive. However, studies on <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> humpback whales revealed spindle cells, which, in humans, control theory of mind. Because of this, {{it is thought that}} baleen whales, or at least humpback whales, have consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
40|$|It is now {{established}} that <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and other nervous systems {{have the capability}} of forming steroids de novo, the so-called “neurosteroids. ” The pioneering discovery of Baulieu and his colleagues, using rodents, has {{opened the door to}} a new research field of “neurosteroids. ” In contrast to mammalian vertebrates, little has been known regarding de novo neurosteroidogenesis in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> birds. We therefore investigated neurosteroid formation and metabolism in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> quail, a domestic bird. Our studies {{over the past two decades}} demonstrated that <b>the</b> quail <b>brain</b> possesses cytochrome P 450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P 450 scc), 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ 5 -Δ 4 -isomerase (3 β-HSD), 5 β-reductase, cytochrome P 450 17 α-hydroxylase/c 17, 20 -lyase (P 45017 α,lyase), 17 β-HSD, etc., and produces pregnenolone, progesterone, 5 β-dihydroprogesterone (5 β-DHP), 3 β, 5 β-tetrahydroprogesterone (3 β, 5 β-THP), androstenedione, testosterone, and estradiol from cholesterol. Independently, Schlinger’s laboratory demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> zebra finch, a songbird, also produces various neurosteroids. Thus, the formation and metabolism of neurosteroids from cholesterol is now known to occur in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> birds. In addition, we recently found that <b>the</b> quail <b>brain</b> expresses cytochrome P 4507 α and produces 7 α- and 7 β-hydroxypregnenolone, previously undescribed avian neurosteroids, from pregnenolone. This paper summarizes the advances made in our understanding of neurosteroid formation and metabolism in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> domestic birds. This paper also describes what are currently known about physiological changes in neurosteroid formation and biological functions <b>of</b> neurosteroids in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> domestic and other birds...|$|R

40|$|Remipedia {{are rare}} and ancient mandibulate {{arthropods}} inhabiting almost inaccessible submerged cave systems. Their phylogenetic position is still enigmatic {{and the subject}} of extremely controversial debates. To contribute arguments to this discussion, we analyzed <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> Godzilliognomus frondosus Yager, 1989 (Remipedia, Godzilliidae) and provide a detailed 3 D reconstruction of its anatomy. This reconstruction yielded the surprising finding that in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> other crustaceans such as representatives of the Branchiopoda and Maxillopoda <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> G. frondosus is highly organized and well differentiated. It is matched in complexity only by <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> “higher” crustaceans (Malacostraca) and Hexapoda. A phylogenetic analysis limited to <b>brain</b> anatomy across <b>the</b> Mandibulata strongly contradicts the prevailing hypothesis that the Remipedia are a basal, ancestral crustacean group but instead argues in favor of a remipede-malacostracan-hexapod clade and most likely a sister-group relationship of Remipedia and Malacostraca...|$|R
5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Many {{months before}} the coup, Đông had met Diệm's brother and adviser Ngô Đình Nhu, widely {{regarded}} as <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> the regime, to ask for reform and de-politicisation of the army.

However, a few weeks later, Dong and his collaborators were transferred to different commands and physically separated. Fearing that Diệm and Nhu were trying to throw their plans off balance, they accelerated their planning work, and decided to move on October 6. However, they were then scheduled to go into battle against the communists near Kon Tum in the II Corps in the Central Highlands, forcing a postponement.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> {{vertebrates}} {{are made}} of very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E
