5|$|This lists {{all of the}} Category5 hurricanes in {{the order}} in which they formed. Only 1994's Hurricane Emilia and 2006's Hurricane Ioke have reached Category5 {{intensity}} more than once; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> weakening into a Category4 or weaker storm and later re-strengthening to a Category5 storm.|$|E
5|$|Montenegro coach Sava Kovačević, {{whose team}} {{was knocked out}} by Bolivia in the semifinals, said that Montenegro would ask {{football}} governing body FIFA {{to look into the}} matter. However, FIFA announced they would not be doing so as complaints concerning the eligibility of players should have been submitted in writing to FIFA's headquarters in Singapore at the Youth Olympic Games no later than five days before the first match, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> 8 August. FIFA also said that its staff had met all footballers individually at the Olympic Village and had checked their passports against their dates of birth provided by their respective National Olympic Committees.|$|E
5|$|Nine Atlantic hurricanes—Camille, Allen, Andrew, Isabel, Ivan, Dean, Felix, Irma and Maria—reached Category5 {{intensity}} on {{more than}} one occasion; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> reaching Category5 intensity, weakening to a Category4 or lower, and then becoming a Category5 again. Such hurricanes have their dates shown together. Camille, Andrew, Dean, Felix, Irma, and Maria each attained Category 5 status twice during their lifespans. Allen, Isabel, and Ivan reached Category 5 intensity on three separate occasions. However, no Atlantic hurricane has reached Category5 intensity more than three times during its lifespan. The November 1932 Cuba hurricane holds the record for most time spent as a Category5 (although it took place before satellite or aircraft reconnaissance, so this record may be somewhat suspect). Irma holds the record for longest continuous span as a Category 5 storm in the satellite era.|$|E

However, when the monarch dies, the successor to the crown does not automatically become Head of the Commonwealth.

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of scientists refute young Earth creationism. Around {{the start of the}} 19th century mainstream science abandoned the concept that Earth was younger than millions of years. Measurements of biological, chemical, geological, and astronomical timescales differ from YEC's estimates of Earth's age by six orders of magnitude (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> factor of a million times). Scientific estimates of the age of the earliest pottery discovered, the oldest known trees, the ice cores, and layers of silt deposit in Lake Suigetsu are all significantly older than the oldest YEC estimate of Earth's age. YEC's theories are further contradicted by scientists' ability to observe galaxies billions of light years away.|$|E
25|$|They are a {{hardy and}} useful {{aquarium}} fish despite having a coloration <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are {{fascinated by the}} habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb {{the bottom of the}} aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank. Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind.|$|E
25|$|In all {{instances}} where R2 is used, the predictors are calculated by ordinary least-squares regression: <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> minimizing SSres. In this case R2 increases as we {{increase the number}} of variables in the model (R2 is monotone increasing with the number of variables included—i.e., it will never decrease). This illustrates a drawback to one possible use of R2, where one might keep adding variables (Kitchen sink regression) to increase the R2 value. For example, if one is trying to predict the sales of a model of car from the car's gas mileage, price, and engine power, one can include such irrelevant factors as the first letter of the model's name or the height of the lead engineer designing the car because the R2 will never decrease as variables are added and will probably experience an increase due to chance alone.|$|E
