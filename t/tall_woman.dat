5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a <b>tall</b> <b>woman</b> in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was}} not herself, her mother took her to a physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E

Her affection towards her apprentice Septimus is manifest in the novels, as is the responsibility she feels to protect him and his sister, even with her own life. She {{is described as a}} <b>tall</b> <b>woman,</b> with long, dark curly hair and deep-green eyes, and generally wears a deep purple tunic with purple python-skin boots. Her symbol and source of power, an Akhu-Amulet, which makes her ExtraOrdinary Wizard, hangs around her neck. Her haughty and vain characterization has been praised as a [...] "well-written stand-alone".|$|E

500|$|Prokofiev {{was born}} in 1891 in Sontsovka (now Sontsivka, Pokrovsk Raion, Donetsk Oblast, eastern Ukraine), a remote rural estate in the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire. His father, Sergei Alexeyevich Prokofiev, was an agronomist. Prokofiev's mother, Maria (née Zhitkova), came {{from a family of}} former serfs who had been owned by the Sheremetev family, under whose {{patronage}} serf-children were taught theatre and arts from an early age. She was described by Reinhold Glière (Prokofiev's first composition teacher) as [...] "a <b>tall</b> <b>woman</b> with beautiful, clever eyes... who knew how to create an atmosphere of warmth and simplicity about her." [...] After their wedding in the summer of 1877, the Prokofievs moved to a small estate in the Smolensk governorate. Eventually Sergei Alexeyevich found employment as a soil engineer, employed by one of his former fellow-students, Dmitri Sontsov, to whose estate in the Ukrainian steppes the Prokofievs moved.|$|E
500|$|Stanton's mother, Margaret Livingston Cady, a {{descendant}} of early Dutch settlers, {{was the daughter of}} Colonel James Livingston, an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Having fought at Saratoga and Quebec, Livingston assisted in the capture of Major John Andre at West Point, New York where Andre and Benedict Arnold, who escaped aboard the HMS Vulture, were planning to turn West Point over to the English. Margaret Cady, an unusually <b>tall</b> <b>woman</b> for her time, had a commanding presence, and Stanton routinely described her mother as [...] "queenly." [...] While Stanton's daughter, Harriot Stanton Blatch, remembers her grandmother as being fun, affectionate, and lively, Stanton herself did not apparently share such memories. Emotionally devastated by the loss of so many children, Margaret Cady fell into a depression, which kept her from being fully involved in the lives of her surviving children and left a maternal void in Stanton's childhood.|$|E
500|$|Homer is {{initially}} {{happy to get}} an organized, cheerful new assistant at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a very <b>tall</b> <b>woman</b> named Roz Davis. However, when he and Barney head out to see a film during their work shift, Roz reveals this to Mr. Burns, who demotes Homer to Roz's job and gives Roz Homer's position. Roz proceeds to charm the regulars at Moe's Tavern while finding dozens of ways to make Homer's job miserable. After Ned Flanders sees Homer is depressed, Homer tells him about Roz, and is shocked to learn that Ned knew Roz back in Ohio; {{they were part of}} the same Christian group, and when Ned gave her a congratulatory hug for winning a [...] "no-fun run" [...] he learned that Roz cannot stand any physical contact. When Roz wins a [...] "Worker of Millennium" [...] award at the plant, Homer manipulates Burns into giving Roz a hug. She proceeds to beat Burns up, and is fired. Roz then compliments Homer for being much smarter than she expected, in terms Homer does not quite understand.|$|E

500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very <b>tall</b> <b>woman,</b> or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of her career, Callas was a heavy woman; in her own words, [...] "Heavy—one can say—yes I was; but I'm also a <b>tall</b> <b>woman,</b> 5' 8½" [...] , and I used to weigh no more than ]." [...] Tito Gobbi relates that during a lunch break while {{recording}} Lucia in Florence, Serafin commented to Callas that she was eating too much and allowing her weight to become a problem. When she protested that she wasn't so heavy, Gobbi suggested she should [...] "put the matter to test" [...] by stepping on the weighing machine outside the restaurant. The result was [...] "somewhat dismaying, and she became rather silent." [...] In 1968, Callas told Edward Downes that during her initial performances in Cherubini's Medea in May 1953, she realized that she needed a leaner face and figure to do dramatic justice to this {{as well as the other}} roles she was undertaking.

2500|$|The {{length of}} ladies' evening gloves are {{referred}} to in terms of [...] "buttons", whether they in fact have buttons or not. The word is derived from French, and the exact measure is actually a bit longer than one inch. Wrist length gloves are usually eight-button, those at the elbow are 16, mid-biceps are 22 and full shoulder length are 30. Opera gloves are between 16 and 22inches long, though some gloves can be as long as 29 or 30inches. To fit oneself for gloves, measure all around the hand at the widest part of the palm where the knuckles are, but excluding the thumb. The measurement in inches is the glove size, but if one's arms are large, it may be practical to go up a size. Generally, an evening glove {{is considered to be}} a true [...] "opera-length" [...] glove if it reaches to mid-biceps or higher on the wearer's arm, notwithstanding its actual length in inches or buttons; therefore, a petite woman might find a glove with a measurement of 16 or 17inches adequate for the purpose, while a <b>tall</b> <b>woman</b> might need a glove longer than 22inches. A glove shorter than elbow-length should not be referred to as an [...] "opera-length glove" [...] or [...] "opera glove" [...] under any circumstances.|$|E
