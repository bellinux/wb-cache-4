Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> an altercation as Tommy watches. Tommy's mother convinces him {{that he did not}} see or hear the incident and must never tell anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, and blind to the outside world ("1921"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E

Dolgorukov had been initiated into Freemasonry in the late 1770s and had belonged to the Rite of Strict Observance; there were rumors that he had met both Alessandro Cagliostro and the Count of St. Germain. She also later stated {{that at this time}} of life she began to experience visions in which she encountered a [...] "Mysterious Indian" [...] man, and that in later life she would meet <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the flesh. Many biographers have considered this to be the first appearance of the [...] "Masters" [...] in her life story.|$|E

2500|$|The Augustinian friars {{came into}} being {{as part of the}} mendicant {{movement}} of the 13th century, a new form of religious life which sought to bring the religious ideals of the monastic life into an urban setting which allowed the religious to serve the needs of the People of God in an apostolic capacity. [...] At this time {{there were a number of}} eremitical groups living in such diverse places as Tuscany, Latium, Umbria, Liguria, England, Switzerland, Germany, and perhaps France. [...] In 1243 the Tuscan hermits petitioned Pope Innocent IV to unite them all as one group. [...] Innocent IV issued the Bull Incumbit Nobis on 16 December 1243, an essentially pastoral letter which exhorted these hermits to adopt [...] "the Rule and way of life of the Blessed Augustine," [...] to profess this Augustinian manner of life in a way that they themselves would decide with regards to specific charism and apostolate, and to elect a Prior General. [...] The bull also appointed Cardinal Riccardo Annibaldi as their supervisor and legal guide.

2500|$|On 28 December, German {{prosecutors}} {{said they had}} detained a 40-year-old Tunisian man, who they thought {{may have been involved}} in the attack. Amri had saved the number of <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> his phone. Prosecutors stated on the next day that he was released after investigations revealed that he was not a suspected contact of Amri. They also confirmed that the attacker had sent a mobile phone voice message and a picture to a contact shortly before carrying out the attack. The German police raided the homes of two suspected associates on 3 January 2017, including a 26-year-old Tunisian man they suspected of being in contact with Amri and knowing about the attack as well as a former flatmate of Amri. The Tunisian suspect who was suspected of either planning the attack or knowing about it was detained with federal prosecutors stating that he had known Amri since the end of 2015, had met him a day before the attack and both had [...] "very intense conversations". Amri's former flatmate was also being investigated and the attacker had tried to contact him twice on 19 December.|$|E
2500|$|The Augustinian friars {{came into}} being after the older Canons Regular, {{as part of the}} mendicant {{movement}} of the 13th century, a new form of religious life which sought to bring the religious ideals of the monastic life into an urban setting which allowed the religious to serve the needs of the People of God in an apostolic capacity.

In 1243 the Tuscan hermits petitioned Pope Innocent IV to unite them all as one group. Innocent IV issued the Bull Incumbit Nobis on 16 December 1243, an essentially pastoral letter which, despite its brevity, basically served as the magna carta initiating the foundation of the Order as it is known today. This papal bull exhorted these hermits to adopt [...] "the Rule and way of life of the Blessed Augustine," [...] to profess this Augustinian manner of life in a way that they themselves would decide with regards to specific charism and apostolate, and to elect a Prior General.
