5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
25|$|Although a socialist, Attlee still {{believed}} in the British Empire of his youth. He <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an institution that was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that {{a large part of}} it needed to be self-governing. Using the Dominions of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand as a model, he continued the transformation of the Empire into the modern-day British Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|Exhausted and {{frustrated}} by the antagonism in Palermo, Falcone accepted a post in the Ministry of Justice in Rome offered to him by Claudio Martelli, the new minister of Justice in a new government of Giulio Andreotti in March 1991. The transfer was initially seen as a capitulation by Falcone, but he himself <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a tactical move to better fight the Mafia. His first action was to prepare a decree to repair the disastrous sentence by Supreme Court judge Corrado Carnevale, known as the “sentence-killer”, that allowed {{most of the remaining}} defendants of the Maxi Trial to walk free from prison. The Martelli decree led to the immediate re-arrest of the Mafia bosses.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of the crash, Saint-Donat villagers {{remember}} hearing the noise of a large aircraft passing overhead and moments later an impact. Jos Gaudet, then on duty in fire tower number four at Archambault lake did see the light emitted by the burning wreckage on top of the mountain but <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the reflection of the sun on a moist rocky slope. On the morning of the crash Gaudet and Georges Moore took a boat around lake Archambault to look for signs of wreckage such as oil slicks or debris, believing that the aircraft had fallen in the water. Later on, Mr. Moore went to the town hall to alert the military authorities but his claim was dismissed as being implausible.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{was generally not}} well known or understood during the war. The English people <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a minor operation, a waste of precious resources which would be better spent on the Western Front, while the peoples of India {{were more interested in}} the Mesopotamian campaign and the occupation of Baghdad. Australia did not have a war correspondent in the area until Captain Frank Hurley, the first Australian Official Photographer, arrived in August 1917 after visiting the Western Front. Henry Gullett, the first Official War Correspondent, arrived in November 1917. The long-lasting effect of this {{campaign was}} the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, when France won the mandate for Syria and Lebanon, while the British Empire won the mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine. The Republic of Turkey came into existence in 1923 after the Turkish War of Independence ended the Ottoman Empire. The European mandates ended with the formation of the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, the Lebanese Republic in 1943, the State of Israel in 1948, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan and Syrian Arab Republic in 1946.|$|E

50|$|Philip Dalkin first {{wrote the}} story as a stage play, which Bob Weis read in 1978. He enjoyed it and at one stage <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> making <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a {{television}} miniseries before deciding on {{turning it into a}} feature film. It was shot over six weeks in and around Melbourne on a budget of $1.7 million.|$|R

Asked whether it wasn't true that race-walking looks funny, he responded: [...] "But in the 1950s, when I started running, people also thought I was a nut. Jews didn't run. They would laugh." [...] He explained further: [...] "People <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> only <b>as</b> punishment for soldiers.” ...|$|R

500|$|Over $11million {{has been}} spent on the {{rehabilitation}} of Taliesin since 1998. Unfortunately, its preservation is [...] "fraught with epic difficulties", because Wright never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a series of buildings with a long-term future. It was built by inexperienced students, without solid foundations. Financing renovations has been challenging because revenue from Taliesin visitation has been lower than projected.|$|E
500|$|The word cê is a {{shortened}} {{version of}} the Portuguese personal pronoun você, meaning you. Veloso says that cê is a more [...] "colloquial" [...] version of você, used often in everyday speech. When he writes lyrics, Veloso typically writes the word você, but sings cê when performing. The inspiration for the album's title came when he wrote cê instead of você and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an appropriate title.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} a {{financial}} success for Comedy Central and helped the network transform into [...] "a cable industry power almost overnight". Despite this, critics gave the season mixed reviews. Parents Television Council rated it so offensive that it [...] "shouldn't have been made": [...] "it doesn't just push the envelope; it knocks it off the table", while another critic <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "coming pretty damn close" [...] to being a [...] "perfect" [...] television series season.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{have found}} The Time Traveler's Wife {{difficult}} to classify generically: some categorize it as science fiction, others as a romance. Niffenegger herself {{is reluctant to}} label the novel, saying she [...] "never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> science fiction, {{even though it has}} a science-fiction premise". In Niffenegger's view, the story is primarily about Henry and Clare's relationship and the struggles they endure. She has said that she based Clare and Henry's romance on the [...] "cerebral coupling" [...] of Dorothy Sayers's characters Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane.|$|E
500|$|The Irish {{thought of}} Scotland as a provincial place. Others <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an outlandish or barbaric place. [...] "Who would {{deny that the}} Scots are barbarians?" [...] was a rhetorical {{question}} posed {{by the author of}} the De expugnatione Lyxbonensi (i.e. [...] "On the Conquest of Lisbon"). A century later Louis IX of France was reported to have said to his son [...] "I would prefer that a Scot should come from Scotland and govern the people well and faithfully, than that you, my son, should be seen to govern badly." ...|$|E

His idea was to plough their money into a chain of shops not unlike Woolworth's in concept: Apple boutiques, Apple posters, Apple records. Brian needed an outlet for his boundless energy".

DJ Paul stated that he felt like it was a reunion, despite the absence of Juicy J. He <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> rather <b>as</b> a whole new project and decided to give the group a new name out of respect for Juicy J.|$|R
500|$|Different {{from the}} other Hasbro {{properties}} Ball had worked on, she explained that Hasbro wanted the comic to entertain readers rather than be morally didactic. She likened this {{to the principle of}} [...] "no hugging, no learning" [...] coined on the set of Seinfeld. Apart from that, the studio gave Ball license to give Blythe hobbies not depicted on the show. Ball focused on writing stories that would appeal to readers transitioning from primary to secondary education. She described the structure for the comic as a daily drama, while Anderson <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> slice of life.|$|E

[...] In the same interview Frances said: [...] "I never even <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> being a fraud– it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I can't understand to this day why they were taken in– {{they wanted to be}} taken in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{initially}} released by Bulk Recordings on May 7, 1996, under the shorter title Dr. Octagon. Although the album sold relatively well, Nakamura {{has said it}} was under-promoted because it was released by an independent label. In both the United States and United Kingdom, the album was issued by Bulk Records on vinyl as a double LP, and on compact disc with bonus tracks,. Separately, it was also issued by Mo' Wax in the UK as a triple LP, reflecting the track listing of the Bulk Recordings compact disk. [...] "When we did this record we <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an underground joint", Nakamura said.|$|E

500|$|Spanish {{critic and}} philosopher Miguel de Unamuno {{comments}} of the book, [...] "I never took Facundo by Sarmiento {{as a historical}} work, nor do I {{think it can be}} very valued in that regard. I always <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a literary work, as a historical novel". However, Facundo cannot be classified as a novel or a specific genre of literature. According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an [...] "essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [...] travelogue". Sarmiento's style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina's geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the crew}} shoots scenes out of order, the last scene that Muhney filmed {{was the one}} in which Keith offers to help Lamb in {{investigating}} the break-in at the O'Dell residence. He enjoyed acting with Grieco, calling him [...] "very approachable." [...] He was also pleased with the character's sendoff, stating that it was appropriate. He wished that he had more time to say farewells to each cast and crew member individually. Lamb's last words were [...] "I smell bread"; Muhney explained that it was a reference to a minor character death on M*A*S*H. He stated that it was an in-joke among the crew and that the words had [...] "no significance within the borders of Neptune." [...] However, Muhney <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> his character's last burst of sarcasm.|$|E
500|$|Manga artist Natsumi Ando's concept art of Arisa had two earlier {{models of}} Tsubasa with chin-length and shoulder-length hair, respectively. Ando {{initially}} felt {{worried about the}} absence of a potential romantic partner for Tsubasa, as Arisas target audience is girls; however, as the manga progressed, she <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a selling point." [...] As a result of this, she was able to focus on Tsubasa's emotions towards her twin. Soon after beginning the manga's serialization, Ando created [...] "Tsubasa", a bonus chapter focusing on Arisa's pretending to be her elder sister; she continued to delay its publication, because it seemed inappropriate to have a bonus story with Arisa appear when she was comatose in the main storyline. According to Ando, it made a good chapter with which to conclude the series.|$|E

We had had a row as to whose fault it was that we had first lost our way. We had got thoroughly disagreeable, footsore, and weary. But throughout it all the hope of that duck kept us up. A fairy-like vision, it floated before our tired eyes and drew us onward. The <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was <b>as</b> a trumpet-call to the fainting.

60|$|In pagan Tahiti a cocoa-nut branch was {{the symbol}} of regal authority. Laid upon the {{sacrifice}} in the temple, it made the offering sacred; {{and with it the}} priests chastised and put to flight the evil spirits which assailed them. The supreme majesty of Oro, the great god of their mythology, was declared in the cocoa-nut log from which his image was rudely carved. Upon one of the Tonga Islands, there stands a living tree revered itself as a deity. Even upon the Sandwich Islands, the cocoa-palm retains all its ancient reputation; the people there having <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> adopting <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the national emblem.|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} of the album has had some critics draw comparisons to Drake's More Life. In terms of the album structure, critics have been more mixed. In a generally positive review, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian acknowledged the album as a [...] "scattershot collection of tracks, rather than a coherent album." [...] Record Collector <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> both <b>as</b> a flaw but also its strength, stating that [...] "the album throws it all at you in one gloriously delirious barrage that has no real anchor."
