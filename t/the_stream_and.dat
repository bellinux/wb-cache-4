5|$|Roaring Brook is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for part of its length and a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for {{the other part of}} its length. It is also Class A Wild Trout Waters from the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir. Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> boreal forest trees inhabit wetlands in the watershed. A 12-mile (19-kilometer) rail trail connecting the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail to the Poconos via the Roaring Brook Corridor has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June 1809 Agamemnon, {{along with}} the rest of the {{squadron}} (which was now under the command of Rear-Admiral Michael de Courcy), put into Maldonado Bay for the third and final time, to shelter from a storm. While working her way between Gorriti Island and the shore, Agamemnon struck an uncharted shoal. Captain Jonas Rose attempted to use the ship's boats, together with <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> kedge anchors, to pull the ship off, but to no avail. The ship had dropped anchor on the shoal just previously, and it was discovered that she had run onto it when she grounded, the anchor having pierced the hull. On 17 June, with the ship listing heavily to starboard, Agamemnons stores and all her crew were taken off by boats from other vessels in the squadron, and the following day Captain Rose and his officers left the ship.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{forces were}} entrenched {{on the crest}} of two small hills, between which the road from Arroyo to Guayama ran. The Americans had crossed a stream in front of the hills when {{suddenly}} the Spanish opened fire. The Americans protected their position by <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> increased their firepower as more reinforcements arrived. The outnumbered Spanish troops retreated to Guayama as the Americans made their advance on the hills. The firefight, which lasted half an hour, left three American wounded. When the 4th Ohio entered the town they discovered that the Spaniards had fled north and abandoned the city, ending the Battle of Guayama. General John Rutter Brooke used the Cautiño Residence (Casa Cautiño) by the town square in Guayama as his military headquarters.|$|E

5|$|US113Alternate {{continued}} north across Isaac Branch at Moores Lake {{and entered}} the city of Dover just south of its underpass of Puncheon Run Connector and crossing of Puncheon Run. Just north of <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> highway, the alternate route intersected US13 (DuPont Highway). While South State Street continued north toward the Dover Green Historic District and the Delaware State Capitol, US113Alternate turned east to run concurrently with US13. The two highways crossed the St. Jones River and intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west toward the state capitol and east {{to provide access to}} US 113 (Bay Road). Immediately to the north of Court Street, US113Alternate and US113 reached their joint termini at US 13's directional intersection with Bay Road; US 13 continued north along DuPont Highway. There was no direct access between US 113 Alt. and US 113 at the terminal intersection.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the 35th Infantry {{took up a}} hill {{position}} {{northwest of}} Hamch'ang and south of Mun'gyong {{on the south side}} of a stream that flowed past Sangju to the Naktong. On the north side of the stream an ROK battalion held the front line. Brigadier General Vennard Wilson, the 25th's Assistant Division Commander, ordered F Company of the battalion to be inserted in the center of the ROK line north of <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> <b>and</b> this was done over the strong protests of the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins. Wilson thought the American troops would strengthen the ROK defense but Wilkins did not want the untried company to be dependent on ROK stability in its first engagement. Behind the ROK and F Company positions the ground rose to another hill within small arms range. Heavy rains had swollen the stream behind the ROK and F Company positions to a torrent that was rolling large boulders along its channel. In the meantime, the ROK 2nd Battalion, 17th Regiment, ambushed a battalion of North Korean troops near Tongkwanri, forcing it to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The two battalions of the 27th Infantry {{went into}} a {{perimeter}} defense {{just north of the}} village of Soi-ri. The 1st Battalion, on the left of the road, took a position with C Company on high ground in front, and with A Company on a ridge behind it. On their right, B Company was placed parallel to A Company, and carried the line across <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> the narrow valley to the road. There the 2nd Battalion took up the defense line with E Company on the road and F Company on its right, while G Company held a ridge behind F Company. Thus, the two battalions presented a four-company front, with one company holding a refused flank position on either side. A platoon of tanks took positions on the front line, two tanks on the road and two in the stream bed, with four more tanks in reserve. The artillery went into firing positions behind the force. Six bazooka teams took up positions in front of the infantry positions along the road and in the stream bed. At the same time, the ROK 1st Division remained in control of the high ground {{on either side of the}} 27th Infantry positions.|$|E

25|$|Scouting or {{examining}} the rapids before running them {{is crucial to}} familiarize oneself with <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> anticipate the challenges. This is especially important during flood conditions when the highly increased flow have altered the normal conditions drastically.|$|E
25|$|There are fifteen {{abandoned}} mine drainage discharges in the watershed of Carbon Run. There {{are also a}} number of small lakes in the watershed. It is at least partially in the Coal Region. There is a coal field between <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> the summit of Mahanoy Mountain.|$|E
25|$|Silver Creek {{is partly}} or fully in the Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The {{dominant}} hydrologic soil group in {{the upper part of}} the watershed is C. There are significant deposits of sediment along <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> <b>and</b> streambank erosion occurs in the watershed. The surface geology consists of interbedded sedimentary rock in 89 percent of {{the upper part of the}} watershed and sandstone in the remaining 11 percent.|$|E

25|$|Larvae are not {{numerous}} {{in larger}} streams, possibly {{because of the}} abundance of trout; predation by trout and other species of fish can affect the populations of E. junaluska. Competition with other salamanders {{can also be a}} factor. The junaluska salamander is thought to feed on smaller invertebrates found in <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> forest areas they inhabit. Currently, interactions with other species are not well studied for this species.|$|E
25|$|Lionblaze {{plans to}} travel up <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> {{find a way}} to unblock it and bring the water back, a journey that would include a patrol from each Clan, and ThunderClan leader Firestar agrees, sending Lionblaze and Dovepaw to {{represent}} ThunderClan. After an initial failed attack on the beaver dam, in which RiverClan warrior Rippletail is killed, the patrol succeeds in destroying the dam {{with the help of a}} few housecats encountered during their journey.|$|E
25|$|In New Mexico {{rain was}} scarce during {{certain parts of}} the year so new {{techniques}} of farming were developed (such as dry farming and crop rotation) The Zia would plant seeds in a fertile piece of land close to a river or stream. They would then dig paths to the fields from <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> thus the water flowed from the stream to water the crops. By strategically placing rocks in the paths, they controlled the flow of water to their crops.|$|E

50|$|The area is traversed by many <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> {{punctuated by}} forests of palm trees, {{alternating}} with natural pasture lands which are employed to raise cattle <b>and</b> sheep. <b>The</b> <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nearby Guayquiraró River are adequate for fishing.|$|R
25|$|Kings Gap Hollow Run is a spring-fed {{stream that}} {{periodically}} dries up and reveals a stony bottom. However, {{in the spring}} when the water flow is at its peak, this stony bottom is home for many aquatic animals. Pick a stone out of <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> observe the larva of the black fly as they cling to the stone and filter food from the water. Although the adult black fly is considered a pest, the presence of its larva in the stream is an indicator of good water quality.|$|E
25|$|After hiding all day {{above the}} camp, in holes dug beneath {{the bank of}} Sand Creek, the {{survivors}} there, {{many of whom were}} wounded, moved up <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> spent the night on the prairie. Trips were made {{to the site of the}} camp but very few survivors were found there. After a cold night without shelter, the survivors set out toward the Cheyenne camp on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill River. They soon met up with other survivors who had escaped with part of the horse herd, some returning from the Smoky Hill camp where they had fled during the attack. They then proceeded to the camp, where they received assistance.|$|E
25|$|Numerous bridges {{have been}} built over Buck Run. One was {{constructed}} in 1881 and two more were built in 1914, {{one of which was}} repaired in 2012. A bridge was built over <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> its tributary Doe Run in 1915. Another five bridges were built over the stream between 1926 and 1930 and two more in 1937 and 1940. The three newest bridges over it were constructed in 1969, 1975, and 2002. Additionally, there are three covered bridges over the creek. Two of them, the Mary Ann Pyle Bridge and the Hayes Clark Bridge are on private property. They were built in 1881 and 1971, respectively. The third covered bridge is the Speakman Bridge.|$|E

25|$|Until the 1700s, Tibbets Brook {{split into}} two smaller streams at around West 237th Street, the westernmost and primary stream along modern Tibbett Avenue feeding into the Spuyten Duyvil, and the easternmost along the right-of-ways of the Putnam Railroad and current Major Deegan Expressway feeding into the Harlem River. The two streams formed a {{triangular}} island called Paparinemo that constitutes much of today's Kingsbridge neighborhood. The brook had numerous tributaries, including several within modern Van Cortlandt Park. The {{north end of the}} brook within Yonkers and the park is entirely fresh water, while south of the park it was a tidal estuary lined with salt marshes. The watershed from the brook created wetlands surrounding <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> <b>and</b> formed a northern extension of the Harlem River valley. The original Spuyten Duyvil Creek course has since been filled in, replaced by the Harlem River Ship Canal.|$|E
25|$|The two forces {{then began}} an {{intermittent}} fight that began at 9:00a.m. and lasted until 1:30p.m. After the initial artillery shot, Bendix's men began to scatter {{into the trees}} for protection. The 5th New York Infantry under Colonel Duryee charged {{the left of the}} forward Confederate position with the apparent ultimate intent of crossing <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> turning the Confederate flank but they were quickly discouraged and turned back by heavy Confederate fire. Lieutenant Greble came up the road to place his three guns where he and his small detachment of regulars from the 2nd U.S. Artillery Regiment could return fire, which he did resolutely but with little effect. Peirce then positioned the 5th New York (Duryee), 7th New York (Bendix) and the Massachusetts and Vermont companies (Washburn) {{to the right of the}} Hampton Road and the 3rd New York (Townsend) and 1st New York (Allen) to the left of the road. He would launch piecemeal attacks from these positions. Greble continued to fire at the Confederate positions while Peirce arranged his force and gave them some time to rest.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{suspension}} is entrained {{in the center}} of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is arranged so that there is a large separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell per droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets, the flow passes through a fluorescence measuring station where the fluorescent character of each cell of interest is measured. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based immediately prior to fluorescence intensity being measured, and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly to <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> <b>and</b> the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.|$|E
50|$|The name Midan {{is derived}} from Midan Al Hassa (ميدان الحصى) or the field of gravel.
