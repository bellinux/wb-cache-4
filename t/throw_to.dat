5|$|As {{it had in}} {{the third}} quarter, Stanford's offense scored quickly. In only three plays, the Cardinal {{advanced}} 72yards. A 34-yard run by Stepfan Taylor was followed by one stopped for no gain, then Luck completed a 38-yard <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> Fleener for Stanford's second touchdown of the quarter. The score and extra point improved Stanford's lead to 40–12 with 6:05 remaining in the game. Tech's subsequent drive went three-and-out after Tyrod Taylor was sacked twice, and Stanford got the ball again at its 46-yard line.|$|E
5|$|This {{remains the}} only nine-inning major league game where the teams {{combined}} for just one hit. The game's only run, scored by the Dodgers, was unearned. The Dodger run was scored without a recorded at bat—Lou Johnson walked, reached second on a sacrifice bunt, stole third, and scored when the <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> get him out at third went wild.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{began the}} 1991 season with Buffalo. The Pirates {{promoted}} Banister from {{the minor leagues}} on July 23, 1991, when catcher Don Slaught was injured and placed on the disabled list. Manager Jim Leyland used Banister as a pinch hitter for pitcher Doug Drabek {{in the eighth inning}} of that day's game against the Atlanta Braves at Three Rivers Stadium. Using Cecil Espy's bat, Banister hit a ball from Dan Petry and just beat shortstop Jeff Blauser's <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> first base. Banister is one of only 15 batters (excluding pitchers) in baseball history to record a hit in his only major league plate appearance.|$|E

5|$|Clemson {{received}} Georgia Tech's kickoff with 1:20 {{remaining in}} the game. On the Tigers' first play, they committed a 10-yard penalty. Two incomplete passes followed from Parker, who then completed an 18-yard <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> Xavier Dye. This set up a fourth-and-two for the Tigers, who needed to gain a first down to keep their potential game-winning drive going. Instead, Parker was stymied {{in his attempt to}} run for the needed yards, and Clemson turned the ball over on downs. Georgia Tech's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and ensured their 39–34 victory.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Tech {{began at}} its 20-yard line. On {{the first play}} of the possession, Florida State {{committed}} a 15-yard pass interference penalty that gave Tech a first down at its 35-yard line. Tech was further aided by two five-yard penalties against Florida State that gave the Hokies another first down, and Vick completed a short pass across midfield. On the first play in Florida State territory, Vick completed a 49-yard <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> wide receiver André Davis for Tech's first touchdown of the game. The extra point attempt was good, and with 30seconds remaining in the quarter, Tech narrowed Florida State's lead to 147.|$|E
5|$|Four of the This Year in Baseball Awards {{also went}} to the Phillies. Lidge was {{recognized}} as the Closer of the Year, while Utley won the Postseason Moment of the Year award for his fake <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> first base which allowed him to throw out Rays' shortstop Jason Bartlett at home plate during the World Series. Manager Charlie Manuel and general manager Pat Gillick were also named Manager of the Year (distinct from Major League Baseball's Manager of the Year award) and Executive of the Year, respectively, for their leadership of the 2008 team and for winning the World Series.|$|E
25|$|The Buckeyes tried one last-ditch {{effort to}} pull within Michigan with 3:12 {{left in the}} game, with Maciejowski finding Dick Kuhn. Hayes called a fake punt with Sensibaugh <b>throwing</b> <b>to</b> Zelina to get the first down at their own 38. Kuhn then took another pass in Michigan territory, then Maciejowski <b>threw</b> <b>to</b> Ray Gillian at the Michigan 22. The drive was {{squashed}} on the next play when Maciejowski <b>threw</b> an interception <b>to</b> Thom Darden.|$|R

5|$|Game 3 {{matched the}} Giants' Juan Marichal against Johnny Podres, though Dodgers' manager Walt Alston had {{considered}} starting reliever Larry Sherry. The pair kept the game scoreless through two innings before the Giants opened the scoring {{in the top}} of the third. José Pagán singled to lead off the inning, Marichal reached on a throwing error by the pitcher on a <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> second base which allowed Pagán to move to third, and Pagán scored on a Harvey Kuenn single. Then, while Chuck Hiller was batting, John Roseboro made an error in attempting to pickoff Marichal on second base, allowing him to advance to third. Hiller hit a fly ball to shallow left field and Marichal held at third base. Left fielder Duke Snider threw home but the ball was cut off by the third baseman, who threw to second to try to catch Kuenn in a rundown between first and second. However, the second baseman's <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> first hit Kuenn in the back, leaving him safe at first and allowing Marichal to score, to make the game 2–0. Felipe Alou then singled, Kuenn went to third, and Alou advanced to second on the throw. Podres intentionally walked Willie Mays to load the bases with one out, and induced a double play from Orlando Cepeda to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Rodríguez {{suffered}} a season-ending injury {{in a game}} against the Anaheim Angels. While trying to make a <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> second base, his thumb made contact with the swing of Mo Vaughn's bat. He fractured his right thumb and underwent surgery the next day. This injury caused him to miss the rest of the season. Rodríguez appeared in just 91 games, which was the fewest that he appeared in since his first season in the league, 1991. His nine home runs in April matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with Alex Rodriguez (2002), Carl Everett (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2007). Even though he was injured, he was still named to the second-team of Baseball America's Major League Baseball All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the drive, Tennessee {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty, pushing the Volunteers back toward their goal line. A Tennessee rush was stopped for no gain, then Stewart picked up eight yards on a running play. Needing eight yards for a first down, Manning threw an 11-yard pass to Kent for the first down. On the next play, Manning completed a 43-yard toss to Kent, driving the Volunteers into the Virginia Tech half of the field. Manning's next throw was a 35-yard touchdown <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> Marcus Nash. The extra point was good, and Tennessee took a 140 lead with 1:08 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Running back Dwayne Thomas gained six {{yards on}} the first play, then earned a first down at the 30-yard line on an option play. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Druckenmiller completed a nine-yard <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> Still. Tech committed a false-start penalty on third down, but the Hokies made up the penalty and earned a first down when Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings at the Texas 45-yard line. On the first play after the completion, Druckenmiller was sacked for a one-yard loss. A second-down pass was dropped, a third-down pass was incomplete, and the Hokies punted again.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at their}} 20-yard line after the touchback, Florida State's first play was a five-yard rush by running back Travis Minor. Quarterback Chris Weinke then {{completed}} a three-yard pass to wide receiver Peter Warrick, who was {{stopped short of}} the first down. After the next play failed to gain positive yardage, the Seminoles were forced to punt. Virginia Tech's offense began their second series after a short punt return to the 31-yard line. After an incomplete pass from Vick, Stith picked up a Tech first down with two running plays. From their 43-yard line, Tech executed an end-around for a first down. Florida State also committed a five-yard facemask penalty that pushed Tech to the Seminoles' 40-yard line. Tech was stopped for losses on subsequent plays and committed a five-yard false start penalty, but Vick completed an 18-yard pass to Davis for a first down, making up the losses. Tech was unable to make good the losses accumulated on the next three plays, when Vick was sacked after throwing two incomplete passes. Tech punted, the ball rolled into the end zone, and Florida State's offense began again at its 20-yard line. Weinke threw two incomplete passes before connecting on a first-down <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> wide receiver Ron Dugans. On the next play, Weinke connected on a 64-yard <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> Warrick for a Florida State touchdown and the first points of the game. The extra point attempt was successful, and Florida State took a 70 lead with 3:22 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{scoreless}} {{through the first}} two innings. Detroit took a three-run lead {{in the third inning}} which started when Curtis Granderson walked, advanced on a ground out, and scored on a single by Magglio Ordóñez to center field. Ordóñez was then brought home via a two-run home run by Tigers' first baseman Miguel Cabrera. The Twins responded {{in the bottom of the}} inning, with Matt Tolbert singling to lead off the inning, advancing to second base on a single by Denard Span, and then moving to third on a flyball out. Tigers' starter Rick Porcello attempted a pickoff <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> first which hit the baserunner Span and went past the first baseman Cabrera. Span was out but Tolbert was able to score on Porcello's throwing error.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} quarter with {{a first down}} at its 29-yard line. After Williams carried the ball for a four-yard gain, Taylor {{completed}} a 14-yard pass to Andre Smith for a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. Two plays gained only one yard, then Taylor completed a 46-yard <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> Coale for a first down at the Florida State 6-yard line. Three plays later, Taylor ran five yards into the end zone, finishing an 11-play, 82-yard drive that spanned two quarters. Tech increased its margin to 41–24, but as Virginia Tech attempted the extra point, Florida State's Nigel Bradham disrupted and blocked the kick. Bradham scooped up the loose ball and returned it {{the length of the}} field to the opposite end zone for an unusual defensive two-point conversion.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's third {{drive of}} the quarter started from its 23-yard line. The first two plays of the drive were stopped for {{negative}} gain, then Taylor completed a 17-yard <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> Jarret Boykin for a first down. Tech couldn't gain another first down, however, and punted to Stanford, which started from its 13-yard line. As in Virginia Tech's previous drive, the Stanford offense began with a play that lost yardage, but it made up the failure with a running play that gained sixyards and a passing play from Luck to Fleener for a first down at the Stanford 32-yard line. On the quarter's final play, running back Tyler Gaffney gained sevenyards. With one quarter remaining, Stanford led 26–12.|$|E
5|$|After a one-minute {{break between}} periods, the third {{overtime}} began with another jump ball that was won by Chamberlain. After King missed the opening {{shot of the}} period, Carolina's Kearns made a right handed layup to bring the score to 50–48. Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being fouled, but then made both free throws. Off of a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was fouled, and made the ensuing free <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was fouled after being trapped in a double team and then missed the first shot of the one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close layup, but King got the offensive rebound and was fouled on a put back shot. King made one of the free throws and tied the score at 5252.|$|E

5|$|Alabama {{received}} Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, which {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback. Because of the touchback, Alabama's first drive of the quarter started at its 20-yard line. The first play of that drive resulted in a five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech. Alexander then was tackled for a one-yard loss. On second down, Zow threw an incomplete pass, but on third down he completed a 34-yard <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> Alexander, who earned a first down at the Tech 42-yard line. On the first play in Alabama territory, Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty. Zow then threw two incomplete passes, and on third down he was sacked by the Tech defense at the Hokie 41-yard line. Because the Tide was trailing Tech by four scores, Alabama head coach Mike DuBose ordered his offense to try to convert the fourth down rather than punt. Zow's pass flew incomplete, and Alabama turned the ball over on downs.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Adams {{created the}} concept of the shortstop position, {{according}} to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> the three infielders. With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved toward the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving empty space in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.|$|E
5|$|Because Miami {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. After Miami's kickoff and a touchback, Tech began the first possession {{of the second half}} at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a quick first down off a rush each by Lawrence, Dovel, and Casey. Lawrence picked up another with two rushes that resulted in 13 yards and drove the Hokies to their 44-yard line. There, Casey completed his longest pass of the game — a 42-yard <b>throw</b> <b>to</b> tight end Rob Purdham — that gave Tech a first down at the Miami 14-yard line. Tech continued to drive, picking up short yardage with multiple rushes. The Hokies suffered a near-disaster when Lawrence fumbled the ball, but Tech retained possession when the ball rolled out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays after the fumble, Lawrence vaulted over the goal line for Tech's first and only touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech cut Miami's lead to 1410 with 8:52 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
