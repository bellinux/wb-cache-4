5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>of</b> the ōpuhe; however, {{it is unlikely that}} its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and {{it may have been a}} snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction and the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
