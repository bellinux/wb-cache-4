5|$|Equally, Gaudí {{stood out}} as {{interior}} decorator, decorating {{most of his}} buildings personally, from <b>the</b> <b>furnishings</b> to the smallest details. In each case {{he knew how to}} apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office {{at the beginning of his}} career to <b>the</b> <b>furnishings</b> designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batlló and Milà houses, of the Güell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Família. It is noteworthy that Gaudí studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at Gaudi House Museum.|$|E

5|$|Anne's daughter, Margaret, married John Tufton, the Earl of Thanet.

5|$|In April 1885, the Cosmos Club {{considered}} {{purchasing the}} house from the Tayloe family.

5|$|In 1636 {{the space}} beneath the south west tower became a bishop's consistory court. It was {{furnished}} as such at that time, {{and is now}} a unique survival in England, hearing its last case, that of an attempted suicide of a priest, in the 1930s. Until 1881, the south transept, which is unusually large, also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity: the parish church of St Oswald. Although the 17thcentury saw additions to <b>the</b> <b>furnishings</b> and fittings, there was no further building work for several centuries. By the 19thcentury, the building was badly in need of restoration. The present homogeneous appearance that the cathedral presents from many exterior angles is largely the work of Victorian restorers, particularly George Gilbert Scott.|$|E
5|$|In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion {{in which}} Somerset people fought against James II.

They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil.

5|$|The {{estate was}} first {{opened to the}} public in 1953 by Albert, to {{mitigate}} against taxation, and Althorp had its own railway station called Althorp Park on the Northampton Loop Line until 1960. After his death in 1975, Albert passed Althorp to his son Edward John, 8th Earl Spencer, who had served as Equerry to King George VI (1950–52) and to Queen Elizabeth II (1952–54). Edward was a wine connoisseur and had an extensive wine cellar at Althorp. He made his own wine and attracted fellow connoisseurs {{from around the world to}} Althorp, although he did not sell much of it. During Edward's ownership of Althorp approximately 20% of <b>the</b> <b>furnishings</b> of Althorp were sold off. The divestment included eleven Van Dykes and nearly every religious painting in the collection, as well as estate housing, and drew severe public criticism, including from the heir.|$|E

5|$|As Renaissance styles survived {{late in the}} city, the {{appearance}} of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at {{the centre of the}} development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, {{but by the end of}} the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in <b>the</b> <b>furnishings</b> of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Magi (1748–50) is the work of Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The earliest two-towered Baroque church was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of Košice and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town. The Baroque Bánffy Palace (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in {{the appearance}} of the principal façade.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the Cliffords began {{spending}} more time at their other castles, particularly Skipton Castle in Yorkshire. Brougham descended through several generations of Cliffords, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, {{it was in a}} state of disrepair, as George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland was {{spending more}} time in southern England due to his role as Queen's Champion. The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King James I of England was entertained there in 1617. In 1643, Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estates, including the castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Brough, and set about restoring them. Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time, after Lady Anne's death in 1676; however, Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, who had inherited the Clifford estates, sold <b>the</b> <b>furnishings</b> in 1714. The empty shell was left to decay, as it was too costly to maintain. As a ruin, Brougham Castle inspired a painting by J. M. W. Turner, and was mentioned at the start of William Wordsworth's poem The Prelude, as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth's Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors. The castle was left to the Ministry of Works, in the 1930s, and is today maintained by its successor, English Heritage.|$|E
