One should also check whether there are no systematic differences between the schools in the number of students reaching the attainment targets.

For this purpose, background questionnaires are administered to the students, the parents, and the teachers of the schools participating in <b>the</b> Flemish <b>national</b> <b>assessment.</b> In <b>the</b> present paper, the results of multilevel analyses <b>of</b> some recent <b>national</b> <b>assessments</b> will be discussed.
