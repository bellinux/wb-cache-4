5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her a week before <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> had {{said that she was}} going to Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|The suspect list {{drawn up}} by Nove's team {{included}} Nicholas Jacobs, who would be tried for <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> acquitted in 2014, based on the statements gathered during the second investigation.

5|$|In October 2011, Heywood {{reportedly}} had {{a business}} dispute with Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, when he demanded a higher commission for his services.

Heywood was then allegedly poisoned by Gu and an assistant. Gu would be convicted of <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> receive a suspended death sentence in August 2012.|$|E

5|$|Leigh's family {{opposed the}} fictionalisation of her murder, though {{protests against the}} film were {{abandoned}} after it received financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office. Blackrock was filmed {{over a period of}} two weeks at locations including Stockton, where Leigh was murdered, a decision that was opposed by local residents who said that memories of the murder were still fresh. While the film was never marketed as being based on a true story, numerous comparisons between <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> the film were made, and many viewers believed it to be a factual account of the murder.|$|E
5|$|Marceau splits {{her time}} between seeing to {{the duties of}} the train (such as helping to fix the heat in the engine), {{interviewing}} passengers about <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>and</b> examining the train and surrounding area for clues. She travels to several additional locations that Poirot does not travel to in the book, such as the engine, the baggage car, and an old shack outside of the snowed in train. Additionally, a sabotaged ham radio is in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Poirot's nephew and ask him to research the passengers.|$|E

5|$|Power {{told the}} police that the letter had been written by Williams and that Williams had tried to burgle Sztaray's house and killed Inspector Walls. According to Power, Williams met with his girlfriendFlorence Seymourafter <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>and</b> the two decided to bury the gun {{on the beach and}} send a letter to Williams' brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Power. Power's motive in coming to the police was that {{he was in love with}} Seymour.|$|E
5|$|Richard Ferguson QC, for the defence, {{argued that}} the ESDA test, which {{suggested}} that the disputed words had {{been added to the}} notes later, was not reliable. The defence also produced 14 witness statements from the two Blakelock inquiries, seven of them excerpts from Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry and seven from the original investigation in 1985, the latter read out to the jury as statements H to N. One of the 1985 statements said that Silcott had been carrying a knife with a two-foot-long blade on the night of <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>and</b> that he had attacked Blakelock.|$|E
5|$|The crime gained {{national}} notoriety for the particularly brutal way {{in which}} Pryce was murdered, only metres from his own home, and had only his Oyster card and mobile phone taken from him, but no money (the case being widely reported {{as an example of}} steaming). The murderers were later tracked down when the police examined CCTV footage of where the Oyster card was used after the murder. The crime caused a political uproar and condemnation of railway station security. The Tom ap Rhys Pryce Memorial Trust was set up after <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>and</b> a school was built in his honour.|$|E
50|$|Hunter was {{the only}} man to be fully trialed for <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> <b>and</b> on August 17, 1910, the jury convicted him of <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> court sentenced him to death by hanging. On December 22, 1911, Hunter’s sentenced was reduced from hanging to a life in prison, and on October 27, 1923, he was granted a pardon by Governor Clifford Walker and {{returned}} to Savannah.|$|R

5|$|There {{were several}} {{bystanders}} who witnessed <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> managed {{to see the}} faces of the assassins, including Juan Manuel Bautista, a colleague of Buendía; Rogelio Barrera Galindo, a man who had parked his vehicle close to the journalist's; and Felipe Flores Fernández, a bus driver. Among the first to arrive at the murder scene was José Antonio Zorrilla Pérez, then-head of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's equivalent of the FBI, and one of Buendía's main sources for his political publications. Photos of Buendía's corpse circulated across Mexico {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E

After being told there were no suspects yet, he called for his horse and began his return trip of four days to Bowling Green. Arriving, he told his wife Anna that Sharp was dead. The next morning, a posse from Frankfort arrived and told Beauchamp that he was under suspicion for the murder. He agreed to return with the men to Frankfort and face the charge.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which {{may lead to the}} murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire clues to lead to the solution of <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>and</b> retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E
5|$|A third subplot centres on the {{relationship}} between Fenwick, Mr. Puddleham, the village's Methodist minister, and the Marquis of Trowbridge, Bullhampton's principal landowner. The marquis believes that Sam Brattle is guilty of <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>and</b> is angered by Fenwick's support for him. He spreads rumours about Fenwick's relations with Carry Brattle, and grants Puddleham permission to build a chapel on a piece of land neighbouring Fenwick's residence, where he hopes that the sight of it and the sound of its bell will annoy the vicar. Fenwick tries to reconcile himself to the existence of the chapel, but it subsequently comes to light that the land does not belong to the marquis, and is instead part of the parish's glebe. The embarrassed marquis pays to move the chapel to a new location, and through the intervention of his son, a suave Member of Parliament, he and Fenwick are reconciled.|$|E

5|$|Alice Nutter {{was unusual}} among the accused in being {{comparatively}} wealthy, {{the widow of}} a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her {{plea of not guilty}} to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>and</b> Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama {{tries to}} track her down using her résumé, but as Yoshikawa warned, {{all of the}} {{contacts}} are dead ends. At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E
5|$|As Doggett {{approaches}} {{the body of}} Jeb's latest victim, he has a flashback of when he found Luke's body. Doggett storms off, but Reyes refuses to let it go, finally revealing her theory: she believes that the boy's murder {{was part of a}} “thread of evil,” an interconnected series of terrible events. Meanwhile, Katha returns home with her daughter and finds Jeb there. He insists that it wasn't him who committed <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> <b>and</b> pleads to his sister for help. Katha calls the agents and tries to separate her daughter from Jeb, but he realizes what she is planning and uses his niece as a hostage. Before Jeb can shoot Doggett, Reyes incapacitates him with a round to the throat.|$|E
