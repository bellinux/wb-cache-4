40|$|ABSTRACT: Bovine {{respiratory}} diseases (BRD) affect production rates negatively {{because it}} compromise {{health and well-being}} of the affected animal. The hypothesis of this study was that the use of metaphylactic protocols based on the risk to develop BRD would reduce morbidity and pulmonary lesions. For this purpose, the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of two metaphylactic protocols on the morbidity of feedlot cattle with a known sanitary history, occurrence of pulmonary lesions at slaughter, and the possible participation of Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV- 1) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) in the development of BRD. An experimental study was designed in which 3, 094 adult, male, cattle, were grouped according to the risk to develop BRD: a) group without metaphylaxis (n= 2, 104), low-risk animals; b) metaphylaxis group with oxytetracycline (n= 789), moderate-risk animals; c) metaphylaxis group with <b>tildipirosin</b> (n= 201), high-risk animals. All cattle were immunized against pathogens associated with BRD (BoHV- 1, BVDV, BRSV, PI 3). The morbidity for BRD was 8. 2 % (253 / 3, 094); cattle within the moderate-risk group for BRD had the lowest frequency (6. 1 %), followed by high-risk animals with <b>tildipirosin</b> metaphylaxis (6. 5 %) and low-risk without metaphylaxis (9. 1 %) (P= 0. 019). At the abattoir, 1. 2 % of lungs with lesions were found. There was a difference (P= 0. 036) in the frequency of pulmonary lesions between healthy animals (1. 1 %) and those diagnosed with BRD (2. 8 %). Two agents associated with BRD were identified by PCR assays in the lungs (n= 37) of cattle: M. haemolytica (16. 2 %) and H. somni (5. 4 %). In addition, concomitant infections involving these pathogens were identified in the lungs of two steers. These results demonstrate that the use of metaphylactic protocols, based on the risk to develop BRD, reduces morbidity and pulmonary lesions in affected cattle. Furthermore, pulmonary lesions were more frequent in animals with a history of BRD...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} how resistance to macrolides is conferred in field isolates of Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica that lack previously identified resistance determinants for rRNAmethylation, efflux and macrolide-modifying enzymes. Methods: Isolates of P. multocida andM. haemolytica {{identified as being}} highly resistant (MICs. 64 mg/L) to the macrolides erythromycin, gamithromycin, tilmicosin, <b>tildipirosin</b> and tulathromycin were screened by multiplex PCR for the previously identified resistance genes erm(42),msr(E) andmph(E). Strains lacking these determinants were analysed by genome sequencing and primer extension on the rRNAs. Results: Macrolide resistance in one M. haemolytica isolate was conferred by the 23 S rRNA mutation A 2058 G; resistance in three P. multocida isolates were caused by mutations at the neighbouring nucleotide A 2059 G. In each strain, all six copies of the rrn operons encoded the respective mutations. There were no mutations in the ribosomal protein genes rplD or rplV, and no other macrolide resistance mechanism was evident. Conclusions: High-level macrolide resistance can arise from 23 S rRNA mutations in P. multocida and M. haemo-lytica despite their multiple copies of rrn. Selective pressures from exposure to different macrolide or lincosamide drugs presumably resulted in consolidation of either the A 2058 G or the A 2059 G mutation...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma (M.) bovis is {{frequently}} implicated in respiratory diseases of young cattle worldwide. Today, to combat M. bovis in Europe, only antimicrobial therapy is available, but often fails, leading to important economical losses. The antimicrobial susceptibility of M. bovis is {{not covered by}} antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks. The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify resistances that were acquired over the last 30 years in France and to determine their prevalence within comtemporary strains. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of 12 antimicrobials, considered active on M. bovis, were compared, using an agar dilution method, between 27 and 46 M. bovis isolates respectively obtained in 1978 – 1979 and in 2010 – 2012 from 73 distinct respiratory disease outbreaks in young cattle all over France. For eight antimicrobials, resistances were proven to be acquired over the period and expressed by all contemporary strains. The increase of the MIC value that inhibited 50 % of the isolates (MIC 50) was: i) substantial for tylosin, tilmicosin, tulathromycin and spectinomycin, from 2 to. 64, 2 to. 128, 16 to 128 and 4 to. 64 mg/mL, respectively, ii) moderate for enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, marbofloxacin and oxytetracycline, from 0. 25 to 0. 5, 0. 25 to 0. 5, 0. 5 to 1, 32 to. 32 mg/mL, respectively. No differences were observed for gamithromycin, <b>tildipirosin,</b> florfenicol and valnemulin with MIC 50 of 128, 128, 8,, 0. 03 mg/ mL, respectively. If referring to breakpoint MIC values published for respiratory bovine pathogens, all contemporary isolates would be intermediate in vivo for fluoroquinolones and resistant to macrolides, oxytetracycline, spectinomycin an...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine and PathobiologyBrad J. White and Robert L. LarsonBovine {{respiratory}} disease (BRD) {{is the most}} costly disease of cattle in US feedyards and diagnosis based on clinical signs of illness is challenging. Over the course of five independent studies we evaluated the precision of multiple observers assigning clinical illness scores (CIS) to calves with induced Mycoplasma bovis pneumonia. We also evaluated the accuracy of CIS in relation to lung lesions at necropsy. Agreement among observers over all five studies was slight ({kappa]= 0. 16; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 10 to 0. 24) and ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 21 for individual trials. The accuracy of CIS varied based on the pulmonary consolidation score chosen to represent a truly ill animal. Inflammation associated with BRD can lead to significant pulmonary damage and reduced lung function. Treatment for BRD frequently involves antimicrobial administration and occasionally non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We evaluated how calves experimentally challenged with Mannheimia haemolytica respond to treatment with flunixin meglumine, alone or {{in combination with the}} antimicrobial florfenicol. Individual calf response to bacterial pneumonia was highly variable in this study. None of the changes in serum biomarkers, CBC or chemistry parameters provided reliable indicators of the pulmonary inflammation associated with the mild severity of bronchopneumonia in our study. Metaphylaxis is frequently administered to manage the risk of BRD within cohorts of cattle. We evaluated the impact of metaphylactic antimicrobial administration 10 days prior to experimental Mannheimia haemolytica inoculation to mitigate pulmonary lesions. We found that calves receiving <b>tildipirosin</b> had less lung damage and fewer clinical signs of illness compared to calves treated with tulathromycin or saline. Finally, the ability to predict those animals that would not finish the production cycle normally would provide benefits in effectively managing cattle. We evaluated the ability of classification algorithms to accurately predict an individual calf’s outcome based on data available at first identification of and treatment for BRD. We found accuracy of classifiers was dependent on the data recorded by the feedyard and there are sub-groups of calves within feedyard populations where classifiers were highly accurate. These data suggest the importance of pairing the proper classifier with the data available...|$|E
