25|$|Systemic {{poisoning}} {{may occur}} if the bites are numerous. Exposure to bed bugs may trigger an asthma attack via {{the effects of}} airborne allergens although evidence of this association is limited. There is no evidence <b>that</b> <b>bed</b> bugs transmit infectious diseases even though they appear physically capable of carrying pathogens and this possibility has been investigated. The bite itself may be painful thus resulting in poor sleep and worse work performance.|$|E
25|$|One recent {{theory about}} bed bug reappearance in the US {{is that they}} never truly disappeared, but may {{have been forced to}} {{alternative}} hosts. Consistent with this is the finding <b>that</b> <b>bed</b> bug DNA shows no evidence of an evolutionary bottleneck. Furthermore, investigators have found high populations of bed bugs at poultry facilities in Arkansas. Poultry workers at these facilities may be spreading bed bugs, unknowingly carrying them to their places of residence and elsewhere after leaving work.|$|E

40|$|Boolean Expression Diagrams (BEDs) is a {{new data}} {{structure}} for representing and manipulating Boolean functions. BEDs are a generalization of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) {{that are capable of}} representing any Boolean circuit in linear space and still maintain many of the desirable properties of BDDs. This paper demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>BEDs</b> are well suited for solving the combinational logiclevel verification problem which is, given two combinational circuits, to determine whether they implement the same Boolean functions. Based on all combinational circuits in the ISCAS 85 and LGSynth 91 benchmarks, we demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>BEDs</b> outperform both standard BDD approaches and the techniques specifically developed to exploit structural similarities for efficiently solving the problem...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{investigate}} {{the relationship between the}} dips of seismic reflectors, which are used to define sequence boundaries, and the orientation (dip and dip direction) of bedding surfaces at core scales. Sequence boundaries from seismic data and lithostratigraphic boundaries from cores and logs are compared with the bedding orientations measured on borehole images of Miocene siliciclastic sediments at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 313 Site M 28. It is not surprising <b>that</b> <b>bedding</b> orientations show huge variations at scales that are too small to be detected on seismic profiles. However, changes of orientation defined as rotation between two successive intervals match the depths of approximately half of the seismic sequence boundaries. While they do not match boundaries between lithostratigraphic units, changes of orientation frequently correlate with maxima and minima in the gamma ray signal, suggesting that they are related to changes in depositional processes rather than to changes in lithology. This study suggests for the first time <b>that</b> <b>bedding</b> attitudes {{can be used as a}} stratigraphic tool at various scales from bed to bed across depth intervals of tens of meters...|$|R
