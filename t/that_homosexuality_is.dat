Also interviewed were psychiatrist Charles Socarides, who strongly advocated the position <b>that</b> <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> a mental disorder, and fellow psychiatrist Irving Bieber, who shared Socarides' opinion of homosexuality as pathology. Interspersed with these interview segments was footage, described as being in the cinéma vérité style, of the inside of a gay bar along with shots of hustlers working a street corner and a teenager being arrested in a public sex sting.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states <b>that</b> <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> not a pathology.|$|E

25|$|During the {{earliest}} parts of psychoanalytic history, analysts granted <b>that</b> <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> non-pathological in certain cases, and the ethical {{question of whether}} it ought to be changed was discussed. By the 1920s analysts assumed <b>that</b> <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> pathological and <b>that</b> attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion about changing <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> largely pessimistic. Those forms of <b>homosexuality</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> considered perversions were usually held to be uncurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition of the difficulty of achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric of analysts, some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.|$|R

25|$|Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? is a 1956 book by the {{psychoanalyst}} Edmund Bergler, {{in which}} the author argues <b>that</b> <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> a curable illness. Bergler denies <b>that</b> <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> caused by hormonal or other biological factors, the Oedipus complex, or having a dominant mother and a weak or absent father, instead attributing {{both male and female}} homosexuality to pre-Oedipal factors involving an unsolved masochistic conflict with the mother during the earliest period of infancy. According to Bergler, homosexuality in men reflects unconscious fear and hatred of women. Bergler argues that there are several different types of homosexuality, each with a distinct clinical profile. Bergler rejects the existence of bisexuality, maintaining that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals, and criticizes the work of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. He characterizes homosexual men as sexually promiscuous, and argues that this promiscuity is a result of their unsatisfying sex lives and masochistic craving for danger. Bergler argues against immediately repealing laws against homosexuality, though he suggests that such laws could perhaps be repealed in the future if other measures against homosexuality proved effective. Bergler proposes the publicizing of his ideas as a measure against homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of traditional Muslim scholars believe Shariah law opposes same-sex marriage and condemns same-sex sex. This is also the dominant view in modern Muslim societies.

25|$|In {{response}} to the statements relating to prosecutions of persons because of their sexual orientation, {{the head of the}} delegation said <b>that</b> <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> a purely private matter, with a long history in Senegal, and is not in itself a cause for prosecution. The prosecutions referred to occurred only when the homosexual relations took place in public and were of an obtrusive nature, therefore placing them in conflict with morality and religion. Concerning decriminalization, it is necessary to take account of the culture, and avoid exacerbating the rejection of homosexuals and endangering their lives.|$|E
25|$|Homosexual {{behavior}} is a ground for divorce, {{an act of}} sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one's ability to describe it.

To declare <b>that</b> <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> harmful {{is not to make}} new law but to reaffirm the old; {{to say that it is}} not harmful is to experiment with people's lives, particularly the lives of children.|$|E
