Jonathan Gray wrote in Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality that The Poke of Zorro [...] "ridicules the outlandishness of Hollywood blockbuster fare," [...] especially its [...] "blatant historical inaccuracies" [...] which sees the film feature Zorro, King Arthur, the Three Musketeers, the Scarlet Pimpernel, [...] "the Man in the Iron Mask and ninjas in nineteenth century Mexico". The Buzz Cola advertisement shown before The Poke of Zorro is a parody of the opening Normandy invasion sequence from the film Saving Private Ryan (1998). Gray writes that it [...] "scorns the proclivity of ads to use any gimmick to grab attention, regardless of the ethics: as an indignant Lisa asks incredulously, 'Do <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?'" ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{there were}} two hours of intense misery in that house,--of misery to all who were concerned. The servants, down to {{the girl in the}} scullery and the boy who cleaned the boots, were made aware that master and {{mistress}} were both determined to keep their married daughter a prisoner in the house. The servants of the house sided with their mistress generally, having all of them been induced to regard John Caldigate with horror. Hester's nurse, of course, sympathised with her and her baby. During these two hours the packing was completed, but Hester found that her strong walking-boots and her bonnet had been abstracted. Did <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that at such a time as this boots and bonnets would be anything to her? They could know nothing of her nature. They could not understand the sort of combat she would carry on if an attempt were made to take from her her liberty,--an attempt made by those who had by law no right to control her! When once she had learned what was being done she would not condescend to leave her room till the carriage should have come. That that would come punctually at twelve she was sure. Then she would go down without her bonnet and without her boots, and see whether any one would dare to stand in her way, as with her baby in her arms she would attempt to walk forth through the front door.|$|E

6000|$|Why women suffer these wrongs--why {{they do not}} insist {{in having}} their clothes made small enough for them I cannot conceive.

5000|$|Bob Levin, {{chief of}} {{marketing}} for the film, was caught by surprise when Emmerich insisted not to use full body images or head shots of Godzilla during the marketing, Levin stated, [...] "we got indications from them that <b>they</b> <b>really</b> didn‚Äôt <b>think</b> that the full figure Godzilla should be at all exposed prior {{to the release of}} the film.

[...] 300 companies signed an agreement not to show the full image of Godzilla before the film was released. Prior to principal photography, Emmerich filmed a teaser trailer, budgeted at $600,000, that featured Godzilla's foot crushing the skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex at a museum. It debuted a year before the film's release. A full trailer was later released with Starship Troopers.|$|R

There was also criticism about supposed Satanic content in media at that time, making the demonic nature of the antagonist of Ultima III and its picture on the box art an easy target. The official biographer of Richard Garriott, Shay Addams, wrote: [...] "He decided that if people were going to look for hidden meaning in his work when they didn't even exist, he would introduce ideas and symbols with meaning and significance he deemed worthwhile, to give them something <b>they</b> could <b>really</b> <b>think</b> about."
