5|$|Grand Forks International Airport (GFK, KGFK) {{is served}} by Delta Air Lines with several daily round trips to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport; and Allegiant Air, which {{operates}} flights {{a few times a}} week to Mesa, Arizona (Phoenix-Gateway), Sanford, Florida (Orlando-Sanford) and Las Vegas, Nevada. A new passenger terminal completed in early 2011, allowed more passengers <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> airport, improved circulation, added a baggage claim and addressed security and safety concerns. The airport was a major distribution center for FedEx, which conducts flights daily within the state and northern Minnesota. FedEx moved their flight operations to Fargo, ND on October 31, 2016. The airport is one of the busiest airports in the country, due in large measure to the presence of the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences of the University of North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|This fourth IARC {{mission was}} {{conducted}} at the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab using the McKenna MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) site, which replicates a complete German village created for war gaming when the main cold war threat was perceived <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Fulda Gap into Germany. The fourth mission was completed in 2008 with various teams having already demonstrated all of the required aerial robotic behaviors mandated by the fourth mission rules, except being able to demonstrate these behaviors seamlessly in under 15 minutes—a feat considered by the organizer and judges to be inevitable given a bit more time, and therefore no longer a significant challenge. Thus the fourth mission was terminated, $80,000 in awards distributed, and the fifth mission established.|$|E

25|$|While the {{majority}} of exposures have been shown <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> diet, accidental ingestion {{can also be considered}} a source of exposure.

While {{the results of this study}} have yet to be replicated, it gives reason to question whether exposure can also occur in infants through ingestion by chewing on certain books or toys.|$|E

25|$|Public sex of {{any kind}} is illegal {{in many parts of}} the world, and police {{undercover}} operations continue to be used in order to enforce such laws. Adverse personal consequences to participants in glory hole activity have included police surveillance, public humiliation in the press, often with marital and employment consequences, and imprisonment following a criminal conviction. Gay bashing, mugging, and bodily injury are further potential risks. For reasons of personal safety, as well as etiquette, men typically wait for a signal from the receptive partner <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hole before inserting any part of their genitals through a glory hole.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Wann {{stood in}} front of the jail and {{addressed}} the mob, saying he would kill the first person <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door. He removed his belt and handed his gun to one of his deputies. He walked through the mob and the crowd parted to let him through; Wann was not touched by anyone. He walked across the street to the courthouse where he telephoned Governor Benjamin M. Miller, who mobilized the Alabama Army National Guard to protect the jail. He took the defendants to the county seat of Gadsden, Alabama, for indictment and to await trial. Although rape was potentially a capital offense in Alabama, the defendants at this point were not allowed to consult an attorney.|$|E

25|$|January 2006 {{started with}} {{victories}} against Jonas Bjorkman and Davide Sanguinetti, but a quarterfinal loss to Tommy Haas at the Qatar Open This {{was followed by}} a first round defeat by Xavier Malisse at the Australian Open. However, Youzhny steadily improved by reaching the quarterfinals of the PBS Zabreb Indoors and then the semifinals of the Dubai Tennis Championships, defeating players such as Dominik Hrbatý and Igor Andreev on the way. He lost to world No. 1 Roger Federer. At the French Open Youzhny lost to Carlos Moyá in three sets. Youzhny reached the third round at Wimbledon but lost to Novak Djokovic in four sets.

This marked the first time in four attempts that Youzhny was able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fourth round of a Major. Later that year, on 25 October, Youzhny tore the ligaments in his right ankle and did not play {{for the rest of the}} season. Youzhny ended the season with a 25–21 win-loss record, and with a year-end ranking of twenty-four.|$|E

500|$|They {{decided to}} wait for the next man <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gate and ask him to make the decision.

Each of the clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and carried the Black Stone to the right spot. [...] Then, Muhammad set the stone in place, {{satisfying}} the honour of all of the clans. After his Conquest of Mecca in 630, Muhammad is said to have ridden round the Kaaba seven times on his camel, touching the Black Stone with his stick in a gesture of reverence.|$|E
500|$|In 1822, {{seeking more}} land {{in order to}} provide for their children's inheritance, the Jetté family sold their farm under a {{staggered}} payment arrangement whereby they would not have the full payment for three years. While waiting for the payments <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>through,</b> <b>the</b> Jettés lived in Vercheres, either in rented property or residing with relatives. Cadron-Jetté, Jean-Marie and their children were accompanied in the move by Rosalie's parents and Rosalie's sister Sophie. In 1823 they moved again to Saint Hyacinthe and in 1824 they bought land there from a Charles Jarret. However, they later discovered the seller did not own the relevant land, leading in late 1826 or early 1827 to the repossession {{of the majority of the}} Jetté family's property.

500|$|Root came {{to realise}} {{that while the}} novel's {{narrative}} style allowed Anne's thoughts <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>through,</b> <b>the</b> film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue. As a result, she [...] "had to cover pages and pages of the story without uttering anything, much of the time. I couldn't even think about technique, I just had to keep looking at the [...] and then somehow radiate the feelings". Persuasion was shot in chronological order, which allowed Root to see [...] "what a difference [...] sense of unhappiness can create", as {{by the end of}} the film Anne is [...] "happier and looks better". Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth. The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds, who depicted Frederick Wentworth, commented that Austen [...] "understands a man's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes". He also appreciated that, though Wentworth was a [...] "competent leader of men in his profession", he was [...] "socially inept" [...] in Anne's presence. Susan Fleetwood, the actress who played Lady Russell, had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia. She died soon after filming; Persuasion was her last film role.|$|E
