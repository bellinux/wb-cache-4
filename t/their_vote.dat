5|$|During Expo 58, {{a poll of}} over 100 film historians named Kane {{one of the top}} ten {{greatest}} films {{ever made}} (the group gave first-place honors to The Battleship Potemkin). When a group of young film directors announced <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> for the top six, they were booed for not including the film.|$|E
5|$|The 200 {{members of}} the {{parliament}} are elected using the proportional D'Hondt method through which voters cast <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> for a candidate of their choosing within a party list. Electoral alliances between parties were allowed but were less common for the parliamentary parties in this election as the parties were preparing for future electoral reform that would not provide for electoral alliances.|$|E
5|$|The {{order in}} which each country {{announced}} <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> was determined in a draw following the jury results from final dress rehearsal. Similar to the 2011 contest an algorithm was used to add as much excitement as possible. The spokespersons are shown alongside each country.|$|E

40|$|We {{study how}} {{changes in the}} {{barriers}} ex-felons face to restore <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights affect <b>their</b> political participation in Iowa. Prior to Executive Order 42, ex-felons were required to submit applications to request the restoration of <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights. We build an original dataset of who applied to have <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights restored and which of these applications were granted. These data reveal {{that only a small}} percentage of exfelons submitted applications. While most applications were granted, those submitted by individuals convicted of violent crimes, particularly sex crimes, were substantially more likely to be denied. The signing of Executive Order 42 in 2005 and Executive Order 70 in 2011 generates variation in whether ex-felons must submit applications to restore <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights. Our results show that eliminating applications increases ex-felon political participation, especially when ex-felons are notified that <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights are automatically restored...|$|R
5|$|The {{question}} of Warren's ancestry was pressed by the Brown campaign throughout the election. However, polls showed that most voters {{said that the}} controversy would not impact <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> in the election. Warren's 2014 autobiography devoted a section to the allegations, describing them as untrue and hurtful.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} loss of their land, local {{residents}} discovered that they had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, they had lost <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were too small to warrant a seat in the new federal parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote, managed to gain two seats, giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> to gain an additional two seats at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E
50|$|To prompt {{resolute}} voting decisions, in 2014, SEBI asked {{mutual funds}} {{to publish the}} rationale for <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> decision.

5|$|In 1880, {{the party}} {{nominated}} Thompson for vice president, joining a ticket headed by Neal Dow of Portland, Maine, {{the author of}} one of the nation's first municipal prohibition laws. Only twelve states sent delegates to the convention, and the platform they agreed on was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the evils of alcohol. The Prohibitionists increased <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> total in the election that year, but still received just over 10,000 votes out of more than nine million cast. Thompson made another bid for elected office in 1887, when the Prohibition Party nominated him for Governor of Ohio. He was again unsuccessful, netting {{less than one percent of}} the vote and finishing in a distant fifth place behind the winner, Democrat Richard M. Bishop. Thompson's vote total was also surpassed by the Republican candidate, William H. West, and the candidates of two other minor parties, the Workingman Party and the Greenback Party.|$|E
5|$|Like Daniel, most {{party members}} came from pietist churches, and most were former Republicans. Elected {{as the head}} of the Maryland branch of the party, he {{attended}} the 1884 Prohibition Party National Convention in Pittsburgh. After being selected as temporary chairman of the convention, the delegates chose Daniel to be nominated for vice president alongside the presidential nominee, John St. John. The party platform was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the alcohol problem. In the election that year, the Prohibition ticket fell far short of victory, as expected, but placed third with 1.5 percent of the vote—a marked improvement over the 0.1 percent the 1880 Prohibition candidates had received. Further, <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> total in New York—just over 25,000—was more than enough to throw the election in that state from James G. Blaine, the Republican, to Grover Cleveland, the Democrat. Because pro-temperance voters usually voted Republican, many historians credit St. John and Daniel with costing Blaine the election.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{players were}} chosen {{to be on the}} ballot for the All-Star Game (minimum of two players from each team), but fans were also given the option to write in any player who was not listed. Ballots were all digital for the fourth {{consecutive}} time, giving fans the ability to cast votes online at NHL.com and Facebook. Votes could also be cast via text messages from mobile devices and Smartphone users could vote by way of a mobile ballot feature. The NHL put no limitation on the number of votes an individual could cast. When fan balloting ended, 14.3 million votes had been cast and the top six were named to the All-Star Game. The six top vote recipients were from only two teams, the Pittsburgh Penguins (4) and Chicago Blackhawks (2). Individually, Sidney Crosby led all players with 635,509 votes, while teammate Kris Letang was elected as a write-in candidate. The six players elected by the fans are listed below with <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> totals.|$|E

5|$|The storm struck Florida in {{the midst}} of 1992 presidential {{election}} campaign. A poll conducted by CBS News in September showed that 65% of Dade County residents approved of Bush's handling of the disaster, while 61% of residents approved statewide. Despite the support of Bush's response and his proposal to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, he benefited little politically and trailed 48%–42% against Bill Clinton in another poll taken in September. Additionally, 75% of voters in Dade County and 82% of Floridians overall stated that the president's actions in response to Andrew would not impact <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> in November. Bush went on to carry the state of Florida, but by a margin of only 1.89%. The hurricane also impacted Governor Chiles politically. The state's response to the storm was perceived as poor, sinking Chiles' approval rating to 22%, while his disapproval rating rose to 76%. However, Chiles was able to recover prior to the 1994 gubernatorial election.|$|E

25|$|Following Chris Daughtry's elimination, many Idol fans claimed calls they dialed to Daughtry's line {{during the}} first few minutes of voting were misdirected. According to them, the first of his two numbers was {{answered}} by a recording of Katharine McPhee (who was also in the bottom two that night) giving thanks for <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> rather than Daughtry. Others reported similar behavior dialing other lines, such as dialing Elliott Yamin's line and hearing a recording of Daughtry giving thanks for <b>their</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{low rate}} of {{informal}} voting is largely attributed to advertising from the various political parties indicating how a voter should number their ballot paper, called a How-to-Vote Card. On election day, volunteers from political parties stand outside polling places, handing voters a card which advises them how to cast <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> for their respective party. Thus, if a voter wishes {{to vote for the}} Liberal Party, they may take the Liberal How-to-Vote Card and follow its instructions. While they can lodge <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> according to their own preferences, Australian voters show a high degree of party loyalty in following their chosen party's card.|$|E
