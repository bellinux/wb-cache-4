40|$|In {{this thesis}} the QCM (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) method {{was used to}} study beer properties. After {{necessary}} adjustments on the measuring apparatus the dependence of the output data on <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>used</b> sample was measured. The measuring apparatus was connected to computer with direct graphical output to the display. Model samples of alcohol, glucose, wort and glycerol with various concentrations were measured as well as few beer samples. The object {{of the work is}} to find out whether QCM method is applicable for determining the alcohol content and original gravity of beer and studying beer stability...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{differential}} scanning calorimetry (DSC) {{techniques are}} commonly used to quantify the solubility of drugs within polymeric-controlled delivery systems. However, {{the nature of the}} DSC experiment, and in particular the relatively slow heating rates employed, limit its use to the measurement of drug solubility at <b>the</b> drug's melting <b>temperature.</b> Here, we describe the application of hyper-DSC (HDSC), a variant of DSC involving extremely rapid heating rates, to the calculation of the solubility of a model drug, metronidazole, in silicone elastomer, and demonstrate that the faster heating rates permit the solubility to be calculated under non-equilibrium conditions such that the solubility better approximates that at <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> At a heating rate of 400 °C/min (HDSC), metronidazole solubility was calculated to be 2. 16 mg/g compared with 6. 16 mg/g at 20 °C/min. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) usually {{suffer from}} a too {{moderate}} quantum efficiency and too large dark current which is often announced as crippling for low flux applications. Despite this reputation we demonstrate the ability of QWIP for the low infrared photon flux detection. We present the characterization {{of a state of}} the art 14. 5 μ m QWIP from Alcatel-Thales 3 - 5 Lab. We developed a predictive model of the performance of an infrared instrument for a given application. The considered scene is a Cryogenic Wind Tunnel (ETW), where a specific Si:Ga camera is currently used. Using this simulation tool we demonstrate the QWIP ability to image a low temperature scene in this scenario. QWIP detector is able to operate at 30 K with a NETD as low as 130 mK. In comparison to the current detector, <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> is three times higher and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a QWIP based camera would allow a huge simplification of the optical part...|$|R
25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple <b>temperature</b> sensor. <b>The</b> outer controller controls <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water <b>using</b> a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between <b>the</b> desired bath <b>temperature</b> and measured <b>temperature.</b> Instead <b>of</b> controlling <b>the</b> heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater <b>temperature</b> goal for <b>the</b> inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heater <b>using</b> a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater <b>temperature</b> setpoint and <b>the</b> measured <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heater.
