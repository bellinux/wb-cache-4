An example of such bottom-up processes is the average social sensitivity or the average and maximum intelligence scores of group members. Furthermore, collective intelligence {{was found to be}} related to a group's cognitive diversity including <b>thinking</b> <b>styles</b> and perspectives. Groups that are moderately diverse in cognitive style have higher collective intelligence than those who are very similar in cognitive style or very different. Consequently, groups where members are too similar to each other lack the variety of perspectives and skills needed to perform well.

25|$|Sternberg & Lubart’s Investment Theory. Using {{the metaphor}} of a stock market, they {{demonstrate}} that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, <b>thinking</b> <b>styles,</b> personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence {{is just one of}} the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: The most {{important}} principles {{in an organization}} are continuous development and survival. Nowadays, creativity and innovation are vital for survival in a competitive world. The <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> of a manager in an organization {{is an important factor}} in his/her creativity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> and organizational innovation in 84 senior and junior managers of Shiraz educational hospitals in 2008. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study 84 top and mid-level managers of Shiraz teaching hospitals were selected by the census method. Data were collected using two standard questionnaires, one for <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> and one for innovation, the content validity and reliability of which had been confirmed. A preliminary test showed the Cronbachs alpha for the <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> and organizational questionnaires to be 0. 83 and 0. 72, respectively. Data analysis was performed using Spearman correlation test. Results: The Spearman correlation analysis showed a statistically significant, although weak, relationship between <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> of senior and junior managers of Shiraz teaching hospitals and their organizational innovation. A pragmatic <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> had the strongest association with organizational innovation. Conclusion: The <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> of a teaching hospital manager plays a vital role in his/her creativity. No <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> is particularly preferred; any <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> may give desirable results as regards creativity of a manger, depending on the circumstances and conditions...|$|R
40|$|Irwin and Young (2002), in {{line with}} {{previous}} findings, found a relationship between <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> and paranormal belief. This study built on their work by looking in more detail at {{the nature of the}} relationship between intuitive-experiential and analytical-rational <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> as described by Epstein, Pacini, Denes-Raj and Heier (1996) and paranormal belief. Paranormal belief was measured in two ways, using an explicit self-report measure (the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (Tobacyk, 2004)) scored according to Lange, Irwin and Houran’s (2000) recommendations, and an implicit association test developed in this study. <b>Thinking</b> <b>style</b> was manipulated using primes based on vignettes used by Epstein, Lipson, Holstein and Huh (1992). Two hundred and one participants completed the experiment online. Intuitive-experiential <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> was found to be related to New Age Philosophy (NAP) and Traditional Paranormal Belief (TPB), but no significant relationship was found between analytical-rational style and explicit paranormal belief. Some evidence was found that <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> may have been manipulated according to priming condition, but this was not conclusive. No relationship was found between manipulation of <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> and paranormal belief. The implicit measure of paranormal belief showed no relationship with the explicit measure and also no relationship with <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> or manipulation of <b>thinking</b> <b>style.</b> These findings are discussed with reference to experimental design, theory regarding association and dissociation between alternative measures of paranormal belief, measuring paranormal belief more generally and broader theories regarding the psychology of paranormal belief...|$|R

40|$|Paranormal beliefs {{often become}} {{stronger}} {{in times of}} stress. Such beliefs have also been found to vary in accordance with <b>thinking</b> <b>style,</b> whereby stronger beliefs are often observed in experiential thinkers. Little research, however, has explored the interaction between perceived stress and <b>thinking</b> <b>style.</b> 82 males and females aged 18 to 62 years (mean = 29. 96 ± 12. 53 years) completed measures of perceived stress, <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> (rational and experiential) and paranormal belief. The results revealed stronger beliefs in experiential thinkers, compared with those with a rational <b>thinking</b> <b>style.</b> Perceived stress alone, was not a prominent predictor of belief but the combination of stress and <b>thinking</b> <b>style,</b> specifically high perceived stress with a rational <b>thinking</b> <b>style,</b> significantly predicted greater global paranormal belief, belief in superstition, traditional religious belief, and belief in psi. High perceived stress appeared to facilitate belief in rational thinkers as conversely, belief was lowest in rational thinkers under conditions of low-perceived stress. These findings suggest that stress may lower the propensity for rational thinking and consequently, encourage belief in scientifically unsubstantiated phenomena. This interaction may have implications for coping during stressful situations...|$|R

Method: During this study 177 students from the 5 th and 6 th grades of 7 Dutch elementary schools were asked {{to fill out the}} My <b>Thinking</b> <b>Style</b> test (MTS) and several subtests of the NIO (Nederlandse Intelligentietest voor Onderwijsniveau), a Dutch IQ test that consists of six subtests: three concerning language skills and three concerning spatial awareness and numeracy skills. Students were grouped in three <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> categories: visual-spatial thinkers, auditory-sequential thinkers or no preference for either <b>thinking</b> <b>style.</b> NIO scores were used to group students into intelligence categories: low-ability, average-ability, high-ability and gifted students. Gifted students were classified based on a diagnosis for giftedness. Intelligence scores and school results were compared to measure the degree of underachievement. Results: <b>Thinking</b> <b>style</b> does not appear to predict giftedness; factors that predict a diagnosis for giftedness are intelligence, school results and age (p <. 001). Intelligence and to an extent also <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> influence school results (p <. 001), but not underachievement (p =. 064). Gifted students underachieve significantly more than non-gifted students (p =. 025). No interaction between giftedness and <b>thinking</b> <b>style</b> preference was found (p =. 675).
