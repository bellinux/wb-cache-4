5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missile</b> launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher.|$|E
5|$|Originally, 300 AMX-30s {{were ordered}} by the French Army, and by 1971 the order had been {{increased}} to 900, divided between eight batches, including all variants based on the chassis. Beginning in 1966, ten AMX-30s were assembled per month, and the first five were issued in August 1966 to the 501st Régiment de Chars de Combat. Monthly production grew to 15–20 tanks as new factories began to manufacture components of the vehicle and existing factories increased their production potential. However, in April 1969, production was again reduced to ten per month. By 1971, about 180 vehicles were in service; in 1975 delivery began of the last 143 units of the final eighth batch of the original order. In 1985, the number of AMX-30s had risen to 1,173. By the end of production, France had accepted 1,355 AMX-30s into service, including 166 brand-new AMX-30B2s. Another 493 tanks were refitted and modernized to AMX-30B2 standards; originally 271 new and 820 refitted vehicles had been planned. The French Army also accepted {{a large number of}} variants, including 195 self-propelled howitzers, 44 AMX-30 Pluton <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missile</b> launchers, 183 AMX-30Rs, 134 AMX-30Ds and 48 engineer vehicles (AMX-30EBG).

25|$|A month later, Soviet forces {{launch a}} {{offensive}} towards Fort Teller, {{a military base}} located within the Cascade Mountains, in order to disable the United States' Strategic Defense Initiative project, unaware {{that it had been}} a failure. The U.S. had concealed this knowledge to ensure the Soviets would not attempt a nuclear strike. Parker, Sawyer and Bannon, joined by Captain Webb, engage in a series of delaying battles en route to the town of Cascade Falls near the Fort, before forming a defensive line within the town. Learning that the advance is not stopping, Sawyer orders the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the area, then launches a <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missile</b> at the town. Bannon, remorseful over mistakes made earlier in the war and seeking redemption, sacrifices himself and his company to pin down Soviet forces, allowing Sawyer to withdraw the rest of his forces. The resulting nuclear blast eliminates Bannon and his company, along with the Soviet forces in the town, successfully halting the assault.|$|E
500|$|The AMX-30 has {{a number}} of {{different}} variations, including a number of other armoured vehicles based on the same chassis. A simplified version of the tank, without the infra-red searchlight and periscopes and a less complex commander's cupola was developed for export, known as the [...] "basic AMX-30". This version also came devoid of the pressurized air filtering system, and moved the smaller [...] machine gun into the coaxial position and the larger [...] M2 to the turret roof. Another version was considered for the French Army, adopting a [...] tank gun able to fire the supersonic [...] (Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé) anti-tank guided missile, as well as high explosive rounds. A prototype was finished in 1967 with a new cast turret, wide enough to hold the much larger armament. However, the high costs of the missiles forced the French Army to abandon the program in 1972. The vehicles based on the chassis include an armoured recovery vehicle, a bridgelayer, a self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle, a <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missile</b> launcher and a self-propelled artillery piece.|$|E
500|$|Three missile {{systems were}} {{developed}} to be mounted on the AMX-30 chassis. Recognizing the need for <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missile</b> mobile launchers, the French Army began developing the Pluton missile in 1963. In 1964, the program was suspended and instead the French Army opted for a missile with a longer range, able to be mounted on the AMX-30. A contract to develop the system was established in 1968. The first prototype was soon delivered and testing occurred between July and August 1970, followed by {{the production of a}} second prototype in 1971. Two more prototypes were fabricated in 1972. The next year, the vehicle was put into mass production and by 1 May 1974 four of these vehicles had been delivered to the 3rd Artillery Regiment. The missile itself weighs [...] and is [...] long. Using a simplified inertial guidance system and a solid propellant rocket motor, the Pluton has a maximum range of [...] The second missile system is the AMX-30R (Roland) surface-to-air missile launching system, which began development in 1974. Five vehicles of a pre-series were completed by 1977 and then evaluated, prompting the order of 183 vehicles that same year. The Roland includes a rectangular superstructure, taller than that of both the AMX-30D and the Pluton, which houses the radar system and mounts two launching tubes on either side, with an autoloading system feeding from an eight missile reserve inside the superstructure. The Roland's exploration radar has a detection range of [...] The third missile system, called the AMX-30SA, was developed in 1975 for Saudi Arabia, to fire the SA-10 Shahine, developed and manufactured by Thomson-CSF; the launching vehicle was heavily based on the AMX-30R.|$|E

50|$|In 1950, Tactical Air Command (TAC) was {{designated}} as the Air Force major command (MAJCOM) for <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missiles,</b> and was given the responsibility for training new missile crews. The B-61A Matador, an aerodynamic tactical missile, was under development by Air Research and Development Command at Patrick AFB and Cape Canaveral AFS, Florida. Two TAC missile squadrons, the 1st and 69th Pilotless Bomber Squadrons were attached to ARDC at Patrick AFB beginning in 1951 and 1952. They were then reassigned to the Ninth Air Force in 1954, but remained at Patrick AFB prior to their deployment to West Germany as part of NATO.|$|R

50|$|A {{series of}} {{paintings}} which Kiefer executed between 1980 and 1983 depict looming stone edifices, referring to famous examples of National Socialist architecture, particularly buildings designed by Albert Speer and Wilhelm Kreis. The grand plaza in To the Unknown Painter (1983) specifically refers to the outdoor courtyard of Hitler's Chancellery in Berlin, designed by Speer in 1938 {{in honor of the}} Unknown Soldier. In 1984-85, he made a series of works on paper incorporating manipulated black-and-white photographs of desolate landscapes with utility poles and power lines. Such works, like Heavy Cloud (1985), were an indirect response to the controversy in West Germany in the early 1980s about NATO's stationing of <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missiles</b> on German soil and the placement of nuclear fuel processing facilities.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the north}} {{west of the}} island at (...) , a missile testing range was built in 1957-58 to launch the Corporal missile, Britain and America's first guided nuclear weapon. This {{development}} went ahead despite significant protests, some locals expressing concern that the Scottish Gaelic language would not survive the influx of English-speaking Army personnel. The British Government claimed {{that there was an}} 'overriding national interest' in establishing a training range for their newly purchased Corporal, a weapon that was to be at the front line of Cold War defence. The Corporal missile was tested from 1959 to 1963, before giving way to Sergeant and Lance <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missiles.</b> The 'rocket range' as it is known locally has also been used to test high altitude research rockets, Skua and Petrel. Local opposition to the range inspired the 1957 novel Rockets Galore by Compton Mackenzie.|$|R
50|$|Green Cheese was a British-made radar-guided anti-ship <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> warhead <b>missile</b> {{project of}} the 1950s. It was {{developed}} by Fairey Aviation {{to be used by}} the Fairey Gannet shipborne anti-submarine warfare aircraft, and was originally called Fairey Project 7. However, the missile's 3,800 lb (1720 kg) weight proved to be too heavy for the Gannet, and would have required modifications to the Gannet's bomb bay to expose the missiles' seeker heads to the target before launch. The missile project continued, since the Blackburn Buccaneer naval strike aircraft had a rotating bomb bay which was ideally suited to the task.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 the Corporal missile {{had been}} adopted by the Royal Artillery as a {{battlefield}} <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missile.</b> This missile was liquid-fuelled, thus requiring a large convoy of support vehicles to prepare it slowly for launch. It also required continual command guidance in flight, yet only achieved relatively poor accuracy. Also in use within the Royal Artillery was the Honest John rocket. This was solid-fuelled and could be launched rapidly, but was unguided and had only short range. There was a clear requirement for a missile that would combine guidance and long range with rapid deployment and easy operation.|$|E

His strength, reflexes and endurance have all been enhanced by his armor and he can fly at sub-sonic speeds. The suit is also air conditioned to prevent discomfort for the operator. The Firepower armor contains a vast array of sensors and an impressive array of weapons including four back-mounted surface-to-air missiles (and additional missiles mounted on leg hardpoints), chest-mounted heat beam lasers, mini-grenades and arm-mounted concussive cannons. The armor can also fire a small <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missile</b> known as Terminax from a back-mounted launch tube.

2500|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, LeMay clashed {{again with}} U.S. President John F.

Kennedy secretly agreed to remove US missiles from Turkey and Italy. Unknown to the US, the Soviet field commanders in Cuba had been given authority to launch nuclear weapons under their controlthe only time such authority was delegated by higher command. They had at least 20 nuclear warheads for medium-range R-12 Dvina (NATO Code SS-4 Sandal) ballistic missiles capable of reaching US cities (including Washington DC), each carrying a one megaton warhead (equivalent to 50 Hiroshima bombs), and nine <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missiles.</b> [...] A Soviet submarine flotilla in the area commanded by Kapitan (later Vice Admiral) Vasili Arkhipov had nuclear torpedoes. [...] Because a US Navy surface flotilla was harassing the Soviet submarines with small depth charges, both the flagship's captain and its Zampolit, believing that war had started, voted to launch their nukes. [...] But Captain Arkhipov, a veteran of the K-19 disaster, voted to wait and see, thus averting World War III. If the Soviet officers on land and at sea had chosen to launch, many millions of US citizens could have been killed. The ensuing SAC retaliatory thermonuclear strike would have killed roughly one hundred million Soviet citizens. Kennedy refused LeMay's requests, and the naval blockade was successful.|$|R
5000|$|Still, {{strategic}} problems {{remain in}} other areas. Other nations {{have engaged in}} policies that are regarded as potentially destabilizing. Officials in the People's Republic of China recently tested an anti-satellite missile, leading to widespread international concern, as anti-satellite missiles are viewed as threats to nuclear-launch warning systems, which could facilitate a first strike; further, tensions amid the Chinese governments over Taiwan have been rife in recent years; in addition, the PRC is reportedly pursuing modernization of their nuclear forces. Israel has made threats {{of the use of}} weapons, including those of a non-conventional character, while the former administration in the U.S. has refused to [...] "take options off the table" [...] (including the [...] "nuclear option"), in the nuclear dispute with Iran, who is suspected of pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. The North Korean government has tested a nuclear device, and has historically threatened to turn Seoul into a [...] "sea of fire", or most recently, [...] "ashes", in response to unspecified, but always imminent, U.S. or South Korean [...] "aggression" [...] against it. The foreign relations of Pakistan and India remain unstable, and are exacerbated by Pakistan's poor history of nuclear proliferation, as well as the rise of radical Al-Qaeda Islamism in Pakistan. Pakistan's development of <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missiles</b> for use against possible Indian aggression, and the subsequent Indian response, has lowered the threshold for nuclear weapons deployment and created an even more tense situation.|$|R

In addition, he suffers from a moody captain and unwanted attention from beautiful young Susan Beresford, traveling with her immensely wealthy family. However, when the Campari sails after a succession of delays attributable to sabotage that he realizes something is seriously wrong. A member of the crew is suddenly missing and the unsuccessful stem-to-stern search only increases tension.

50|$|For example, {{firing a}} low-yield nuclear {{artillery}} shell {{similar to the}} W48 (with a yield equivalent to 72 tons of TNT) at the enemy invites retaliation. It may provoke the enemy into responding with several nuclear artillery shells similar to the W79, which had a 1 kiloton yield. The response to these 1 kiloton nuclear artillery shells may be to retaliate by firing a <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missile</b> similar to a French Pluton (15 kiloton yield), Russian OTR-21 Tochka (100 kiloton yield) or the American MGM-52 Lance, fitted with a W70 variable yield warhead ranging between 1 and 100 kilotons. By using tactical nuclear weapons {{there is a high}} risk of escalating the conflict until it reaches a tipping point which provokes the use of strategic nuclear weapons such as ICBMs. Additionally, the tactical nuclear weapons most likely to be used first (i.e., the smallest, low-yield weapons such as nuclear artillery dating from the 1960s) have usually been under less stringent political control at times of military combat crises than strategic weapons. Early Permissive Action Links could be as simple as a mechanical combination lock. If a relatively junior officer in control of a small tactical nuclear weapon (e.g., the M29 Davy Crockett) were in imminent danger of being overwhelmed by enemy forces, he could request permission to fire it and due to decentralised control of warhead authorization, his request might quickly be granted during a crisis.|$|E
5000|$|The BS-1 [...] "Tishina" [...] (Silence) grenade {{launching}} {{system is}} one of the most interesting and impressive weapons that were developed for Soviet Spetsnaz (Soviet Army Special Operations forces). This system was adopted in the 1970s, to replace previously used stand-alone silenced / flash and noiseless 30mm grenade launchers known as [...] "Device D" [...] and [...] "Device DM". The idea behind [...] "noiseless"grenade launcher was to hide the sound and flash of the grenade launch and thus give the shooter (and his comrades) more chances to escape after a successful diversion behind enemy lines; the main targets for Spetsnaz during the Cold War were <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>missile</b> launchers, C&C installations and equipment, fuel and ammunition storage facilities and parked tactical aircraft. The original BS-1 system included the 7.62×39mm Kalashnikov AKMS assault rifle with PBS-1 silencer, subsonic 7.62×39mm US ammunition, 30mm GSN-19 under barrel grenade launcher and grenade launching sight. When, during the late 1970s, the Soviet army switched over to 5.45×39mm ammunition, 7.62mm AKMS assault rifles with PBS-1 silencer were replaced with 5.45mm AKS-74UB compact assault rifles with PBS-4 silencers. The original GSN-19 grenade launcher was slightly reworked, mainly to use different launching ammunition (based on 5.45mm rather than 7.62mm blanks). Other changes include different mounting brackets to better suit AKS-74UB compact assault rifles. These weapons are still in limited use with Spetsnaz elements of the Russian army and probably some other armies of ex-USSR countries.|$|E
