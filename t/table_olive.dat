25|$|<b>Table</b> <b>olive</b> {{varieties}} {{are more difficult}} to harvest, as workers must take care not to damage the fruit; baskets that hang around the worker's neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production.|$|E
25|$|The {{curing process}} may take {{from a few}} days, with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the {{exception}} of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final <b>table</b> <b>olive</b> product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid {{is the most important}} metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} {{for the detection}} of the color adulteration of green <b>table</b> <b>olives</b> with E- 141 ii colorant. Addition of this colorant to <b>table</b> <b>olives</b> to obtain a green permanent color in the product is a fraudulent practice, because the FDA allows its use only in citrus-based dry beverage mixes and European Union regulations do not permit the addition of colorants to <b>table</b> <b>olives.</b> The method consists of a pigment extraction in liquid phase and subsequent analysis by HPLC-DAD. The fraudulent addition of E- 141 ii is determined from the detection in fruit and/or packing solution, of peaks identified as copper chlorophyllin complexes, which are compounds completely foreign to the natural pigment profile of green <b>table</b> <b>olives.</b> The proposed methodology allows controlling the color quality of green <b>table</b> <b>olives.</b> © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Spain herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State Spain (EMS Spain), received and application from Syngenta Agro to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance thiamethoxam in artichokes, <b>table</b> <b>olives</b> and olives for oil production and for clothianidin in <b>table</b> <b>olives</b> and olives for oil production, based on the intended use of thiamethoxam. Spain received also another application from Syngenta Crop Protection AG to modify the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam and clothianidin in cauliflower, based on the intended use of thiamethoxam. In order to accommodate for the intended SEU use of thiamethoxam, the EMS Spain proposed to raise the existing MRLs for thiamethoxam in <b>table</b> <b>olives</b> and olives for oil production from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 5 mg/kg and to raise the existing MRLs for clothianidin in <b>table</b> <b>olives,</b> olives for oil production and cauliflower, resulting from the use of thiamethoxam from 0. 02 mg/kg to 0. 09 and 0. 05 mg/kg, respectively.
