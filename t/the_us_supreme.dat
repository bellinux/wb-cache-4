5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. <b>The</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E

5|$|The {{legality}} of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands {{continued to be}} contested {{in state and federal}} courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304. <b>The</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.|$|E
