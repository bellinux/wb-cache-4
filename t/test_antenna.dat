40|$|Probe pattern {{compensation}} {{is essential in}} near-field scanning geometry, {{where there is a}} great need to accurately know far-field patterns at wide angular range. This paper focuses on a novel formulation and computer simulation to determine the precise need for and effect of probe compensation in cylindrical near-field scanning. The methodology is applied to a linear test array antenna and the NASA scatterometer radar antenna. The formulation is based on representing the probe by its equivalent tangential magnetic currents. The interaction between the probe equivalent aperture currents and the <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> fields is obtained with the application of a reciprocity theorem. This allows us to obtain the probe vector output pickup integral which is proportional to the amplitude and phase of the electric field induced in the probe aperture with respect to its position to the <b>test</b> <b>antenna.</b> The integral is evaluated for each probe position on the required sampling point on a cylindrical near-field surface enclosing the antenna. The use of a hypothetical circular-aperture probe with a different radius permits us to derive closed-form expressions for its far-field radiation patterns. These results, together with the probe vector output pickup, allow us to perform computer simulated synthetic measurements. The far-field patterns of the <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> are formulated based on cylindrical wave expansions of both the probe and <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> fields. In the limit as the probe radius becomes very small, the probe vector output is the direct response of the near-field at a point, and no probe {{compensation is}} needed. Useful results are generated to compare the far-field pattern of the <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> constructed from the knowledge of the simulated near-field with and without probe pattern compensation and the exact results. These results are important since they clearly illustrate the angular range over which probe compensation is needed. It has been found that a probe with an aperture radius of 0. 25 (lambda), 0. 5 (lambda), and 1 (lambda) needs a little probe compensation, if any, near the <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> main beam. In addition, a probe with low directivity may provide a better signal-to-noise ratio than a highly directive one. This is evident in <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> patterns without probe compensation at wide angles...|$|E

40|$|Abstracf-In many cases, it is {{impractical}} {{or impossible}} to make antenna patfern measurements on a conventional far-field range; {{the distance to the}} radiating far field may be too long, it may be impractical to move the antenna from its operating environment to an antenna range, or the desired amount of pattern data may require too much time on a far-field range. For these and other reasons, it is often desirable or necessary to determine far-field antenna patterns from measurements made in the radiating near-field region; three basic techniques for accomplishing this have proven to be successful. In the 6 rst technique, the aperture phase and amplitude distributions are sampled by a scanning field probe, and then the measured distributions are transformed to the far field. In the second technique, a plane wave that is approximately uniform in amplitude is created by a feed and large reflector in the immediate vicinity of the <b>test</b> <b>antenna.</b> And in the third technique, the <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> is focused within the radiating near-field region, patterns are measured at the reduced range, and then the antenna is refocused to infinity.

40|$|In this paper, {{the issues}} {{pertaining}} to microwave imaging and holographic diagnostic to antennas in cylindrical near-field measurements are addressed. The theoretical approach {{is based on}} expanding the work in [1] and [2] where a cylindrical wave expansion of the field on a cylindrical near-field surface is given. The sampling probe is modeled by its equivalent aperture current (idealized circular aperture) and incorporated into the near-field to far-field transformation. The method of steepest decent is applied to obtain the far-field. In its implementation, however, one could specify directly the angular spectrum at which the far-field is desired to be calculated without resorting to interpolation. The microwave imaging and holographic diagnostic is based on back projection where a plane wave expansion of the far-field is obtained. This approach necessitates {{the knowledge of the}} far-field at exact angular spectrum resulting from application of 2 -D FFT. Hence, we were able to construct simply the near-field on a plane not necessarily on the aperture plane of the <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> but also on planes perpendicular to the aperture plane [3]. And a 3 -D high resolution and high precision antenna imaging of the <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> is obtained from cylindrical near-field simulated measurements.

40|$|Modern {{communication}} systems are making increasing {{demands on the}} precision with which antenna patterns are specified and pattern measurement is now a time-consuming procedure. This time consumption is expensive and should be minimized as much as possible. Antenna patterns can also be corrupted by unwanted multi-path reflections from extraneous scatterers located around the antenna test range and physically removing the sources of these reflections can be prohibitively expensive. This thesis details solutions to overcome the excessive time required for measuring antenna patterns. The solutions given each achieve a substantial decrease in measurement time. They also remove the effects of reflections, either by timegating or by using {{the information about the}} test antenna&# 146;s pattern contained in the reflections to decrease the number of measurements required. With sparse data methods, it is shown that data need not be taken at all the data points required by conventional analysis. The missing data is filled in from a priori knowledge about the measurement system, (the point spread function, the dimensions of the <b>test</b> <b>antenna)</b> and from the information contained in the reflections. When gathering data &# 147;on-the-fly&# 148; with a slant raster scan, the <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> is kept moving, as fast as possible, while taking frequency scans. This can cause errors due to mixing the antenna&# 146;s angular pattern in with its frequency response. The test antenna&# 146;s pattern can still be found by not exceeding limits which are described in detail in the text. Use of the astronomical algorithm, CLEAN significantly improves the contrast of sparse data sets. There is also a substantial improvement in the SNR, both for situations with no extraneous scatterers (ie a &# 147;good&# 148; antenna range) and with an extraneous scatterer deliberately introduced. Moreover, there is information about the test antenna&# 146;s pattern contained in the unwanted reflections. In conventional measurements this information is discarded. Here, it is incorporated into the test antenna&# 146;s pattern by using an iterative transform (or successive projection) algorithm. When the number of measurements used exceeds a prescribed minimum value, the iterative transform algorithm improves the contrast of the above CLEAN results. Good antenna patterns are obtained, even {{in the presence of a}} strong scatterer, at high rotational speeds by using the slant raster scan. With modern fast receivers, the measurement speed is shown to be limited only by mechanical considerations of the <b>test</b> <b>antenna</b> or the attendant positioner...|$|E
