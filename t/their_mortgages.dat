40|$|Although {{it remains}} the goal of many {{households}} to repay <b>their</b> <b>mortgage</b> by retirement, an increasing proportion now enters retirement with a mortgage. At the same time, households are increasingly likely to hold substantial amounts of financial assets, {{as a result of}} the growth of 401 (k) and similar plans. Among households aged 60 to 69 in 2007, 41 percent had a mortgage. Of these, 51 percent had sufficient assets to repay <b>their</b> <b>mortgage.</b> These households could, if they wanted, be mortgage-free simply by selling some of their investments and mailing a check to the lender. This Issue in Brief considers whether households should use retirement or non-retirement wealth to pay down <b>their</b> <b>mortgage.</b> It first shows that it is unlikely that many retired households will be able to earn a return on risk-free investments such as bank certificates of deposit, Treasury bills, and Treasury bonds that will exceed the cost of <b>their</b> <b>mortgage.</b> Liquidity considerations aside, households holding such assets will generally be better off using them to pay down <b>their</b> <b>mortgage.</b> It then considers and (for most households) rejects the argument that households should retain <b>their</b> <b>mortgage</b> because they can earn a higher expected return in stocks and other risky assets. It concludes with practical advice for most households. ...|$|R

Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the escrow account and the subsequent uses of the funds.

2500|$|The {{growth of}} private-label {{securitization}} {{and lack of}} regulation {{in this part of}} the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led, in 2006, to an increasing number of borrowers, often with poor credit, who were unable to pay <b>their</b> <b>mortgages</b> – particularly with adjustable rate mortgages (ARM), caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures. As a result, home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages. This depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the GSEs, which back the majority of US mortgages. In July 2008, the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that [...] "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in the US housing finance system". The US Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs' stock. Despite these efforts, by August 2008, shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had tumbled more than 90% from their one-year prior levels.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, JPMorgan Chase {{admitted}} that it wrongly overcharged several thousand military families for <b>their</b> <b>mortgages,</b> including active duty personnel in Afghanistan. The bank also admitted it improperly foreclosed {{on more than}} a dozen military families; both actions were in clear violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act which automatically lowers mortgage rates to 6 percent, and bars foreclosure proceedings of active duty personnel. The overcharges may have never come to light were it not for legal action taken by Captain Jonathan Rowles. Both Captain Rowles and his spouse Julia accused Chase of violating the law and harassing the couple for nonpayment. An official stated that the situation was [...] "grim", and Chase initially stated it would be refunding up to $2,000,000 to those who were overcharged, and that families improperly foreclosed on have gotten or will get their homes back. Chase has acknowledged that as many as 6,000 active duty military personnel were illegally overcharged, and more than 18 military families homes were wrongly foreclosed. In April, Chase agreed to pay a total of $27million in compensation to settle the class-action suit. At the company's 2011 shareholders' meeting, Dimon apologized for the error and said the bank would forgive the loans of any active-duty personnel whose property had been foreclosed.

5000|$|This {{major and}} {{unexpected}} decline in house prices meant that many borrowers have zero or negative equity in their homes, meaning their homes were {{worth less than}} <b>their</b> <b>mortgages.</b> As of March 2008, an estimated 8.8 million borrowers — 10.8% of all homeowners — had negative equity in their homes, a number that {{is believed to have}} risen to 12 million by November 2008.

30|$|Another {{issue is}} whether the house price decline might be {{attributed}} to a lower willingness of banks to provide mortgage funding {{as a result of the}} financial crisis. Clearly, there is a chicken-egg problem. The fall in house prices pushed many house “under water” (value of their home being below the value of <b>their</b> <b>mortgage)</b> and raised loan-to-value ratios, which makes banks’ mortgage portfolios less save assets, even though delinquency rate remained very low compared to international standards. Banks therefore wanted to reduce <b>their</b> <b>mortgage</b> portfolio. The easiest way to achieve that is not issuing new loans. This reinforced the downward pressure on house prices.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{homeowners who}} are facing {{foreclosure}} {{may be able}} to remain in possession of their homes if they work with their lenders to modify <b>their</b> <b>mortgage.</b> Loan modification can also make homeowners’ monthly loan payments more affordable.|$|R
