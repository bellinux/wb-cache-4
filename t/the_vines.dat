5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. <b>The</b> <b>vines</b> are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley {{and parts of the}} Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant <b>the</b> <b>vines</b> on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, ampelographers began to {{distinguish}} Sauvignon blanc from Sauvignonasse plantings in Chile. The character of non-blended Chilean Sauvignon blanc are noticeably less acidic than the wines of New Zealand and {{more similar to}} the French style that is typical of Chilean wines. The region of Valparaíso is the most notable area for Sauvignon blanc in Chile due to its cooler climate which allows the grapes {{to be picked up}} to six weeks later than in other parts of Chile. In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that <b>the</b> <b>vines</b> called Sauvignon blanc planted in the region are really Seyval blanc.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} century BC, Theophrastus {{mentioned}} komakon, including it with cinnamon and cassia as an ingredient in aromatic confections. Guillaume Budé and Claudius Salmasius have identified komakon with cubeb, {{probably due to the}} resemblance which the word bears to the Javanese name of cubeb, kumukus. This is seen as a curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus. It is unlikely Greeks acquired them from somewhere else, since Javanese growers protected their monopoly of the trade by sterilizing the berries by scalding, ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>vines</b> were unable to be cultivated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{region was}} known for its wine. Since the 15th century the local {{inhabitants}} practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners' Guild in 1447, the oldest such guild in the German-speaking world. Terraced vineyards extended {{up the sides of}} the Krems River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation. The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture. As the terrain became steeper, <b>the</b> <b>vines</b> grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein, primordial rock. From Dürenstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line-of-sight between the two towns.|$|E
5|$|Abir {{enjoyed a}} boom {{through the late}} 1890s, by selling a {{kilogram}} of rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr which had cost them just 1.35 fr. However, this came {{at a cost to}} the human rights of those who could not pay the tax with imprisonment, flogging and other corporal punishment recorded. Abir's failure to suppress destructive harvesting methods and to maintain rubber plantations meant that <b>the</b> <b>vines</b> became increasingly scarce and by 1904 profits began to fall. During the early 1900s famine and disease spread across the concession, a natural disaster judged by some to have been exacerbated by Abir's operations, further hindering rubber collection. The 1900s also saw widespread rebellions against Abir's rule in the concession and attempts at mass migration to the French Congo or southwards. These events typically resulted in Abir dispatching an armed force to restore order.|$|E

5|$|At about 2:00 pm the French {{attacked}} Castel Ceriolo {{and delayed}} {{the advance of}} Schellenberg’s column by attacking its tail. Aided by Frimont, Ott defeated Monnier and forced two-thirds of his command to retreat to the northeast. About the same time, Marengo had fallen to the Austrians, forcing Napoleon's men into a general retreat. As Austrian troops crossed the Fontanone, their guns bombarded the French infantry in <b>the</b> <b>vines.</b> In a bid to further delay Schellenberg’s advance, Bonaparte committed his main Guard battalion and its artillery, which moved to flank the column. After driving off Austrian dragoons {{with the aid of}} GdB Champeaux’s remaining cavalry (under Joachim Murat), they engaged the head of the column. After a 15-minute firefight around 4:00 pm the Guard were surprised and destroyed by Frimont’s cavalry.|$|E
5|$|He {{is said to}} have meditated {{motionless}} in a standing posture (kayotsarga) for a year, during which time climbing plants grew around his legs. However, he was adamant and continued his practice unmindful of <b>the</b> <b>vines,</b> ants, and dust that enveloped his body. According to Jain text Ādi purāṇa, {{on the last day of}} Bahubali's one year long fast, Bharata came in all humility to Bahubali and worshiped him with veneration and respect. A painful regret that he had been the cause of his elder brother's humiliation had been disturbing Bahubali's meditation; this was dispersed when Bharata worshipped him. Bahubali was then able to destroy the four kinds of inimical karmas, including the knowledge obscuring karma, and he attained omniscience (kevala gyana). He was now revered as an omniscient being (Kevali). Bahubali finally attained liberation (moksha) and became a pure, liberated soul (siddha). He is said to be the first Digambara monk to have attained moksha in the present half-cycle of time (Avasarpiṇī).|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If <b>the</b> <b>vines</b> were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E
25|$|In {{materials}} science, {{and especially}} elasticity theory, ideas of torsion also {{play an important}} role. One problem models <b>the</b> growth of <b>vines,</b> focusing on <b>the</b> question of how vines manage to twist around objects. <b>The</b> <b>vine</b> itself is modeled {{as a pair of}} elastic filaments twisted around one another. In its energy-minimizing state, <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> naturally grows {{in the shape of a}} helix. But <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> may also be stretched out to maximize its extent (or length). In this case, the torsion of <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> is related to the torsion of the pair of filaments (or equivalently the surface torsion of the ribbon connecting the filaments), and it reflects the difference between the length-maximizing (geodesic) configuration of <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> and its energy-minimizing configuration.|$|R

50|$|This vine {{will grow}} in all seasons and {{typically}} spreads along forest floors. <b>The</b> <b>vine</b> grows in two ways: through rhizomes, or through new shoots that grow where the stem has been cut. As Eru is a wild forest vine, {{it tends to}} grow best in shaded areas. Input requirements for Eru {{have not yet been}} established, and nutrient requirements are currently unknown as well. This is likely {{due to the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> is traditionally a wild vegetable opposed to a cultivated crop, and so its domestication potential has remained unrealized. However, it has been noted that <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> grows best in well-shaded areas similar to that of a forest, as too much sunlight can burn <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> and produce substandard leaves for selling purposes. It has also been noted that <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> does not grow particularly well in very moist conditions such as marshes and swamps.|$|R
5000|$|The trunk is {{composed}} of sleeves of conductive tissue, most notably the phloem and xylem.

The downward passage of phloem sap to the roots and this storing process can be interrupted by the viticultural practice of [...] "girdling" [...] or cincturing <b>the</b> <b>vine.</b> This process can improve fruit set by forcing <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> to direct most of its energy towards developing the grape clusters.
