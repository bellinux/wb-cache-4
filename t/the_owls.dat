5|$|The team's next {{challenge}} was the Central Michigan Chippewas, which Temple Owls handled 65–53. <b>The</b> <b>Owls</b> were losing 31–41 with 16:35 {{left in the}} game, but then scored the next eight points. Temple Owls permanently took the lead off a Lavoy Allen layup with 9:30 remaining. Juan Fernandez notched 18 points led <b>the</b> <b>Owls,</b> and Allen had a double-double of 13 points and 10 rebounds. In the teams' first meeting since 2006, Temple Owls knocked off Maryland 63–61. Despite trailing by 15 at halftime, Maryland staged a comeback led by Terrell Stoglin, who had 12 of his 16 {{points in the second}} half. James Padgett dunked with 1:49 left to tie the game at 56. Afterwards, Lavoy Allen completed a three-point play, and Khalif Wyatt stole a Dino Gregory pass to put Temple Owls in the lead permanently. <b>The</b> <b>Owls</b> outrebounded the Terrapins 42–32, and Ramone Moore scored 16 points, leading the team.|$|E
5|$|To {{begin the}} conference season, <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> won against Fordham 70–51 at the IZOD Center. Fordham last won a conference game on January 28, 2009, but Temple Owls had a 27–22 {{deficit in the}} first half. However, a {{balanced}} offensive attack, led by Juan Fernandez and Ramone Moore's 15 points each, helped Temple Owls to take the lead. Michael Eric scored his first collegiate double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Lavoy Allen was the fourth starter to score in double figures, with 12 points. On January 6, starting point guard Juan Fernandez bruised his knee in practice and missed the January 9 game against Saint Louis. Despite shooting 30.6 percent from the field, <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> won 57–53 behind Ramone Moore's 15 points. Temple Owls was behind 41–32 with 10:13 remaining, then went on an 11–2 run. Moore scored five consecutive points to break a tie at 49, giving <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> a lead. The Billikens missed all seven three-point shots against the Temple Owls defense. Fernandez also missed the January 12 game against St. Bonaventure, but <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> defeated the Bonnies nonetheless, 83–55.

30|$|Our {{analysis}} {{shows that a}} corpus of 14 learning ontologies includes a subset of OWL 2 constructors.

Predominantly, <b>the</b> <b>OWL</b> 2 RL profile includes all the nominal constructors whereas the corpus includes only a few occurrences of nominals. Those occurrences of nominal could also be represented using primitive classes. Since <b>the</b> <b>OWL</b> 2 constructors of the corpus form a subset of <b>the</b> <b>OWL</b> 2 RL profile, we consider this subset as a new profile and call it OWL 2 Learn profile. <b>The</b> <b>OWL</b> 2 Learn profile includes {{the great majority of}} <b>the</b> <b>OWL</b> 2 constructors that are used in the corpus and is sufficient to build all the ontologies in it with small modifications.|$|R

5|$|In the 2011 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament, Temple Owls {{received}} a two seed {{by virtue of}} a 14–2 conference record and earned a bye into the quarterfinals. Due to La Salle beating St. Bonaventure in the first round, Temple Owls was matched up with La Salle. <b>The</b> <b>Owls</b> won the game 96–76, posting their most points {{of the season in}} the process. Five players scored more than nine, and Ramone Moore led the charge with 23 points.

Harper finished the game with 18 points and nine rebounds, and was involved in a controversial end-of-game play. With 30 seconds left, Khalif Wyatt attempted a 3-pointer and Harper came down on him, but no call was made. Wyatt proceeded to foul Harper, who hit the deciding free throws. Wyatt had 15 points, while Lavoy Allen added 12 points and 10 rebounds. Juan Fernandez made only 3 of his 17 field goal attempts.|$|E

50|$|The poem {{consists}} {{entirely of}} a fierce debate between <b>the</b> eponymous <b>owl</b> and nightingale, as overheard by an unidentified narrator.

The Nightingale begins the argument by noting <b>the</b> <b>Owl's</b> physique, calling her ugly and unclean. <b>The</b> <b>Owl</b> proposes that they proceed civilly and reasonably in their debate, and the Nightingale suggests consulting Nicholas of Guildford, who, although frivolous in his youth, is now a reasonable judge. However, the Nightingale immediately goes on to shame <b>the</b> <b>Owl</b> for <b>the</b> screeches and shrieks she produces, and equates her active time of night with vices and hatred. <b>The</b> <b>Owl</b> in turn posits that the Nightingale's continuous noise is excessive and boring.|$|R

5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} in Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds.

There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E
