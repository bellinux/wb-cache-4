The actress has said of her character's personality: [...] "I never wanted her to be boring. She was never boring before – she started out kind of boring, but I think that's <b>the</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> because people will expect her to be interesting."

[...] Furthermore, Roddenberry pledged to Nimoy that if the actor remained unhappy with the ears by the 13th episode then he would find a means of removing them from the show.

This enumeration of the hours and the conventional formula יצתה בת קול are important for {{the determination of the}} dependence of the additions in Deut.

Early in the midrash the angels Gabriel and Zangaziel, [...] "the scribe of all the sons of heaven," [...] are mentioned; but in the last hours of the life of Moses it is Samael, the head of the Satans, whose activity is most conspicuous as he watches for the passing of the soul, while Michael weeps and laments. At last Samael receives the command to bring the soul of Moses, but flees in terror before his glance. Again he appears with a drawn sword before Moses, but he has to yield before the [...] "shem ha-meforash," [...] carved {{on the staff of the}} leader of Israel. The last moment approaches, however, and God Himself appears to receive Moses' soul.

He later used that music theme in other films, such as How to Marry a Millionaire in 1953, which opens with him conducting an orchestra.

This is reinforced by the fact that during this scene, Janice briefly hallucinates an image of Livia falling down the stairs on an [...] "In case of fire use stairs" [...] sign on the hospital wall.

500|$|Before he {{was forced}} abroad by {{political}} persecution, Jules Dassin made two classic noirs that also straddled the major–independent line: Brute Force (1947) and the influential documentary-style The Naked City were developed by producer Mark Hellinger, who had an [...] "inside/outside" [...] contract with Universal similar to Wanger's. Years earlier, working at Warner Bros., Hellinger had produced three films for Raoul Walsh, the proto-noirs They Drive by Night (1940), Manpower (1941) and High Sierra (1941), now regarded as a seminal work in noir's development. Walsh had no great name during his half-century as a director but his noirs White Heat (1949) and The Enforcer (1951) had A-list stars and are seen as important examples of the cycle. Other directors associated with top-of-the-bill Hollywood film noirs include Edward Dmytryk (Murder, My Sweet , Crossfire [...] )—the first important noir director to fall prey to the industry blacklist—as well as Henry Hathaway (<b>The</b> Dark Corner , <b>Kiss</b> <b>of</b> <b>Death</b> [...] ) and John Farrow (The Big Clock , Night Has a Thousand Eyes [...] ).|$|R
