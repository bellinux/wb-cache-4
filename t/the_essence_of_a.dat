To constitute a conversion of a chattel, there must be an unauthorized assumption of the right to possession or ownership. The act must have <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tort.|$|E

Heikhalot ("Palaces") deals in describing the palaces of Gan Eden, and Gehinom, and contains many matters related to prayer.

Tosefta are paragraphs containing the beginnings of chapters on the wisdom of the Kabbalah of the Zohar, and it is dispersed in all three volumes of the Zohar.

500|$|Bertrand Russell, {{during his}} early Hegelian phase, {{accepted}} the argument; he once exclaimed: [...] "Great God in Boots!—the ontological argument is sound!" [...] However, he later criticized the argument, asserting that [...] "the argument does not, {{to a modern}} mind, seem very convincing, but {{it is easier to}} feel convinced that it must be fallacious than it is to find out precisely where the fallacy lies." [...] He drew a distinction between existence and essence, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person can be described and their existence still remain in question.|$|E
500|$|Kant {{goes on to}} write, [...] "'being' is evidently not a real predicate" [...] and {{cannot be}} part of the concept of something. He proposes that {{existence}} is not a predicate, or quality. This is because existence does not add to <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> being, but merely indicates its occurrence in reality. He states that by taking the subject of God with all its predicates and then asserting that God exists, [...] "I add no new predicate to the conception of God". He argues that the ontological argument works only if existence is a predicate; if this is not so, he claims the ontological argument is invalidated, as it is then conceivable a completely perfect being doesn't exist.|$|E

500|$|Although {{developers}} billed {{a realistic}} atmosphere, reviewers criticized {{that aspect of}} the game. [...] "I understand the emphasis for this game is on the gameplay.

Crowds will applaud your great plays and touchdowns, but <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> football game revolves around atmosphere. Here, it’s completely lacking," [...] said Acevedo in his review. The game was also criticized for its lack of play-by-play and poor audio. [...] "There's no witty banter between a play-by-play announcer and color commentator (although some would argue that Madden's audio presentation's been seriously lacking the past few iterations), there's no stadium music aside from “Boom” by P.O.D. being played during kickoffs (it gets old pretty fast), and the stadium crowds are basically an afterthought," [...] added Doug Aamoth of Techland.

500|$|The {{placement}} of carrel spaces at the periphery {{was the product}} of thinking that began years earlier when Kahn submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University. There he dispensed with the traditional arrangement of completely separate library spaces for books and readers, usually with book stacks {{on the periphery of the}} library and reading rooms toward the center. [...] Instead he felt that reading spaces should be near the books and also to natural light. For Kahn, <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> library was the act of taking a book from a shelf and walking a few steps to a window for a closer look: [...] "A man with a book goes to the light. [...] A library begins that way. [...] He will not go fifty feet away to an electric light." [...] Each carrel area is associated with two levels of book stacks, with the upper level structured as a mezzanine that overlooks the carrels.

500|$|West {{has been}} an outspoken and {{controversial}} celebrity throughout his career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents. On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC (A Concert for Hurricane Relief), he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media's portrayal of, and the federal response to, black hurricane victims. He criticized President George W. Bush for not [...] "car about black people". Bush stated {{in an interview that}} the comment was [...] "one of the most disgusting moments" [...] of his presidency. In November 2010, in a taped interview with Matt Lauer for the Today show, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize.

500|$|Since its proposal, few {{philosophical}} {{ideas have}} generated as much interest and discussion as the ontological argument. Nearly {{all of the}} great minds of Western philosophy have found the argument worthy of their attention, {{and a number of}} criticisms and objections have been mounted. The first critic of the ontological argument was Anselm's contemporary, Gaunilo of Marmoutiers. He used the analogy of a perfect island, suggesting that the ontological argument could be used to prove the existence of anything. This was the first of many parodies, all of which attempted to show that the argument has absurd consequences. Later, Thomas Aquinas rejected the argument on the basis that humans cannot know God's nature. Also, David Hume offered an empirical objection, criticising its lack of evidential reasoning and rejecting the idea that anything can exist necessarily. Immanuel Kant's critique was based on what he saw as the false premise that existence is a [...] He argued that [...] "existing" [...] adds nothing (including perfection) to <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> being, and thus a [...] "supremely perfect" [...] being can be conceived not to exist. Finally, philosophers including C.D. Broad dismissed the coherence of a maximally great being, proposing that some attributes of greatness are incompatible with others, rendering [...] "maximally great being" [...] incoherent.|$|E
500|$|A {{makeshift}} {{control room}} with tape machines, a mixing console, and other outboard equipment {{was set up}} in Danesmoate's dining room, with the adjacent drawing room used for recording and performing. The large doors separating the rooms were replaced with a glass screen, and to maintain a relaxed [...] "non-studio" [...] atmosphere for the sessions, the control room was dubbed the [...] "lyric room" [...] and the recording space was called the [...] "band room". Lanois' strategy was to encourage the band members to have their parts worked out in advance and to capture as much of <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> live band take as possible, without having the possibility of subsequent overdubbing to fall back on. This was a change for U2, who previously recorded each instrument separately and then layered them into the mix. To support his approach of having all the band members recording in a room together, Lanois eschewed having them wear headphones in favour of using monitor speakers due to their power; Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton used two each. To aid in sound isolation, gobos were built in the drawing room, although the production staff still faced issues with audio spill from the monitor speakers. Lanois said that due to the setup, [...] "you have to make a commitment to what you put down and either use it or throw it all away." [...] This recording setup was duplicated at subsequent locations during the album sessions.|$|E

500|$|The show's writers {{presented}} Todd's personality as {{a combination}} of dark humor, uncouth behavior, and <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tortured soul; he often delivers one-liners that range from humorous to sadistic. Soap opera columnist Jenn Bishop stated that Todd's personality is [...] "violent, gentle, caring, apathetic, smart, obsessive, crazy, irrational, devilish, heroic, angst-filled, comical, etc." [...] and that [...] " [...] loves, but he feels he's unworthy of true love because of the things he's done. He doesn't love himself and projects a facade of a confident, arrogant playboy, but underneath it all, he's someone who seeks an unattainable love". Columnist Jill Berry, who saw Todd as self-centered in the extreme, said that although Todd desperately wants to be loved, {{he is unable to}} give or receive it, and when he is loved, he will destroy it. She did acknowledge Todd's capability of loving his children, which he expressed by doing [...] "crazy and illegal things to prove it", but felt that much of the difficulty he experiences is brought on by himself and that he is incapable of learning from his mistakes even when they hurt the people he loves. She said Todd is in need of [...] "intensive therapy", which will never work because he refuses to change. [...] For example, as portrayed by St. John in 2006, he fights for the custody of his son, Sam, but he is motivated by anger that he has been lied to and revenge more than by a desire to recover his child.|$|E
