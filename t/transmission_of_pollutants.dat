30|$|Since {{groundwater}} {{quality is}} {{inextricably linked to}} the topography that it underlies, which is mostly vulnerable to anthropogenic activities (Moody 1996), the end point of such activities {{could lead to the}} storage of pollutants in the unsaturated zone and further transmission into available groundwater over a period of time. The unsaturated zone, described as the portion between the ground surface and groundwater (Freeze and Cherry 1979), is of key interest because the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> to groundwater occurs through it. Periodically, water is added to this zone by rainfall and through irrigation of crops and the portion that is not returned to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration can move downward towards the water table. Under conditions of plenty of water and fractures, water may percolate through the unsaturated zone fairly quickly and may be a major means of recharge. The unsaturated zone may hence serve as a sink for contaminants and transmit pollutants which may have adverse impacts on groundwater quality.|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{underground}} {{dissolution of}} gypsum, {{and the evolution}} of the gypsum karst in Lithuania and England, results in subsidence problems which can make construction difficult. The natural dissolution yields sulphate-rich groundwater of poor quality and the karst is susceptible to the rapid <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants.</b> In the north of Lithuania gypsum karst is developed in Devonian gypsum. Here the towns of Birai, Pasvalys and the surrounding countryside suffer subsidence and some buildings have been damaged. The majority of the potable water in these areas is derived from groundwater extracted from sandstone sequences that underlie the gypsum. In Lithuania conservation measures have been introduced to control agriculture and prevent pollution of the gypsum karst. These measures include environmentally-friendly farming, restrictions on land use and exclusion zones around subsidence hollows. In England subsidence caused by the dissolution of Permian gypsum has caused severe problems {{in the vicinity of the}} town of Ripon. Numerous buildings have been damaged and new sites are difficult to develop. Here formal planning regulations have recently been introduced to help to protect against the worst effects of subsidence resulting from gypsum dissolution. ...|$|E

40|$|Soils {{represent}} complex dynamic systems {{which form}} the living space for flora and fauna, {{as well as}} for mankind. This pedosphere is influenced by numerous substance flows and interactions, many of them still today unknown, which may be of a more chemical, physical or biological nature, so that the soil can be considered to be a prime example for a variable system. Because of their complexity, soils have numerous capabilities of reacting against 'harmful' processes, which are primarily triggered by mankind, in both a balanced and a buffered manner. These buffering and filtering properties of the soil, however, are not unlimited, a fact which has been demonstrated in numerous examples seen in the recent past. In Germany, the Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundesbodenschutzgesetz; BBodSchG) was therefore adopted in 1998. With the establishment of the Federal Soil Protection Act, it has been accepted that "The purpose of this legislation is the protection of the soil as a central component of the ecosystem and as a basic necessity of life for humans, animals and plants. The soil only has a limited resistance to contaminants, so that any damage suffered may frequently prove to be irreparable or may only be counteracted through the application of considerable expenses. In addition, the danger associated with the gradual enrichment of environmentally hazardous materials in the soil continues to increase as well. The alterations which thereby develop primarily remain unseen, although, in the long run, they may ultimately result in irreparable damage to the soil. Should the resistance of the soil to damage eventually be surmounted, this may, for instance by way of the food chain, lead to the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> to food products or might result in injurious alterations to the groundwater. Consequently, excessive demands dealing with the ecological capabilities of the soil also frequently lead to limitations in the exploitation of the soil. Long-term precautionary soil protection must guarantee an enduring protection of the functions of the soil with regard to the ecosystem. This must be taken into-consideration particularly because of the gradual increase in environmentally hazardous materials, which may, in the long run, lead to the development of damage in the soil which is no longer reversible. The Federal Soil Protection Act is therefore responsible for establishing regulations which serve to avoid detrimental influences to the soil as far as possible. Available knowledge {{could be used as a}} basis for the conception of this legislation. At the same time, it has become clear that extensive, interdisciplinary and success-oriented research will become mandatory in order to meet the demands which are seen to reflect the complexity of soils and the processes which are thereby involved. The relatively late application of this interdisciplinary research is responsible for the fact that some parts of the Soil Protection Act, especially soil biology, have not yet been supported by sufficient investigations. The scientific and practice-related discussions concerning the Federal Soil Protection Act, on the other hand, have made their impression in current research and have even greatly stimulated the development of this research with regard to its practice-related and interdisciplinary structure. The goal of the authors was to provide an overview concerning the existing spectrum of methods for the evaluation of undesirable harmful effects to the soil, and to discuss this information critically with regard to its applicability and significance. An essential feature here was the demonstration of the present status of ecotoxicological testing methods for the evaluation of natural soil functions and an attempt to make a plea for the inclusion of these ecotoxicological methods within the structure of the Federal Soil Protection Act. In this contribution die main results of this review are provided, while all details including a comprehensive list of references can be found in the GDCh monograph (Kördel et al. 2000) ...|$|E

40|$|Indicators were {{devised to}} {{classify}} air pollution monitoring sites {{according to the}} type of expected photochemical pollution. The indicators are based on measured ozone volume fractions, the most frequently monitored component of photochemical pollution, and in particular on two contributions: one due to the ratio of daily maximum-to-minimum ozone volume fractions and the other to observed peak values. The two contributions regarded as independent are logically connected by “ and” and therefore mathematically combined by multiplication. The criterion of classification is mainly described by the mentioned ratio and incidences of ozone volume fractions exceeding the limit of 80 ppb. Twelve monitoring stations within the European network (Cooperative programme for monitoring 1 and evaluation <b>of</b> long-range <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> air <b>pollutants</b> in Europe, EMEP) were classified according to this indicator predicting what ozone levels can be expected at the particular sites during the growth season (April through September) into three groups: clean, medium, and polluted, based on the data for the 7 years(1997 to 2003) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{monitoring}} station for atmospheric deposition {{was designed and}} constructed. Three such stations were applied in a pilot project for a year on three sites (Speulder forest in The Netherlands, Auchencorth in Scotland and Melpitz in Germany) in different regions in Europe to estimate local inputs and to validate deposition models which are currently used or developed to estimate ecosystem specific deposition in Europe. Fluxes at Auchencorth Moss are lowest for all components, except for those much influenced by the sea as a source. As Melpitz is located far away from seas, these components are lowest at this site. Wet deposition is the dominant source of input at Auchencorth, whereas at Speulder forest, through its roughness and pollution climate, dry deposition is dominant. At this site dry deposition velocities are highest. Melpitz is a polluted site. Particularly sulphur deposition is high.

The EMEP ‘supersite’ is located in central southern Scotland at Auchencorth (3. 2 oW, 55. 8 oN), a remote rural moorland site 20 km south-west of Edinburgh. Monitoring operations started formally on 1 June 2006. In addition to measurements made specifically under this contract, the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology also acts as local site operator for measurements made under other UK monitoring networks: the Automated Urban and Rural Network (AURN), the UK Eutrophication and Acidification Network (UKEAP), the UK Hydrocarbons Network, and the UK Heavy Metals Rural Network. Some measurements were also made {{under the auspices of the}} ‘Air Pollution Deposition Processes’ contract. All these associated networks are funded by Defra.

Air concentrations of PCBs were generally lowest in more remote areas of northern Europe with elevated levels in more densely populated areas. γ-HCH was found at elevated levels in more central parts of Europe, whereas α-HCH, β-HCH and DDTs showed higher concentrations in the south-eastern part. There was no clear spatial pattern in the concentrations for PAHs, indicative of influence by local sources, rather than long range atmospheric transport (LRAT). HCB was evenly distributed across Europe, while the concentrations of chlordanes were typically low or non-detectable. A comparison of results obtained on the basis of PAS and active air sampling (AAS) illustrated that coordinated PAS campaigns have the potential serve as useful inter-comparison exercises within and across existing monitoring networks. The results also highlighted limitations of the current EMEP measurement network with respect to spatial coverage. We finally adopted an existing Lagrangian transport model (FLEXPART) as recently modified to incorporate key processes relevant for POPs to evaluate potential source regions affecting observed concentrations at selected sites.

Seasonal variations are pronounced at most of the 114 locations for any time of the day. Seasonal-diurnal variability classification using hierarchical agglomeration clustering reveals 5 distinct clusters: clean/rural, semi-polluted non-elevated, semi-polluted semi-elevated, elevated and polar/remote marine types. For the cluster "clean/rural" the seasonal maximum is observed in April, both for night and day. For those sites with a double maximum or a wide spring-summer maximum, the one in spring appears both for day and night, while the one in summer is more pronounced for daytime and hence can be attributed to photochemical processes. For the spring maximum photochemistry is a less plausible explanation as no dependence of the maximum timing is observed. More probably the spring maximum is caused by dynamical/transport processes. Using data from the 3 -D atmospheric chemistry general circulation model ECHAM 5 /MESSy 1 covering the period of 1998 ? 2005 a comparison has been performed for the identified clusters. For the model data four distinct classes of variability are detected. The majority of cases are covered by the regimes with a spring seasonal maximum or with a broad spring-summer maximum (with prevailing summer). The regime with winter?early spring maximum is reproduced by the model for southern hemispheric locations. Background and semi-polluted sites appear in the model in the same cluster. The seasonality in this model cluster is characterized by a pronounced spring (May) maximum. For the model cluster that covers partly semi-elevated semi-polluted sites the role of the photochemical production/destruction seems to be overestimated. Taking into consideration the differences in the data sampling procedure the carried out comparison demonstrates the ability of the model to reproduce the main regimes of surface ozone variability quite well...|$|R
40|$|International audienceImportant {{aspects of}} the {{seasonal}} variations of surface ozone are discussed. The underlying analysis {{is based on the}} long-term (1990 ? 2004) ozone records of the Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation <b>of</b> the Long-range <b>Transmission</b> <b>of</b> Air <b>Pollutants</b> in Europe (EMEP) and the World Data Centre of Greenhouse Gases, which provide data mostly for the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal variations are pronounced at most of the 114 locations at all times of the day. A seasonal-diurnal variations classification using hierarchical agglomeration clustering reveals 6 distinct clusters: clean background, rural, semi-polluted non-elevated, semi-polluted semi-elevated, elevated and polar/remote marine. For the "clean background" cluster the seasonal maximum is observed in March-April, both for night and day. For those sites with a double maximum or a wide spring-summer maximum, the spring maximum appears both for day and night, while the summer maximum is more pronounced for daytime and hence can be attributed to photochemical processes. The spring maximum is more likely caused by dynamical/transport processes than by photochemistry as it is observed in spring for all times of the day. We compare the identified clusters with corresponding data from the 3 -D atmospheric chemistry general circulation model ECHAM 5 /MESSy 1 covering the period of 1998 ? 2005. For the model output as for the measurements 6 clusters are considered. The simulation shows at most of the sites a spring seasonal maximum or a broad spring-summer maximum (with higher summer mixing ratios). For southern hemispheric and polar remote locations the seasonal maximum in the simulation is shifted to spring, while the absolute mixing ratios are in good agreement with the measurements. The seasonality in the model cluster covering background locations is characterized by a pronounced spring (April?May) maximum. For the model clusters which cover rural and semi-polluted sites the role of the photochemical production/destruction seems to be overestimated. Taking into consideration the differences in the data sampling procedure, the comparison demonstrates the ability of the model to reproduce the main regimes of surface ozone variations quite well...|$|R
40|$|During 2013 total gaseous mercury was {{monitored}} at the Auchencorth Moss and Harwell field sites, {{which are}} run by the UK’s Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Ricardo-AEA respectively {{on behalf of the}} UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as part of the UK rural heavy metals monitoring network. The sites are the two UK EMEP supersites, part of the cooperative programme for monitoring and evaluation <b>of</b> long-range <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> air <b>pollutants</b> in Europe. Auchencorth was first established in 1995, and is operated to EMEP level III. It is located about 20 km south-west of Edinburgh (55. 450 N, 3. 150 W). This is a rural, upland peat site with a large, uniform fetch. Harwell has had air monitoring since the 1970 s, and is operated at EMEP level II, located about 26 km south of the city of Oxford (51. 571 N, 1. 325 W). This is a semi-rural site located near the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus. The Tekran mercury analyser (Model 2537 A, Tekran Inc.), is used to measure TGM in air at both sites. It is run at a resolution of 5 minutes, using dual channels allowing for continuous monitoring. Observed concentrations of TGM is {{at the lower end of}} the northern hemispherical background level of 1. 4 - 1. 7 ng m- 3 observed at other sites. The annual averages of TGM for 2013 for Auchencorth and Harwell respectively are: 1. 33 and 1. 45 ng m- 3. Using measurements of other atmospheric species from colocated instruments, we have used the OpenAir Statistical Package for R, to analyse the influence of point sources on observations, specifically looking at the closure of coal fired power stations at Cockenzie and Didcot for Auchencorth and Harwell respectively, which were located within the local area. We also use air mass back trajectories and cluster analysis to assess the long range transport of mercury to the sites, investigating repeated episodic peak events of up to 2. 8 ng m- 3 observed at both sites during spring 2013...|$|R
