5|$|Star Wars: Rogue Squadron {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Star Wars galaxy, where a war is fought between the Galactic Empire and <b>the</b> <b>Rebel</b> Alliance. The game's first fifteen levels occur six months after the Battle of Yavinas {{depicted}} in A New Hopeand before the events of The Empire Strikes Back. As the Empire gathers strength for an all-out assault on <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> forces, Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles form Rogue Squadron, a group comprising twelve of the most skilled X-wing pilots from <b>the</b> <b>Rebel</b> Alliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle changed the {{perception}} of <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> movement in Mexico. Before Madero's victory many believed that <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> forces would scatter {{as soon as they}} were confronted by federal troops. The fall of Juárez proved that notion wrong and revealed the real strength of <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1834, the {{imperial}} forces managed to finally repel the Siamese invaders and gained {{the upper hand}} over the rebels, regaining control of the southern countryside and besieging <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> fortress. Although Khôi died during the siege in November 1834, the rebels defending the citadel of Saigon held out against imperial troops until September, 1835. <b>The</b> <b>rebel</b> commanders put to death. In all, between 500 and 2,000 citadel defenders were captured and executed, including Marchand.|$|E
50|$|The Spaniards {{continued}} to pursue <b>the</b> <b>rebels,</b> furiously driving <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> out of Cabiao. <b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> of Cabiao retreated to Candaba, Pampanga, while <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> of Gapan retreated to San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan. <b>The</b> San Isidro <b>rebels</b> crossed <b>the</b> river to safety in Jaen, Nueva Ecija. Manuel Tinio defended <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> crossing <b>the</b> river, {{who were all}} relatives of <b>the</b> local <b>rebels,</b> and were among his kinfolk.|$|R
50|$|She {{takes him}} to an island where <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> asked Kade to perform a gun run. In {{the middle of this}} mission, <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> turn on her and Carver. They escape from <b>the</b> <b>rebels,</b> and much of the time after that is spent attacking <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{rescue team}} {{approaches}} the village, and learns that <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> have moved Jennings to their HQ. They begin following <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> {{try to force}} Jennings to tell the United States (through a video camera) that the Marines must leave the island; but she refuses. In response, <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> torture her.|$|R
5|$|The Falcon {{journeys}} to <b>the</b> <b>Rebel</b> base at Yavin IV, {{where the}} Rebels analyze the Death Star plans {{and find a}} weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. <b>The</b> <b>Rebel</b> fighters attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, {{and is about to}} fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to <b>the</b> <b>Rebel</b> base with his friends to celebrate their victory.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{began to}} cross from Southwark onto London Bridge on the {{afternoon}} of 13 June. The defences on London Bridge were opened from the inside, either in sympathy for <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> cause or out of fear, and the rebels advanced into the city. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> force from Essex made its way towards Aldgate {{on the north side of}} the city. The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest of the rebels in.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{not going}} well for the loyalists and the new regency {{government}} considered retreating to Ireland. Prince Louis and <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> barons were also finding it difficult to make further progress. Despite Louis controlling Westminster Abbey, {{he could not be}} crowned king because the English Church and the Papacy backed Henry. John's death had defused some of <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country. In a bid to take advantage of this, Henry encouraged <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the Magna Carta, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy. The move was not successful and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.|$|E
50|$|Success for <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> {{began in}} 1996. <b>The</b> <b>Rebels</b> won <b>the</b> 1997, 1998, and 2000 league championships. After {{disappointment}} in 2001 and 2002, <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> were again victorious in 2003 and 2004. With five league championships in eight years, <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> {{have yet to}} win the Clarence Schmalz Cup as All-Ontario Champions.|$|R
50|$|He {{made his}} debut for <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> against <b>the</b> Blues as a {{replacement}} for Patrick Leafa in a defeat for <b>the</b> <b>Rebels,</b> becoming <b>the</b> third 'home-grown' player to player for <b>the</b> <b>Rebels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The next year, <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> {{finished}} <b>the</b> 2008 season 7-1. <b>The</b> <b>Rebels</b> {{once again}} {{returned to the}} Shamrock Bowl to face the defending champions, the UL Vikings, but <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> lost 14-12.|$|R
5|$|The war was {{not going}} well for the loyalists, but Prince Louis and <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> barons were also finding it {{difficult}} to make further progress. John's death had defused some of <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country. Henry's government encouraged <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> barons {{to come back to}} his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the 1215 Charter, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy and clause 61, which had set up the council of barons. The move was not successful, and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.|$|E
5|$|With {{the support}} of an entire legion, other legionnaires, {{prompted}} by discontent over pay, deserted Macrinus and joined Elagabalus' ranks as well. In response to the growing threat, Macrinus sent out a cavalry force {{under the command of}} Ulpius Julianus to try and regain control of <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> soldiers. Rather than capturing <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> forces, the cavalry instead killed Ulpius and defected to Elagabalus.|$|E
5|$|A {{spacecraft}} crashes at Wiekamp Air Force base in West Virginia, and {{the surviving}} Rebel passenger is {{captured by the}} military. Mulder shows Scully more photos of the victims and, having found more implants in them, believes the implant in Scully {{may be able to}} answer all of their questions. The Syndicate meets over the capture of <b>the</b> <b>Rebel.</b> The Well-Manicured Man informs them of the existence of the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over <b>the</b> <b>Rebel</b> and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E
50|$|He {{made his}} debut for <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> against <b>the</b> Queensland Reds as a late {{replacement}} for Tamati Ellison in a 25-23 win for <b>the</b> <b>Rebels,</b> becoming <b>the</b> first ever 'home-grown' player to player for <b>the</b> <b>Rebels.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rebels</b> faced Devon Sharks in the Grand Final {{in their}} first year, after the Sharks {{finished}} second in the league, and beat <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> to become Grand Final Winners, after a lacklustre performance from <b>the</b> <b>Rebels.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rebels</b> {{won their}} Round Six home-game against the Wellington Hurricanes, and their Round Seven clash against the Western Force. For Rounds 13 and 14 <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> {{travelled}} to South Africa for {{games against the}} Bulls and <b>the</b> Cheetahs. <b>The</b> <b>Rebels</b> lost 47-10 to the Bulls, yet Bulls coach Frans Ludeke expressed confidence that <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> could experience a rapid rise.|$|R
5|$|Alex Krycek {{reports to}} the Syndicate on the rebel's recent attacks. <b>The</b> <b>rebel,</b> {{masquerading}} as the elder he killed, proposes that the Syndicate align themselves with the rebels. The Cigarette Smoking Man seems {{to recognize that the}} elder has opposed his own previous opinion- that siding with the rebels is suicide.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> {{victory at}} the Battle of Rijmenam in July 1578, much of the Southern Netherlands were lost to the Spanish Army during the autumn; Brussels was menaced, and the States General were moved to the safer Antwerp. Taking {{advantage}} of the Dutch rebel army's indiscipline, Farnese decided {{at the beginning of}} 1579 to besiege Maastricht. As a feint to distract the Dutch rebels from his goal, but also aiming to scare Antwerp's inhabitants, Farnese moved with his troops to surprise the village of Borgerhout, very close to Antwerp, where a part of the Dutch States Army had its quarters, namely 3,000 or 4,000 infantry which were the backbone of <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> army and consisted of French Calvinists under François de la Noue, and English and Scottish troops under John Norrey's orders.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have pointed}} to the {{deliberate}} parallels between the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> army into the Austrian Netherlands in 1789 and Louis of Nassau's invasion of Frisia in 1566 which acted as the trigger for the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule.|$|E
50|$|Since {{his arrival}} at his final school, West Monroe High School, Shows led <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> to sixteen district, seven state, and two {{national}} championships. <b>The</b> <b>Rebels</b> also secured six state runner-up designations. Before Shows took over <b>the</b> <b>Rebels,</b> <b>the</b> team had mostly losing seasons for many previous years.|$|R
50|$|During {{the hike}} to the border, using {{satellite}} scans, they discover <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> are somehow tracking them. As they escape and evade <b>the</b> <b>rebels,</b> <b>the</b> team enters a village whose inhabitants are being raped, tortured, and massacred by rebel soldiers. Aware of having the opportunity to stop it, Waters orders the team to take down <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> <b>The</b> team is visibly shaken by the atrocities they see <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> have committed against the villagers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> killed 50 of the 70 {{soldiers}} in the 1st regiment. Others went over to <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> <b>The</b> weapons seized from the disarmed regiment and military enlistment offices were added to existed weapons cached in cellars. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> had {{a large number of}} rifles, grenades, and a few machine guns. <b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> also staged an ambush near the station Barbach, from which they could bombard incoming trains delivering Red Army units.|$|R
5|$|In 1204, John lost Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou to Philip II of France, leaving English {{power on}} the {{continent}} limited to Gascony and Poitou. John raised {{taxes to pay for}} military campaigns to regain his lands, but unrest grew among many of the English barons; John sought new allies by declaring England a Papal fiefdom, owing allegiance to the Pope. In 1215, John and <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> barons negotiated a potential peace treaty, the Magna Carta. The treaty would have limited potential abuses of royal power, demobilised <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> armies and set up a power-sharing arrangement, but in practice neither side complied with its conditions. John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the Magna Carta and the First Barons' War erupted, with <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> barons aided by Philip's son, the future Louis VIII, who claimed the English throne for himself. The war soon settled into a stalemate, with neither side able to claim victory. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry as his heir.|$|E
5|$|Letters backing John {{arrived from}} the Pope in April, but by then <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> barons had {{organised}} into a military faction. They congregated at Northampton in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, marching on London, Lincoln, and Exeter. John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London, they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists. The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter, {{but this was not}} attractive to the rebels. Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, had been working with <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1963, {{the coup}} went ahead, with Cao's troops {{isolated}} in the far south, and Tung's forces outside Saigon, unable to rescue Diệm from <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> encirclement. Tung was called to the Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base under the pretense of a routine meeting, and was seized and executed. Attempts by Diệm and Nhu {{to make contact with}} Đính were blocked by other generals, who claimed that Đính was elsewhere. This led the Ngô brothers to think that Đính had been captured, still unaware that he had rebelled. The following morning, Đính was allowed to have the final word with Diệm before the brothers were arrested, allowing him to prove his loyalty to <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> cause. Đính subsequently shouted obscenities at the Ngô brothers.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016, <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> {{struggled}} to a 5-7 record. After beginning the season at No.11, <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> blew a 22-point lead {{en route to}} a loss the opening weekend to Florida State. After defeating Wofford the following week, <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> blew another three-touchdown lead in a loss to Alabama. After obliterating Georgia [...] and Memphis, <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> lost three straight to Arkansas, LSU and Auburn. After defeating Georgia Southern and upsetting then-No. 10 Texas A&M, <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> dropped their last two regular season games to Vanderbilt and Mississippi State.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> {{gathered}} in Cheongdan, 2.5 kilometers away from Haeju. 7,000 rebels were camped {{on the east}} and the south, and 400 were additionally hidden in the pine forests. 10,000 were camped 400 meters away, and 14,000 were camped a kilometer away. Because <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> lacked rifles and other modern weaponry, they were crushed after three Japanese strikes. However, <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> did not retreat.Because the Japanese also lacked ammunitions due to the large number of rebels, they finally directly charged at <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> only had old-fashioned muskets, the superior numbers of <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> wore out <b>the</b> Japanese soldiers. <b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> fled, and were chased for 600 meters. Minor skirmishes continued until January 1895, and Kim Gu hid in the house of An Taehun, a Catholic and the father of An Junggeun, until 1896.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rebels</b> {{finally agreed}} to be dissarmed; in return the Sierra Leone government, led by Kabbah, offered <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> amnesty and career {{opportunities}} and counselling. <b>The</b> child <b>rebels</b> were placed in public schools, also offered counselling and reunited with family members. In 2001, UN forces moved in rebel-held areas and began to disarm <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{years after}} the events in Tarifa, a quarrel erupted between the Marinids and the Nasrids, in 1306. The Nasrids {{promptly}} sponsored the rebellion of Uthman ibn Idris, a pretender to the Marinid throne in Morocco. Uthman was landed by a Nasrid force in Ceuta, and quickly carved out an enclave. The rebels continued to receive support across the strait from the Nasrid garrisons. It is believed that the Marinid sultan Abu al-Rabi Sulayman, unable to dislodge <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> from Ceuta, intrigued with the Castilians, whose truce with Granada was about to expire, encouraging them to take Algeciras and Gibraltar and cut <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> off. The first siege of Gibraltar was a side-operation of the main Castilian siege of Algeciras in 1309–10.|$|E
5|$|Spartacus' forces then retreated towards Rhegium. Crassus' legions {{followed}} and upon arrival built fortifications across the isthmus at Rhegium, despite harassing raids from <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> slaves. The rebels were under siege {{and cut off}} from their supplies.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Katarn met Jan Ors (Julie Eccles), a Human Rebel working {{undercover}} as {{a double}} {{agent in the}} Empire. Ors uncovered the real information about Katarn's parents' death; that the Empire was behind it. The Empire eventually discovered that Ors {{was working for the}} Rebels and she was taken prisoner. Katarn helped her escape, thus ending his career with the Empire. He soon became a mercenary and, due to his hatred of the Empire for killing his parents, he began to take on jobs from <b>the</b> <b>Rebel</b> Alliance. Dark Forces begins with Katarn being recruited by <b>the</b> <b>Rebel</b> Alliance to recover the plans to the Death Star, a heavily armed space station capable of destroying an entire planet. The Alliance uses the plans to find a weakness in, and subsequently destroy, the Death Star.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 Mitchell {{played in}} <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> {{pre-season}} game against Fiji, and scored an opportunist try {{early in the}} game. On 28 May 2012 Mitchell became <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> most capped player, when <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> travelled to Wellington to be trounced by the Hurricanes.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of KHSAA class {{expansion}} in 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> now compete in Class 4A (6A being the largest - by school population). In 2008, Larry French became the head coach of <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> French led <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> to a 13-1 record {{and a trip to}} the state semifinals. In 2009 and 2010 he led <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> to <b>the</b> state championship with perfect 15-0 records. <b>The</b> Boyle County <b>Rebels</b> currently have 7 State Championships in football.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, Pihos {{served as}} the head coach of <b>the</b> Richmond <b>Rebels</b> of <b>the</b> Atlantic Coast Football League. He {{remained}} with <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> in 1965 as the team joined the Continental Football League. He led <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> to records of 8-5-1 in 1964 and 6-8 in 1965. He stepped down as the coach of <b>the</b> <b>Rebels</b> in February 1966.|$|R
