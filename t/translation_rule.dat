40|$|A {{number of}} machine {{translation}} systems {{based on the}} learning algorithms are presented. These methods acquire <b>translation</b> <b>rules</b> from pairs of similar sentences in a bilingual text corpora.

However, it is diffi-cult to give complete linguistic knowledge to the system ex ante because natural language has various linguistic phe-nomena. Therefore, we worked to develop learning-based {{machine translation}}. In learning-based machine translation, a system acquires <b>translation</b> <b>rules</b> automatically from <b>translation</b> examples that are pairs of source and target language sentences. However, existing learning-based ma-chine translation presents the problem that it requires {{a large number of}} similar translation examples.

This paper proposes a method of machine translation using Recursive Chain-Link-type Learning, which can acquire many useful <b>translation</b> <b>rules</b> from sparse <b>translation</b> examples. Our system, based on this method, efficiently acquires <b>translation</b> <b>rules</b> from each <b>translation</b> example without requiring two similar transla-tion examples. <b>Translation</b> <b>rules</b> are acquired by extracting corresponding parts between source and target language sentences in translation examples. Our system determines those corresponding parts using previously acquired trans-lation rules. Therefore, the system engenders a chain reac-tion in acquisition of new <b>translation</b> <b>rules.</b> Evaluation experiments using our system demonstrated an effective translation rate of 61. 1 %.

To tackle this, we propose a framework that uses two different segmentation specifications for alignment and translation respectively: we use Chinese character as the basic unit for alignment, and then convert this alignment to conventional word alignment for <b>translation</b> <b>rule</b> induction.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a factored approach to incorporating soft source syntactic constraints into a hierarchical phrase-based translation system. In contrast to traditional approaches that directly introduce syntactic constraints to translation rules by explicitly decorating them with syntactic annotations, which often ex-acerbate the data sparsity problem and cause other problems, our approach keeps transla-tion rules intact and factorizes {{the use of}} syn-tactic constraints through two separate mod-els: 1) a syntax mismatch model that asso-ciates each nonterminal of a <b>translation</b> <b>rule</b> with a distribution of tags {{that is used to}} measure the degree of syntactic compatibil-ity of the <b>translation</b> <b>rule</b> on source spans; 2) a syntax-based reordering model that predicts whether a pair of sibling constituents in the constituent parse tree of the source sentence should be reordered or not when translated to the target language. The features produced by both models are used as soft constraints to guide the translation process. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the proposed approach significantly improves a strong string-to-dependency translation sys-tem on multiple evaluation sets. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we briefly address the {{consistency}} of formulations for nested surfaces plasticity and their kinematic hardening translation rules. Some requirements for these formulations are then given. It is shown and discussed that multilayer plasticity based on nested yield surfaces present some inconveniences when modelling multiaxial cyclic loading. On the other hand, the use of hardening surfaces, instead of yield surfaces solves the problem partially. It is also shown that multilayer plasticity based on the Mróz kinematic rule yields clearly different multiaxial predictions when using the same uniaxial bilinear curve and different number of surfaces, which is a priori inconsistent since the same monotonic stress–strain curve should not result into a clearly different multiaxial behavior {{simply because of the}} discretization employed by the user. It is demonstrated that, in contrast with the Mróz <b>translation</b> <b>rule,</b> multilayer plasticity using the Prager <b>translation</b> <b>rule</b> results in the same prediction regardless of the number of surfaces in which the hardening part of the bilinear curve is discretized.

40|$|How can one {{represent}} {{the meaning of}} English sentences in a formal logical notation such that the translation of English into this logical form is simple and general? This report answers this question for {{a particular kind of}} meaning, namely quantifier scope, and for a particular part of the translation, namely the syntactic influence on the <b>translation.</b> <b>Rules</b> are presented which predict, for example, that the sentence: Everyone in this room speaks at least two languages. has the quantifier scope AE in standard predicate calculus, while the sentence: At lease two languages are spoken by everyone in this room. has the quantifier scope EA. Three different logical forms are presented, and their <b>translation</b> <b>rules</b> are examined. One of the logical forms is predicate calculus. The <b>translation</b> <b>rules</b> for it were developed by Robert May (May 19 77). The other two logical forms are Skolem form and a simple computer programming language. The <b>translation</b> <b>rules</b> for these two logical forms are new. All three sets of <b>translation</b> <b>rules</b> are shown to be general, {{in the sense that the}} same rules express the constraints that syntax imposes on certain other linguistic phenomena. For example, the rules that constrain the translation into Skolem form are shown to constrain definite np anaphora as well. A large body of carefully collected data is presented, and used to assess the empirical accuracy of each of the theories. None of the three theories is vastly superior to the others. However, the report concludes by suggesting that a combination of the two newer theories would have the greatest generality and the highest empirical accuracy...|$|R
