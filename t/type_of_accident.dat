This then led to the overexposure of at least one patient. While the initial failure was the simple failure of a semiconductor diode, it set in motion a series of events which led to a radiation injury.|$|E
500|$|On 19 April 2010 the FIL {{published}} {{its final}} {{report to the}} International Olympic Committee on Kumaritashvili's death. The report found that the sled used by Kumaritashvili had met all FIL standards. It attributed the accident to [...] "driving errors starting in curve 15/16 which as an accumulation ended in the impact that resulted in him leaving the track and subsequently hitting a post. ... This is a tragic result that should not have occurred {{as a result of}} an initial driving error". As the sled hit the wall at the curve-16 exit, it catapulted off the track, causing Kumaritashvili to lose control of it entirely. This was a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> not seen before, and therefore [...] "ith the unknown and unpredictable dynamics of this crash, the calculation and construction of the walls in that section of the track did not serve to prevent the tragedy that happened". However, the report also determined that during the homologation (certification) process and later sessions at the Whistler Sliding Centre, the track was faster than originally calculated. While calculations called for a top speed around , the highest speed recorded was [...] The FIL felt that luge athletes were able to cope with this speed, but [...] "this was not a direction the FIL would like to see the sport head [...] ". FIL President Fendt wrote to the Sochi 2014 Olympic Organizing Committee that the FIL would homologize the proposed Sochi track only if speeds did not exceed [...] The FIL also said it was [...] "determined" [...] to do what it could to prevent such accidents from occurring again. It would re-examine changes to the sport, sled design, and track technology. FIL Secretary General Svein Romstad summarized: [...] "What happened to Nodar has been an unforeseeable fatal accident".|$|E

2500|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{was first}} apprised of the {{situation}} in his morning briefing the same day as the accident. He was told that the 16th Nuclear Disaster Team had been sent to investigate, per the standard procedures for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident.</b> News stories related to the crash began to appear the following day, and it achieved front page status in both the New York Times and Washington Post on 20 January. Reporters sent to the accident scene covered angry demonstrations by the local residents. On 4 February, an underground Communist organization successfully initiated a protest by 600 people in front of the U.S. Embassy in Spain. The Duchess of Medina Sidonia, Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo (known as the [...] "Red Duchess" [...] for her socialist activism), eventually received a 13-month prison sentence for leading an illegal protest.|$|E
2500|$|The other style, the [...] "ghost rider," [...] when {{performed}} correctly, can {{be faster}} than the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] style, but has the tendency to be more dangerous, {{which is one of}} the reasons why it is no longer taught to rookies during rookie week. In order to perform the exchange the rider goes through all the same steps as in the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, except, instead of stepping off the bike, the rider sets the handlebars and then grabs hold of the seat. Once set, the rider will push herself off the back of the bike while it is still moving. As long as the handle bars stay in line and the rider clears the back wheel, then the bike will keep going straight on its own until the other rider grabs hold and jumps on. The name [...] "ghost rider" [...] comes from the fact that when the first rider gets off, the bike keeps going as if someone were really still on it, like a ghost. There are several risks to this exchange. The first is if the first rider doesn't set the handle bars properly, then when she lets go, the bike will swerve and the rider will be thrown from the bike, and possibly take out other members of hers or other teams. Any rider performing this exchange must also be careful to clear the back wheel of the bike or else face the inevitable injuries associated with this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident.</b> Another risk is that the second rider can miss the bike and it will cut into other teams exchanges or even worse, race traffic. In the women's race, the only team to consistently use this technique is Kappa Alpha Theta.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Accidents {{and related}} {{injuries}} {{are very important}} public health problems in developing countries. Previous {{studies have shown that}} over 19 million people became disabled due to traffic, occupational and domestic accidents. It is important to know the causes and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> for development and implementation of intervention programs. In this study, we aimed to determine the incidence and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> within the previous two weeks and to evaluate some socio-demographic variables and home accidents in two different regions of Ankara. Materials and Methods: The studies were designed as cross-sectional epidemiological studies in which the “ 30 Cluster Sampling Method” was used. Results: The incidences <b>of</b> having any <b>accidents</b> within the past two weeks were 5. 1 % in Region I and 8. 9 % in Region II. In both Region I and Region II, "domestic accidents" were the leading cause <b>of</b> all <b>accidents.</b> Conclusion: Intervention studies should be structured according to the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents...</b>|$|R
