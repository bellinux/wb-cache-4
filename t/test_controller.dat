40|$|Abstract—Systems {{with many}} {{integrated}} circuits (ICs), often {{of the same}} type, are increasingly common to meet the constant performance demand. However, systems in recent semiconductor technologies require not only manufacturing test, but also in-field test. Preferably, the same test set is utilized both at manufacturing test and in-field test. While deterministic test patterns provide high fault coverage, storing complete test vectors leads to huge memory requirements and inflexibility in applying tests. In an IEEE 1149. 1 (Boundary scan) environment, this paper presents an approach to efficiently embed deterministic test patterns in the system by taking structural information of the system into account. Instead of storing complete test vectors, the approach stores only commands and component-specific test sets per each unique component. Given a command, test vectors are created by a <b>test</b> <b>controller</b> during test application. The approach is validated on hardware and experiments on ITC’ 02 benchmarks and industrial circuits show that the memory requirement for storing the test data for a system is highly related {{to the number of}} unique components.

40|$|Multibody {{dynamics}} simulation {{is widely}} used for prototyping and <b>testing</b> <b>controllers.</b> However, the transfer of controllers initially developed in simulation to real mechatronics platforms requires updating the code in order to interface with physical sensors and actuators. Due to this strong coupling with specific hardware, the controller re-usability is often severely compromised. In the present contribution, we solve this issue by adding a middleware between the controller and the controlled platform (either real or simulated). This framework decouples the controller from the hardware, allows fast controller developments and eases collaborations on large scale projects. Moreover, it offers the possibility to simultaneously control the real and the simulated robot from a unique controller. This paper presents the interface of the Robotran dynamic simulator with the YARP middleware. Robotran leverages symbolic generation of the multibody equations to provide fast and accurate simulations of multibody systems.
