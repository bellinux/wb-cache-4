50|$|An ALSP Broadcast Emulator (ABE) {{facilitates}} {{the distribution of}} ALSP information. It receives a message on one of its <b>communications</b> <b>paths</b> and retransmits the message on all of its remaining <b>communications</b> <b>paths.</b> This permits configurations where all ALSP components are local to one another (on the same computer or on a local area network). It also permits configurations where sets of ACMs communicate with their own local ABE with inter-ABE communication over wide area networks.|$|R

50|$|Meteor burst {{communications}} (MBC), {{also referred}} to as meteor scatter communications, is a radio propagation mode that exploits the ionized trails of meteors during atmospheric entry to establish brief <b>communications</b> <b>paths</b> between radio stations up to 2250 km apart.|$|R
50|$|CJLF-FM is a Canadian radio station, {{broadcasting}} a Contemporary Christian music format on 100.3 FM in Barrie, Ontario. Using the on-air {{brand name}} Life 100.3, {{the station was}} founded by Scott Jackson in August 1999 and is owned by <b>Trust</b> <b>Communications</b> Ministries, Inc, {{which is based in}} Barrie, Ontario.|$|R
5000|$|Typically the MUF is a {{predicted}} number. Given {{the maximum}} observed frequency (MOF) for a mode on {{each day of the}} month at a given hour, the MUF is the highest frequency for which an ionospheric <b>communications</b> <b>path</b> is predicted on 50% of the days of the month.|$|R
50|$|Path quality {{analysis}}: In a <b>communications</b> <b>path,</b> {{an analysis}} that (a) includes the overall {{evaluation of the}} component quality measures, the individual link quality measures, and the aggregate path quality measures, and (b) is performed by evaluating communications parameters, such as bit error ratio, signal-plus-noise-plus-distortion to noise-plus-distortion ratio, and spectral distortion.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{coherence}} bandwidth [...] in Hz {{is given}} approximately by the equation:It can be reasonably {{assumed that the}} channel is flat if the coherence bandwidth {{is greater than the}} data signal bandwidth.The coherence bandwidth varies over cellular or PCS <b>communications</b> <b>paths</b> because the multipath spread D varies from path to path.|$|R
50|$|A CCS network {{provides}} {{signaling message}} transfer for participating Common Channel Signaling Switching Offices (CCSSOs), databases, and operator systems. It is a packet-switched communication network that allows call control and transaction {{messages from the}} voice and data networks to be transferred on <b>communications</b> <b>paths</b> that are separate from the voice and data connections.|$|R

50|$|Federated VoIP {{is a form}} of {{packetized}} {{voice telephony}} that uses voice over IP between autonomous domains in the public Internet without the deployment of central virtual exchange points or switching centers for traffic routing. Federated VoIP uses decentralized addressing systems, such as ENUM, for location and identity information of participants and implements secure, <b>trusted</b> <b>communications</b> (TLS) for identify verification.|$|R
50|$|The eduGAIN service enables {{participating}} federations, which primarily {{serve the}} authentication and authorisation interests {{of research and}} education sectors, to interfederate. eduGAIN provides an infrastructure for establishing <b>trusted</b> <b>communications</b> between identity providers and service providers in different participating federations. End-users authenticate at identity providers and obtain access to service providers. Technically, eduGAIN is managed by aggregating and distributing signed SAML 2.0 metadata files.|$|R
5000|$|The Institute conducts {{research}} into policy, technology, economics, {{trade and investment}} relevant to the energy sector. The research is disseminated through the publication of policy papers, presentation of briefings and facilitation of workshops. It provides [...] "a <b>trusted</b> <b>communications</b> channel between government and the private sector" [...] and represents the Australian industry to the APEC Energy Working Group and similar international bodies.|$|R
50|$|The primary <b>communications</b> <b>path</b> is via the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) III (U) satellite. There {{are nine}} of these {{satellites}} currently in orbit, each one providing six {{super high frequency}} encrypted data and voice channels and a single channel dedicated for Emergency Action Messages which {{would be used to}} direct a nuclear release from the motorcade.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} a heavily {{modified}} Chevrolet Suburban equipped with protective armor, runflat tires, vehicle transponder, and turbocharger. The most obvious feature is a configurable antennae platform {{mounted on the}} roof. This contains a large SATCOM dome containing a tracking dish {{that serves as the}} data uplink and downlink as the primary <b>communications</b> <b>path</b> for the motorcade. Also on the roof are smaller VHF antennas that serve as a repeater for the other motorcade elements as well as another <b>communications</b> <b>path</b> to local authorities and the onsite WHCA office. VHF antennae configuration changes according to the mission operational requirements. This also serves as the hub for the LCP or Limousine Control Package that allows C2 functions to be performed from USSS control cars, presidential parade limo or presidential suburban. 22 of these vehicles were built by Assurance Technology Corporation in Carlisle, MA and developed with NRL (Naval Research Laboratory).|$|R

50|$|While JASURAUS {{was capable}} of {{supporting}} an upgrade to 20 Gbit/s, such agreements would have required consensus from the JASURAUS operators and APCN's owners. Proposed upgrades were further hampered due to the high cost charged by Telstra to third parties {{for the provision of}} IP transit and Leased line services from Port Hedland to Perth, which resulted in decreased demand from carriers as there was no alternative <b>communications</b> <b>path</b> out of Port Hedland.|$|R
5000|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{are that}} it may take more time to encode, as the process is more complex, and that some hardware might not be compatible with VBR files. [...] VBR may also pose problems during streaming when the instantaneous bitrate exceeds the data rate of the <b>communications</b> <b>path.</b> These problems can be avoided by limiting the instantaneous bitrate during encoding or (at the cost of increased latency) by enlarging the playout buffer.|$|R

40|$|Steve Bellovin {{looks at}} the complex code behind Microsoft Vista and its DRM mechanisms. Increased amounts of code add to insecurity, but the real danger with DRM is with {{increased}} interaction among different pieces of code. A lot of new mechanisms have been introduced; more seriously, {{a lot of new}} <b>communications</b> <b>paths</b> and dependencies have been introduced. Worst of all, these paths and mechanisms are solving a new problem, one with which the profession has very little experience. Did Microsoft get it right...|$|R
30|$|In this context, {{positive}} {{trust is}} a {{property of the}} communication between agents required when message passing is executed bottom-up in the hierarchy, or {{as a result of}} a sceptic agent checking information. Negative trust is instead the result of rejecting received contradictory information. These two situations are associated with epistemic costs, essential to determine if a network that resolves contradictory transmissions by rejecting information is more or less costly than one which facilitates message passing by straightforward acceptance. We focus in particular on networks that preserve memory of previously obtained <b>trusted</b> <b>communications.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On January 28, 2011, the CRTC revoked the licence of CKLN-FM for {{regulatory}} non-compliance. The {{decision was}} {{appealed to the}} Federal Court of Canada, which denied the appeal on April 15, 2011. The CRTC subsequently issued a call for applications to occupy the now-vacant 88.1 FM frequency on September 28, 2011. [...] <b>Trust</b> <b>Communications</b> filed an application to launch a new Christian music radio station in Toronto. [...] The CRTC rejected Trust Communication's application on September 11, 2012, in favour of a new station, CIND-FM, owned by Rock 95 FM.|$|R
50|$|With the new century, DISA faced {{even greater}} {{challenges}} as a DoD service provider. Preserving radio spectrum, information assurance, ensuring interoperability, and establishing secure wireless links were {{just some of}} the tasks performed by the agency. Perhaps the most significant achievement of the agency in 2001 was its immediate response {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. DISA justified $300 million in supplemental funds to support the Global War on Terrorism by providing critical <b>communications</b> <b>paths</b> and command and control enhancements for warfighters.|$|R
30|$|Scenario B: Actuator-to-sensors {{communications}} (A 2 S). In this scenario, {{the communications}} {{are carried out}} between one actuator and one sensor. The distance between two actuators is again 300 m. The number of hops is variable since {{it depends on the}} proximity of the selected sensors. Moreover, the mobility of nodes which take part in the communications is likely to be higher than in the previous scenario. Notice that in the previous scenario there were always two static nodes forming the <b>communications</b> <b>paths.</b> This scenario is illustrated in Figure 12.|$|R
