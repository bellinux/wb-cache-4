25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, before {{enzymology}} was well understood, colloids {{were thought to}} be the key to the operation of enzymes; i.e., the addition of small quantities of an enzyme to a quantity of water would, in some fashion yet to be specified, subtly alter the properties of the water so that it would break down the enzyme's specific substrate, such as a solution of ATPase breaking down ATP. Furthermore, life itself was explainable in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal substances <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> organism. As more detailed knowledge of biology and biochemistry developed, the colloidal theory was replaced by the macromolecular theory, which explains enzymes as a collection of identical huge molecules that act as very tiny machines, freely moving about between the water molecules of the solution and individually operating on the substrate, no more mysterious than a factory full of machinery. The properties of the water in the solution are not altered, other than the simple osmotic changes that would be caused by the presence of any solute. In humans, both the thyroid gland and the intermediate lobe (pars intermedia) of the pituitary gland contain colloid follicles.|$|E
25|$|A life {{script is}} a schema that {{outlines}} cultural appropriate events that individuals should experience during {{a specific time}} period. (Berntsen & Rubin, 2004). The life script account argues that the reminiscence bump occurs because individuals use life script memories to provide a basis of recalling important memories. The life script events often contain more memories during early adulthood, or the reminiscence bump, than any other age period (Berntsen & Rubin, 2004).The life script account emphasizes norms and expectations typical of a given culture {{with regard to the}} timing of major life events. The order and timing of the major events may differ depending on the culture. The life script is a representation of the sequence of normative and major life events. Individuals know the culturally shared expectations of the order and timing of life events in a prototypical life, and are also aware of their own timing in relations to those norms. It assumes that people have an internalized culturally-aware script of the events <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> expected, skeletal life course; this script acts as a template for the recall of life events in association with each life phase.|$|E

[...] The tumour suppressor gene PTEN is frequently inactivated in EIN, being abnormally turned off in approximately 2/3 of all EIN lesions.

2500|$|The British {{psychologist}} Charles Spearman in 1904 {{made the}} first formal factor analysis of correlations between the tests. He observed that children's school grades across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated, and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance {{on all kinds of}} mental tests. He suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor and a large number of narrow task-specific ability factors. Spearman named it g for [...] "general factor" [...] and labeled the specific factors or abilities for specific tasks s. In any collection of test items <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> IQ test, the score that best measures g is the composite score that has the highest correlations with all the item scores. Typically, the [...] "g-loaded" [...] composite score of an IQ test battery appears to involve a common strength in abstract reasoning across the test's item content. Therefore, Spearman and others have regarded g as closely related to the essence of human intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{took issue}} with the level design and {{shooting}} mechanics, particularly when compared to both the original Duke Nukem 3D {{and those of other}} modern-day first-person shooters. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot felt that the [...] "joy of that game's shooting has been flattened" [...] with [...] "little sense of impact", finding the overall design to be [...] "tedious", and ended his video review by calling Duke Nukem Forever a [...] "bad, boring, bargain bin kind of game". Eurogamer commented that [...] "few of the locations [...] the sort of exploration and excitement that made Duke 3D such a memorable experience. Duke Nukem Forever is linear to a fault, and huge chunks of the game are spent simply walking from one fight to another through uninspired corridors." [...] IGN criticized [...] "the frequent first-person platforming segments <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> unnecessarily large percentage of the story mode", although they stated the [...] "shooting sections are simple fun". GamesRadar concluded that [...] "Duke Nukem Forevers world-record development time has produced an ugly, buggy shooter that veers back and forth between enjoyably average and outright boring, with occasional surges of greatness along the way." [...] GamePro felt that [...] "Unexpected moments ... are really the game's biggest strengths. But they're few and far between." [...] X-Play gave the game a 1 out of 5, criticizing the graphics, load time, number of enemies onscreen, the multiplayer, being called [...] "an afterthought", the game's [...] "creepy, hateful view of women.", and the hive level, with Adam Sessler saying that [...] "this is all played for laughs".|$|E

I am also a friend of Mme. de Lastaola, you must know. Oh, no, I have never spoken to her in my life and have seen her only twice, I believe. I wrote to her though, that I admit. She or rather the image of her has come into my life, into that part of it where art and letters reign undisputed like a sort of religion of beauty to which I have been faithful through all the vicissitudes of my existence. Yes, I did write to her and I have been preoccupied with her for a long time. It arose from a picture, from two pictures and also from a phrase pronounced by a man, who in the science of life and in the perception of aesthetic truth had no equal in the world of culture. He said that there was something in her of the women of all time. I suppose he meant the inheritance of all the gifts <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> irresistible fascination—a great personality. Such women are not born often. Most of them lack opportunities. They never develop. They end obscurely. Here and there one survives to make her mark even in history. [...] . And even that is not a very enviable fate. They are at another pole from the so-called dangerous women who are merely coquettes. A coquette has got to work for her success. The others have nothing to do but simply exist. You perceive the view I take of the difference?” ...|$|E
