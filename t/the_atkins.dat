5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of <b>the</b> <b>Atkins</b> diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of <b>the</b> <b>Atkins</b> diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified <b>the</b> <b>Atkins</b> diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Atkins</b> {{family moved}} {{frequently}} in his youth, eventually settling in Claiborne County, Tennessee. He attended {{high school at}} Powell Valley High in Speedwell, Tennessee. During high school, Atkins played guitar {{in his spare time}} at events and festivals. He went to college at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, Tennessee, where he made friends with songwriters and soon began writing himself. In the mid-1990s, Atkins moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a recording career. He signed with Curb Records in 1996, the same week that LeAnn Rimes did.|$|E
5|$|The first {{long-lived}} supercell, which {{spawned the}} tornado with the longest continuous track of any single tornado to occur during this outbreak, developed around 4:50 pm CST (2250 UTC) southeast of Centerville in Yell County, Arkansas. The tornado touched {{down to the}} southwest of New Neely, causing minor damage to two structures and downing trees at EF0 to EF1 strength. The tornado tracked into Pope County, rapidly intensifying to EF3 strength as it slammed into Lucky Landing, a marina at Lake Atkins where multiple vehicles, boats, and mobile homes were destroyed, and one woman was killed. Continuing northeast, the tornado struck the southern and eastern edge of Atkins, killing three people. 65 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, and 39 others were damaged {{to a lesser degree}} in <b>the</b> <b>Atkins</b> area. Several vehicles were blown off of Interstate 40, and six mobile homes were destroyed as well, with five others damaged. Northeast of Atkins, the tornado toppled metal truss towers, destroyed chicken houses, and heavily damaged a large church and gym. In the Happy Bend area, another fatality occurred as a man abandoned his mobile home and sought shelter in a large metal shipping container, which was tossed hundreds of yards into a wooded area. The tornado continued on and crossed into Conway County at EF3 intensity, passing near the town of Cleveland. 36 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 6 sustained major damage, and 8 sustained minor damage along this segment of the path. Several chicken houses were completely destroyed, killing 80,000 chickens, and an elderly couple was killed when their mobile home was swept completely away.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the action of}} <b>the</b> <b>Atkin</b> operator on spaces of overconvergent p-adic modular forms. Our contributions are both computational and geometric.

As an application, we explicitly construct Heegner-type points on elliptic curves. We then make a geometric study of <b>the</b> <b>Atkin</b> operator, and prove a potential semi-stability theorem for correspondences. We explicitly determine the stable models of various Hecke operators on quaternionic Shimura curves, and make a purely geometric study of canonical subgroups.

25|$|In 1911, former schoolteacher Mary McAfee Atkins (1836-1911) (widow of {{real estate}} {{speculator}} James Burris Atkins) bequeathed $300,000 to establish an art museum.

Original plans called for two art museums based on the separate bequests (with <b>the</b> <b>Atkins</b> Museum to be located in Penn Valley Park). However, trustees of the two estates decided to combine the two bequests along with smaller bequests from others to make a single major art institution.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to the burgeoning popularity of low-carbohydrate diets such as <b>the</b> <b>Atkins</b> diet, Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed C2 Cola. C2 contains a mix of high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, sucralose, and Acesulfame potassium. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with {{less than half of the}} food energy and carbohydrates of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.|$|E
500|$|Everything Tastes Better with Bacon was {{positively}} received by reviewers and food critics. The Chicago Tribune {{reported that it}} sold 30,000copies in its first month. Janet F. Keeler of the St. Petersburg Times commented positively on the book's title. She noted the work was covered by food critics, who included its recipes in articles about the subject. Keeler interviewed Fran McCullough, author of The Best American Recipes 2003–2004, who posited that <b>the</b> <b>Atkins</b> diet (which emphasizes higher meat consumption {{as part of a}} low carbohydrate plan) had helped increase the popularity of bacon usage. She classed it among the [...] "most interesting and unique cookbooks" [...] published. Giblin's photography received favorable commentary from Cindy Hoedel of The Kansas City Star. Literary critic Dwight Garner of The New York Times included the book in a list of favorites among recent cooking publications. The review was critical of the author's dessert recipes, but agreed with her overall argument for increased use of bacon in cooking.|$|E
500|$|The {{company has}} adapted its menu to {{accommodate}} different dietary lifestyles by adding several vegetarian options, including salads, the BK Veggie sandwich, and its deep-fried spicy bean burger that {{is sold in}} Burger King's international locations. The majority of these products do not qualify as vegan due {{to the presence of}} egg or dairy products; an example is the BK Veggie, which is approved by the British Vegetarian Society. Society guidelines do not require their approved products to be vegan, and allow ovo-lacto-vegetarian ingredients. The Veggie Burger is widely sold in other countries, sometimes under different names (for example, it is called a [...] "Country Burger" [...] in Germany). Burger King added low-carb variants of several of its products in 2004 that are in accordance with low-carb diets such as <b>the</b> <b>Atkins</b> diet and the South Beach Diet. Low-carbohydrate preparation consists of eliminating the bread and serving the product in a bowl with silverware.|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Marlene Parrish {{gave the}} book a {{favorable}} review, highlighting {{it in her}} article [...] "Favorite Cookbooks for 2002". She wrote that she enjoyed sampling the recipes from the book. Parrish added that Robert Atkins, creator of <b>the</b> <b>Atkins</b> diet, would think favorably of the [...] "Gorgonzola Cheeseburgers with Bacon" [...] dish. The Denver Post included the book in a list of best cookbooks of 2002. Another article for the same newspaper highlighted recipes in the book, including Spaghetti alla Carbonara and Cobb salad, Pear-Apple Crisp with Brown Sugar-Bacon Topping and Bacon Brittle. A review in the Toronto Star criticized Perry's lack of creativity in her choice of recipes. The review concluded the book {{was a good deal}} compared to other cookbooks on the subject, while noting its lack of comprehensiveness with the small number of total recipes included. Michele Anna Jordan of The Press Democrat recommended Perry's work, and commented that the author's zest for the subject was contagious.|$|E
