5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear {{prosthetic}} legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis</b> fit more snugly.|$|E
5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of transmitting {{movement from the}} implant to <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis</b> determines the degree of prosthetic motility. Movement is transmitted from traditional nonporous spherical implants through the surface tension at the conjunctival–prosthetic interface and movement of the fornices. Quasi-integrated implants have irregularly shaped surfaces that create an indirect coupling mechanism between the implant and prosthesis that imparts greater movement to <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Directly integrating the implant to <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis</b> through an externalized coupling mechanism {{would be expected to}} improve motility further.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a new technique}} for fabricating cement-retained implant-supported <b>prostheses.</b> <b>The</b> technique involves cementation of <b>the</b> <b>prostheses</b> over customized gold cylinders. Access channels are incorporated in <b>the</b> <b>prostheses</b> to allow future access of the gold screws. This technique {{can be used in}} various clinical situations to achieve total passive fit of the framework without compromising retrievability. The technique overcomes the problems encountered with other previously advocated methods for constructing such prostheses.

25|$|Historically, {{implants}} {{that directly}} attached to <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis</b> were unsuccessful because of chronic inﬂammation or infection {{arising from the}} exposed nonporous implant material.|$|E
25|$|Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant {{traditionally}} {{was thought}} to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a ball-and-socket joint, when the implant moves, <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis</b> moves. However, because the so-called ball and socket are separated by layers of Tenon’s capsule, imbricated muscles, and conjunctiva, the mechanical efﬁciency of transmission of movement from the implant to <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is suboptimal. Moreover, {{the concern is that}} imbrication of the recti over nonintegrated implants actually can result in implant migration. The recent myoconjuctival technique of enucleation is an alternative to muscle imbrication.|$|E

25|$|And {{although}} the porous implants {{have been reported}} to offer improved implant movement, these clearly are more expensive and intrusive, requiring wrapping, and subsequent imaging to determine vascularization and pegging to provide for better transmission of implant movement to <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> and also are prone to implant exposure.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to compare two {{different}} total knee prostheses that differ {{in the shape of}} the Polyethylene (PE) insert, trying to optimize the shape of the best one, in order to reduce the stress peaks. The study procedure has been divided into the following steps. First step has been the three-dimensional shape acquisition of <b>the</b> two <b>prostheses</b> by means of a COMET 5 3 D scanner. The morphology of two prototypes of <b>the</b> <b>prostheses</b> has been acquired by elaborating multiple Moirè fringe pattern projected on their surfaces. Second step consisted of the manipulation of these data in a CAD module, that is the interpolation of raw data into parametric surfaces, reducing singularities due to the typical scattering of the acquiring system. Third step has been the setting up of FEM simulations to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>prostheses</b> behaviour under typical loading conditions. The CAD model of <b>the</b> <b>prostheses</b> has been meshed into solid finite elements. Different flexion angles configurations have been analysed, the load being applied along the femoral axis. FEM analyses have returned stress fields in the PE insert and, in particular, in the stabilizing cam which function is to avoid dislocation. Last step has been the integrated use of CAD-FEM to modify the shape of the stabilizing cam of <b>the</b> best <b>prosthesis,</b> in order to reduce the stress peaks in <b>the</b> original <b>prosthesis</b> without compromising <b>the</b> kinematics of the joint. Good results have been obtained both in terms of stress and contact pressure peaks reduction...|$|R

40|$|Background: An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} into possible increased forces, torques, and altered motions during load-bearing ankle motion after implantation of two different total ankle prostheses. We hypothesized that the parameters investi-gated would not differ {{in relation to the}} two implants compared. Methods: We included two different ankle prostheses (Hintegra, Newdeal, Vienne, France; German Ankle System, R-Innovation, Coburg, Germany). <b>The</b> <b>prostheses</b> were implanted in seven paired cadaver specimens. The specimens were mounted on an industrial robot that enables complex motion under predefined conditions (RX 90, Stäubli, Bayreuth, Germany). The robot detected the load-bearing (30 kg) motion of the 100 th cycle of <b>the</b> specimens without <b>prostheses</b> as <b>the</b> baseline for the later testing, and mimicked that exact motion during 100 cycles after <b>the</b> <b>prostheses</b> were implanted. <b>The</b> resulting forces, torques, and bone motions were recorded and the differences between <b>the</b> <b>prostheses</b> compared. Results: <b>The</b> Hintegra and German Ankle System, significantly increased the forces and torques in relation to the specimen without a prosthesis with one exception (one-sample-t-test, each p ≤ 0. 01; exception, parameter lateral force measured with the German Ankle System, p = 0. 34).

25|$|On radiography, it {{is normal}} to see thin {{radiolucent}} areas {{of less than}} 2mm around hip prosthesis components, or between a cement mantle and bone. However, these may still indicate loosening of <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis</b> if they are new or changing, and areas greater than 2mm may be harmless if they are stable. In {{the first year after}} insertion of uncemented femoral stems, it is normal to have mild subsidence (less than 10mm).|$|E
25|$|In {{hydroxyapatite}} implants {{a secondary}} procedure can insert an externalized, round-headed peg or screw into the implant. <b>The</b> <b>prosthesis</b> {{is modified to}} accommodate the peg, creating a ball-and-socket joint: after fibrovascular ingrowth is completed, a small hole can be drilled into the anterior surface of the implant. After conjunctivalization of this hole, it can be fitted with a peg with a rounded top that ﬁts into a corresponding dimple at the posterior surface of the artiﬁcial eye. This peg thus directly transfers implant motility to the artiﬁcial eye.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{the models}} of the Third and of the Fourth generations of breast implant devices were {{sequential}} advances in manufacturing technology, such as elastomer-coated shells that decreased gel-bleed (filler leakage), and a thicker (increased-cohesion) filler gel. Sociologically, the manufacturers of prosthetic breasts then designed and made anatomic models (natural breast) and shaped models (round, tapered) that realistically corresponded with the breast- and body- types of women. The tapered models of breast implant have a uniformly textured surface, which reduces the rotation of <b>the</b> <b>prosthesis</b> within the implant pocket; the round models of breast implant are available in smooth-surface- and textured-surface- types.|$|E
40|$|The biotolerant and haemodynamic {{effects of}} {{three types of}} woven {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (Dacron) arterial prostheses were compared.
