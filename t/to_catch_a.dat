5|$|Dawlish Warren is a sand spit {{and nature}} reserve that {{lies at the}} mouth of the River Exe. The route now turns away from the coast and follows the Exe estuary past Cockwood to Starcross where the {{seasonal}} Exmouth to Starcross Ferry crosses to Exmouth. The Exe Valley Way continues beyond Starcross towards Exeter, but when the ferry is not running it is possible <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> train from either Dawlish Warren or Starcross railway stations to Exmouth railway station.|$|E
5|$|Hearing of the {{approach}} of Pompey, Spartacus attempted to negotiate with Crassus to bring the conflict to a close before Roman reinforcements arrived. When Crassus refused, a portion of Spartacus' forces broke out of confinement and fled toward the mountains west of Petelia (modern Strongoli) in Bruttium, with Crassus' legions in pursuit. The legions managed <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> portion of the rebels – {{under the command of}} Gannicus and Castus – separated from the main army, killing 12,300.|$|E

On June15, he was again injured by a Barr pitch, and forced to leave the game with a dislocated finger. He played in three games for the Nationals in 1886, collecting two hits in eight at bats.|$|E
5|$|The jackalope {{is subject}} to many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims {{embedded}} in tall tales about its habits. Jackalopes {{are said to be}} so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored. Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk, but The New York Times questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk. One of the ways <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> jackalope is to entice it with whiskey, the jackalope's beverage of choice.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, {{as well as the}} fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E

5|$|Although Salinger {{tried to}} escape public {{exposure}} as much as possible, he continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both {{the media and the}} public. Readers of his work and students from nearby Dartmouth College often came to Cornish in groups, hoping <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of him. In May 1986 Salinger learned that the British writer Ian Hamilton intended to publish a biography that made extensive use of letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends. Salinger sued to stop the book's publication. The court in Salinger v. Random House ruled that Hamilton's extensive use of the letters, including quotation and paraphrasing, was not acceptable since the author's right to control publication overrode the right of fair use.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted {{by the sound of}} a distant train's whistle. One day, they run away from home <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E
5|$|By war's end, Black Hawk and {{nineteen}} {{other leaders}} of the British Band were incarcerated at Jefferson Barracks. Most of the prisoners were released in the succeeding months, but in April 1833, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, Neapope, and three others were transferred to Fort Monroe in Virginia, which was better equipped to hold prisoners. The American public was eager <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of the captured Indians. Large crowds gathered in Louisville and Cincinnati to watch them pass. On April 26, the prisoners met briefly with President Jackson in Washington, D.C., before being taken to Fort Monroe. Even in prison they were treated as celebrities: they posed for portraits by artists such as Charles Bird King and John Wesley Jarvis, and a dinner was held in their honor before they left.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, road users {{wishing to}} go from Saltash to Plymouth had two main choices. Travel by coach {{involved}} a long detour north either to Gunnislake New Bridge (a one-lane bridge constructed in 1520), or other bridges further north along the Devon – Cornwall border. The alternative was <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> ferry across the Tamar. The Torpoint Ferry had been running successfully since 1791 (and is still in active service) while the Saltash Ferry ran near to the bridge's present location. While popular, the ferries did not have sufficient capacity by the 20th century to cater for motor traffic. The idea for a fixed crossing across the Tamar had been floated around since the early 19th century, and proposals had been discussed in Parliament as early as 1930.|$|E
5|$|In Apur Panchali (the Bengali {{translation}} of , 1994), Ray {{wrote that he}} had omitted many of the novel's characters {{and that he had}} rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir's death, which occurs early in the novel at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of the train is not in the novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is {{not the end of the}} novel.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City had {{the first}} attack of the match, but it came to nothing. Soon Everton began to {{dominate}} the match, with Dean frequently involved in the attacking play. Several Everton attacks came on their left flank. Stein caused Manchester City right-back Sid Cann problems, and Cann was forced to concede a corner kick on several occasions. Just after the half-hour Everton had their first shot on target, when Stein's effort was saved by Langford. Another chance quickly arrived. Stein's cross passed in front of goal, but Dean was unable {{to connect with the}} ball. Two minutes later Manchester City goalkeeper Langford attempted <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> cross from Britton, but dropped the ball under pressure from Dean. The ball fell into the path of Stein, who put the ball into the empty net to give Everton the lead. At half-time Everton led 1–0.|$|E

5|$|Matilda {{achieved}} {{success as}} an author of children's books (using the pen name Susie Sunbeam), beginning in 1849 with A Trap <b>to</b> <b>Catch</b> <b>a</b> Sunbeam, which subsequently went through 42 editions. She married the Rev. Henry Mackarness in 1852, and with him had eleven children, four of whom did not survive infancy. Taking after her father {{in terms of writing}} output, Matilda Mackarness produced an average of one book a year until her death, most of them under her married name. Her husband's death in 1868 left her with little means of supporting her family, as the books did not produce much income. She and her children moved in with her father.|$|E
5|$|Species {{identification}} using scales {{requires a}} fair {{degree of knowledge}} about snakes, their taxonomy, snake-scale nomenclature as well as familiarity with and access to scientific literature. Distinguishing by using scale diagrams whether a snake is venomous or not in the field cannot {{be done in the}} case of uncaught specimens. It is not advisable <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> snake to check whether it is venomous or not using scale diagrams. Most books or websites provide an array of traits of the local herpetofauna, other than scale diagrams, which help to distinguish whether a snake in the field is venomous or not.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} begins with Carey, revisiting her youth, wandering {{a high school}} corridor and standing inside a classroom of schoolchildren playing various musical instruments with inter-cutting clips of men playing on drums. Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing her movements, and her efforts <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about {{in the classroom and}} corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of schoolchildren are shown dancing in the corridor as the boy she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 3.3 million views on YouTube as of June 2017.|$|E
