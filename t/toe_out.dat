6000|$|The invariable {{practice}} was, first, {{to place}} a bottle of rum and a pitcher of water before the lad, and to order him to try his hand at mixing a glass of grog. Four applicants were incontinently rejected for manifesting a natural inaptitude at hitting the juste milieu, in this {{important part of the}} duty of a cabin-boy. Most of the candidates, however, were reasonably expert in the art; and the captain soon came to the next requisite, which was, to say [...] "Sir," [...] in a tone, as Noah expressed it, somewhere between the snap of a steel-trap and the mendicant whine of a beggar. Fourteen were rejected for deficiencies on this score, the captain remarking that most of them [...] "were the sa'ciest blackguards" [...] he had ever fallen in with. When he had, at length, found one who could mix a tumbler of grog, and answer [...] "Sir," [...] to his liking, he proceeded to make experiments on their abilities in carrying a soup-tureen over a slushed plank; in wiping plates without a napkin, and without using their shirt-sleeves; in snuffing candles with their fingers; in making a soft bed with few materials besides boards; in mixing the various compounds of burgoo, lobscouse, and dough, (which he affectedly pronounced duff); in fattening pigs on beef-bones, and ducks on the sweepings of the deck; in looking at molasses without licking his lips; and in various other similar accomplishments, which he maintained were as familiar to the children of Stunin'tun, as their singing-books and the ten commandments. The nineteenth candidate, to my uninstructed eyes, seemed perfect; but Noah rejected him for the want of a quality that he declared was indispensable to the quiet of the ship.

5000|$|The Weissach axle is {{a variant}} of the {{semi-trailing}} arm suspension. The tendency of a vehicle to oversteer when decelerating is compounded by the compliant bushings found in most trailing arm suspensions.

50|$|Bump steer {{causes a}} vehicle to turn itself when one wheel hits a bump or falls down into a hole or rut.

For example, if the front left wheel rolls over a bump it will compress the suspension on that corner and automatically rotate to the left (<b>toe</b> <b>out),</b> causing the car to turn itself left momentarily without any input from the steering wheel. Another example, is that when most vehicles become airborne their front wheels will noticeably toe in.|$|E

50|$|In {{automotive}} engineering, toe, {{also known}} as tracking, is the symmetric angle that each wheel makes with the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, {{as a function of}} static geometry, and kinematic and compliant effects. This can be contrasted with steer, which is the antisymmetric angle, i.e. both wheels point to the left or right, in parallel (roughly). Negative toe, or <b>toe</b> <b>out,</b> is the front of the wheel pointing away from the centerline of the vehicle. Positive toe, or toe in, is the front of the wheel pointing towards the centerline of the vehicle. Toe can be measured in linear units, {{at the front of the}} tire, or as an angular deflection.|$|E

40|$|A large {{external}} knee adduction torque during gait {{has been}} {{correlated with the}} progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Though foot path changes (e. g. toeing out) can reduce the adduction torque, no method currently exists to predict whether an optimal foot path exists for a specific patient. This study evaluates a patient-specific optimization cost function to predict how foot path changes influence both adduction torque peaks. Video motion and ground reaction {{data were collected from}} a patient with knee OA performing normal, <b>toe</b> <b>out,</b> and wide stance gait. Joint and inertial parameters in a dynamic, 27 degree-of-freedom, full-body gait model were calibrated to the patient’s normal gait data. The model was then used in gait optimizations that predicted how the patient’s adduction torque peaks would change due to changes in foot path. The cost function tracked the patient’s normal gait data using weight factors calibrated to <b>toe</b> <b>out</b> gait and tested using wide stance gait. For both gait motions, the same cost function weights predicted the change in both adduction torque peaks to within 7 % error. With further development, this approach may eventually permit the design of patient-specific rehabilitation procedures such as an optimal foot path for patients with knee OA...|$|E

A new functional assessment instrument, the <b>toe</b> <b>out</b> angle (TOA) is quantified using computerized gait analysis. We compared Sciatic Functional Index (SFI) with TOA parameter after peripheral nerve transection and entubulation repair. We found a good correlation between SFI and TOA measurements in terms of predicting functional recovery.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that an association exists between {{the characteristics of the}} knee adduction moment and foot progression angle (FPA) in asymptomatic individuals and those with mild to moderate and severe knee osteoarthritis (OA). DesignFifty asymptomatic individuals, 46 patients with mild to moderate and 44 patients with severe knee OA were recruited. Maximum knee adduction moment during late stance and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to describe the knee adduction moment captured during gait. Multiple regression models were used {{for each of the three}} group assignments to analyze the association between the independent variables and the knee adduction moment. ResultsFPA explained a significant amount of the variability associated with the shape of the knee adduction moment waveform for the asymptomatic and mild to moderate groups (P 0. 05). Walking velocity alone explained significant variance associated with the shape of the knee adduction moment in the severe OA group (P< 0. 05). ConclusionA <b>toe</b> <b>out</b> FPA was associated with altered knee adduction moment waveform characteristics, extracted using PCA, in asymptomatic individuals and those with mild to moderate knee OA only. These findings are directly implicated in medial knee compartment loading. This relationship was not evident in those with severe knee OA...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{progression}} of medial knee osteoarthritis seems {{closely related to}} a high external knee adduction moment, which could be reduced through gait retraining. We aimed to determine the retraining strategy that reduces this knee moment most effective during gait, and {{to determine if the}} same strategy is the most effective for everyone. Methods: Thirty-seven healthy participants underwent 3 D gait analysis. After normalwalking was recorded, participants received verbal instructions on four gait strategies (Trunk Lean, Medial Thrust, Reduced Vertical Acceleration, <b>Toe</b> <b>Out).</b> Knee adduction moment and strategy-specific kinematics were calculated for all conditions. Findings: The overall knee adduction moment peak was reduced by Medial Thrust (− 0. 08 Nm/Bw·Ht) and Trunk Lean (− 0. 07 Nm/Bw·Ht), while impulse was reduced by 0. 03 Nms/Bw·Ht in both conditions. Toeing out reduced late stance peak and impulse significantly but overall peakwas not affected. Reducing vertical acceleration at initial contact did not reduce the overall peak. Strategy-specific kinematics (trunk lean angle, knee adduction angle, first peak of the vertical ground reaction force, foot progression angle) showed that multiple parameters were affected by all conditions. Medial Thrust was the most effective strategy in 43 % of the participants, while Trunk Lean reduced external knee adduction moment most in 49 %. With similar kinematics, the reduction of the knee adduction moment peak and impulse was significantly different between these groups. Interpretation: Although Trunk Lean and Medial Thrust reduced the external knee adduction moment overall, individual selection of gait retraining strategy seems vital to optimally reduce dynamic knee load during gait...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to gain a deeper {{understanding}} of the gender differences in knee osteoarthritis (OA) by evaluating the differences in gait spatio-temporal parameters and the differences in pain, quality of life and function between males and females suffering from knee OA. Methods 49 males and 85 females suffering from bilateral medial compartment knee OA participated in this study. Each patient underwent a computerized gait test and completed the WOMAC questionnaire and the SF- 36 health survey. Independent t-tests were performed to examine the differences between males and females in age, BMI, spatio-temporal parameters, the WOMAC questionnaire and the SF- 36 health survey. Results Males and females had different gait patterns. Although males and females walked at the same walking speed, cadence and step length, they presented significant differences in the gait cycle phases. Males walked with a smaller stance and double limb support, and with a larger swing and single limb support compared to females. In addition, males walked with a greater <b>toe</b> <b>out</b> angle compared to females. While significant differences were not found in the WOMAC subscales, females consistently reported higher levels of pain and disability. Conclusion The spatio-temporal differences between genders may suggest underlying differences in the gait strategies adopted by males and females in order to reduce pain and cope with the loads acting on their affected joints, two key aspects of knee OA. These gender effects should therefore be taken into consideration when evaluating patients with knee OA.
