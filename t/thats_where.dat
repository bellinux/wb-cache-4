60|$|BLANCO [Forcibly] No: <b>thats</b> <b>where</b> youre wrong. Dont flatter yourselves {{that youre}} miserable sinners. Am I a miserable sinner? No: I'm a fraud and a failure. I started {{in to be}} a bad man like the rest of you. You all started in to be bad men or you wouldn't be in this jumped-up, jerked-off, hospital-turned-out camp that calls itself a town. I took the broad path because I thought I was a man and not a snivelling canting turning-the-other-cheek {{apprentice}} angel serving his time in a vale of tears. They talked Christianity to us on Sundays; but when they really meant business they told us never to take a blow without giving it back, and to get dollars. When they talked the golden rule to me, I just looked at them as if they werent there, and spat. But when they told me to try to live my life so that I could always look my fellowman straight in the eye and tell him to go to hell, that fetched me.|$|E
60|$|COLLINS [judicially] Well, many ladies with a {{domestic}} turn thought so and said so, maam. But I will say for Mrs George that {{the variety of}} experience made her wonderful interesting. <b>Thats</b> <b>where</b> the flighty ones score off the steady ones, maam. Look at my old woman! She's never known any man but me; and she cant properly know me, because she dont know other men to compare me with. Of course she knows her parents in--well, in the way one does know one's parents not knowing half their lives as you might say, or ever thinking that they was ever young; and she knew her children as children, and never thought of them as independent human beings till they ran away and nigh broke her heart {{for a week or}} two. But Mrs George she came to know a lot about men of all sorts and ages; for the older she got the younger she liked em; and it certainly made her interesting, and gave her a lot of sense. I have often taken her advice on things when my own poor old woman wouldnt have been a bit of use to me.|$|E
