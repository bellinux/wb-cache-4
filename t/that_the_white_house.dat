25|$|In 2009 First Lady Michelle Obama, a Chicago native, {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> fountains be dyed {{green to}} celebrate St.Patrick's Day.|$|E
25|$|On April 10, 2013, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> would seek $2.5 million to hold another referendum as part of Obama's 2014 budget proposal (the money would fund both voter education and the plebiscite itself). This next referendum {{would be the first}} Puerto Rican status referendum to be financed by the federal government. Leaders of the PNP (party in favor of statehood) claimed that the announcement meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> upheld the results of the 2012 referendum, while the PDP (party in favor of maintaining the status quo) claimed that the announcement meant the White House rejected the 2012 referendum.|$|E
5000|$|That {{year was}} an {{election}} year and <b>the</b> president feared <b>that</b> news of <b>the</b> collapsing <b>White</b> <b>House</b> would provide an undesirable metaphor for his administration. On September 30, 1948, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Architect announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House's</b> [...] "structural nerves" [...] had been damaged, the second floor {{would need to be}} rebuilt, but <b>that</b> overall <b>the</b> building was in [...] "good shape". He estimated the cost of repairs might be $1 million.|$|R
2500|$|In early June 2009, Congresswoman McCarthy took {{herself out}} of any run. [...] McCarthy, who had raised only a small {{fraction}} of the amount of money Gillibrand had, said her declining was for personal reasons. [...] Maloney, however, still seemed likely to run, and a conversation with Vice President Joe Biden did not change her mind. [...] Several House Democrats from New York said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House's</b> interventions to forestall a primary race had been unwise.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, President Barack Obama named Hook to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, a group <b>that</b> advises <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> on {{national}} security and emergency preparedness issues with regard to telecommunication services.|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} six months of the investigation, Gray {{remained}} heavily involved. It was only when it became apparent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> was involved that Gray recused himself from the investigation and handed control over to Mark Felt.|$|E
25|$|The Pennsylvania Avenue closing {{has been}} opposed by {{organized}} civic groups in Washington, D.C. They {{argue that the}} closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, the House of Representatives voted 227–189 {{to approve a}} Democratic bill that would expand court {{oversight}} of government surveillance inside the United States while denying immunity to telecom companies. House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers {{left the door open}} to an immunity deal in the future, but said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> must first give Congress access to classified documents specifying what the companies did that requires legal immunity.|$|E

25|$|In August 2006, in {{an article}} in The New Yorker, Hersh wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> gave the green light for the Israeli {{government}} to execute an attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon. Supposedly, communication between the Israeli government and the US government about this came as early as two months in advance of the capture of two Israeli soldiers and the killing of eight others by Hezbollah prior to the 2006 Lebanon War in July 2006. The US government denied these allegations.|$|E
25|$|When {{the time}} rolled around to stage Operation Snake Eyes, two {{separate}} guerrilla units were {{poised for a}} pincer movement. The Nam Yu contingent already had the three teams in place, and would push southeast to join them. A second unit would move west {{from the direction of}} Luang Prabang, under the command of Captain Xieng Manh Noy Sirisouk. When Operation Snake Eyes was again scheduled, the Cambodian Incursion intervened. There was such public furor over that invasion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> decided not to risk further publicity by staging Snake Eyes.|$|E
25|$|While Sheridan's {{men were}} {{off on their}} raid, Grant's army had begun moving from Cold Harbor to cross the James River. In {{conjunction}} with this move, Grant ordered that his principal supply base be moved from White House on the Pamunkey River to City Point on the James. Sheridan learned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> depot {{had not yet been}} broken up, so he sent his wounded, prisoners, and African-Americans who had been following his column, to White House under escort on June 19, and then marched back to Dunkirk, where he could cross the Mattaponi.|$|E

25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> was not required to turn them over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, she pointed to the senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E
25|$|On December 9, 2016, Obama {{ordered the}} U.S. Intelligence Community to {{investigate}} Russian {{interference in the}} election and report before he left office on January 20, 2017. U.S. Homeland Security Advisor and chief counterterrorism advisor to the president Lisa Monaco announced the study, and said foreign intrusion into a U.S. election was unprecedented and would necessitate investigation by subsequent administrations. The intelligence analysis would cover malicious cyberwarfare occurring between the 2008 and 2016 elections. CNN reported that an unnamed senior administration official told them <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> was confident Russia interfered in the election. The official said the order by President Obama would be a lessons learned report, with options including sanctions and covert cyber response against Russia.|$|E
25|$|However, on November 10, 2009, the White House {{decided in}} the CIA's favor, agreeing that the {{authority}} to appoint station chiefs overseas should remain with the CIA. Some intelligence experts believe this significantly weakens the DNI's authority, comparing the DNI to a DCI without an agency. Senator Susan Collins of Maine expressed concerns during hearings over the botched 2009 Christmas terrorist attack <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> had undermined the power of ODNI by siding with the CIA in turf disputes, specifically citing this disagreement over intelligence community appointees. In a January 2010 statement to lawmakers by Thomas Kean and Lee H. Hamilton who led the 9-11 Commission Report, Kean and Hamilton urged Obama to be clear {{who was in charge}} and urged a strong DNI. According to the Washington Post, a former Clinton administration official suggested scrapping the DNI position if Blair were removed.|$|E
5000|$|Scott McClellan, former <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Press Secretary for U.S. President George W. Bush, {{wrote in}} his 2008 memoir What Happened: Inside <b>the</b> Bush <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and Washington's Culture of Deception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bush <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{suffered}} from a [...] "permanent campaign" [...] mentality, and that policy decisions were inextricably interwoven with politics.|$|R
50|$|B. F. Saul {{also owns}} and manages Washington, D.C.’s famous Hay-Adams Hotel, a small, luxury {{downtown}} hotel <b>that</b> overlooks <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> During <b>the</b> summer of 2010, the Hay-Adams temporarily closed to undergo renovations.

50|$|Wincopia farms was one {{of three}} large farms in the area. Overlook Farm and Fairlands remain well preserved, but the 124 acre Wincopia Farms was {{purchased}} for development.

25|$|On March 11, seven Selma {{solidarity}} activists sat-in at the East Wing of the White House until arrested. Dozens {{of other}} protesters {{also tried to}} occupy the White House that weekend but were stopped by guards; they blocked Pennsylvania Avenue instead. On March 12, President Johnson had an unusually belligerent meeting {{with a group of}} civil rights advocates including Bishop Paul Moore, Reverend Robert Spike, and SNCC representative H. Rap Brown. Johnson complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> protests were disturbing his family. The activists were unsympathetic and demanded to know why he hadn't delivered the voting rights bill to Congress yet, or sent federal troops to Alabama to protect the protesters. In this same period, SNCC, CORE, and other groups continued to organize protests in more than eighty cities, actions that included 400 people blocking the entrances and exits of the Los Angeles Federal Building.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among the}} Post's {{anonymous}} sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant {{was identified as}} William Mark Felt, Sr., {{deputy director of the}} FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staff regarded the stakes in Watergate extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All of the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in Rosslyn over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted leaks about Watergate with Time magazine, the Washington Daily News and other publications.|$|E
25|$|Hamid Karzai's {{election}} {{campaign manager for}} the south, and half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai – himself a candidate for re-election {{as the head of}} the Kandahar provincial council – has also long been alleged to have prominent drug trafficking ties, and was thought to control a significant proportion of Afghan heroin production. Numerous reports link him to the Afghan drug trade, according to officials from the White House, the State Department and the United States Embassy in Afghanistan. Officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> favored a hands-off approach with Ahmed Wali Karzai because of his political position. Only a week before the election he denied a report from German news magazine Stern that said that British special forces had found several tons of opium on his land. He claimed that this was being done just before the election to hurt Hamid Karzai's chance of re-election.|$|E
50|$|He {{also claims}} that {{insecure}} messaging puts national security at risk. He claims <b>that</b> since <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staffers must bypass government servers, their email is traveling across the Internet without necessary security. He cites numerous national security risk scenarios that could occur due to possible interception of <b>White</b> <b>House</b> email messages.|$|R
5000|$|Former FBI director, Louis Freeh, {{commented on}} the matter in 2009, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Clinton <b>White</b> <b>House</b> had [...] "used" [...] Holder and kept both the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the dark as to their full {{activities}} around the last minute pardons.|$|R
50|$|The DOJ OIG later {{concluded}} that it was extraordinary and inappropriate that a single DOJ attorney, John Yoo, was relied upon to conduct the initial legal assessment of <b>the</b> PSP, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of oversight and review of Yoo's work, as customarily is the practice of OLC, contributed to a legal analysis of <b>the</b> PSP <b>that</b> at a minimum was factually flawed. Deficiencies in the legal memoranda became apparent once additional DOJ attorneys were read into the program in 2003 and when those attorneys sought {{a greater understanding of}} the PSP's operation. The DOJ OIG concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House's</b> strict controls over DOJ access to the PSP undermined DOJ's ability to perform its critical legal function during the PSP's early phase of operation.|$|R
25|$|In September 1993, General Powell asked Aspin {{to approve}} {{the request of the}} U.S. {{commander}} in Somalia for tanks, armored vehicles and AC-130 Spectre gunships for his forces. Aspin turned down the request. Shortly thereafter Aidid's forces in Mogadishu killed 18 U.S. soldiers and wounded more than 75 in attacks that also resulted in the shooting down of two U.S. helicopters and the capture of one pilot (see the Battle of Mogadishu). In the face of severe congressional criticism, Aspin admitted that in view of what had happened he had made a mistake, but stated that the request for armored equipment had been made within the context of delivering humanitarian aid to Somalia rather than protecting troops. In an appearance before a congressional committee to answer questions about the Somalia disaster, Aspin made an unfavorable impression and appeared weak in response to the detailed probing and criticism of his performance. The president publicly defended Aspin but made clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> was not involved in the decision not to send armor reinforcements to Somalia. Several members of Congress called on Clinton to ask for Aspin's resignation.|$|E
500|$|On June 5, 1996, Clinger {{announced}} that the committee's investigations had discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> had requested access to Billy Dale's FBI background check report seven months after the terminations, in what Clinger said was an improper effort to justify the firings. [...] It was rapidly discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> had additionally gotten improper access to hundreds of other FBI background reports, many on former White House employees in Republican administrations; thus was born the Filegate controversy.|$|E
500|$|The First Lady {{had long}} been irritated by the {{perception}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{and access to the}} President and First Lady were exclusively for the wealthy and famous; she would routinely come down from the family quarters to greet tourists, shake hands, sign autographs, and pose for photos. Her daughter Julie Eisenhower reflected, [...] "she invited so many groups to the White House to give them recognition, not famous ones, but little-known organizations..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010 another {{video was}} {{published}} where Ms. Thomas got more specific with her hatred saying [...] "There’s {{no question about}} <b>that.</b> Congress, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> and Hollywood, Wall Street, are owned by the Zionists [...]. And in an April 2011 Playboy interview, she claimed there was a Jewish conspiracy controlling America.|$|R
5000|$|Pennsylvania Avenue is {{a street}} in Washington, D.C. <b>that</b> connects <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and <b>the</b> United States Capitol.

5000|$|In {{his views}} on {{politics}} {{and its effect on}} legal standards, Balkin adheres to what is known as [...] "partisan entrenchment". This theory states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party <b>that</b> controls <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> can place in the federal courts judges and justices <b>that</b> share <b>the</b> President's political views. This in turn affects Supreme Court justices and, ultimately, constitutional doctrine.|$|R
