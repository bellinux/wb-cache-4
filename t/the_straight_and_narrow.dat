25|$|The British prevailed at the Battle of Krabbendam near Alkmaar on 10 September, {{where the}} Batavians and French were routed. This defeat was {{partly due to}} sloppy staffwork that {{allocated}} one narrow road to the columns of both Batavian divisions {{that were supposed to}} converge on the hamlet of Krabbendam. This hamlet sat astride one of the few entry roads to the Zijpe polder in which Abercromby had set up an armed camp. The polder formed a natural redoubt with its dike acting as a rampart and its circular drainage canal as a moat. <b>The</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> road through Krabbendam formed one of the few easy entries, but it was easily defensible also. The original plan had this entry point attacked by both Batavian divisions, but because Daendels' division was forced to take a more easterly route, only the division of Dumonceau was brought to bear. This division could not be fully deployed {{due to the nature of}} the terrain and the Batavian forces were therefore again fed piecemeal into the battle. They were unable to prevail over the valiant defence of the British 20th Foot. Elsewhere, the French division of General Vandamme was likewise unable to overcome the obstacles of the canal and the dike behind it, that protected the British troops. Vandamme therefore failed to turn Abercromby's right flank as planned.|$|E

500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> path, and you know, I definitely kinda like {{to experiment}} and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long {{to work together}} because of that, because {{what he does is}} genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} an {{adaptation}} of Timothy Shay Arthur's novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There. The Moving Picture World synopsis states: [...] "Despite {{the fact that he}} is a loving husband and father, Joe Morgan ruins his life by his fondness for drink and finally becomes a seemingly hopeless drunkard. He spends his time and money in the saloon kept by Slade, the man who took away Joe's mill and largely caused his financial ruin. Slade's saloon, when he first opened it, was well furnished, the landlord courteous and well groomed, and the customers happy and seemingly unaffected by their surroundings. But as time passed, a change for the worse was noted in everything. Probably this escaped Joe's notice, for a sharp shot, indeed, was needed to reform him. That shock came. Joe's only daughter, Mary, was in the habit of going to the saloon and piteously urging her father to come home. She knew that no matter how intoxicated he might be, he would never harm her. But one evening when she appeared her father and Slade had been quarreling, and the saloonkeeper threw a bottle at Morgan, who dodged. The missile struck the child, entering. The blow resulted fatally, but before Mary died, she extracted a promise from her grief-stricken father that he would never drink again, a promise which he ever-afterward kept. In later years Joe became wealthy and respected, and influenced by the thought of his daughter in heaven he kept in <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> path. The saloon keeper who killed Mary was never punished by the law - but through the irony of fate his taking off was much like that of Joe Morgan's helpless child." ...|$|E

He said that AJ {{was brought in}} [...] "to stir up Masood's life, and that has exciting prospects", and they would [...] "get up {{to all sorts of}} shenanigans." [...] Presenter Kate Thornton, when interviewing Ganatra, said AJ was a [...] "playmate" [...] for Masood, while Wadia said that AJ brings the comedy back to Masood. Inside Soap Kate White called AJ [...] "a world away from family man Masood", while Soaplife said AJ is [...] "not a good influence but he sure puts a smile on [...] face and a new spring in his step." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, you get to see what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ as somebody with [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm interested to see him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..."

2500|$|Sangam age is {{considered}} by the Tamil people as the golden era of Tamil language. This was the period when the Tamil country was ruled by the three 'crowned kings' the Cheras, Pandyas and the Cholas. The land was at peace with no major external threats. Asoka's conquests did not impact on the Tamil land and the people were able to indulge in literary pursuits. The poets had a much more casual relationship with their rulers than can be imagined in later times. They could chide them when they are perceived to wander from <b>the</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrow.</b> The greatness of the Sangam age poetry may be ascribed {{not so much to}} its antiquity, but {{due to the fact that}} their ancestors were indulging in literary pursuits and logical classification of the habitats and society in a systematic manner with little to draw from precedents domestically or elsewhere. The fact that these classifications were documented at a very early date in the grammatical treatise Tolkappiyam, demonstrates the organized manner in which the Tamil language has evolved. [...] Tolkappiyam is not merely a textbook on Tamil grammar giving the inflection and syntax of words and sentences but also includes classification of habitats, animals, plants and human beings. The discussion on human emotions and interactions is particularly significant. Tolkappiyam divided into three chapters: orthography, etymology and subject matter (Porul). While the first two chapters of Tolkappiyam help codify the language, the last part, Porul refers to the people and their behavior. The grammar helps to convey the literary message on human behavior and conduct, and uniquely merges the language with its people.|$|E
