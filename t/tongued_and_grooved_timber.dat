50|$|The {{palisade}} church construction itself consisted, in its simplest form, of posts set {{closely together}} into a trench in the earth, with the roof resting directly {{on top of the}} logs. Later the logs were split in two halves, with the flat side facing into the enclosed room. The edges could be straight, or <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} of timber construction, using mainly Queensland yellow wood, pines and cedars. The cars were {{finished}} externally with tongue <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> <b>timber</b> below the window line.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} almost L-shaped in plan, {{and has a}} {{corrugated}} iron roof which is a complex of hips, gables, ridges and pavilions, with decorative gablets and finials, and three brick chimneys. There are verandahs, with separate roofs, on all four sides. Several of these have been enclosed. The open verandahs all have simple timber balustrading and timber frieze, and ceilings of narrow tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber.</b> Most of the walls are single-skin tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber,</b> but where exposed to the weather, are clad externally with chamferboards.|$|R
50|$|The {{ceiling is}} lined in tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards <b>and</b> the timber trusses {{supporting}} the roof are exposed. Flooring throughout is timber boarding. Significant church furniture includes early timber pews.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has ornate pressed metal ceilings, single skin tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> walls, timber batten arches, sash windows and fanlights above internal doors. The building houses original furniture, fittings and artefacts which belonged to the Cook family.|$|R
50|$|An early office {{compartment}} {{exists at}} {{the western end of}} the upper floor, constructed with a raised timber floor <b>and</b> tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> partitions. At the eastern end there is a single storey timber frame extension which is not original.|$|R
50|$|The chapel is lit by long, narrow, Gothic {{windows in}} the bays between the buttresses. These windows are unusual in that the lower {{sections}} of the openings are unglazed, and are fitted with tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> shutters to assist with ventilation and light.|$|R
50|$|The timber {{walls are}} single-skin, {{vertical}} tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards, with the wall framing {{visible in the}} interior. The western elevation has three timber-framed, double-hung sashes and a single leaf door. There are two similar windows and a door on the eastern elevation.|$|R
50|$|Internally, most of {{the walls}} and the {{ceilings}} are lined with fibrous cement sheeting, braced with timber strips. The chancel walls are clad with vertically-jointed tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards. A hardwood floor has been superimposed above the original concrete flooring. None of the church furniture, decorations and plaques remains.|$|R
50|$|The {{front and}} side {{verandah}}s feature double slat balustrades and arched timber verandah sweeps. The verandah ceiling {{is lined with}} timber. A verandah room is enclosed {{on the western side}} with tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards <b>and</b> double hung sash windows. The buildings have external studs and some weatherboard framing.|$|R
5000|$|Bedford co-developed with Duple the [...] "Vista" [...] {{coachwork}} for the OB, fronted by {{a classic}} bullnose. The ash framework was reinforced with steel, {{and the floor}} made from hardwood with softwood <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> boarding, {{with the exception of}} the cab area which was finished with alloy chequerplate. Seating capacity was normally 29 with overhead luggage racks provided for passengers, whilst the rear luggage boot was also used to store the spare wheel. The price of a complete coach, including finishing in a two-colour livery, was £1,314.10s for a 27-seater, and £1,325.10s for a twenty nine seater.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{the swell}} Scotch all imitate the English, as {{everybody}} else does, for the matter of that, our girls included; and they're all alike. Society makes 'em fit in together like <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> planks that will take any amount of holy-stoning and polish. It's like dropping into a dead calm, with every rope and spar that you know already reflected back from the smooth water upon you. It's mighty pretty, but it isn't getting on, you know." [...] After a pause he added: [...] "I asked them {{to take a little}} holiday cruise with me." ...|$|R
50|$|Woodblocks for textile {{printing}} {{may be made}} of box, lime, holly, sycamore, plane or pear wood, the latter three being most generally employed. They vary in size considerably, but must always be between two and three inches thick, otherwise they are liable to warping, which is additionally guarded against by backing the wood chosen with two or more pieces of cheaper wood, such as deal or pine. The several pieces or blocks are <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> to fit each other, and are then securely glued together, under pressure, into one solid block with the grain of each alternate piece running in a different direction.|$|R
50|$|Ideally shearers {{should not}} have to cross the {{shearing}} board with their sheep or move them excessive lengths. Earlier shed plans often had the catching pen {{on the opposite side of}} the release chutes which necessitated shearers crossing the board and paths with the roustabout. Nowadays the shearing board may be of a curved and/or raised style to save the roustabout extra walking and bending. Sheep may be released through the wall or through a chute in the floor, depending on the plan used. A <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> wooden floor is best for the shearing board and wool processing area (wool room) as it is easier to keep clean, especially with scrapers and to slide butts of wool along.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{interior}} includes two renovated bars, {{a dining room}} which is now partitioned, the kitchen, the store and bathrooms. On the first floor, accessed by a fine timber staircase, {{are a number of}} bedrooms and bathrooms. With the exception of the bars and bathrooms, the interior is largely intact. The walls are lined with plaster, and fretwork fanlights remain above the doors. In the bedrooms, the tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> ceilings have metal rose vents.|$|R
50|$|Internally, timber pews {{are located}} {{on either side of}} a central aisle leading to the raised {{sanctuary}} at the eastern end of the church. The eastern wall of the sanctuary and adjoining southern wall are lined with painted horizontal tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber.</b> The remainder of the church is clad internally with chamferboards. This sanctuary is raised about a metre higher than the church floor and includes a cedar altar and communion rails. The timber ceiling is braced with arched metal rods.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the house, {{walls and}} ceilings, {{including}} the raked verandah ceilings, are generally lined with painted v-jointed tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards <b>and</b> clear finished skirtings and architraves, {{except in the}} formal living and dining rooms and the rear informal lounge where there is flat sheeting. The timber floors throughout have been clear finished. In wet areas vinyl tiles have been laid. The joinery of the core rooms is generally clear finished with early brass hardware, while the verandah joinery is painted.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bottom of}} the boat was formed of yellow pine plank 1.5 in. thick, <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved,</b> <b>and</b> set {{together}} with white lead. This bottom or platform was laid in a transverse platform and molded out with batten and nails. The shape of the bottom being thus formed, the floors of oak and spruce were placed across the bottom; the spruce floors being 4×8 inches and 2 feet apart. The oak floors were reserved for the ends, and were both sided and molded 8 inches. Her top timbers (which were of spruce and extended from a log that formed the bridge to the deck) were sided 6 inches and molded at heel, and both sided and molded 4 inches at the head. She had no guards when first built and was steered by a tiller. Her draft of water was 28 inches.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} is clad with tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards <b>and</b> is very intact, retaining the original colour schemes. The ground floor, {{which is used}} as a supper room, exhibits a brown dado with hand painted floral frieze. Above this are horizontal tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> boards painted ochre yellow. The room has a series of shallow arched enclosed beams supporting the upper floor. At the rear of the ground floor there are ancillary rooms situated in either corner. Between them is a central entrance which has a section of hit and miss flooring, presumably for the clearing of mud from boots.|$|R
50|$|Athol Place is a row {{of three}} Colonial Georgian style terrace houses. Two storey in height, it is built in Brisbane tuff with a {{corrugated}} iron roof replacing the original shingles. A timber verandah with cast-iron balustrading extends {{across the front of}} the building of the upper level. As with many of its contemporaries, the row appears as a unified building with a single hipped roof. The interior is lined with plaster except for the rear sections which are in tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the front}} of the house a {{projecting}} gable entrance to the west end opens onto the front verandah. The south wall onto the front verandah is of post and rail construction with a single-skin of vertical tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards. A door from the enclosed west verandah, a central entrance door and two sets of french doors from the bedrooms open onto the front verandah. An opening for earlier french doors east of the central entrance doorway is infilled with vertical timber boards.|$|R
50|$|The core of {{the main}} {{building}}, which likely dates to the mid-1870s, is a rectangular, timber-framed, timber-clad and timber-lined building which faces east toward the creek. It is set on low timber stumps and has deep exterior chamferboards, a steeply pitched hipped main roof with two double brick chimneys, and a front central projecting gable over an enclosed former front entrance. The roof of this gable has timber shingles beneath later corrugated iron cladding. The interior is lined with wide, single-beaded, tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boarding.|$|R
50|$|At {{the centre}} of the front {{elevation}} there is a projecting bay with a triple window and sunhood below a decorative timber gable infill. This is adjoined on the right hand side by a wide verandah that runs {{around the side of the}} house and has been built in at the rear. The verandah roof is ceiled with tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards <b>and</b> is supported by timber posts with decorative timber brackets. It has a timber handrail and slat balustrading. Four sets of French windows open onto the verandah.|$|R
50|$|The Drying Kilns is a timber-framed {{building}} with a corrugated iron roof and timber block footings. The kilns are two tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> lined rooms comprising {{the inside of the}} building while three open sided verandahs form the outside. Above the ceiling of each drying chamber is a lined enclosed space which contains a series of parallel steam/hot water pipes feeding into a main pipe that leads towards the main steam boiler. Sections of the internal railway and timber carts used on the internal railway are stored under one verandah of the Drying Kilns.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has a rear {{entry into the}} rear wing {{that has become the}} main entrance. The ground and first floor levels of the William Street wing are similar in design, with original joinery, iron columns, and exposed rafters and beams. Walls are rendered and painted. The William Street wing is partitioned on ground level into three rooms, each with a fireplace. The rooms retain finely detailed joinery and ceilings are beaded tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> board ceilings with timber mouldings. Generally, the building retains early and original door and window hardware.|$|R
50|$|Wall {{construction}} differs {{across the}} coach house complex. In the kitchen building {{the wall to}} the semi enclosed southern verandah is constructed from rough sawn vertical timber slabs spanning from the ground to the pitching point of the lean-to roof. In the boarding house {{the southern end of}} the east facing verandah has been enclosed with butt jointed pit sawn hardwood boards spanning vertically from floor level to the pitching point of the lean-to verandah roof. The eastern exterior wall to the boarding house is clad with dressed tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards.|$|R
50|$|The {{foundations}} are {{a system}} of load bearing bed logs that support floor joists <b>and</b> tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> floors. Damage to the foundations has caused {{the western end of}} the house to subside. The wall construction is a timber frame with chamferboards to the external walls. The interior walls and ceilings are constructed from tongue <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> boards which are finished in a dark stained varnish. Two of the main rooms have masonry fireplaces with brick and stone chimneys. Six sets of French doors open out from the main rooms onto the north side verandah. One of these has been altered to create a window.|$|R
50|$|The Church of St. James in Charlestown is {{a painted}} tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> building, now a grade II listed building.It {{was moved to}} Baildon from Great Warley, Essex in 1905.The Reverend N. R. Bailey, rector of Great Warley, had {{property}} in Baildon and hoped to retire there.However his obituary was published in November 1900 before he retired.In 2007/2008 the church was moved again, but only by a few yards.This allowed the surrounding land to be sold by the Diocese for development.Rotten timbers were replaced and underground heat pump system installed to make the building more eco-friendly.|$|R
50|$|The {{detached}} {{kitchen is}} located {{at the back of the}} house, connected by a raised, covered walkway that has been enclosed in horizontal, corrugated iron sheeting. On the western side this area is abutted by a bathroom also sheeted in corrugated iron. The kitchen is a simple rectilinear building with a pitched roof. It is clad in weatherboards and has been extended with a small open, lean-to at the back which is used for timber storage. The cottage is lined internally with beaded, tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boarding <b>and</b> has three bedrooms and a parlour. The kitchen is lined with fibro cement sheeting.|$|R
50|$|The {{opposite}} side of the house has rooms along what may have been a former verandah. A verandah at the rear has been extended into a timber deck. The interior of the building has walls of tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards <b>and</b> timber floors. The core rooms have high ceilings and the doors that open from the main room into the bedrooms and study have decorative transoms. The ceilings of all rooms on the perimeter of the house have raked ceilings, which suggests that the house has evolved from a four-room core and verandahs. The kitchen and bathroom are modern.|$|R
50|$|On {{the west}} side the {{single-storey}} rear extension, an early service wing formerly detached from the main house, has walls and coved ceiling lined with <b>timber</b> tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> boarding with a narrow beading. This wing {{is divided into two}} rooms by a wall of vertically jointed tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber.</b> Access to the southern room (possibly a former servant's room) is off the verandah. It has timber small-pane sash windows to the east and west side elevations. The rear room (early kitchen) has a corrugated iron stove recess in the rear north wall and a door to the rear yard area. A narrow enclosed corridor runs between the two extensions to the rear yard area.|$|R
5000|$|The {{auditorium}} remains remarkably {{intact and}} retains {{much of its}} early decorative finishes. It is a large space, with the roof supported by unboxed laminated timber arches, and has an early lattice ceiling with hessian or canvas backing which follows {{the curve of the}} arches. There are three decorative light panels in the centre of this ceiling. There is a raked timber floor, sloped more steeply at the northern end of the building. The side walls are lined internally with vertically-jointed tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards to dado height, and above this have early plasterboard panels with decorative [...] "classical" [...] mouldings between the timber arches.|$|R
50|$|Aboriginals {{had long}} known the Maleny district, on the Blackall Range behind Nambour, {{as an area}} where the {{important}} Bunya Pine (Araucaria bidwilli) grew. The first Europeans to live in the district were transient timber getters who heard from local Aborigines of the huge red cedar (Toona australis) trees on the Blackall Range. While timber was cut, it was not always shifted {{due to the lack of}} roads and steepness of the terrain. The first non-indigenous person to settle in the area was Isaac Burgess, who took up residence on his selection on 1 January 1872; others followed in the late 1870s. They built their homes using pit-sawn timber from their own land. Pits were dug near where the trees stood and there they were sawn down to scantlings and boardings, <b>and</b> afterwards planed, <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> by hand as required. As the red cedar was cut out attention turned to the beech trees and Maleny pioneers of the timber industry include Isaac Burgess, Francis and William Dunlop, Joseph McCarthy, and JD Campbell.|$|R
50|$|Internally, round {{sandstone}} piers supporting pointed arches, form arcades which {{define the}} nave and aisles of the church. Slender engaged columns extend upward from the piers {{to support a}} variation of hammer-beam timber roof trusses, strengthened with brackets of decorative joinery. The ceiling is diagonally boarded, tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove,</b> v-jointed <b>timber.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{accommodates}} the entrance vestibule, manager's office and private quarters, {{dining room and}} former sitting room, and public bar. The ground floor plan works off the entrance vestibule from which a fine timber stair rises to the guest accommodation on the first floor. From the vestibule, the dining room is entered {{to the left and}} the manager's quarters/office to the right. The vestibule runs through to the rear verandah which accommodates toilets at each end. Partitions to the ground floor rooms are post and rail construction lined with vertical tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> boards. All the public rooms, including the bay window space in the public bar, have decorative pressed metal ceilings, ceiling roses and cornices except the rear section of the public bar where the ceiling is lined with tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards.|$|R
50|$|At the {{southern}} end of the core building is another early 20th century timber extension. This has a pyramid roof clad in corrugated iron., and external chamferboards narrower than those of the 1870s section. Like the core and the northern wing, {{the southern}} extension also rests on timber stumps, but at a greater height than the core, and there are steps leading down to the foyer connecting this extension to the 1870s building. The southern extension comprises one large room - living room/ball room/billiard room - with a high, coved ceiling lined in narrow tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boarding. In the eastern wall is a bay window overlooking the garden, and glass doors opening onto the southern verandah of the house core.|$|R
