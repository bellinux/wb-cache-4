These methods require multiple incubation steps and {{take a long time}} to results. An improved rapid flow-cytometry based detection method was developed, using a fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide probe specifically binding a 16 S rRNA sequence. The method positively detected 51 E. coli isolates as well as 4 Shigella species. All 27 non-E. coli strains tested gave negative results. Comparison of the new genetic assay with a <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> (<b>TPC)</b> assay and agar plate counting indicated similar sensitivity, agreement between cytometry cell and colony counts. This method can detect a small number of E. coli cells in the presence of large numbers of other bacteria. This method can be used for rapid, economical, and stable detection of E. coli and Shigella contamination in the food industry and other contexts...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} {{the effect of}} chitosan coating on shelf life extension of salmon (Salmo salar) fillets. The success of edible coatings depends highly on their effective wetting capacity of the surfaces on which they are applied. In this context in a first stage the surface properties of salmon fillets and the wetting capacity of the coatings on fish were evaluated. In terms of wettability {{there were no significant}} differences (p > 0. 05) between the solutions presenting higher values (solutions 1 − 4); therefore, solution 1 with a spreading coefficient (Ws) of − 4. 73 mN m− 1, was chosen to be subsequently analyzed and applied on fish fillets. For shelf life analyses the fillets were coated and stored at 0 °C for 18 days. The control and coated fish samples were analyzed periodically for <b>total</b> aerobic <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> (<b>TPC),</b> pH, <b>total</b> volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), trimethylamine (TMA), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), and ATP breakdown products (K value). The results showed that fish samples coated with chitosan presented a significant reduction (p < 0. 05) for pH and K value after 6 days and for TVB, TMA, and TBA values after 9 days of storage, when compared to control samples. In terms of microbial growth, a slower increase in TPC was observed for the coated fish, indicating that chitosan-based coatings were effective in extending for an additional 3 days the shelf life of the salmon. These results demonstrate that chitosan-based coatings may be an alternative for extending the shelf life of salmon fillets during storage at 0 °C.

40|$|Chilled seafood is {{considered}} to have a short quality shelflife {{when compared to other}} protein alternatives. Quality deterioration evidenced by high microbial counts, textural degradation and exudates loss affects palatability and subsequently consumer satisfaction and confidence. Australian produced chilled seafood competes directly for market share with other fresh protein products. Consumer demand, price, repeat purchasing and resultant business viability is based on customer satisfaction achieved at the point of consumption. Barriers to seafood consumption include concerns regarding product origin, freshness and difficulty in evaluating seafood quality. Chilled seafood goes through complex distribution channels before reaching the retail consumer, which can allow quality deterioration to occur. Consequently, one of the most challenging tasks for the seafood industry is controlling product quality and consistency throughout the supply chain. This research defined best practices for the handling, processing and storage of chilled seafood throughout the supply chain and applied these to 4 Australian species. Flathead (Platycephalus bassensis), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), southern calamari (Sepioteuthis australis) and abalone (Haliotis rubra) were packed in modified atmospheres comprising primarily CO 2 and in air before storage at temperatures of 0 °C and no more than 5 °C (maximum regulatory limit). To date, few published studies specifically related to the species considered in this study or conducted in the Australian context could be located on spoilage rates and quality indicators over time. Consequently, no maximum quality benchmark exists that will enable assessment of supply chain performance. Microbial spoilage and temperature are cited as the most significant factors impacting on seafood shelflife. This study applied the principles of hurdle technology throughout the supply chain to disrupt microbial growth in order to extend the lag phase and minimise microbial effects on quality shelflife. The effectiveness of treatments was evaluated by microbial, chemical, textural and sensory parameters from harvest to spoilage. To facilitate comparison between storage temperatures the equivalent days on ice was calculated for each species. The quality shelflife of modified atmosphere packed (MAP) product stored at 0 °C was determined as 21 days for flathead, 20 days for Atlantic salmon, 19 - 20 days for squid and 21 days for abalone. Corresponding microbial <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> (<b>TPC)</b> colony forming units per gram (CFU/g) were flathead 1. 4 x 103 CFU/g, Atlantic salmon 2. 9 x 104 CFU/g, squid 2. 8 x 103 CFU/g, abalone 2 x 102 CFU/g. It was concluded that microbial spoilage was not the primary factor limiting quality shelflife for any of the species stored in MAP at 0 °C. Instead, the primary factors that limited quality shelflife were identified as autolytic spoilage reducing texture, and nucleotide degradation adversely affecting flavour. The impact on shelflife of storage at temperatures of 0 °C and 5 °C or less was investigated. The time taken for microbial counts for the 4 species to reach 107 CFU/g when air stored at 5 °C, or air stored at 0 °C or MA packed at 5 °C was respectively: Flathead 9 days: 18 days and 19 to 20 days. Atlantic salmon: 9 days; 16 days and 17 days. Southern calamari: 10 days, 17 and 20 days. Abalone: 10 days, 21 days and 25 days. Samples held in air at storage temperatures of 5 °C or less (mean 4. 7 °C) had approximately 50...|$|R

Jatropha leaf macerated in stages ranging from hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol. Results of preliminary research note that the ethyl acetate extract and methanol with a concentration of 1 % (w / v) is the best extract that provides antibacterial activity against several of histamine-forming bacteria. In this experiment, frigate tuna were divided into 3 groups, group 1 was soaked for 30 minutes in water, group 2 soaked for 30 minutes in a solution of ethyl acetate extract of leaf jatropha with a concentration of 1 %, and group 3 was soaked for 30 minutes in a solution of methanol extract of leaf jatropha with a concentration of 1 %. After that, frigate tuna stored {{at room temperature for}} 5 hours, then analyzed the number of bacterial colony with <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> method (<b>TPC),</b> number of histamine-forming bacteria and histamine levels. The results showed that the value of TPC the frigate tuna its soaked in water are log 6. 68 (cfu / g), soaked in a solution of ethyl acetate extract are log 4. 94 (cfu / g) and soaked in a solution of methanol extract are log 5. 61 (cfu / g). The number of histamine-forming bacteria in the frigate tuna its soaked in water are log 5. 62 (cfu / g), soaked in a solution of ethyl acetate extract are log 4. 40 (cfu / g) and soaked in a solution of methanol extract are log 5. 54 (cfu / g). histamine levels of the frigate tuna its soaked in water are 17. 73 mg / kg, soaked in a solution of ethyl acetate extract are 11. 07 mg / kg and soaked in a solution of methanol extract are 14. 02 mg / kg.
