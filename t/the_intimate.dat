5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only <b>the</b> <b>intimate</b> association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, <b>the</b> <b>intimate</b> connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about pre-sequence, utterances {{which are usually}} used before announcing, arranging, inviting, {{requesting}} and closing something. More specifically, this study focused on the conversations of three English Department students with intimate and distant interlocutors. The writer {{would like to know}} whether there was any difference in using the pre-sequence between the students and the two kinds of interlocutors when they were having conversations. In analyzing the data, she used Levinson?s (1983) theory of pre-sequence and its classification. For the findings, the writer found that all types of pre-sequence, that is, pre-announcement, pre-arrangement, pre-invitation, pre-request and pre-closing, were used by the students and their interlocutors, <b>the</b> <b>intimates</b> and <b>the</b> distants. Furthermore, pre-request was used more frequently between <b>the</b> <b>intimates.</b> Meanwhile, pre-announcement was used more frequently by the subjects and the distant interlocutors. Besides, the writer also found that both <b>the</b> <b>intimates</b> and <b>the</b> distants used almost the same total numbers of pre-sequence. Hence, the writer could conclude that <b>the</b> stereotype about <b>intimates</b> that tended to use direct utterances, and distants that tended to use indirect utterances did not really happen in this study...|$|R

Each concert had drawn in approximately 2,000 audience members in Australia, and was deemed a commercial success by the Australian media.

5|$|By 1931, Fraser had {{successfully}} passed her medical examinations and become licensed. Two years later, Fraser became a part-time lecturer {{and then in}} 1934 was promoted to full-time lecturer in the department. Around the same time, in 1933, Williams moved to the farm full-time, returning to Toronto only on weekends. In 1937, she was finally accepted into the Ontario Veterinary College and that same year, Fraser's mother died. Williams graduated in 1941 and she began practicing as a veterinarian. For the first time, the two women acquired a home together, living in Toronto. They took in a foster child, Jenny Rodd, a war refugee from England, who remained with them until the war ended. Rising homophobia during the war-years, which carried into the 1950s and 1960s led the couple to hide <b>the</b> <b>intimate</b> nature of their relationship from their ward and present an ambiguous relationship to the greater society, limiting their social life to those who knew them best.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were still wearing highly structured undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of the}} miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While <b>the</b> <b>intimate</b> apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
