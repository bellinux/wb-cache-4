5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E

5|$|From the 21st Dynasty onward, more {{copies of}} the Book of the Dead are found in hieratic script.

5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece.

5|$|The {{town has}} had a council since 1292, when it was granted a {{constitution}} under the Holy Roman Empire. The constitution shaped the local political system until the French Revolution of 1789. Since then, the town has been administered as all the other communes of France. Its council currently comprises 33 councillors, whose number is defined by law according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population. The town also has a mayor elected by the councillors.|$|E

5|$|A report {{commissioned}} by the Ministry of Defence in 1995 {{made a number of}} recommendations for financial savings in the armed forces' budget, one of which was the abolition of the five-star ranks. Part of the rationale was that these ranks were disproportionate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forces commanded by these officers and that none of the United Kingdom's close allies, such as the United States (which reserves the rank of general of the army for officers who have commanded large armies in major wars), used such ranks. The recommendation was not taken up in full, but the practice of promoting service chiefs to five-star ranks was stopped and the ranks are now reserved for special circumstances. Sir Peter Inge was, in 1994, the last active officer to be promoted to the rank. Inge relinquished the post of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) in 1997 and his successor, Sir Charles Guthrie, was the first officer not to be promoted upon appointment as CDS.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Commonwealth, several new types of military units were introduced. First among these were the registered Cossacks, formed in 1578. These were the troops made up of Cossacks, paid for their service and not subject to serfdom. Their numbers varied from about 500 to many times that number, with the Treaty of Zboriv setting the record at 40,477. The Cossacks' refusal to submit to serfdom, and the Commonwealth's nobility attempts to force them into it led to much political wrangling with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cossack register, and to numerous Cossack uprisings, particularly in the 17th century. These weakened the state, and eventually led to the Cossack subjugation and destruction by the Russian Empire. In addition to the Cossack formations, another group that provided notable service to the Polish state were the Tatars, some of whom resided in Lithuania, and were Commonwealth subjects. Known as Lipka Tatars, they provided some light and medium cavalry units for the Lithuanian army.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{responded by}} putting {{commercial}} pressure on shipping companies {{to abandon the}} Glamorganshire Canal and using his feudal rights to force shippers to move their wharfs to his docks. His efforts paid off and although trade through the docks only came to 8,000 tons in 1839, they then rose quickly, reaching 827,000 tons by 1849. Between 1841 and 1848 the docks brought in a gross income of just under £68,000, a relatively disappointing figure compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investment. Successive marquesses would find themselves under huge pressure to continue investing and expanding in the docks and subsequent phases of construction over the coming decades.|$|E
