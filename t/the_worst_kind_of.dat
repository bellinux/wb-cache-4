40|$|Restorative and {{responsive}} justice {{can be a}} strategy of social work practice that builds democracy bottom-up by seeing families as building blocks of democracy and fonts of democratic sentiment. At the same time, because families are sites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> tyranny and <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> neglect, a {{rule of law is}} needed that imposes public human rights obligations on families. The republican ideal is that this rule of law that constrains people in families should come from the people. Restorative {{and responsive}} justice has a strategy for the justice of the people to bubble up into the justice of the law and for the justice of the law to filter down into the justice of the people. The role of the social worker is to be a bridge across which both those democratic impulses are enabled to flow. The empowering side of the social work role fits the first side of the duality where the will of families bubble up; the coercive side of the social work role fits the second where the justice of the law filters down. Key words: social work, responsive regulation, restorative justice, demo...|$|R

The section of the valley patrolled by the Anzac Mounted Division was crossed by the wadis Auja, Mellahah, Nueiameh and the Kelt as well as the Jordan River with several extensive marshes in the jungle on its banks. The nullahs were astonishingly deep, usually with dense vegetation and quite big trees.

Because merger means change. And change means fear. And <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fear is the kind that lives in your head. The dark thoughts. The paranoia. The worst case scenarios that you play out that usually don't come true. And with Richard holing himself up inside his office, it's just a breeding ground for rumor, fear and paranoia.

500|$|Some people {{interpreted}} the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black {{hole at the}} center of our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*), creating havoc on Earth. Apart from the [...] "galactic alignment" [...] already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it. Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System. This reading of the alignment was included on the History Channel documentary Decoding the Past. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as [...] "45minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> inane sensationalism".|$|E

GameSpy writer Craig Pearson stated that the game [...] "displays astonishing design ineptitude and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> microtransactions in gaming, all in one ugly package". Eurogamer's Rich Stanton gave it 3 out of 10, calling it [...] "a real disaster" [...] and criticized both the game's design and the developer's ethics.

Fey wanted to cancel the show but was flying to Denver from the US Festival in California with Morris when the decision to continue was made. After arriving in Denver, Fey called the amphitheatre asking to where the concert was being moved, unaware that the band had decided to proceed with the show. Guitarist the Edge said that when Fey learned of the group's decision, he could not believe it. The Edge said, [...] "I don't think he'd ever heard anything quite so crazy in his life, going on with an outdoor show in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> weather, rain and wind in the mountains. He thought we'd lost our minds completely." [...] Bono went on the radio that day to confirm that the Red Rocks concert was still taking place, and to promote a concert that the band planned for the following night at the CU Events Center to accommodate fans who were unable to attend the Red Rocks show. Clayton said during the band's radio interviews, [...] "We know it's raining now but we're sure it won't be when the show starts, so please come." [...] Two hours before the concert, the downpour subsided and settled into a misty drizzle. The 9,000-person venue had sold out, but because of the inclement weather, only about 4,400 fans attended.|$|E

[...] During the war, more people were lost due to casualties. The government sought to resupply its labor force by systematically abducting 96,000 civilians from the South. The Korean Armistice required both sides to facilitate their return home. The North kept most of those abductees, assigning them to the lower social class (songbun), forcing upon them <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> labor and life, and permanently severing any contact with their relatives in the South.|$|E

Elst, on the other hand questions Nanda's motive behind shielding Abrahamic monotheism and suggests she attaches moral superiority to it.

50|$|Computer security, {{also known}} as {{cybersecurity}} or IT security, is security applied to computing devices such as computers and smartphones, as well as computer networks such as private and public networks, including the whole Internet. The field includes all five components: hardware, software, data, people, and procedures by which digital equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction, and is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance of computer systems in most societies. It includes physical security to prevent theft of equipment and information security to protect the data on that equipment. Those terms generally do not refer to physical security, but a common belief among computer security experts is that a physical security breach is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> security breaches as it generally allows full access to both data and equipment.|$|R

2500|$|Boam {{graduated}} from UCLA in 1973, with a Master of Fine Arts degree. He {{got a job}} as a film booker for Paramount Pictures, where he kept track of film prints and made sure the movies were distributed to the correct theaters. All the while, he was writing scripts, trying to land a screenwriting job. Of the work at Paramount, Boam said, [...] "I was... in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Siberia in Hollywood." [...] He switched from Paramount to the film distribution office at 20th Century Fox, where he earned $200 a week. In 1976, Froug helped him get an agent, and some of his scripts were shopped around Hollywood. He got a flurry of meetings with film studio executives and producers, eventually meeting producer Tony Bill. Bill offered to pay Boam the same $200 per week he was making at Fox, but instead write screenplays. Bill's stipulation was that he get a free option on whatever was written. Before Boam entered into that arrangement, one of his scripts was optioned by director-producer Ulu Grosbard. This became Boam's first Hollywood writing job.|$|E

George Bernard Shaw wrote of the [...] "childishly egotistical character of her acting, which is not the art of making you think more highly or feel more deeply but the art of making you admire her, pity her, champion her, weep with her, laugh at her jokes, follow her fortunes breathlessly and applaud her widely when the curtain falls... It is the art of fooling you." [...] Ivan Turgenev wrote: [...] "All she has is a marvelous voice. The rest is cold, false, and affected; <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> repulsive chic Parisienne!" [...] Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov, then a young medical student, was paying for his studies by writing reviews for a Moscow newspaper. He stated that [...] "We are far from admiring the talent of Sarah Bernhardt.

Ever a frugal sort, Reacher travels mostly by hitchhiking (as he does at the beginning of “A Wanted Man” and 2001’s “Echo Burning,” both set roughly in the time they were written), even though the practice is roughly as current as bellbottoms and even though his appearance is, as previously established, notably simian. (Not that this deters a series of smart, attractive young women, most of them officers of the law, from jumping into bed with him.) And although he’s a loner who seems never so happy — rather like Agent Cooper in “Twin Peaks” — as when sitting quietly in a diner with a cup of black coffee and a piece of pie, he has an uncanny knack for stumbling into <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> trouble, almost none of it connected to himself." ...|$|R

In the international protests that followed came one from Germany, from none other than Joseph Goebbels. Although productions of Shakespeare's plays in Germany itself were subject to 'streamlining', he continued to be favoured as a great classical dramatist, especially so as almost every new German play since the late 1890s onwards was portrayed by German government propaganda {{as the work of}} left-wingers, of Jews or of [...] "degenerates" [...] <b>of</b> one <b>kind</b> or another.

40|$|It {{seems that}} the years of mankind {{struggle}} against poverty have ended to a symbolic belief: "We must empower people to stand up against poverty". Empowering people depends on the equal access to cultural, economical, and political opportunities. Equal accessibility to information and knowledge sources, has {{a key role in}} developing and maintaining those equal situations. Information can create money, power, and knowledge, and increase human capability. So, any inequality in information distribution is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> discrimination, which leads to ever-lasting poverty. The central premise of this research is that E-Government can act as a facilitator for equal access to information, empower people in all aspects of social arenas, and as a result, strengthen the poverty eradication process. To explain this hypothesis, a model was introduced, which showed how discrimination leads to poverty and inactive participation in social life. In another model, empowerment, equal access to opportunities, and their impacts on poverty eradication were developed. Finally, a comprehensive model emphasizing on the unique affect of e-government on reforming the public involvement level was suggested. The model shows how e-government results in proactive participation of people in social arenas and public policy processes...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{some critics}} viewed the album's sound as unoriginal and dated. Johnny Dee of Virgin Media said [...] "Flesh Tone marks a thrilling {{comeback}} ...

[...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquenmani was more critical of Kelis' direction towards dance music, stating that the album [...] "sounds dated in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> way—that is, not enough to sound retro-cool, but enough to sound totally uncool. It helps that the album ... segued together with interludes that are {{more interesting than the}} actual songs. Flesh Tone should sound desperate, but it often sounds inspired instead. Kelis seems electrified by her new genre shift, and the result is an album that's one of her most consistent to date." [...] Kaya Burgess of The Times pointed out that 'Acapella' and 'Home' are the only tracks which [...] "stand out from an otherwise rather copy-and-paste collection of electronic numbers". Magaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times expressed that Kelis has managed to [...] "make a spirited but disciplined set of classic Euro-club bangers. Sometimes they're darkly contemplative, slipping into trance; other times they nearly rip at the seams ... it's clear that Kelis has carved out a new niche for herself, dancing in front of the turntables till the lights come on, if they dare." [...] Sam Richards of Uncut complimented its fusion of [...] "R sass to thumping club beats" [...] and stated [...] "most everything Kelis touches drips with class". Gavin Haynes of the NME felt that [...] "Flesh Tone has already filled out an application form for pop record of the year" [...] and stated, [...] "Her ability to appear unimpeachably cool hasn't wavered either.

Such people had committed their crimes in an unmanly and stealthy way. Additionally, they may have avoided taking responsibility for their actions. Such behaviour made an otherwise redeemable act irredeemable. This norm for proper conduct is firmly rooted in pre-Christian notions, and the Church {{used it as a}} platform {{to make it easier for}} the populace to understand that whereas most people belonged within the churchyard, others clearly did not. With some modifications during the high Middle Ages, typically when additional categories of criminals were excluded from Christian burial, this principle carried through well into the early modern period. Documents which can tell us how these rules worked out in practice are few and far between, but are enough to show that the Church tried to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> outlaws remained out of the churchyard.
