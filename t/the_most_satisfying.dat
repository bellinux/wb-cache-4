5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>satisfying</b> {{moments in}} the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers {{appreciated}} the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

25|$|Chamber music {{does not}} figure {{prominently}} in Tchaikovsky's compositional output. Other than {{a number of}} student exercises, it consists of three string quartets, a piano trio and a string sextet, along with three works for violin and piano. While all these works contain some excellent music, the First String Quartet, with its famous Andante cantabile slow movement, shows such mastery of quartet form that some consider it <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>satisfying</b> of Tchaikovsky's chamber works in its consistency of style and artistic interest. While the Second String Quartet is less engaging than the First and less characterful than the Third, its slow movement is a substantial and particularly affecting piece. Some critics consider the Third String Quartet the most impressive, especially for its elegiac slow movement.|$|E

25|$|On April 2, 2010, Bryant {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} extension worth $87million. Bryant finished the regular season missing four of the final five games, due to injuries to his knee and finger. Bryant suffered multiple injuries throughout the season and as a result, missed nine games. The Lakers began the playoffs as the number one seed in the Western Conference against the Oklahoma City Thunder, eventually defeating them in six games. The Lakers swept the Utah Jazz {{in the second round}} and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they faced the Phoenix Suns. In Game 2, Bryant finished the game with 13 assists, setting a new playoff career high; it was the most assists by a Laker in the playoffs since Magic Johnson had 13 in 1996. The Lakers {{went on to win the}} series in six games capturing the Western Conference Championship and advancing to the NBA Finals for a third straight season. In a rematch against the 2008 Champion Boston Celtics, Bryant, despite shooting 6 for 24 from the field, led the Lakers back from a thirteen-point third quarter deficit in Game 7 to win the championship; he scored 10 of his game-high 23 points in the fourth quarter, and finished the game with 15 rebounds. Bryant won his fifth championship and earned his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP award. This marked the first time the Lakers won a Game 7 against the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. Bryant said that this was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>satisfying</b> of all of his five championships.|$|E

500|$|Larry Purvis' {{character}} arc, overcoming victimization and heroically sacrificing {{himself to}} defeat his captor, was well received by critics. In From Alien to the Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney calls the arc one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>satisfying</b> elements of Alien Resurrection; an otherwise-unremarkable, universally disrespected character ensures {{the survival of}} the protagonists and gives Wren poetic justice.

500|$|In {{the romantic}} comedy Love & Friendship, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2016, Beckinsale reunited with her Last Days of Disco {{collaborators}} Stillman and Sevigny. The film revolved around her character, a wry and calculating woman named Lady Susan, as she pursues a wealthy and hapless man for marriage originally intended for her daughter, though she eventually marries him herself. The film was universally acclaimed by critics and found commercial success in arthouse cinemas. Justin Chang of Variety described the role as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>satisfying</b> screen roles {{of her career}} Beckinsale magnetizes the screen {{in a way that}} naturally underscores how far ahead of everyone else she is: an effect that doesn’t always work to the movie’s advantage."

500|$|Chrono Trigger used a 32-megabit ROM {{cartridge}} with battery-backed RAM for saved games, lacking special on-cartridge coprocessors. The Japanese {{release of}} Chrono Trigger included art for the game's ending and running counts of {{items in the}} player's status menu. Developers created the North American version before adding these features to the original build, inadvertently leaving in vestiges of Chrono Triggers early development (such as the piece [...] "Singing Mountain"). Hironobu Sakaguchi asked translator Ted Woolsey to localize Chrono Trigger for English audiences and gave him roughly thirty days to work. Lacking {{the help of a}} modern translation team, he memorized scenarios and looked at drafts of commercial player's guides to put dialogue in context. Woolsey later reflected that he would have preferred two-and-a-half months, and blames his rushed schedule on the prevailing attitude in Japan that games were children's toys rather than serious works. Some of his work was cut due to space constraints, though he still considered Trigger [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>satisfying</b> games [...] ever worked on or played". Nintendo of America censored certain dialogue, including references to breastfeeding, consumption of alcohol, and religion. Square shipped Trigger with two world maps, and Japanese buyers who preordered received holographic foil cards.|$|E

Onyett wrote, [...] "Valve knows how a good co-operative mode requires a game design that doesn't simply encourage but requires you to work together. In Portal 2, communication is vital to success". Several reviewers praised the non-verbal cues that players could initiate to work with their partners. Portal 2 was praised {{for the amount of}} detail in its design, sound, and music. Nelson credited the [...] "sheer amount of detail" [...] put into the game's world, and wrote, [...] "it all feels very real and natural with brief moments where you're simply sucked into this world".
