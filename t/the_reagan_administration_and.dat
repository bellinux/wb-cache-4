5|$|The United Kingdom and France are {{not part}} of the NATO E-3A Component, instead {{procuring}} E-3 aircraft through a joint project. The UK and France operate their E-3 aircraft independently of each other and of NATO. The UK operates six aircraft (with a seventh now retired) and France operates four aircraft, all fitted with the newer CFM56-2 engines. The British requirement came about following the cancellation of the British Aerospace Nimrod AEW3 project to replace the Avro Shackleton AEW2 during the 1980s. The UK E-3 order was placed in February 1987, with deliveries starting in 1990. The other operator of the type, delivered between June 1986 and September 1987, is Saudi Arabia which operates five aircraft, all fitted with CFM56-2 engines. This particular sale was hotly contested between <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> opponents of the sale.|$|E

25|$|Wilkerson {{spent some}} {{years in the}} United States Navy's Pacific Command in South Korea, Japan and Hawaii, where he was well {{regarded}} by his superiors. These recommendations led in early 1989 to a successful interview to become the assistant to Colin Powell, who was then finishing his stint as National Security Advisor in <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> moving to {{a position in the}} United States Army Forces Command at Fort McPherson. He continued this supporting role as Powell became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff through the Gulf War, following Powell into civilian life and then back into public service when President George W.

25|$|After a 1976 {{report by}} the United States National Academy of Sciences {{concluded}} that credible scientific evidence supported the ozone depletion hypothesis a few countries, including the United States, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, moved to eliminate the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans. At the time this was widely regarded {{as a first step}} towards a more comprehensive regulation policy, but progress in this direction slowed in subsequent years, due to a combination of political factors (continued resistance from the halocarbon industry and a general change in attitude towards environmental regulation during {{the first two years of}} <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration)</b> <b>and</b> scientific developments (subsequent National Academy assessments that indicated that the first estimates of the magnitude of ozone depletion had been overly large).|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Congress {{authorized}} {{an overhaul}} of the system between Washington and Boston. Called the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project (NECIP), it included safety improvements, modernization of the signaling system by General Railway Signal, and new Centralized Electrification and Traffic Control (CETC) control centers by Chrysler at Philadelphia, New York and Boston. It allowed more trains to run faster and closer together, and set the stage for later high-speed operation. NECIP also introduced the AEM-7 locomotive, which lowered travel times between cities and became the most successful engine on the Corridor. The NECIP set travel time goals of 2 hours and 40 minutes between Washington and New York, and 3 hours and 40 minutes between Boston and New York. These goals were not met because of the low level of funding provided by <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>and</b> Congress in the 1980s.|$|E

It was less successful than Kramer's previous play, The Normal Heart, possibly due to its sharply political tone.|$|R

In 1991, the author Kitty Kelley wrote an unauthorized and largely uncited biography about Reagan, repeating accounts of a poor relationship with her children, and introducing rumors of alleged sexual relations with singer Frank Sinatra.

Upon his return to Panama, however, {{stepped down from the}} presidency after a confrontation with Noriega. He was replaced by Vice President Eric Arturo Delvalle. Barletta was highly regarded in <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>and</b> his removal brought a downturn in the relations between the U.S. and Noriega. The U.S. response included reducing economic assistance and pressuring Panama to reform its banking secrecy laws, crack down on narcotics trafficking, investigate the murder of Spadafora, and reduce the FDP's role in the government.|$|E

The following day, the White House delivered to the committee hundreds of other such files related to White House employees of <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>and</b> George H. W.

500|$|In {{addition}} to escalating its military support for UNITA, <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> its conservative allies also worked to expand recognition of Savimbi {{as a key}} U.S. ally in an important Cold War struggle. In January 1986, Reagan invited Savimbi to {{a meeting at the}} White House. Following the meeting, Reagan spoke of UNITA as winning a victory that [...] "electrifies the world". Two months later, Reagan announced the delivery of Stinger surface-to-air missiles as part of the $25million in aid UNITA received from the U.S. government. Jeremias Chitunda, UNITA's representative to the U.S., became the Vice President of UNITA in August 1986 at the sixth party congress. Fidel Castro made Crocker's proposal—the withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and Namibia—a prerequisite to Cuban withdrawal from Angola on 10 September.|$|E
500|$|The {{choice of}} Ferraro {{was viewed as}} a gamble, and pundits were {{uncertain}} whether it would result in a net gain or loss of votes for the Mondale campaign. While her choice was popular among Democratic activists, polls immediately after the announcement showed that only 22percent of women were excited about Ferraro's selection, versus 18percent who agreed that it was a [...] "bad idea". By a three-to-one margin, voters thought that pressure from women's groups had led to Mondale's decision rather than his having chosen the best available candidate. Nonetheless, {{in the days after the}} convention Ferraro proved an effective campaigner, with a brash and confident style that forcefully criticized <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> sometimes almost overshadowed Mondale. Mondale had been 16points behind Reagan in polls before the pick, and after the convention he pulled even for a short time.|$|E

500|$|McCarthy's {{refusal to}} endorse Humphrey wavered {{somewhat}} by October, {{as the former}} candidate laid out conditions for the Democratic nominee. These included a shift in his stance on the Vietnam War, a change of the military draft, and a reform of the Democratic machine politics. Humphrey discussed the demands with McCarthy via telephone, and responded that he was [...] "not prone to start meeting conditions," [...] but that he is stating his [...] "own case" [...] as a candidate. At the end of October, McCarthy {{announced that he would}} vote for Humphrey, but would go no further than that. Nixon eventually won the election, and McCarthy received 20,721 write-in votes in California. and 2,751 in Arizona, where he was listed as the nominee of the anti-war New Party. McCarthy also ran for the Democratic nomination in 1972, but soon dropped out. He mounted an independent campaign in 1976 and received over 700,000 votes.

500|$|Several {{historians and}} {{commentators}} hold {{the view that}} Bush {{was one of the}} most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a [...] "transformative" [...] one, and said that [...] "some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on". Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as [...] "the most noteworthy president since FDR" [...] and said that the Patriot Act [...] "increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" [...] as evidence. Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>and</b> his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society. Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.|$|E
