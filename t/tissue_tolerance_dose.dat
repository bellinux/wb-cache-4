40|$|Abstract Background To assess {{brachytherapy}} catheter {{positioning accuracy}} and {{to evaluate the}} effects of prolonged irradiation time on the tolerance dose of normal liver parenchyma following single-fraction irradiation with 192 Ir. Materials and methods Fifty patients with 76 malignant liver tumors treated by computed tomography (CT) -guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) {{were included in the}} study. The prescribed radiation dose was delivered by 1 - 11 catheters with exposure times in the range of 844 - 4432 seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets for assessing irradiation effects on normal liver tissue, edema, and hepatocyte dysfunction, obtained 6 and 12 weeks after HDR-BT, were merged with 3 D dosimetry data. The isodose of the treatment plan covering the same volume as the irradiation effect was taken as a surrogate for the liver <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose.</b> Catheter positioning accuracy was assessed by calculating the shift between the 3 D center coordinates of the irradiation effect volume and the tolerance dose volume for 38 irradiation effects in 30 patients induced by catheters implanted in nearly parallel arrangement. Effects of prolonged irradiation were assessed in areas where the irradiation effect volume and tolerance dose volume did not overlap (mismatch areas) by using a catheter contribution index. This index was calculated for 48 irradiation effects induced by at least two catheters in 44 patients. Results Positioning accuracy of the brachytherapy catheters was 5 - 6 mm. The orthogonal and axial shifts between the center coordinates of the irradiation effect volume and the tolerance dose volume in relation to the direction vector of catheter implantation were highly correlated and in first approximation identically in the T 1 -w and T 2 -w MRI sequences (p = 0. 003 and p p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 004, respectively). There was a significant shift of the irradiation effect towards the catheter entry site compared with the planned dose distribution (p p Conclusions Positioning accuracy of brachytherapy catheters is sufficient for clinical practice. Reduced tolerance dose in areas exposed to prolonged irradiation is contradictory to results published in the current literature. Effects of prolonged dose administration on the liver tolerance dose for treatment times of up to 60 minutes per HDR-BT session are not pronounced compared to effects of positioning accuracy of the brachytherapy catheters and are therefore of minor importance in treatment planning. </p...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Biomedical Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009. The main {{objective}} of radiotherapy is to completely eradicate tumours while preserving {{the integrity of}} the normal surrounding tissue. The severity of normal tissue reactions varies considerably amongst individuals. Following the same treatment regime for individuals with identical tumours in terms of location, pathology and size might result in adverse tissue reactions for some while others may experience no adverse reactions. Based on this principle some individuals who are more radiosensitive than others are receiving beyond normal <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>doses</b> while others, who are more radioresistant, receive sub-tolerance doses. These differences in response to radiation are a concern for both the patient and the oncologist. For these reasons it is essential to predict individual responses to radiotherapy in order to optimise the treatment regime for each patient. The development of predictive assays for normal tissue reactions are in the early stages and not routinely used in laboratories. Qualities of a predictive assay should include the capacity to distinguish between small changes in individual radiosensitivity. These assays should also be easy and quick to perform {{so that it can be}} employed during the initial treatment planning phase for therapy. Also, the assay should be inexpensive enough to be used on a daily basis in the clinic...|$|R

After determining <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> of drugs in pilot study, 24 male rats were divided to four groups: ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycine, vinblastin, dacarbazine) group, ChlVPP (chlorambucil, vinblastin, procarbazine, prednisolone) group and two control groups one for each treatment group. One half of the lethal dose for 50 % of population (LD 50) was used for treatment of animals in each protocol. Testes and epididymis tissues were examined for structural changes and serum testosterone level was measured by Lission (chemiluminescence method). Body weight, testis and epididymis weights, in treated rats were significantly less than their control groups specifically in ABVD group was less than ChlVPP group. Decreasing of mean diameter of seminiferous tubules, height of spermatogenic cells and diameter of epididymis in caput, corpus and cauda in ABVD group were significantly more than ChlVPP and control group. The serum testosterone level in ABVD group was significantly less than ChlVPP and control group. According to this study results, the ChlVPP had fewer impairment effects than ABVD on testis and epididymis <b>tissue</b> in <b>tolerance</b> <b>doses</b> on male rats' reproductive system.

40|$|Non-malignant {{radiotherapy}} is medical exposure, {{which is}} done with benign disease after exhausting all other standard treatments. Its goal is relief from problems caused by benign disease, or prevents deterioration of function of the affected organ. The main difference between the radiation treatments of malignant versus non-malignant diseases is {{in the size of}} the received dose and irradiation techniques. For irradiation of malignant diseases, often approaching <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>doses,</b> while those used in non-malignant radiation therapy are significantly lower. These results in simpler techniques of irradiation, often get by with one or two input fields. The main principle of non-malignant radiotherapy is applied as the smallest and most effective individual and total dose into the smallest possible volume of tissue, then use simple techniques (direct one field, or two opposite), if necessary, take the form of individual treatment of irradiated fields, focus the radiation beam from the body of the patient from a radiosensitive organs, using all methods of radiation protection (for example lead shielding of the testes in men, lead collar on the neck, etc.), patient age should not be less than 40 years, younger patients should be treated like this after considering the benefits relation to the possible consequences. The patient is sent to the radiotherapy on the advice of another field. Indication for radiotherapy is entirely the responsibility of the radiation oncologist. Prescriber physician recommendation states that it is a state in which all other treatment methods are exhausted or not applicable. The physician takes into account contraindications treatment, the overall condition of the patient and his age. The patient is on treatment and possible side effects informed by the doctor before starting treatment with signed informed consent to treatment. To indicate a treatment planning is necessary history and other investigations in relation to the disease. After completion of radiotherapy department of radiation oncology ensures borreliosis acute flare reaction. The department will evaluate whether the radiation prescription and treatment plan followed. The patient is a report on the treatment handed over to the care of the sending physician. In this thesis is the research question: Causes the development of therapeutic modalities reduction of treatments of nonmalignant radiotherapy? To answer this research question was obtained data from the archive and irradiation protocols of radiotherapy departments of hospitals in the České Budějovice and in the Jihlava. It was the data of non-malignant indications for radiotherapy conducted in 1979, 1980, 2012 and 2013, irradiation parameters and techniques. In the České Budějovice in 1979 - 1980 were treated 1471 patients and 854 patients in Jihlava. In 2012 - 2013, it was only 793 patients in the České Budějovice, which is 48. 4 % less. In the same period in Jihlava it was 413 patients which mean about 53. 9 % less.

Methods Twenty patients with liver metastases were treated repeatedly (2 - 4 times) at identical or intersecting locations by CT-guided interstitial brachytherapy with varying time intervals. Magnetic resonance imaging using the hepatocyte selective contrast media Gd-BOPTA was performed before and after treatment to determine the volume of hepatocyte function loss (called pseudolesion), and the last acquired MRI data set was merged with the dose distributions of all administered brachytherapies. We calculated the BED (biologically equivalent dose for a single dose d = 2 Gy) for different α/β values (2, 3, 10, 20, 100) based on the linear-quadratic model and estimated the <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> for liver parenchyma D 90 as the BED exposing 90 % of the pseudolesion in MRI. Results The <b>tolerance</b> <b>doses</b> D 90 after repeated brachytherapy sessions were found between 22 - 24 Gy and proved only slightly dependent on α/β in the clinically relevant range of α/β = 2 - 10 Gy. Variance analysis showed a significant dependency of D 90 with respect to the intervals between the first irradiation and the MRI control (p 90 and the pseudolesion's volume. No symptoms of liver dysfunction or other toxic effects such as abscess formation occurred during the follow-up time, neither acute nor on the long-term. Conclusions Inactivation of liver parenchyma occurs at a BED of approx. 22 - 24 Gy corresponding to a single dose of ~ 10 Gy (α/β ~ 5 Gy).

Tolerance to salinity stress can be considered to contain three main components: Na+ exclusion, tolerance to Na+ in the <b>tissues</b> and osmotic <b>tolerance.</b> To date, most experimental work on salinity tolerance in cereals has focused on Na+ exclusion due in part to its ease of measurement. It has become apparent, however, that Na+ exclusion is not the sole mechanism for salinity tolerance in cereals, and research needs to expand to study osmotic <b>tolerance</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Here, we develop assays for high throughput quantification of Na+ exclusion, Na+ <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> and osmotic tolerance in 12 Triticum monococcum accessions, mainly using commercially available image capture and analysis equipment.

Brassica napus was the most tolerant species {{in terms of the}} overall performance, with Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea being much more sensitive to salt stress with no obvious difference between them. While prominent reduction in net CO 2 assimilation was observed in both sensitive species, physiological mechanisms beyond this reduction differed strongly. Brassica juncea plants possessed high osmotolerance and were able to maintain high transpiration rate but showed a significant reduction in leaf chlorophyll content and efficiency of leaf photochemistry. On the contrary, B. oleracea plants possessed the highest (among the three species) <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> but showed a very significant stomatal limitation of photosynthesis. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that the high <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> in B. oleracea was related to the ability of leaf mesophyll cells to maintain highly negative membrane potential in the presence of high apoplastic Na(+). In addition to high osmotolerance, the most tolerant B. napus showed also lesser accumulation of toxic Na(+) and Cl(-) in the leaf, possessed moderate <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> and had a superior K(+) retention ability.

There are a number of possible mechanisms by which cereals can tolerate high levels of salinity, but these can be considered in terms of Na+ exclusion and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Na+ exclusion {{has been the focus of}} much of the recent work in wheat, but with relatively little progress to date in developing high-yielding, salt-tolerant genotypes. Using a diverse collection of bread wheat germplasm, the present study was conducted to assess the value of tissue Na+ concentration as a criterion for ST, and to determine whether ST differs with growth stage. Two experiments were conducted, the first with 38 genotypes and the second with 21 genotypes. A wide range of Na+ concentrations within the roots and shoots as well as in ST were observed in both experiments. However, maintenance of growth and yield when grown with 100 mM NaCl was not correlated with the ability of a genotype to exclude Na+ either from an individual leaf blade or from the whole shoot. The K+:Na+ ratio also showed a wide range among the genotypes, but it did not explain the variation in ST among the genotypes. The results suggested that Na+ exclusion and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> varied independently, and there was no significant relationship between Na+ exclusion and ST in bread wheat. Consequently, similar levels of ST may be achieved through different combinations of exclusion and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Breeding for improved ST in bread wheat needs to select for traits related to both exclusion and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Yusuf Genc, Glenn K.

The more salt-tolerant species accumulate Na⁺ and Cl⁻ to concentrations in leaves and roots {{that are similar to}} the external solution, thus allowing energy-efficient osmotic adjustment. Adverse effects of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ on metabolism must be avoided, resulting in a situation known as ‘tissue tolerance’. The strategy of sequestering Na⁺ and Cl⁻ in vacuoles and keeping concentrations low in the cytoplasm is an important contributor to <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Although there are clear differences between species in the ability to accommodate these ions in their leaves, it remains unknown whether there is genetic variation in this ability within a species.

40|$|Soil {{salinity}} causes osmotic and ion specific {{stresses and}} significantly affects growth, yield and productivity of wheat. The visual symptoms of salinity stressed wheat include stunted shoot growth, dark green leaves with thicker laminar surfaces, wilting and premature leaf senescence. There are three major components of salinity tolerance {{that contribute to}} plant adaptation to saline soils: osmotic tolerance, Na⁺ exclusion and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> However, to date, research into improving the salinity tolerance of wheat cultivars has focused primarily on Na⁺ exclusion and little work {{has been carried out}} on osmotic or <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> This was partly due to the subjective nature of scoring for plant health using the human eye. In this project, commercially available imaging equipment has been used to monitor and record the growth and health of salt stressed plants in a quantitative, non-biased and non-destructive way in order to dissect out the components of salinity tolerance. Using imaging technology, a high throughput salt screening protocol was developed to screen osmotic tolerance, Na⁺ exclusion and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> of 12 different accessions of einkorn wheat (T. monococcum), including parents of the existing mapping populations. Three indices were used to measure the tolerance level of each of the three major components of salinity tolerance. It was identified that different lines used different combinations of the three major salinity tolerance components as a means of increasing their overall salinity tolerance. A positive correlation was observed between a plant’s overall salinity tolerance and its proficiency in Na⁺ exclusion, osmotic <b>tolerance</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance.</b> It was also revealed that MDR 043 as the best osmotic and tissue tolerant parent and MDR 002 as a salt sensitive parent for further mapping work. Accordingly, the F₂ population of MDR 002 × MDR 043 was screened to understand the genetic basis of osmotic <b>tolerance</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> in T. monococcum. Wide variation in osmotic <b>tolerance</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> was observed amongst the progenies. The broad sense heritability for osmotic tolerance was identified as 0. 82. Similar, salinity tolerance screening assays were used to quantify and identify QTL for major components of salinity tolerance in Berkut × Krichauff DH mapping population of bread wheat (T. aestivum). Phenotyping and QTL mapping for Na⁺ exclusion and osmotic tolerance has been successfully done in this mapping population. There existed a potential genetic variability for osmotic tolerance and Na⁺ exclusion in this mapping population. The broad sense heritability of osmotic tolerance was 0. 70; whereas, it was 0. 67 for Na⁺ exclusion. The composite interval mapping (CIM) identified a total of four QTL for osmotic tolerance on 1 D, 2 D and 5 B chromosomes. For Na⁺ exclusion, CIM identified a total of eight QTL with additive effects for Na+ exclusion on chromosomes 1 B, 2 A, 2 D, 5 A, 5 B, 6 B and 7 A. However, there were QTL inconsistencies observed for both osmotic tolerance and Na⁺ exclusion across the three different experimental time of the year. It necessitates re-estimating the QTL effect and validating the QTL positions either in the same or different mapping population. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and structural integrity were characterized by longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in combination with behavioral, histologic, and biochemical assessment of NPA-preconditioned animals and controls. Using this approach we show that the ischemia-tolerant state is characterized by a lower energy charge potential and lower CBF, indicating a reduced baseline metabolic demand, and therefore a cellular mechanism of neural protection. Blood vessel density and structural integrity were not altered by NPA treatment. When subjected to MCAO, preconditioned animals had a characteristic MRI signature consisting of enhanced CBF maintenance within the ischemic territory and intraischemic reversal of the initial cytotoxic edema, resulting in reduced infarct volumes.

Furthermore, with an adequate calibration, these images can be used to better assess the <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> of bone marrow and to correlate the absorbed dose to bone lesion responses.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFirst-line palliative {{radiotherapy}} for painful bone metastases is {{an effective}} treatment whatever its fractionation (single or multiple fractions). It is also indicated after failure or insufficient effect of a first irradiation, or the appearance of new painful site. Other indications are spinal cord compression, either as an adjuvant to surgery or as sole treatment, and after surgery for long bone metastases. The development of high precision techniques (stereotactic conditions) widens the possibility of re-irradiation when <b>tolerance</b> <b>doses</b> to normal <b>tissues</b> have already been delivered. Local control and possibly overall survival could be improved in oligometastatic patients...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{number of}} {{patients}} with cardiac implantable electronic devices (permanent pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators) undergoing radiotherapy treatment is increasing. The aims of this audit were to establish current UK practice regarding the management of patients with implanted cardiac devices undergoing radiotherapy and to compare this practice with current ‘gold standard’ evidence-based guidelines. Materials and methods: All UK radiotherapy departments were contacted and asked to provide their current cardiac implantable electronic device policy or to indicate {{if there was no}} current policy. A proforma was created to analyse these polices and to compare with current best practice. Results: In total, 47 / 67 (70 %) radiotherapy departments responded and 45 departmental policies were submitted; 31 / 45 (69 %) policies defined the radiotherapy <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> to permanent pacemakers and 14 / 45 (31 %) defined the monitoring procedure for patients in line with current best practice. Only 5 / 45 (11 %) policies defined the radiotherapy <b>tolerance</b> <b>dose</b> to implantable cardioverter defibrillators and 12 / 45 (27 %) defined the monitoring procedure in line with current best practice. Conclusion: Most UK cardiac device policies do not reflect current best evidence. Policies are based on research carried out in 1994 by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. This evidence does not account for advances in cardiac implantable electronic device technology. Further research is urgently needed to establish the effect of radiotherapy on these devices...|$|R
40|$|Bibliographical references. Cardiac ischaemic {{preconditioning}} (IPC) {{describes a}} biological phenomenon whereby a short ischaemic stimulus confers protection {{to the heart}} against subsequent prolonged ischaemia and reperfusion injury. Understanding this survival programme {{will enable us to}} augment <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> against cell death. Ischaemic preconditioning is poorly understood, however, certain metabolic events and activation intracellular signalling events are known to trigger this cardioprotection. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the metabolic and intracellular signalling events which occur during ischaemic preconditioning and their effects on improvement of contractile recovery following an ischaemia/reperfusion insult...|$|R
40|$|The Judet acrylic femoral head hemiprosthesis {{was first}} {{implanted}} in 1946. We performed bilateral revision in one patient 45 years after implantation of a Judet prosthesis. Histological analysis of femoral neck remnants and joint capsule {{did not show}} aggressive osteoclastic bone resorption or signs of dynamic bone apposition as is frequently observed nowadays with failed total hip prostheses. Only limited tissue reaction was seen with some macrophages with a foamy cytoplasm. This case report confirms the extremely good <b>tissue</b> <b>tolerance</b> of PMMA, as reported by Judet in 1950, even after 45 years follow-up...|$|R
