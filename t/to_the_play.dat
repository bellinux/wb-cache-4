5|$|Purcell {{did not set}} any of Shakespeare's text to music; {{instead he}} {{composed}} music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques are related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear no relationship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> Recent scholarship {{has shown that the}} opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.|$|E
5|$|Booth had {{free access}} to {{all parts of the}} theater as a famous and popular actor who had {{frequently}} performed at Ford's Theatre and who was well known to its owner John T. Ford, even having his mail sent there. He bored a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that day so that he could check that his intended victim had made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> and observe the box's occupants.|$|E
5|$|In some {{interpretations of}} the novella, the male {{characters}} represent patriarchal society, with Hyde signifying its moral corruption. Other interpretations suggest {{that the lack of}} female companionship for the male characters indicates their latent homosexuality and that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity. These interpretations are harder to apply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> because of Sullivan's addition of female characters and heterosexual relationships.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> {{raised a}} {{struggling}} unknown author to fame. This has been attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play's</b> freshness and inherent excellence, and also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play's</b> voicing of popular feelings in regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> celibacy of the clergy, mixed unions, enforced civil {{marriage and the}} relation {{of church and state}} as affected by the declaration of papal infallibility in 1870 (see First Vatican Council).|$|R

It {{is also home}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> fields of <b>the</b> Old Bristolians Society.|$|R
5|$|On March 17, Booth and {{the other}} conspirators planned to abduct Lincoln as he {{returned}} from a play at Campbell Military Hospital. But Lincoln did not go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> instead attending a ceremony at the National Hotel; Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and, had he not gone {{to the hospital for}} the abortive kidnap attempt, {{might have been able to}} attack Lincoln at the hotel.|$|E
5|$|Romeo and Juliet borrows from a {{tradition}} of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these is Pyramus and Thisbe, from Ovid's Metamorphoses, which contains parallels to Shakespeare's story: the lovers' parents despise each other, and Pyramus falsely believes his lover Thisbe is dead. The Ephesiaca of Xenophon of Ephesus, written in the 3rd century, also contains several similarities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> including {{the separation of the}} lovers, and a potion that induces a deathlike sleep.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play)</b> and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a FieldTurf artificial field. Numerous college and high school American football games have also been played at the stadium.|$|E

5|$|While the {{revisions}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> Blackrock {{were still}} being finalised, Enright started working with first-time director Steven Vidler to produce a film version, which would also be titled Blackrock. Blackrock was released in 1997. Rebecca Smart reprised her role as Cherie in the film. Simon Lyndon who portrayed Jared in the play was cast as Ricko in the film.|$|E
5|$|After {{creating}} custom plugins for the 3D {{computer graphics}} software, Burrows {{claimed that the}} team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes. In order <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions {{to be made for}} the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming too large for the PlayStation Portable's Universal Media Disc. The game's cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports.|$|E
5|$|Another {{adaptation}} {{of a classic}} European theatrical work followed almost immediately, with production of The Lower Depths, based on a play by Maxim Gorky, taking place in May and June 1957. In contrast to the Shakespearean sweep of Throne of Blood, The Lower Depths was shot on only two confined sets, in order to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters' lives. Though faithful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> this {{adaptation of}} Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case, the late Edo period—unlike his earlier The Idiot, was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response {{similar to that of}} Throne of Blood. However, some critics rank it among the director's most underrated works.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Fonda {{starred in}} 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film {{was a huge}} {{critical}} and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year. Fonda had long {{wanted to work with}} her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her. On Golden Pond, which also starred Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, {{there was}} a full reading of the one-act version of the play. Despite an {{unfinished}} script and a performance by amateur actors, it evoked a strong response from the audience. Later that year, Stephen Waldschmidt, an artistic associate of Burnt Thicket Theatre, asked to read the script of She Has a Name, and later {{said he could not}} put it down. He was initially reluctant to attach himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> because of the immensity and ugliness of the issues therein, but he ultimately worked with Kooman to expand it into a full-length play with an extra hour of material by the end of 2010. The result is a play that can be performed in 90 minutes but may last up to two hours. Burnt Thicket Theatre served as the play's initial production company.|$|E
5|$|Kami, Perempuan premiered in 1943 in Jakarta. It {{received}} multiple {{performances that}} year, some in Jakarta, some {{in other parts}} of Java. In 1950 Pane included Kami, Perempuan in his book Djinak-Djinak Merpati dengan Tjerita2 Sandiwara Lain, a collection of his stage plays. For this publication Pane removed a scene in which two neighbours came to visit the family, which included further conversation. Pane considered this scene to be anti-climactic, whereas without it the play's title became more appropriate. Another, smaller, change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was the removal of the names of Japan's enemies during World War II.|$|E

After undergoing surgery and rehabilitation, almost two years later Ross made his return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field for <b>the</b> Rabbitohs in the 2010 NRL season.|$|R
5|$|Other {{works that}} {{followed}} continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard's surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed {{his first major}} liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which {{has become the most}} frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and {{it was not until the}} 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters {{that human beings are}} neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Story editor Irene Diamond {{convinced}} producer Hal B. Wallis {{to purchase}} the film rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> in January 1942. Brothers Julius and Philip G. Epstein were initially assigned to write the script. However, despite studio resistance, they left to work on Frank Capra's Why We Fight series early in 1942. Howard E. Koch {{was assigned to the}} screenplay until the Epsteins returned a month later. Principal photography began on May 25, 1942, ending on August 3; the film was shot entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California {{with the exception of one}} sequence at Van Nuys Airport in Van Nuys, Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|The Tigers {{won their}} next two games before losing {{four in a}} row, but {{remained}} competitive in every game, largely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> of Cannon and Taylor. LSU completed {{the season with a}} win over their rival team Tulane and a 5–5 record, although they had been predicted to finish last in their conference. At the end of the season, Cannon was included on the Associated Press (AP) Southeastern Conference (SEC) All-Sophomore team and the United Press International (UPI) All-SEC second team. He also had the leading kickoff return average in the country (31.2 yards).|$|E
5|$|The Wedding Day {{was started}} as his third play, {{but it was}} not {{finished}} until years later and finally brought out on both the stage and in print after his theatrical career ended. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of The Wedding-Day. It was refused by John Rich to be staged, and it was not produced until 1743 by David Garrick. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's preface <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> in his Miscellanies (1743). In it, Fielding says that he intended the leads, Millamour and Charlotte, for Robert Wilks and Anne Oldfield. However, Oldfield died before the play could be produced, and Fielding and Wilks got into a fight, which made it impossible for Fielding to convince him to join the production.|$|E
5|$|The pre-game buildup focused {{primarily}} on the strong rushing attacks of both teams {{as well as the}} overall sound offense of Fresno State. Most analysts predicted a resounding victory by Fresno State. The point spread favored Fresno State as 12-point favorites over the Mustangs. Contrary to predictions, SMU won the game by a score of 43-10, largely thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> of defensive end Margus Hunt, who forced two fumbles and totaled three sacks (including one safety) as well as two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. Consequently, Hunt and Fresno State's Davante Adams, who totaled 13 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, were named the game's co-Most Valuable Player (MVP).|$|E
