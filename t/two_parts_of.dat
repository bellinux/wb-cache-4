5|$|The cantata is {{structured}} in <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> seven movements each, {{to be performed}} {{before and after the}} sermon. It is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, trumpet (Tr), two oboes (Ob), oboe d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc) including bassoon. The <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> seven movements each are composed as the same arrangement of alternating recitatives and arias with a concluding chorale, only Part II is opened by a sinfonia instead of a chorus. The duration is given as 35 minutes.|$|E
5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{evolution}} of circular permutations is the fission and fusion model. The process starts with two partial proteins.

5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities {{are based on the}} previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken {{as the beginning of}} that school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays as though they were real people. Hazlitt, who seems to have had little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never to lose sight of Falstaff's status as a character in a play—three plays, in fact, though the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to {{the late}} 1930s, modern NY15 was part of NY2.

NY2 was supplanted by an extended US15 in April1939, at which time NY2A was renumbered to NY15A to match its parent's new designation.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his best course of action would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E
5|$|NY78 was {{replaced}} by NY44 (now NY414) {{in the vicinity of}} Watkins Glen as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the pre-1921 routing of Route46 east of Seneca Lake were assigned posted route numbers for the first time. From just northeast of Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville, the old road became part of NY227, which initially extended from NY44 (now NY414) near Watkins Glen to NY79 in Perry City. While Route46 veered southeast from Reynoldsville to serve Mecklenburg, NY227 proceeded northeast from the former to connect to Perry City. The portion of old Route46 north of Perry City became part of NY79.|$|E
5|$|Technical {{difficulties}} {{included the}} very high transistor counts needed to support the wide instruction words and the large caches. There were also structural problems within the project, as the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the joint team used different methodologies and had slightly different priorities. Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depends on compiler capabilities {{that had never been}} implemented before, so more research was needed.|$|E

5|$|The Charing Cross Hotel, {{designed}} by Edward Middleton Barry, opened on 15 May 1865 {{and gave the}} station an ornate frontage in the French Renaissance style. It had 250 bedrooms spread over seven floors and extended along Villiers Street {{as well as the}} front of the Strand. The public rooms had balconies overlooking the main station concourse. It quickly became popular and was profitable, leading to a 90-bedroom annexe {{on the other side of}} Villiers Street opening in 1878. A bridge over the street connected the <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the hotel together.|$|E
5|$|The {{years from}} 1949 to 1953 are often {{considered}} {{the highlight of}} Vandersteen's career, when he combined large production with consistent high quality in his stories, the jokes, the many characters, and the graphical aspects, in which the charming quirkiness of the early years was balanced with the more rigorous ligne claire of Hergé. Many of these stories were loosely based on popular classics, ranging from Alexandre Dumas over Buffalo Bill to Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, with as culmination his comic in <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the legend of Till Eulenspiegel, made for Kuifje.|$|E
5|$|This breed, {{along with}} other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemivertebrae.

The condition occurs when <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> a spinal vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped spinal cavity which can put pressure on the spinal cord.|$|E
