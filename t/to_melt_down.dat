They {{were excluded from}} most of the rules imposed on other noble castes and exempted from fanampoana (forced labor in lieu of monetary tax payment). Instead, they were made responsible for maintaining a key dike that supported irrigation of the capital's rice paddies, producing the silk used to make the king's clothing, and conscripting soldiers for the king's army. They were also responsible for gathering used hoes for the royal blacksmiths <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> and then supervise the artisans as the metal was crafted into nails, shackles and other forged objects.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the output}} of copper {{currency}} had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty copper mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085. Although there were on average more copper mines found in Northern Song China {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined copper deposits by 1165. Even though copper cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corvée labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people now had to find additional cash, driving up the price of copper money which would become scarce. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued copper currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song copper coins. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became cautious about its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao of a chance <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> the currency to make iron weapons.|$|E

25|$|The feud between The Undertaker and Kama (a {{member of}} Ted Dibiase's Million Dollar Corporation) began at WrestleMania XI. The Undertaker's manager was Paul Bearer, and Kama's manager was Ted DiBiase. Undertaker was portrayed as the face, and Kama as the heel. At WrestleMania XI, during Undertaker's match with King Kong Bundy, Kama {{ran out to}} the ring, {{attacked}} Bearer, and stole the urn (an object which, in storylines, gives The Undertaker supernatural power) for DiBiase. Immediately afterward, Kama declared (in an interview with Jim Ross) his intention <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> the urn. The urn was revealed to have become a gold necklace, first worn by Kama prior to his match with Scott Taylor on the April 10 episode of Raw. On the April 23 episode of Action Zone, The Undertaker defeated Sycho Sid, another member of The Million Dollar Corporation. On the May 7 episode of Wrestling Challenge, a black wreath was left at ringside for Kama. Kama attacked the wreath and, after defeating Buck Zumhofe, stuffed part of it into Zumhofe's mouth. Another black wreath was left at ringside for Kama on the June 12 Raw. After defeating jobber David Haskins, Kama again attacked the wreath, only to realise it was a mannequin. Both The Undertaker and Kama participated in the 1995 King of the Ring tournament. On the pay-per-view, a black wreath was ringside {{for the whole of}} Kama's quarterfinal match with Shawn Michaels, which ended in a draw. Toward the end of The Undertaker's quarterfinal contest with Mabel, Undertaker was thrown into the referee. While the referee was down, Kama interfered by kicking Undertaker in the face. Mabel followed up with a leg drop, pinning Undertaker to win the match. The Undertaker chased Kama backstage after the bout. The two continued to wrestle together in matches at house shows, with the two facing each other in preparation for their SummerSlam bout. Wreaths continued to be left ringside during Kama's matches, and Kama continued to attack them. On the August 21, 1995 Raw, (storyline) WWF president Gorilla Monsoon announced the match between Undertaker and Kama would be a casket match.|$|E

500|$|Congress {{abolished}} the twenty-cent piece on May 2, 1878. [...] The previous day, Linderman {{had ordered the}} mints <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> twenty-cent pieces on hand, for recoinage into other denominations. By then, forces for silver coinage had been victorious in passing the Bland–Allison Act, requiring the government to purchase large quantities of silver bullion, and strike it into dollars. [...] The piece continued to circulate in the West for a few years, but by 1890 was rarely seen. Of the 1,351,540 twenty-cent pieces minted for circulation, over a third were melted by the government between 1895 and 1954, most heavily in 1933. The least expensive twenty-cent piece, according to the 2014 edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (the Red Book), is the 1875-S, listed at $110 in good-4 condition. According to commentary in the Red Book, the twenty-cent piece failed because [...] "the public was confused over the coin's similarity to the quarter dollar, which was better established as a foundation of American commerce", that fractional currency satisfied the need for small change in the East, and because [...] "the twenty-cent piece was essentially just a substitute for two dimes".|$|E

2500|$|The army {{defending}} Constantinople {{was relatively}} small, totaling about 7,000 men, 2,000 {{of whom were}} foreigners. At {{the onset of the}} siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area. [...] Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, {{while the rest of the}} army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally monks. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery bullets, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the city repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the command}} of Lieutenant-Colonel John Jennings, the four under-strength companies, {{approximately}} 200 men in all, withstood three assaults on the castle. In addition to being outnumbered, the garrison was short of ammunition, having <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> their buttons to make bullets. By the time the French made their third attack, the defenders had expended all their ammunition and were left with rocks and bayonets. After the third attempt was beaten back, Colonel Jennings was forced to seek terms. After meeting with the French commander, Jennings and his men were allowed to surrender the castle, give their parole, retaining their arms and colours. The French, in return, promised not to plunder the town of Carrickfergus. Although the regiment surrendered the castle, the French squadron which had landed the force was destroyed by the Royal Navy in an action near the Mull of Galloway. An investigation of the defence of Carrickfergus proclaimed that the men [...] "behav'd like Lyons". The Irish Parliament voted a thanks to the Regiment and Carrickfergus presented the officers with silver cups.|$|E

2500|$|The Shakespeare Garden is a {{relatively}} small [...] "17th century classical garden" [...] located directly southwest of the California Academy of Sciences.

The entrance is an ornate metal gate that says [...] "Shakespeare Garden" [...] intertwined with vines. Directly past the entrance is a walkway overarched with trees and lined with small flowers and a sundial in the center. The main area has a large moss tree and benches. At the end of the garden there is a wooden padlocked shelf containing a bust of William Shakespeare himself. The cast was made and given to the garden by George Bullock in 1918 and has remained behind locked doors since around 1950 to prevent people from cutting off pieces of the statue <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>down.</b> Around the bust, there are four plaques, originally six, with quotes from Shakespeare.

2500|$|When news of {{this crisis}} reached Athens, the city found itself facing a desperate situation. [...] To {{challenge}} the superior Peloponnesian fleet, the Athenians had only 40 ready triremes, {{and most of the}} experienced crews were at sea with Conon. [...] To rebuild their fleet, the Athenians were forced <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> golden religious statues from the acropolis, and the 110 ships the city possessed after this construction were crewed by a mix of less-experienced rowers, farmers, wealthy cavalrymen, and emancipated slaves. [...] All eight generals who remained at Athens, Thrasyllus among them, sailed out with this scratch fleet; none is known to have served as supreme commander. [...] The Athenian fleet, bolstered by 55 ships from allied cities, met a Spartan fleet of 120 ships under Callicratidas at the Arginusae islands, just south of Lesbos. [...] In the resulting battle, the Athenians divided their fleet into 8 autonomous divisions, with Thrasyllus commanding the forward right wing; by limiting the opportunities for the Spartan crews to exercise their superior seamanship, the Athenians were able to wear their enemies down, and the day ended in a decisive Athenian victory. [...] The remnants of the Peloponnesian fleet fled southward, leaving some 70 ships behind, and the blockading force at Mytilene, upon hearing of the result, also fled.|$|E
2500|$|The plant {{comprises}} six separate {{boiling water}} reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and {{maintained by the}} Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At {{the time of the}} quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. A tsunami following the earthquake flooded the low-lying rooms where emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that [...] circulate coolant water to keep them from melting down. When the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown. As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>down.</b> [...] In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown.In an attempt to halt a meltdown, the government ordered that seawater be used to cool the reactors, as no alternative was available at the time. Because of the delay in this process, meltdown progressed, depositing most of the melted fuel {{at the bottom of the}} reactor vessel.|$|E
