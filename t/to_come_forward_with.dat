25|$|Despite {{an average}} {{reduction}} in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 Public Confidence Survey revealed that public satisfaction following {{contact with the}} police was falling {{and that there was}} a greater willingness to complain. The Metropolitan Police, who operate {{in some of the most}} ethnically diverse parts of the UK, received the greatest number of complaints in 2014/15 with 6,828. However, young people and people from black or minority ethic groups were much less likely <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> complaints.|$|E
25|$|During 2011 the Government again asked suitors <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> {{proposals}} for Northern Rock. On 17 November 2011, {{it was announced}} that Virgin Money were to buy Northern Rock plc for £747 million, with other potential payments of up to £280 million over the next few years. By July 2012 a further £73 million was paid as deferred consideration. W.L. Ross increased his stake in Virgin Money, owning 44% of the combined business by putting £260 million into the deal. Both Abu Dhabi-based Stanhope Investments and Branson's Virgin Group invested £50 million in the Northern Rock deal. In 2014 Virgin Money repaid a further £154.5 million that it had received as part of the refinancing package.|$|E

25|$|Many first-round {{candidates}} {{endorsed the}} second-round candidates, but some made public statements regarding {{the second round}} but did not endorse. Dragan Primorac made several public statements - he initially tried to stay completely neutral, but later released one where he listed some characteristics of the future president that he would want, without naming a candidate, but focusing on the fight against corruption. The reception was mixed – Večernji list said he chose no one, while Jutarnji list said that he chose Josipović, reading between the lines. The Josipović campaign later decided to include Primorac in their endorsement list and Primorac did not seem <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a public rebuttal. On the other hand, Josip Jurčević made a late public statement telling voters to void their ballot.|$|E
25|$|Philip's parents {{appeared}} {{regularly on}} the news and clutched what {{has now become a}} well-recognised picture of a smiling Philip in his Confirmation clothes of a blue jacket and a red rosette. This photo has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal 21 years later. However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years. It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved. Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast. Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors say {{it sends}} a message {{that no one is}} above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. Police say that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be trying to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the death}} of Silver's mother, Jackie, Naomi {{provides}} Erin with comfort. Soon afterward, Naomi learns the truth about Jen's actions {{on the night of}} the prom, creating a rift between the two. Naomi then offers Annie her apologies. Annie initially keeps her at a distance, while Liam, after much effort, is eventually given a second chance with Naomi. Later, she begins to encounter awkwardness with Liam. After clashing with Mr. Cannon (Hal Ozsan), a faculty member, Naomi falsely accuses him of sexual harassment while talking with her friends, who unexpectedly urge her <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the experience. As with her attack on Annie, she initially declines to act. However, she eventually does so when Liam faces expulsion for assaulting Cannon. She is later called to testify in front of the school board, which prompts her to reveal the truth. Afterward, Naomi faces new conflicts with her sister Jen, while Liam eventually leaves Naomi upon deciding that their relationship is no longer working. While experiencing trouble with her car one evening, she seeks assistance in school and stumbles upon Mr. Cannon. He kisses Naomi repeatedly as she refuses and pushes him away, but he continues and eventually rapes her.|$|E
500|$|Muslim {{organizations}} in the United States were swift to condemn the attacks and called [...] "upon Muslim Americans <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> their skills and resources to help alleviate the sufferings of the affected people and their families". These {{organizations in}}cluded the Islamic Society of North America, American Muslim Alliance, American Muslim Council, Council on American-Islamic Relations, Islamic Circle of North America, and the Shari'a Scholars Association of North America. Along with monetary donations, many Islamic organizations launched blood drives and provided medical assistance, food, and shelter for victims.|$|E
500|$|The investigation, called [...] "Operation Braid", {{comprised}} 80 detectives {{and civilian}} staff {{under the direction}} of Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones, a senior officer with Avon and Somerset Constabulary's major crime investigation unit. It became one of the largest police operations in the Constabulary's history. Jones urged the public <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> any information to help catch the killer, especially potential witnesses who were in the vicinity of Longwood Lane in Failand in the period before Yeates' body was discovered. He stated that the investigation was seeking the driver of a [...] "light-coloured 4x4 vehicle" [...] for questioning.|$|E

50|$|The land {{purchase}} program adopted a humane approach {{so that the}} sellers do not feel short-changed. To this effect, DLF partnered with farmers so that they also got a share in profits. DLF acquired and created a land bank and then sold plots to buyers after demarcation.

500|$|Vanderbilt {{was drawn}} to the notion that Graysmith went from a {{cartoonist}} {{to one of the most}} significant investigators of the case. He pitched the story as: [...] "What if Garry Trudeau woke up one morning and tried to solve the Son of Sam"? As he worked on the script, he became friends with Graysmith. The filmmakers were able to get the cooperation of the Vallejo Police Department (one of the key investigators at the time) because they hoped that the film would inspire someone <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a crucial bit of information that might help solve this decades-old cold case.|$|E
500|$|Ballo's {{father was}} {{critical}} of the statements made by Fosse about his daughter's history. He commented to Verdens Gang that the Church of Scientology was negatively impacting the reputation of his daughter and not respecting the privacy of her health history. He {{did not wish to}} comment regarding the nature of the investigation in France. Ballo's uncle Heljar Ballo explained that Kaja Ballo's family decided <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> information to the media about her suicide, due to a motivation to publicize information relating to the circumstances of her death. Heljar Ballo told Aftenposten that the family [...] "had confidence" [...] in the investigation by local law enforcement in France. He thought there was a connection between her death and Scientology. Kaja Ballo's father retained an attorney to investigate his daughter's death. In April 2008, Ballo's family was considering taking legal action against Scientology. Kaja Ballo was interred on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in Oslo, and approximately 500 people were present at the funeral ceremony.|$|E

Black has Higgens help him in getting the bodies exhumed, allowing the two to see that Mrs. Garry's wounds were not defensive, but self-inflicted. Black also determines that the message written in blood was in fact [...] "I 28 15"—Book of Isaiah, chapter 28, verse 15; which is concerned with lies and falsehoods. Black pieces together the actual events of the night of the murders, realizing that Mrs. Garry killed her children before committing suicide; before she died she blamed Garry for her actions, causing him to seek atonement by admitting to the crimes. Reilly admits to having helped Garry rearrange the crime scene to incriminate himself; Black urges him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the real events to save his friend's life.|$|E

500|$|The Blair Witch Project {{is thought}} to be the first widely {{released}} film marketed primarily by the Internet. The film's official website featured faux police reports and [...] "newsreel-style" [...] interviews. These augmented the film's found footage device to spark debates across the Internet over whether the film was a real-life documentary or a work of fiction. During screenings, the filmmakers made advertising efforts to promulgate the events in the film as factual, including the distribution of flyers at festivals such as the Sundance Film Festival, asking viewers <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> any information about the [...] "missing" [...] students. The campaign tactic was that viewers were being told, through missing persons posters, that the characters were missing while researching in the woods for the mythical Blair Witch. The IMDb page also listed the actors as [...] "missing, presumed dead" [...] {{in the first year of}} the film's availability. The film's website contains materials of actors posing as police and investigators giving testimony about their casework, and shared childhood photos of the actors to add a sense of realism.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 December 1964, Lamb smashed the front window of Lakeview Marine and Equipment, a {{sporting}} goods store in Tecumseh, and stole three revolvers and a double-barrelled shotgun. Using one of the revolvers, he fired twice on a police constable and the shop's co-owner, missing both times. The officer returned several shots, leading Lamb <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> his hands raised. [...] "Don't shoot. I give up," [...] he said. He then showed the constable where he had hidden the other two handguns and the shotgun. Lamb, who turned 17 during the trial, was tried and convicted as an adult for [...] "breaking, entering and theft ... possession of a [...]22 calibre revolver, dangerous to public peace". Motivated by a presentence investigation report characterising Lamb as exceptionally violent, Magistrate J. Arthur Hanrahan sentenced him to two years at Kingston Penitentiary, a maximum security prison. According to Nosanchuk's account, {{the severity of the}} sentence was unusual for a first-time adult offender who had not caused anybody physical harm. Hanrahan, Nosanchuk writes, must have deemed Lamb beyond rehabilitation. The boy arrived at the penitentiary in April 1965.|$|E
500|$|Various {{abortive}} {{proposals were}} made to extend the line, whose dead-end nature deprived it of much of its usefulness. Even before construction had been completed, businesses in Tenterden were pressing the SER to link with their town. In response, the SER asked Edward Seaton <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> proposals for an affordable extension. Three schemes were put forward in October 1893 which would see the line extended from either Cranbrook or Hawkhurst. The first was essentially a continuation to Appledore, passing near the villages of Benenden, Newenden, Sandhurst and Rolvenden, but only passing within [...] of Tenterden. The second would see the Hawkhurst branch {{becoming part of the}} proposed Loose Valley Railway linking Maidstone with Dungeness via Headcorn, Tenterden and Appledore. The final proposal began with a junction at Cranbrook station, before running to Appledore via Sissinghurst, Biddenden, Tenterden and Reading Street. None of these schemes came to fruition {{due to a lack of}} impetus on the part of the SER and the merger of operations of the SER with the rival London, Chatham and Dover Railway. The buffer stops at Hawkhurst were nevertheless positioned so as to allow the extension of the line without the need for alterations to the existing layout.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the police}} {{launched}} the murder investigation they {{were met with}} a [...] "wall of silence"; none of the estimated seventy or so witnesses <b>to</b> the altercation <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> information.

As the toilet measures just four feet by three feet, this led to the toilets being dubbed the TARDIS, after the time machine in the television series Doctor Who, which is much bigger on the inside than on the outside.|$|R

This study explores the incentives to apply for leniency when each cartel member has private information as to the likelihood that the competition authority will be able to convict them without a cooperating firm. A firm may apply for leniency because it fears being convicted ("prosecution effect") or because it fears another firm will apply ("pre-emption effect"). Policies by the competition authority to magnify concerns about pre-emption - and thereby induce greater use of the leniency program - are also explored. ...|$|R
