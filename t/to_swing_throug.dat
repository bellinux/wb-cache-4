50|$|Swing bowlers are pace bowlers who, {{apart from}} being fast, also use the seam of the ball to make it travel in a curved path through the air. This is further {{encouraged}} by systematically polishing {{one side of the}} ball while allowing the other side to become roughened and worn. The differing airflow around the two sides will cause the ball <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> in the air, towards the roughened side. By changing the orientation of the ball in his hand, a bowler may therefore cause the ball <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> into or away from the batsman. In addition to a well-polished ball, other factors help the ball <b>to</b> <b>swing,</b> notably damp or humid weather conditions. However balls which have been in play for some time do not tend <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> so much due to the deterioration of the seam. In addition, bowlers of express pace do not tend to get as much swing as the fast-medium-to-medium pace bowlers.|$|R
