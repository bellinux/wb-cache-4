When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E

An investor is modeled as a Gaussian fuzzy set (a fuzzy opinion) with the center and standard deviation as inputs and the fuzzy set itself as output. Investors are connected in the following fashion: the center input <b>of</b> <b>an</b> investor is taken as {{the average of the}} neighbors' outputs, where two investors are neighbors if their fuzzy opinions are close enough to each other, and the standard deviation (uncertainty) input is taken with local, global or external reference schemes to model different scenarios of how investors define uncertainties. The centers and standard deviations of the fuzzy opinions are the expected prices and their uncertainties, respectively, that are used as inputs to the price dynamic equation. We prove that with the local reference scheme the investors converge to different groups in finite time, while with the global or external reference schemes all investors converge to a consensus within finite time and the consensus may change with time in the external reference case. We show how to model trend followers, contrarians and manipulators within this mathematical framework and prove <b>that</b> the <b>biggest</b> enemy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> manipulator is the other manipulators.
