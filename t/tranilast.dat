50|$|According to Sur (2008) studies, the {{anti-inflammatory}} {{effect of the}} Avenanthramides {{is due to the}} inhibition of the NF-κB activation in NF-κB dependent cytokine. Nuclear factor-kappa β (NF-κB) is responsible for regulating the transcription of DNA and participates in the activation of genes related to inflammatory and immune responses. Consequently, suppressing the NF-κB limits the proliferation of cancer cells and reduces the level of inflammation. Avenanthramides are able to inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines that are present in pruritic skin diseases and may cause the itch sensations. In addition, its anti-inflammatory activity may prevent the vicious itch scratch cycle and reduce the scratching-induced secondary inflammation that often occur in atopic dermatitis and eczema, preventing the skin from disrupting its barrier. Avenanthramides also have a chemical structure similar to the drug <b>Tranilast,</b> which has anti-histaminic action. The anti-itch activity of avenanthramides may therefore be associated with the inhibition of histamine response. Taken together, these results prove the effect of Avenanthramides as powerful anti-inflammatory agents and its importance in dermatologic applications.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Tranilast</b> (N-(3 ', 4 '-dimethoxycinnamonyl) anthranilic acid) {{has been}} shown to be therapeutically effective, exerting {{anti-inflammatory}} and anti-oxidative effects via acting on macrophage. We hypothesized that <b>Tranilast</b> may protect against oxidative stress-induced bone loss via action in osteoclasts (OCs) that shares precursors with macrophage. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To elucidate the role of <b>Tranilast,</b> ovariectomy (OVX) -induced bone loss in vivo and OC differentiation in vitro were evaluated by µCT and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, respectively. Oral administration of <b>Tranilast</b> protected against OVX-induced bone loss with decreased serum level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mice. <b>Tranilast</b> inhibited OC formation in vitro. Decreased osteoclastogenesis by <b>Tranilast</b> was due to a defect of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) signaling, at least partly via decreased activation of nuclear factor-κB and reduced induction and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (or NFAT 2). <b>Tranilast</b> also decreased RANKL-induced a long lasting ROS level as well as TGF-β to inhibit osteoclastogenesis. Reduced ROS caused by <b>Tranilast</b> was due to the induction of ROS scavenging enzymes (peroxiredoxin 1, heme oxygenase- 1, and glutathione peroxidase 1) as well as impaired ROS generation.

40|$|<b>Tranilast,</b> first {{developed}} as an anti-allergic drug, {{has been reported}} to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -induced angiogenesis and vasopermeability. To further clarify the inhibitory mechanism, we investigated the effects of <b>tranilast</b> on VEGF binding and subsequent intracellular signalling pathway linked to angiogenic activities and gene expression of bovine retinal microcapillary endothelial cells. <b>Tranilast</b> significantly (P< 0. 01) inhibited VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and hypoxia conditioned media-induced BREC proliferation in a dose dependent manner with IC 50 's of 22, 82 and 10 [*]μM, respectively. VEGF-induced migration was also inhibited by <b>tranilast</b> in a dose dependent manner, with IC 50 of 18 [*]μM, and complete inhibition was observed at 300 [*]μM (P< 0. 01). <b>Tranilast</b> suppressed VEGF-induced tube formation in a dose dependent manner with maximum (46 %) inhibition observed at 300 [*]μM (P< 0. 05). <b>Tranilast</b> inhibited phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) -dependent stimulation of [3 H]-thymidine incorporation and VEGF- and PMA-induced gene expression of integrin αv and c-fos in BREC. <b>Tranilast</b> suppressed VEGF- and PMA-stimulated PKC activity in BREC. <b>Tranilast</b> did not affect VEGF binding or VEGF-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of VEGF receptor- and phospholipase Cγ and their associated proteins.

40|$|Breast cancer, and {{particularly}} the resulting metastases, continues to pose a major health risk for women. Studies in both in vitro and in vivo models have shown that <b>tranilast</b> {{has the potential to}} be used in the treatment of breast cancer as an anti-metastatic agent. This study looks at <b>tranilast</b> treatment response in relation to the particular receptor statuses of breast cancer. The objective of the study is to determine the effect of <b>tranilast</b> on the growth and migration of two human breast cancer cell lines BT 474 (receptor positive) and MDA MB 231 (receptor negative). Both cells lines showed a negative correlation between <b>tranilast</b> concentration and quantified proliferation at concentrations ranging from 50 ?mol/L to 200 ?mol/L. In the examination of migration, BT 474 and MDA MB 231 cells also exhibited slower wound closure after <b>tranilast</b> treatment (200 ?mol/L). Additionally, the extent of colony growth in a soft agar assay was reduced after <b>tranilast</b> treatment in both cell lines. Immunocytochemistry of <b>tranilast</b> and vehicle treated cells showed downregulation of two metastatic markers, endoglin and MMP- 9, in both cell lines, though to a lesser extent in the MDA MB 231 cells. While <b>tranilast</b> treatment does exert inhibitory effects on both cell lines tested, BT 474 cells showed greater sensitivity with a larger reduction of proliferation and slower migration, as compared with MDA MB 231 cells. <b>Tranilast</b> may therefore be a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer, and possibly functions through a receptor pathway...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tranilast,</b> an {{antiallergic}} medication, is a {{very promising}} inhibitor of restenosis after balloon angioplasty. <b>Tranilast</b> can prevent the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells by activating the gene expression of p 21, a strong cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, and by arresting cell growth at the G 0 /G 1 phase. The signaling pathway of <b>Tranilast</b> in regulating p 21 is to our best interest and is elucidated in the present study. The major emphasis was weighted on exploring the regulatory effects of <b>Tranilast</b> on promoter activity of p 21. By serial deletion analysis, the sequence between − 74 and − 83 [*]bp of the p 21 promoter, previously identified as the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) -response element, was found sufficient, where {{as most of the}} promoter region 5 ′ to − 111 [*]bp was found unnecessary for the transcriptional activation of p 21 by both TGF-β 1 and <b>Tranilast.</b> <b>Tranilast</b> was also found to induce phosphorylation of Smad 2 (a cytoplasmic signaling molecule essential for mediating TGF-β signal transduction). Transfection of ΔkTβRII, a truncated form of TGF-β type II receptor known to exert a dominant-negative effect on TGF-β signaling, was found to suppress the signaling of both <b>Tranilast</b> and TGF-β 1 to a similar extent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Growth {{factors such}} as {{transforming}} growth factor-beta (TGF beta) {{are believed to have}} an essential role in cardiac fibrosis. <b>Tranilast</b> (N(3, 4 -dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid) attenuates the increased expression of TGF beta mRNA in vitro. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether <b>tranilast</b> reduces cardiac fibrosis in rats with two-kidney, one-clip (2 K 1 C) renovascular hypertension. In addition, we tested the in-vitro effects of <b>tranilast</b> on cardiac myocytes and non-myocyte cells. METHODS: We analysed hearts from four groups of rats: sham-operated controls; rats with 2 K 1 C renovascular hypertension; rats with 2 K 1 C renovascular hypertension treated for 12 weeks with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril (6 mg/kg per day); rats with 2 K 1 C renovascular hypertension treated for 12 weeks with <b>tranilast</b> (400 mg/kg per day). RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure was reduced after quinapril treatment. <b>Tranilast</b> did not alter blood pressure (2 K 1 C: 223 +/- 19 mmHg; 2 K 1 C + quinapril: 149 +/- 15 mmHg (P < 0. 01 compared with 2 K 1 C); 2 K 1 C + tranilast: 204 +/- 32 mmHg). Left ventricular weight was likewise reduced significantly by quinapril, but not significantly by <b>tranilast</b> (2 K 1 C: 1. 52 +/- 0. 2 g; 2 K 1 C + quinapril: 1. 26 +/- 0. 18 g (P < 0. 05 compared with 2 K 1 C); 2 K 1 C + tranilast: 1. 37 +/- 0. 27 g). Using a computer-aided image analysis system, we demonstrated that <b>tranilast</b> prevented cardiac fibrosis in a blood-pressure-independent manner (P < 0. 01 compared with 2 K 1 C). Determination of the cardiac hydroxyproline content similarly revealed a significant reduction in cardiac fibrosis by <b>tranilast</b> (2 K 1 C: 4. 92 +/- 0. 48 mg/mg; 2 K 1 C + tranilast: 3. 97 +/- 0. 46 mg/mg; P < 0. 05). The effect of <b>tranilast</b> on cardiac fibrosis was comparable to the effects of a blood-pressure-decreasing dose of the ACE inhibitor, quinapril. Cell culture experiments revealed that <b>tranilast</b> significantly decreased the proliferation of cardiac non-myocyte cells. Proliferation of cardiac myocytes was not altered. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that long-term treatment with <b>tranilast</b> markedly attenuated left ventricular fibrosis in rats with renovascular hypertension. This was most probably the result of an antiproliferative effect of <b>tranilast</b> on cardiac non-myocyte cells. <b>Tranilast</b> thus offers a unique new therapeutic approach to the reduction of TGF beta-mediated cardiac fibrosis in viv...|$|E

To elucidate the effects of <b>tranilast</b> on prostate cancer, we investigated the mechanisms of its anti-tumor effect on prostate cancer. METHODS The anti-tumor effects and related mechanisms of <b>tranilast</b> were investigated both in vitro on prostate cancer cell lines and bone-derived stromal cells, and in vivo on severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. We verified its clinical effect in patients with advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). RESULTS <b>Tranilast</b> inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP, LNCaP-SF, and PC- 3 cells in a dose-dependent manner and growth of the tumor formed by inoculation of LNCaP-SF in the dorsal subcutis and in the tibia of castrated SCID mice. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay revealed induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by <b>tranilast.</b> <b>Tranilast</b> increased expression of proteins involved in induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Coculture with bone-derived stromal cells induced proliferation of LNCaP-SF cells. <b>Tranilast</b> also suppressed secretion of transforming growth factor Β 1 (TGF-Β 1) from bone-derived stromal cells, which induced their differentiation. Moreover, <b>tranilast</b> inhibited TGF-Β 1 -mediated differentiation of bone-derived stromal cells and LNCaP-SF cell migration induced by osteopontin. In the clinical investigation, PSA progression was inhibited in 4 of 16 patients with advanced HRPC.

40|$|International {{audience}} 3, 4 -dimethoxycinnamonyl-anthranilic acid (<b>tranilast)</b> is an orally available anti-allergic drug with {{structural and}} functional homologies to immunosuppressive catabolites {{of the essential}} amino acid tryptophan and broad anti-inflammatory properties. It has recently {{been shown to be}} effective in animal models of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, two autoimmune diseases that are mediated by auto-aggressive Th 1 -polarized CD 4 + T lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate potent suppressive effects of <b>tranilast</b> on the function of naïve human CD 4 + T cells. <b>Tranilast</b> inhibits activation and proliferation of purified CD 4 + T cells stimulated through the T cell receptor with an EC 50 of less than 10 μM, a concentration that is well below plasma levels achieved after oral administration of approved doses of 200 - 600 mg in humans. The antiproliferative effects were less potent on naïve CD 8 + T cells. Suppression of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell proliferation was associated with an inhibition of T cell activation. Cytokine analyses of naïve CD 4 + T cells revealed that <b>tranilast</b> interferes with the production of cyto- and chemokines driven by signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT 1), notably chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands (CXCL) 9 and 10. <b>Tranilast</b> limited STAT 1 phosphorylation in activated T cells and supplementation of CXCL 9 or CXCL 10 reversed the anti-proliferative effects of <b>tranilast.</b> These data imply CXCL 9 and CXCL 10 as novel therapeutic targets of <b>tranilast</b> in Th 1 -mediated autoimmune diseases and identify phospho-STAT 1 and its target chemokines CXCL 9 and CXCL 10 as potential markers for monitoring the bioactivity of <b>tranilast</b> in humans...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} assess the effects of <b>tranilast</b> on atrial {{remodeling}} in a canine atrial fibrillation (AF) model. BackgroundTranilast inhibits transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 and prevents fibrosis in many pathophysiological settings. However, the effects of <b>tranilast</b> on atrial remodeling remain unclear. MethodsBeagles were subjected to atrial tachypacing (400 beats/min) for 4 weeks while treated with placebo (control dogs, n = 8) or <b>tranilast</b> (<b>tranilast</b> dogs, n = 10). Sham dogs (n = 6) did not receive atrial tachypacing. Atrioventricular conduction was preserved. Ventricular dysfunction developed in the control and <b>tranilast</b> dogs due to rapid ventricular responses. ResultsAtrial fibrillation duration (211 ± 57 s) increased, and AF cycle length and atrial effective refractory period shortened in controls, but these changes were suppressed in <b>tranilast</b> dogs (AF duration, 18 ± 10 s, p < 0. 01 vs. control). The L-type calcium channel α 1 c (Cav 1. 2) micro ribonucleic acid expression decreased in control dogs (sham 1. 38 ± 0. 24 vs. control 0. 65 ± 0. 12, p < 0. 01), but not in <b>tranilast</b> dogs (0. 97 ± 0. 14, p = not significant vs. sham). Prominent atrial fibrosis (fibrous tissue area, sham 0. 8 ± 0. 1 vs. control 9. 3 ± 1. 3 %, p < 0. 01) and increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase protein 1 were observed in control dogs but not in <b>tranilast</b> dogs (fibrous tissue area, 1. 4 ± 0. 2 %, p < 0. 01 vs. control). The TGF-β 1 (sham 1. 00 ± 0. 07 vs. control 3. 06 ± 0. 87, p < 0. 05) and Rac 1 proteins were overexpressed in control dogs, but their overexpression was inhibited in <b>tranilast</b> dogs (TGF-β 1, 1. 28 ± 0. 20, p < 0. 05 vs. control). ConclusionsTranilast prevented atrial remodeling and suppressed AF development in a canine model. Its inhibition of TGF-β 1 and Rac 1 overexpression may contribute to its antiremodeling effects...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) have {{increased}} resistance to cancer chemotherapy. They can be enriched as drug-surviving CSCs (D-CSCs) by growth with chemotherapeutic drugs, and/or by sorting of cells expressing CSC markers such as aldehyde dehydrogenase- 1 (ALDH). CSCs form colonies in agar, mammospheres in low-adherence cultures, and tumors following xenotransplantation in Scid mice. We hypothesized that <b>tranilast,</b> a non-toxic orally active drug with anti-cancer activities, would inhibit breast CSCs. We examined breast cancer cell lines or D-CSCs generated by growth of these cells with mitoxantrone. <b>Tranilast</b> inhibited colony formation, mammosphere formation and stem cell marker expression. Mitoxantrone-selected cells were enriched for CSCs expressing stem cell markers ALDH, c-kit, Oct- 4, and ABCG 2, and efficient at forming mammospheres. <b>Tranilast</b> markedly inhibited mammosphere formation by D-CSCs and dissociated formed mammospheres, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. It was effective against D-CSCs of both HER- 2 + and triple-negative cell lines. <b>Tranilast</b> was also effective in vivo, since it prevented lung metastasis in mice injected i. v. with triple-negative (MDA-MB- 231) mitoxantrone-selected cells. The molecular targets of <b>tranilast</b> in cancer have been unknown, {{but here we}} demonstrate it is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist and this plays a key role. AHR is a transcription factor activated by 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other ligands. <b>Tranilast</b> induced translocation of the AHR to the nucleus and stimulated CYP 1 A 1 expression (a marker of AHR activation). It inhibited binding of the AHR to CDK 4, which {{has been linked to}} cell-cycle arrest. D-CSCs expressed higher levels of the AHR than other cells. Knockdown of the AHR with siRNA, or blockade with an AHR antagonist, entirely abrogated the anti-proliferative and anti-mammosphere activity of <b>tranilast.</b> Thus, the anti-cancer effects of <b>tranilast</b> are AHR dependent. We show that <b>tranilast</b> is an AHR agonist with inhibitory effects on breast CSCs. It is effective against CSCs of triple-negative breast cancer cells selected for anti-cancer drug resistance. These results suggest it might find applications in the treatment of breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitory {{effects of}} DSCG, <b>tranilast,</b> ketotifen, azelastine, {{antiallergic}} agents, and nicardipine, a calcium ion antagonist, on (45) Ca uptake and histamine release by rat peritoneal mast cells were examined when {{the cells were}} stimulated with antigen and com. 48 / 80. All of these agents inhibited both (45) Ca uptake and histamine release by mast cells stimulated with antigen in a dose-dependent manner. When the cells were stimulated with both antigen and phosphatidylserine (PS), inhibitory effects of DSCG and <b>tranilast</b> on (45) Ca uptake decreased, although effets of ketotifen and nicardipine were not affected {{by the addition of}} PS. Only the effect of DSCG on the release of histamine decreased in the experiments in which PS was added. When the cells were stimulated with com. 48 / 80, inhibitory effects of DSCG and <b>tranilast</b> on (45) Ca uptake and histamine release decreased, although the inhibitory effects of ketotifen and nicardipine did not decrease. The effects of the preincubation time with the agents on (45) Ca uptake and histamine release of mast cells were examined. The inhibitory effects of DSCG and <b>tranilast</b> were reduced by prolonged preincubation of mast cells with the agents.

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) is {{the progressive}} form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease {{and is one}} of the most common liver diseases in the developed world. The histological findings of NASH are characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, an optimal treatment for NASH has not been established. <b>Tranilast,</b> N-(3 ′, 4 ′-dimedioxycinnamoyl) - anthranilic acid, is an antifibrogenic agent that inhibits the action of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). This drug is used clinically for fibrogenesis-associated skin disorders including hypertrophic scars and scleroderma. TGF-β plays a central role in the development of hepatic fibrosis, and <b>tranilast</b> may thus ameliorate the pathogenesis of NASH. We investigated the effects of <b>tranilast</b> using an established dietary animal model of NASH, obese diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats and nondiabetic control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats fed a methionine-deficient and choline-deficient diet. Treatment with 2 % <b>tranilast</b> (420 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks prevented the development of hepatic fibrosis and the activation of stellate cells, and down-regulated the expression of genes for TGF-β and TGF-β-target molecules, including α 1 procollagen and plasminogen activator- 1. In addition, <b>tranilast</b> attenuated hepatic inflammation and Kupffer cell recruitment, and down-regulated the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Unexpectedly, <b>tranilast</b> ameliorated hepatic steatosis and up-regulated the expression of genes involved in beta-oxidation, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase- 1. Most of these effects were observed in LETO rats and OLETF rats, which suggest that the action of <b>tranilast</b> is mediated through the insulin resistance-independent pathway. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that targeting TGF-β with <b>tranilast</b> represents a new mode of therapy for NASH.

40|$|Background: Anti-allergic drugs, such as <b>tranilast</b> and ketotifen, {{inhibit the}} release of chemokines from mast cells. However, we know little about their direct effects on the exocytotic process of mast cells. Since {{exocytosis}} in mast cells can be monitored electrophysiologically by changes in the whole-cell membrane capacitance (Cm), {{the absence of such}} changes by these drugs indicates their mast cell-stabilizing properties. Methods: Employing the standard patch-clamp whole-cell recording technique in rat peritoneal mast cells, we examined the effects of <b>tranilast</b> and ketotifen on the Cm during exocytosis. Using confocal imaging of a water-soluble fluorescent dye, lucifer yellow, we also examined their effects on the deformation of the plasma membrane. Results: Relatively lower concentrations of <b>tranilast</b> (100, 250 µM) and ketotifen (1, 10 µM) did not significantly affect the GTP-&# 947;-S-induced increase in the Cm. However, higher concentrations of <b>tranilast</b> (500 µM, 1 mM) and ketotifen (50, 100 µM) almost totally suppressed the increase in the Cm, and washed out the trapping of the dye {{on the surface of the}} mast cells. Compared to <b>tranilast,</b> ketotifen required much lower doses to similarly inhibit the degranulation of mast cells or the increase in the Cm. Conclusions: This study provides electrophysiological evidence for the first time that <b>tranilast</b> and ketotifen dose-dependently inhibit the process of exocytosis, and that ketotifen is more potent than <b>tranilast</b> in stabilizing mast cells. The mast cell-stabilizing properties of these drugs may be attributed to their ability to counteract the plasma membrane deformation in degranulating mast cells...|$|E
40|$|Background—Activation of {{vascular}} chymase plays a {{major role}} in myointimal hypertrophy after vascular injury by augmenting the production of angiotensin (ANG) II. Because chymase is synthesized mainly in mast cells, we assumed that the chymase-dependent ANG II formation could be downregulated by <b>tranilast,</b> a mast cell–stabilizing antiallergic agent. We have assessed inhibitory effects of <b>tranilast</b> on neointima formation after balloon injury in the carotid artery of dogs, which share a similar ANG II–forming chymase with humans, and further explored the pathophysiological significance of vascular chymase. Methods and Results—Either <b>tranilast</b> (50 mg/kg BID) or vehicle was orally administered to beagles for 2 weeks before and 4 weeks after balloon injury. Four weeks after the injury, remarkable neointima was formed in the carotid arteries of vehicle-treated dogs. Chymase mRNA levels and chymaselike activity of vehicle-treated injured arteries were increased 10. 2 - and 4. 8 -fold, respectively, those of uninjured arteries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was slightly increased in the injured arteries, whereas ACE mRNA levels were not. <b>Tranilast</b> treatment completely prevented the increase in chymaselike activity, reduced the chymase mRNA levels by 43 %, and decreased the carotid intima/media ratio by 63 %. In vehicle-treated injured arteries, mast cell count in the adventitia showed a great increase, which was completely prevented by the <b>tranilast</b> treatment. Vascular ACE activity and mRNA levels were unaffected by <b>tranilast...</b>|$|E

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is recognized as a potent downstream mediator of TGF-β 1. Both proximal tubule cells (PTCs) and cortical fibroblasts (CFs) {{are considered to be}} responsible for the production of tubulointerstitial extracellular matrix (ECM). These studies were undertaken to assess the profibrotic effects of CTGF in an in vitro model of the human PTCs and CFs, and to determine whether <b>tranilast</b> is effective in limiting the in vitro matrix responses induced by CTGF. Primary cultures of PTCs and CFs were exposed to CTGF (20 ng/ml) ±tranilast (100 μM). Cell hypertrophy and the secretion of the ECM proteins fibronectin and collagen IV were determined. The effects of <b>tranilast</b> on TGF-β 1 -induced CTGF mRNA expression and on phosphorylation of Smad 2 were determined. CTGF significantly induced cell hypertrophy, increased fibronectin, and collagen IV secretion in PTCs and CFs. In all cases, the CTGF-induced increase in ECM protein was inhibited in the presence of <b>tranilast.</b> <b>Tranilast</b> reduced CTGF mRNA and phosphorylation of Smad 2, which were induced by TGF-β 1 in PTCs and CFs. These results suggest that <b>tranilast</b> is a potential effective antifibrotic compound in the kidney, exerting its effects via inhibition of TGF-β 1 -induced CTGF expression and downstream activation of the Smad 2 pathway in both PTCs and CFs...|$|E
