40|$|Mo 2 P as a {{new member}} of the {{advancing}} two-dimensional (2 D) materials family has been theoretically identified in this study. We conducted extensive density functional theory calculations to explore the crystal structure, dynamical stability, mechanical response, electronic structure and optical properties. Mo 2 P {{was found to be}} metallic with the Fermi energy locating at the d bands of transition metal Mo. A high reflectivity of ~ 100 % at low energies less than 1 eV was observed, introducing Mo 2 P as a potential candidate for photonic and optoelectronic applications such <b>as</b> <b>transmitting</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> waves devices. Our calculations confirm that the novel 2 D structure is dynamically stable and can withstand at high temperatures including 1000 K. Mo 2 P was found to yield high tensile strength and elastic modulus of 12 GPa. nm and 56 GPa. nm, respectively. We particularly evaluated the application of Mo 2 P as an anode material for Li and Na-ion rechargeable batteries. Comment: Applied Materials Today 201...|$|R

Current technologies have {{become a source of}} omnipresent electromagnetic pollution from generated electromagnetic fields and resulting electromagnetic radiation. In many cases this pollution is much stronger than any natural sources of electromagnetic fields or radiation. The harm caused by this pollution is still open to question since there is no clear and definitive evidence of its negative influence on humans. This is despite the fact that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields were classified as potentially carcinogenic. For these reasons, in recent decades a significant growth can be observed in scientific research {{in order to understand the}} influence of electromagnetic radiation on living organisms. However, for this type of research the appropriate selection of relevant model organisms is of great importance. It should be noted here that the great majority of scientific research papers published in this field concerned various tests performed on mammals, practically neglecting lower organisms. In that context the objective of this paper is to systematise our knowledge in this area, in which the influence of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiatio...</b>|$|R

40|$|If space, {{time and}} mass-energy expand {{outward from the}} Big Bang along the time axis equally in the (+) and (-) directions, then time is {{symmetric}} by Weyl's definition. In the Feynman-Stueckelberg Interpretation, antimatter is identical to matter but moves backward in time. This paper argues this interpretation is physically real, leading to the universe containing dark matter with mass accumulations similar to ordinary matte. As time expands, in both directions away from the origin, quantum uncertainty allows a brief, decreasing leakage of mass between (+) and (-) universes. Matter leaking from (-) to (+) time moves forward in time, producing preponderance of matter in (+) time. Antimatter leakage from (+) time to (-) time {{in the same way}} produces antimatter preponderance in the (-) time universe. The remaining opposite partner particles left by the leakage, (antimatter and matter respectively) proceeding outward in antitime and time respectively, after many annihilations also increase the two preponderances in the two universes. The anti-universe should be observable by gravitational lensing, predicting "MACHOS" of approximately stellar mass, and multiple micro-lensing of quasars. Non-existence of primordial antimatter of Z> 1, and a large variation in the quantities of dark matter associated with different individual galaxies are predicted. A symmetry is provided for Nodland and Ralston's observed maximum axis of rotation of polarization of galactic synchrotron radiation. A new solution of the horizon problem at times close to the origin is indicated. Collapse of the wave function and time's arrow are explained and non-locality and instantaneity of quantum interaction required. Extension of the hypothesis to six dimensions gives an 83. 3 % dark matter share of the universe.
