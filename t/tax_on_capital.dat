25|$|A {{capital gain}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> gains (often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> income ranges between 0. 4 and 0. 6 in OECD countries.

We derive analytically the positive optimal <b>tax</b> rates <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> income. Under the fiscal constraint, the optimal <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> income depends <b>on</b> the discount rate, the rate of capital depreciation, and the ratio of government spending to GDP.

40|$|In {{an economy}} with {{identical}} infinitely-lived households that obtain utility from leisure {{as well as}} consumption, Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985) {{have shown that the}} optimal tax system to pay for an exogenous stream of government purchases involves a zero <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> in the long run, with tax revenue collected by a distortionary <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> labor income. Extending the results of Hall and Jorgenson (1971) to general equilibrium, I show that if purchasers of capital are permitted to deduct capital expenditures from taxable capital income, then a constant <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> income is non-distortionary. Importantly, even though this specification of the capital income tax imposes a zero effective <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>capital,</b> the capital income tax can collect substantial revenue.
