5|$|Apical abscesses {{can spread}} to involve {{periodontal}} pockets around a <b>tooth,</b> <b>and</b> periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E
5|$|As in all oryzomyines, {{the upper}} molars all have one root {{on the inner}} (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar in Pseudoryzomys and some other species has another labial root. The first lower molar has large roots at {{the front and back}} of the <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two roots at the front, one labial and one lingual, and another at the back.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are polyphyodonts {{and able}} to replace each of their {{approximately}} 80 teeth up to 50 times in their 35 to 75-year lifespan. They are the only non-mammalian vertebrates with tooth sockets. Next to each full-grown tooth {{there is a small}} replacement <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> an odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina in standby, which can be activated when required. Tooth replacement slows significantly and eventually stops as the animal grows old.|$|E
50|$|Dental braces (also {{known as}} braces, {{orthodontic}} cases, or cases) are devices used in orthodontics that align <b>and</b> straighten <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> help position them {{with regard to}} a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. They are often used to correct underbites, as well as malocclusions, overbites, open bites, deep bites, cross bites, crooked <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> various other flaws of the <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> jaw. Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often {{used in conjunction with}} other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> jaws.|$|R

5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the <b>tooth,</b> <b>and</b> about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E

In males, the labium is two-fifths as long as the maxillae, and as wide as it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> a long, curved fang.|$|E
5|$|The fossils {{from near}} Santa Fé {{included}} the horse tooth which had puzzled Darwin {{as it had}} been previously thought that horses had only come to the Americas in the 16th century, close to a Toxodon <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> a tooth of Mastodon andium (now Cuvieronius hyodon). Owen confirmed that the horse tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named Equus curvidens, and its age was confirmed by a corroded horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils. This discovery was later explained as part of the evolution of the horse.|$|E

5|$|The survey {{continued}} {{to the south}} in Patagonia.

He identified the little-known Megatherium by a <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him {{to be like a}} giant version of the armour on local armadillos.

5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E

5|$|Ampelosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known titanosaurian sauropods from Europe. Since 1989, over 500 bones discovered at the Upper Cretaceous Bellevue locality of southern France have been assigned to A. atacis. An abundant amount of well-preserved elements have been uncovered at Bellevue. In the original description, only a <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> some vertebrae were examined. In 2005, a complete description was made by Le Loueff of all known material, allowing Ampelosaurus to be much better understood. All the material has been assigned to the species, and even though there are some differences in limb proportions, it has all been linked to individual variation.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They could find no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>and</b> is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E
