50|$|During its {{operational}} life, Bala Junction {{served as}} an interchange station for the branch line train to Blaenau Festiniog, usually operated by small tank locomotives such as the 6400 Class 0-6-0PT and 5800 Class 0-4-2T tank locomotives. These trains did not run beyond Bala Junction, instead returning north to the GWR station at Blaenau Festiniog. There were no goods facilities here either; all goods trains stopped <b>to</b> shunt <b>detached</b> <b>wagons</b> for the branch line train.|$|R
5000|$|During the Gettysburg Campaign, the 2nd Vermont Brigade {{was one of}} four brigades {{sent from}} the Capital to join the Army of the Potomac as it pursued Robert E. Lee into Pennsylvania. Stannard's command left the Washington {{defenses}} on June 25. Marching 18 miles a day for a week, the brigade reported to the 3rd Division of the I Corps. The I Corps had fought, and lost, heavily in {{the first day of the}} Battle of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863. Three regiments of Stannard's men arrived only after the fighting ceased that day, adding to the division's depleted ranks. (The other two regiments, the 12th and 15th Vermont, had been <b>detached</b> <b>to</b> guard <b>wagon</b> trains.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of an incline was typically {{controlled by the}} brakesman positioned at the winding house. A variety of systems were used to communicate with workers {{at the bottom of}} the incline, whose job it was <b>to</b> attach and <b>detach</b> the <b>wagons</b> from the incline cable. One of the most common communication methods was a simple electrical bell system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{goods train}} had left Carlisle at 06:55 and made calls at Floriston, Gretna and Kirkpatrick stations, {{arriving}} at Kirtlebridge at 07:55. At Gretna {{the driver had}} been informed that the following passenger station had not left Carlisle at 07:27. On arrival at Kirtlebridge, the train crossed to the up line and detached a brake van and three wagons, and left them on the running line. The engine and part train returned to the down line and entered the down sidings, dropping two wagons there. It {{then returned to the}} up line and recoupled the <b>detached</b> <b>wagons,</b> and entered the up siding.|$|R

40|$|Using a parallel-plate flow chamber, the {{hydrodynamic}} {{shear forces}} to prevent bacterial adhesion (F(prev)) and <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> adhering bacteria (F(det)) were evaluated for hydrophilic glass, hydrophobic, dimethyldichlorosilane (DDS) -coated glass and six different bacterial strains, {{in order to}} test the following three hypotheses. 1. A strong hydrodynamic shear force to prevent adhesion relates to a strong hydrodynamic shear force <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> an adhering organism. 2. A weak hydrodynamic shear force <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> adhering bacteria implies that more bacteria will be stimulated <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> by passing an air-liquid interface (an air bubble) through the flow chamber. 3. DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek) interactions determine the characteristic hydrodynamic shear forces to prevent adhesion and <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> adhering micro-organisms as well as the detachment induced by a passing air-liquid interface. F(prev) varied from 0. 03 to 0. 70 pN, while F(det) varied from 0. 31 to over 19. 64 pN, suggesting that after initial contact, strengthening of the bond occurs. Generally, it was more difficult <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> bacteria from DIDS-coated glass than from hydrophilic glass, which was confirmed by air bubble detachment studies. Calculated attractive forces based on the DLVO theory (F(DLVO)) towards the secondary interaction minimum were higher on glass than on DIDS-coated glass. In general, all three hypotheses had to be rejected, showing {{that it is important to}} distinguish between forces acting parallel (hydrodynamic shear) and perpendicular (DLVO, air-liquid interface passages) to the substratum surface...|$|R
