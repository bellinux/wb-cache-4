25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, she hired William Lawrence Bottomley {{to create a}} unique {{addition}} known as the Finger Bowl, an outdoor dining area consisting of a raised pool surrounded by a flat ledge. Chairs were {{pulled up to the}} ledge and food was served from bowls floating on the water. It was sheltered by a wisteria-covered arbor supported by 12 stone piers. In the late 1930s, Gifford Pinchot started the White Pine Plantation <b>to</b> <b>reforest</b> some old farmland near the mansion. He was particularly interested in that species since it was the dominant tree in the forests of Pike County and had been heavily harvested during the previous century.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} amate paper commercialization {{has led to}} {{environmental}} issues in the San Pablito area and farther away. It is getting harder to find bark due to the over-stripping of trees {{and the loss of}} forests to agriculture and development. There have been attempts to cultivate the tree species currently used for paper-making, but without success. Currently, there are attempts <b>to</b> <b>reforest</b> the area with a similar species which grows to maturity faster. The use of caustic soda and industrial dyes in the process of making amate has caused problems with pollution, especially of the San Marcos River, whose waters then pollute the Cazones River.|$|E
25|$|Sizerville State Park {{is named}} after the nearby ghost town of Sizerville, Pennsylvania, which was in turn named for the Sizer family, early {{settlers}} of the region. With {{the end of the}} logging boom of the late 19th century, the town was gradually abandoned. Sizerville State Park was first opened in 1924. The first park facilities were opened in 1927. The Civilian Conservation Corps led an effort <b>to</b> <b>reforest</b> the lands surrounding Sizerville State park during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Thousands of acres of old growth timber had been logged {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. The CCC planted thousands of acres of white pine and hemlock trees. Today these trees have reached maturity and make up most of the forested acres of Sizerville State Park.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{conducted}} in Victoria, Australia, {{the changes in}} soil biotic and abiotic attributes, organic carbon (OC), mineral nitrogen (MN), total dissolved solutes (TDS) and pH were characterised {{to assess the impact}} of land-use change from bare riparian (BR) <b>to</b> <b>reforested</b> riparian (RR). Additionally, the benefits of revegetating a deforested creek bank with regard to salinity abatement and C-sequestration potentials were assessed.|$|R
50|$|European {{subsidies}} are attributed in priority <b>to</b> <b>reforesting</b> land after forests were felled {{for the production}} of cereals during the preceding generations. Moreover, within the frame of Europe's present Common Agricultural Policy (in 2010) cereals get more subsidies than other crops. A revision of that politic is due in 2013. The choices that will be made then will be determinant {{for the future of the}} Mancha Húmeda. Another determining factor is the developing of other local economics such as solar electricity, ecotourism, better quality agricultural products, and environmental services (carbon sinks for example).|$|R

2500|$|Women's clubs were {{involved}} in protecting natural resources. Many women's clubs started out by beautifying their cities and states. Clubs would sponsor and maintain playgrounds, and dedicate and maintain cemeteries. Later, clubs, like a Michigan women's club, would work <b>to</b> <b>reforest</b> parts of the state. In Idaho, women's clubs helped prevent logging in national forests. GFWC had been active since 1890 in areas related to forestry and had a forestry committee. This committee also disseminated information about conservation to the 800,000 members of the group. The GFWC later sponsored [...] "a natural scenic area survey" [...] of the United States in 1915 in order to discover areas that needed conservation. As women saw environmentally fragile areas start to be developed, many objected. Women worked within existing clubs, and also formed new conservation-based clubs, to protect the environment.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, certain {{organizations}} {{are looking into}} biomass briquette substitution {{in order to reduce}} the demand for fuelwood. Sustainable fuelwood production techniques are also being implemented. The Eco-Makala project under the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has pledged <b>to</b> <b>reforest</b> 4500 ha by 2012 to provide the people of Goma with fuelwood. In the project, the trees are planted on soil belonging to local farmers, with the farmer's permission. The farmer hence becomes owner of the trees, and is able to make his own charcoal from these using a clamp. This amount of wood being planted to offset fuelwood collection is minimal when considering that over 300,000 ha of forest are destroyed each year alone. [...] The REDD campaign is aimed at addressing climate change as all of it projects are working towards an overall world reduction in its emissions by approximately 17 Gt CO2e by 2020 in order to arrive at the GHG atmospheric concentration target of 445 parts per million (pm) of CO2e.|$|E
30|$|Even {{though the}} depth-incremented {{distributions}} of soil organic carbon (OC), soil mineral nitrogen (MN), total dissolved solutes (TDS) and pH were not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate changes in land-use management practices from native forest to cropland (CP) or bare riparian (BR) {{and then from}} BR <b>to</b> <b>reforested</b> riparian (RR), the OC-, MN- and TDS-pools were effective as sensitive indicators to discriminate changes in land-use. However, the pools were not consistently sensitive enough to differentiate the temporal impact of reforestation on the changes in soil condition. The net-deposition of OC and the net-depletion of TDS {{were found to be}} sufficiently sensitive to differentiate site-specific and temporal impacts of reforestation. However, there was also a potential for the temporal impact of reforestation on the soil attributes to be overridden by site-specific variability.|$|R
50|$|During {{the time}} of the CCC, enrollees planted nearly 3 billion trees <b>to</b> help <b>reforest</b> America, {{constructed}} trails, lodges and related facilities in more than 800 parks nationwide and upgraded most state parks, updated forest fire fighting methods, and built a network of service buildings and public roadways in remote areas.|$|R

2500|$|In the United States in 2004 (the {{most recent}} year for which EPA {{statistics}} are available), forests sequestered 10.6% (637 MegaTonnes) of the carbon dioxide released in the United States by the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas; 5657 MegaTonnes). [...] Urban trees sequestered another 1.5% (88 MegaTonnes). [...] To further reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 7%, as stipulated by the Kyoto Protocol, would require the planting of [...] "an {{area the size of}} Texas [...] every 30 years". [...] Carbon offset programs are planting millions of fast-growing trees per year <b>to</b> <b>reforest</b> tropical lands, for as little as $0.10 per tree; over their typical 40-year lifetime, one million of these trees will fix 1 to 2 MegaTonnes of carbon dioxide. [...] In Canada, reducing timber harvesting would have very little impact on carbon dioxide emissions because of the combination of harvest and stored carbon in manufactured wood products along with the regrowth of the harvested forests. Additionally, the amount of carbon released from harvesting is small compared to the amount of carbon lost each year to forest fires and other natural disturbances.|$|E

40|$|Policy and {{decision}} makers dealing with environmental conservation {{and land use}} planning often require identifying potential sites for contributing to minimize sediment flow reaching riverbeds. This {{could be one of}} the environmental objectives of reforestation initiatives. An Integer Programming (IP) formulation for selecting a predefined number of locations to minimize sediment load at a watershed outlet has been previously developed. This paper tests that formulation under the assumption that the area <b>to</b> be <b>reforested</b> is not known in advance, a budget constraint is included instead. Therefore the extension of the reforested area is subject to this budget constraint, which makes the problem more complex. Several experiments are performed for two watersheds in South Dakota in the USA. The results show the sediment load at the watershed outlet as well as the erosion levels, slopes and distances to the riverbeds of the locations selected <b>to</b> be <b>reforested.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Soil {{fertility}} {{is important}} factors {{for growth and}} productivity of vegetation [1 – 3]. Vegetation structure, soil moisture and nutrients have very close relationship. Different soil nutrients affect vegetation community {{the size of the}} biomass, species composition and diversity [4]. Soil nitrogen determines the productivity, biodiversity and species invasive capacity of vegetation communities [5 – 7]. Phosphorus is a restrictive factor in a variety of soil types, and determines the size of vegetation productivity and change of species composition [8 – 12]. Potassium also affects community biomass [10] and state of vegetation water, and help to overcome soil moisture stress [13]. So, in vegetation restoration and reconstruction, it is should be considered that soil properties of abandoned farmland to assure that the ideal and realistic restoration goals [4]. However, over exploitation of existing vegetation further aggravates the problem of land degradation and supply of fuel and fodder in this area, and reduced nutrients retention [14]. Deterioration of soil fertility is important in vegetation restoration, especially for converting agricultural land <b>to</b> <b>reforested</b> plantations or grassland. This topic is also important in estimating the role of natural vegetation recovery in soil rehabilitation of the Loess Plateau, where little natural vegetation exists, helping to guide current restoration of vegetation in west China.|$|R
