25|$|Regulatory {{signs are}} mostly {{circular}} and mostly black {{on a white}} background, with a red border. If the sign contains a prohibition, a red line will diagonally bisect the sign. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> sign was introduced in 1956 with the Traffic Signs Regulations, 1956. Some signs were added later.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{introduced}} 'agency', {{where one}} local authority (usually a district) could {{act as an}} agent for another authority. For example, since road maintenance was split depending upon the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road,</b> both types of council had to retain engineering departments. A county council could delegate its road maintenance to the district council if it was confident that the district was competent. Some powers were specifically excluded from agency, such as education.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{verification}} <b>of</b> the new <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> safety barriers suffers from several deficiencies including {{a lack of}} prescriptive models for impact forces caused by various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> vehicles. For specification of the load-bearing members of barriers, alternative procedures including dynamic, non-linear and probabilistic analyses may be applied. Detailed analysis is based on crash test simulations using models of vehicles based on the finite element method...|$|R

500|$|By 1877 {{there was}} a twice daily mail and {{passenger}} cart connecting Carrick to the railway station at Bishopbourne and [...] "Blair's Bus" [...] ran thrice weekly to Launceston. The Bass Highway, which passed through Carrick, had been designated a National Highway {{as part of the}} Federal National Highway Act 1974. The structure of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> required that the centre of Carrick be bypassed. The road through Carrick is now known as the Meander Valley Highway. Bass Highway, which connects Launceston, Burnie and Devonport, passes south of the town. As of 2011 Redline Coaches, runs a daily school bus service that passes through Carrick to many of the Schools in and around Launceston and regular services connecting Carrick to Burnie, Launceston, Hobart and towns in between.|$|E
500|$|A road along {{what is now}} Great Eastern Highway {{has existed}} since the convict era of Western Australia. The {{original}} road {{is thought to have}} been constructed in 1867, using convict labour, with a road base made of jarrah tree trunks cut into disc shapes. The use of wooden discs as a road base had been proposed by Western Australian Governor John Hampton, leading them to be known as [...] "Hampton's Cheeses". The discs were approximately [...] thick and as large as [...] in diameter, and the gaps between pieces would have been filled with soil or lime. The same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> is known to have existed along Stirling Highway, Guildford Road, Albany Highway and Wanneroo Road in the 1860s, and would have prevented horses and carts from getting bogged in wet weather. Evidence of this original road was found in Belmont in 1948 when widening works uncovered jarrah discs. During upgrade works in 2012, more discs were discovered beneath the existing asphalt, over a [...] stretch.|$|E
2500|$|Conair and cai were general terms, {{given in}} Cormac's Glossary, for any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> and [...] "thirty-seven ancient roads [...] {{mentioned}} {{with the general}} name bealach", meaning 'pass'.

2500|$|... strada urbana di scorrimento (meaning urban expressway) or type-D road: a road {{in urban}} context, with {{separate}} carriageways, {{and at least}} two lanes for each direction. At-level junctions with smaller roads, regulated by traffic lights, are allowed as well as roundabouts. Unless a prohibition sign is placed, there are not access restrictions. Speed limit on this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> is up to 70 kilometers per hour.|$|E
2500|$|The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> {{included}} {{public high}} or main roads, constructed and maintained {{at the public}} expense, and with their soil vested in the state. Such roads led either to the sea, or to a town, or to a public river (one with a constant flow), or to another public road.

2500|$|The {{assertion}} that the first pathways were the trails made by animals has not been universally accepted; [...] in many cases animals do not follow constant paths. Others believe that some roads originated from [...] following animal trails. [...] The Icknield Way is given {{as an example of}} this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> origination, where man and animal both selected the same natural line. By about 10,000 BC, rough roads/pathways were used by human travelers.|$|E
2500|$|UK {{speed limits}} {{are shown in}} mph.

2500|$|In the United States, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> may {{be called}} a divided highway, boulevard, parkway, expressway, freeway, or interstate, and has a grassy median or Jersey barrier {{separating}} the traffic directions. With few exceptions, all roads in the federally funded Interstate Highway System are fully controlled access divided highways known as freeways. A broader definition, expressways, includes both freeways and partial limited-access divided highways, and [...] "expressway" [...] is often used specifically {{to refer to the}} latter.|$|E

2500|$|Warning {{signs are}} similar to the United States design, in that they are black on an amber (orangish yellow) background, and are diamond shaped. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> sign was {{introduced}} in 1956 with the Traffic Signs Regulations, 1956. Some signs were added later, and many types of signs, even common ones, do not appear in any statutes. Some types of sign in particular (for example, pedestrian/zebra crossing signage) are somewhat randomly designed, and differ between county/city boroughs.|$|E
2500|$|... strada extraurbana {{principale}} (meaning main highway) or type-B road: a {{road with}} separate carriageways, {{at least two}} lanes for each direction, paved shoulder {{on the right and}} no cross-traffic. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> is quite similar to an autostrada or type-A road (Italian official name for motorways or freeways), but its building standards are lower. Access limitations and drive behaviour on type-B roads are exactly the same of the motorways (no pedestrians, bicycles and other slow vehicles), as well as the signage (except for the background color, that is blue instead of green). Speed limit on type-B roads is up to 110 kilometers per hour. Type-B roads are always toll-free.|$|E
2500|$|In Canada, {{the term}} [...] "divided highway" [...] {{is used for}} this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>road,</b> and the segment between the roadways is {{referred}} to as a [...] "median". [...] There may be gaps in the median strip of a partially controlled-access road to allow turning and crossing. More informally, a divided highway may be referred to as [...] "twinned". This stems from the practice of [...] "twinning" [...] an existing two-lane highway and converting it into a divided highway. [...] Divided highways are usually freeways in southern Ontario, southern Quebec, and parts of Atlantic Canada where robust federal and provincial funding has made such freeways possible. However, {{due to a lack of}} funding elsewhere, partial controlled-access [...] "expressways" [...] and limited-mobility divided arterial roads are more common in the western provinces where there are no specially numbered systems of freeways.|$|E
