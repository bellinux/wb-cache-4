5|$|After {{the public}} and press {{interest}} garnered from Echo & the Bunnymen's debut album, Crocodiles, the band released <b>the</b> <b>Shine</b> So Hard EP which maintained their profile. Work then soon began on their second album, Heaven Up Here. Following musical differences between the band and Crocodiles producers Bill Drummond and David Balfe, Hugh Jones {{was brought in to}} produce Heaven Up Here. Jones had previously engineered Crocodiles and co-produced Shine So Hard with Drummond. Jones would later go on to produce the band's 2005 album Siberia. The band were also given an additional producer credit. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales during March 1981.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking <b>the</b> <b>shine</b> off the new ball.|$|E

5000|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path quickly {{seized control}} of large areas of Peru, it soon faced serious problems. <b>The</b> <b>Shining</b> Path's Maoism never {{had the support of}} the {{majority}} of the Peruvian people; according to opinion polls, only 15% of the population considered subversion to be justifiable in June 1988, while only 17% considered it justifiable in 1991. In June 1991, [...] "the total sample disapproved of <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path by an 83 to 7 percent margin, with 10 percent not answering the question. Among the poorest, however, only 58% stated disapproval of <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path; 11 percent said they had a favorable opinion of <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path, and some 31 percent would not answer the question." [...] A September 1991 poll found that 21 percent of those polled in Lima believed that <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path did not kill and torture innocent people. The same poll found that 13% believed that society would be more just if <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path won <b>the</b> war and 22% believed society would be equally just under <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path as it was under the government.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Shining</b> Path {{followed}} <b>the</b> {{ideas of}} Marx, Mao, and Lenin. They wanted {{something similar to}} the Chinese Revolution to happen in Peru. This revolution would demolish the government and Peruvian institutions. <b>The</b> <b>Shining</b> Path {{did not believe that}} social organizations were helping the country, but were of no use. The government to <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path was meant to be destroyed, and in their attempt to do so, they killed mostly peasants (30,000). That does not count the many innocent people that died once the Peruvian military was involved in their attempt to capture <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path. <b>The</b> people lived in fear: if they supported the military they would be killed by <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path, and if they supported <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> Path they would be killed by the government.|$|R
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking <b>the</b> <b>shine</b> off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Sunshine shares many similar {{gameplay}} elements {{with its}} predecessor, Super Mario 64, while introducing various new gameplay features. Players control Mario {{as he tries}} to obtain 120 Shine Sprites in order to bring light back to Isle Delfino and prove his innocence after Bowser Jr. (disguised as Mario) steals <b>the</b> <b>Shine</b> Sprites and covers the island in toxic slime. Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Similar to collecting Stars in Super Mario 64, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites in the boathouse in Delfino Plaza.|$|E

25|$|Normal swing occurs mostly {{when the}} ball is fairly new. As it wears more, the {{aerodynamics}} of the asymmetry change and {{it is more difficult}} to extract a large amount of swing. When the ball becomes very old—around 40 or more overs old—it begins to swing towards <b>the</b> <b>shine.</b> This is known as reverse swing—meaning a natural outswinger will become an inswinger and vice versa. In essence, both sides have turbulent flow, but here the seam causes the airflow to separate earlier on one side. The result is always a swing to the side with the later separation, so the swing is away from the seam.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Hoggard was a {{specialist}} orthodox swing bowler, and usually took the new ball for England in Test cricket. Hoggard's primary {{role in the}} team was to utilise <b>the</b> <b>shine</b> on the new ball to test the technique of top-order batsmen against the swinging delivery. If, due to pitch or atmospheric conditions, the new ball did not swing he could be ineffective. Hoggard {{was seen as the}} consistent bowler in the team. Hoggard also had a sound defensive batting technique, but was not known for scoring runs, averaging only 7.40 with the bat. He could block up an end for the batsman at the other end to score, and was also used as a nightwatchman.|$|E
25|$|The {{curator at}} Old Trafford {{had been ordered}} to prepare a dusty, {{spinning}} pitch that was devoid of grass for the Fourth Test. A win for England would see them retain the Ashes. England's chairman of selectors and former captain Gubby Allen thought that the pitch would fall apart by tea on the first morning; the surface had already cracked {{before the start of}} play. When the curator asked Allen if he would like the remaining grass removed, he indicated {{that he would not be}} sad if it happened, so the groundsmen cut what remained of the grass. The umpires felt that the match would be over within three days. Miller bowled 21 wicketless overs for 41 runs as England amassed 459 on the deteriorating and crumbling pitch. Australia began batting after lunch on the second day, and the pace pair of Brian Statham and Trevor Bailey only bowled then overs to remove <b>the</b> <b>shine</b> from the ball before Laker and Lock took over.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Packer {{purchased}} an 18% {{stake in}} Network Ten, quickly offloading half to Murdoch. Both Packer and Murdoch joined the Ten board.

Although Ten was already in some financial difficulties before Murdoch became CEO, by late 2012, on paper Illyria had lost 110million of the original 150million invested since 2010. The share price had fallen by about 80% and network profits had dropped by over half.

25|$|England were {{inserted}} {{and started}} disastrously, losing Stewart and Ramprakash to Walsh's new ball spell before Atherton (144) and Smith (84) settled in, removed <b>the</b> <b>shine</b> {{and set about}} building the innings. They added 171 before Smith became the third man to fall, but Hick picked up from where he had left off at Sabina Park, compiling an innings of 33 that mixed aggression with temperance. Atherton was not out at the close on the first day, but Hick and Thorpe were both victims of the second new ball – Ambrose their tormentor this time around. The second morning was much less productive for the visitors, and although Lewis and Russell batted sensibly, they and final wicket Igglesden all fell with the score on 322. The West Indies openers saw off the new ball, and Haynes (63) and Lara (167) added their own century stand. Arthurton went cheaply, but Jimmy Adams justified his continued selection with a superb 137, his maiden test century, sharing partnerships of 112 with Lara, 126 with Chanderpaul (62) and 64 with Winston Benjamin, before being the last man out. Salisbury took four wickets but was very expensive, going at more than four an over.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania {{was much}} weaker {{than the other}} states in the 1960s and would not play in the Sheffield Shield until 1976–77, so {{the arrival of the}} MCC from the {{mainland}} was greeted with much anticipation. The captain of Tasmania was the wicketkeeper Len Maddocks, who had moved there from Victoria, but he lost the toss and M.J.K. Smith who rested some of his best players and decided to open the batting with Bob Barber. Smith top-scored with 96 and Jim Parks 91, though fellow-keeper John Murray was out for a duck. Colin Cowdrey made 63 and Barry Knight a quick-fire 45 not out. The fast-medium bowler Harold Allen took 3/63 and the leg-spinner Ken Flint suffered with 3/133. Smith declared on 371/9 and put Tasmania in to bat {{at the end of the}} first day, but they lost no wickets before stumps. They made steady progress, Kevin Brown and John Archer added 49 for the first wicket, Brian Richardson (112) made his maiden First Class century and Brian Patterson 67 not out, adding 48 for the last wicket with Flint (4) in a total of 322. Ken Higgs took 3/57 and Dave Allen 3/41. This was only a three-day game and Smith opened with Peter Parfitt late on the last morning. They added 46 for the first wicket, then Cowdrey (108), Parks (58) and Knight (51 not out) batted out the day with 289/7. It was the first tour match in which the MCC had not gone for a win, a policy which continued for the last few games and this rubbed some of <b>the</b> <b>shine</b> off their earlier bright cricket.|$|E
