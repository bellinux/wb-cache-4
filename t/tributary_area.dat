25|$|Landa de Matamoros {{is part of}} {{the heart}} of the Sierra Gorda. This region has been {{occupied}} for about 6000 years. In the Pre Classic and Classic periods, the Sierra Gorda had a number of small cities as the climate at that time was wetter than it is now. Most of the larger cities were south of the current municipalities due to mining activities and major trade routes, but there were cities and trade routes through here as well, connecting the area mostly with Huasteca areas to the east and other areas to the north. While most of the pre-Hispanic history of the area is dominated by peoples culturally related to the Huastecas, the site of the town of Landa de Matamoros is thought to have been first occupied by a group of Purépecha who migrated north from what is now Michoacán. As the climate of the Sierra Gorda dried out in the early Post Classic period, cities were abandoned for simpler hunter gatherer communities and there were migrations of Chichimecas, mostly Pames and Chichimeca Jonaz from the north. Landa would become Pame territory. The Pame would continue to dominate this area {{for the rest of the}} pre-Hispanic period, but small communities of Otomis and Huastecas would also be established as well. The Aztecs also made incursions here, which led to the formation of the Oxitilpa dominion, a commercially based political organization allied with the Aztecs. Aztec records indicate that the Sierra Gorda was a <b>tributary</b> <b>area,</b> but it is likely that the Aztecs only controls parts on the periphery up to the Pánuco River. This route leads to the modern settlement of Landa de Matamoros. However, archeological evidence so far is related to the Pame.|$|E

The first mode contributes significantly to the fluctuating load effect, when its influence line is similar to the mode-shape.

40|$|Roofs during windstorms are {{subjected}} to intense fluctuating external pressures at the windward roof edges. Loads on these areas can be greatly increased when combined with large positive internal pressures resulting from a breached windward wall, giving a large net uplift load. Thus the roof envelope and fixings generally experiences the highest wind loads of the structural components, and are the components most susceptible to failure. Peak cladding pressures derived from the corner and general roof areas for different building geometries representing typical low rise buildings have been determined using wind tunnel time series data. These pressures are significantly larger than design pressures derived from AS/NZS 1170. 2 : 2002. Moving point load testing has demonstrated the elongated <b>tributary</b> <b>area</b> of typical pierced fixed cladding types. The influence coefficients developed from the point load testing were {{used in conjunction with}} an analysis of time series data from a high density tapped wind tunnel model to reveal the relationship of the conical vortices and the elongated <b>tributary</b> <b>area</b> for the pierced fixed cladding. The <b>tributary</b> <b>area</b> and appropriate relationship with the relevant pressure taps were used to show the validity of generating simulated cyclonic wind pressure traces using wind tunnel pressure time series data.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear {{finite element analysis}} of non-seismically detailed reinforced concrete (RC) beam-column connections under reversed cyclic load. The test of half-scale nonductile reinforced concrete beam-column joints was conducted. The tested specimens represented those of the actual mid-rise reinforced concrete frame buildings designed according to the non-seismic provisions of the American Concrete building code (ACI). The test {{results show that the}} specimens representing small and medium column <b>tributary</b> <b>area</b> failed in brittle joint shear while the specimen representing large column <b>tributary</b> <b>area</b> failed by ductile flexure though no ductile reinforcement details were provided. The nonlinear finite element analysis was applied to simulate the behavior of the specimens. The finite element analysis employed the smeared crack approach for modeling beam, column and joint, and employed the discrete crack approach for modeling the interface between beam and joint face. The nonlinear constitutive models of reinforced concrete elements consisted of coupled tension-compression model to model normal force orthogonal and paralleled to the crack and shear transfer model to capture the shear sliding mechanism. The finite element model (FEM) shows good comparison with test results in terms of load-displacement relations, hysteretic loops, cracking process and the failure mode of the tested specimens. The finite element analysis clarified that the joint shear failure was caused by the collapse of principal diagonal concrete strut...|$|E
