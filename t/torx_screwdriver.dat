5000|$|An External Torx version exists, {{where the}} screw head has {{the shape of}} a <b>Torx</b> <b>screwdriver</b> bit, and a Torx socket is used to drive it. The {{external}} “E” Torx nominal sizing does not correlate to the “T” size, (e.g. an E40 socket is too large to fit an T40 Torx bit, while E8 Torx socket will fit a T40 Torx bit [...] ).|$|E
5000|$|Many modern {{electrical}} appliances, if {{they contain}} screws, use screws with heads {{other than the}} typical slotted or Phillips styles. Torx™ is one such pattern that has become widespread. It's a spline tip with a corresponding recess in the screw head. The main cause of this trend is manufacturing efficiency: <b>Torx</b> <b>screwdriver</b> tips do not slip out of the fastener as easily as would a Phillips or slotted driver. (Slotted screws are rarely used in mass-produced devices, since the driver is not inherently centered on the fastener.) ...|$|E

Manufacturing and Assembly 1 Overview and Toolset Here you can find manufacturing and assembly details for one Vitaprint unit. In this repository you can find STEP files for the Vitaprint unit in both orientations - Left and Right. The procedure {{is the same for}} both orientations (the final product is only mirrored) therefore you will find details for assembly for one unit in this repository. 1. 1 General Manufacturing time: approximately 8 h Assembly time: 30 min NOTE: manufacturing and assembly time estimates assume well-skilled user and presence of all the tools listed below 1. 2 Tool List and Skills Required 3 D printer (ABS) CNC mill CNC router band saw lathe HAND TOOLS: <b>torx</b> srewdriver phillips <b>screwdriver</b> super glue two-sided tape scalpel 1. 3 Necessary Steps purchase of raw materials and components manufacturing of parts assembly calibration 2 Part Manufacturing 3 Assembly Details manufacture all parts assemble each section separately, then join them together | SECTION A | SECTION B | SECTION C | | [...] -| [...] -| [...] -| | | | | Use philips DIN 965 screws wherever you see the hole chamfers, use torx BN 6404 screws elsewhere for the following steps gently apply hammer: sliding the ball bearing into the rod holder sliding the M 5 threaded rod into the coupler sliding the fi 3 stainless steel rod into rod holder at the bottom and N 11 motor plate at the top 4 Arduino: Temperature Regulation To download Arduino firmware for temperature regulation please visit vitaprint_heat_regulator. This is an external temperature control system and can be replaced by any system you may have available. Extruder calibration To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly. Calibration set-up In principle, the calibration set-up requires: CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor) the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts) a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable) The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement. Calibration procedure adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values) command piston movement for an exact distance measure the real movement distance and compare repeat steps 1 - 3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M 5 spindle (0. 5 mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914. 30. Thermistor calibration Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section. EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass. pour a small glass of oil (50 mL or so) place the glass on the heat source fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil prepare the system to read analog values turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1 °C increment plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature) fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others) software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega) Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values. step_vitaprint. zi...|$|R
