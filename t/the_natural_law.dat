25|$|Therefore, all sins {{are also}} against <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law.</b> But <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> of {{many aspects of}} life is knowable apart from special revelation by {{examining}} the forms and purposes of those aspects. It is in this sense that Aquinas considered homosexuality unnatural, since it involves a kind of partner other than the kind to which the purpose of sexuality points. He considered it comparable to heterosexual sex for pleasure (rather than reproduction).|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> was {{inherently}} teleological, however, {{it is most}} assuredly not deontological. For Christians, {{natural law}} is how man manifests the divine image in his life. This mimicry of God's own life is impossible to accomplish except {{by means of the}} power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that man is made in God's image, man is empowered by God's grace. Living <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> is how man displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all that is good. Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within man's control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as one lives <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law,</b> temporal satisfaction {{may or may not be}} attained, but salvation will be attained. The state, in being bound by <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law,</b> is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.|$|E

25|$|By the 17th Century, the Medieval teleological view {{came under}} intense {{criticism}} from some quarters. Thomas Hobbes instead founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) {{was subject to}} contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death {{at the hands of}} another). <b>The</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. Natural law, therefore, was discovered by considering humankind's natural rights, whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law.</b> In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. Because the ultimate source of law now comes from the sovereign, and the sovereign's decisions need not be grounded in morality, legal positivism is born. Jeremy Bentham's modifications on legal positivism further developed the theory.|$|E

25|$|In {{the medieval}} period, direct Jewish {{responses}} to Greek ethics {{may be seen}} in major rabbinic writings.

The NLP supported using scientifically verifiable procedures such as the Transcendental Meditation technique and TM-Sidhi program to reduce or eliminate the problems in society. The party was active in up to 74 countries and ran candidates in many countries including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Israel, and Taiwan.|$|E
