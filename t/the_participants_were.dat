5|$|The {{leaders of}} the major Allied powers met at the Potsdam Conference from July 16 to August 2, 1945. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, {{represented}} by Stalin, Winston Churchill (later Clement Attlee), and Truman respectively.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 2009 AAA {{held the}} Torneo Abismo Negro {{in honor of}} Palomeque, the tournament was a 7-man gauntlet-style match and {{included}} a mix of five AAA veterans and two Abismo Negro students. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> Cuervo, Black Abyss, Gato Eveready, Kempo Dragon, Joe Lider, Extreme Tiger and Relámpago. Relámpago, Abismo Negro's last student to turn professional, won the match after 48 minutes. The event was not televised and did not become an annual event. During Triplemania XVII {{there was a moment}} of silence in memory of Abismo Negro, Antonio Peña and Mitsuharu Misawa (Misawa had died the night before).|$|E
50|$|During a whispered speech test, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> and say a series of words in a soft whisper. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to repeat what <b>is</b> heard. If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> unable to {{distinguish}} the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> able {{to understand what is}} being said. The other ear is then tested.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} read a series of related word-reading and color-naming trials. In the first {{component}} of the task, known as the word-reading condition of <b>the</b> task, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to read}} {{as quickly as possible}} a series of color names printed either in white or other various colors. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to name the color of a series of colored blocks.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the major}} points that Asch makes is that {{participants}} are not completely blind in the experiment and making arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of the judgment because {{the context of the}} judgment and thus the meaning of the judgment had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> behaving logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author.|$|E
5|$|The 2017 Emirates Cup was a {{pre-season}} football friendly tournament {{hosted by}} Arsenal at its home ground, the Emirates Stadium. It was the ninth Emirates Cup, an invitational competition inaugurated in 2007. Held {{on the weekend}} of 29–30 July 2017, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> Arsenal, Sevilla, Benfica, and RB Leipzig. It was the first edition since 2015 as pitch reconstruction works put the tournament on hiatus in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Monbar Hotel {{attack was}} carried out by the GAL, a state-sponsored death squad, on 25 September 1985 in Bayonne, France. The targets were four members of ETA military, whom the Spanish {{government}} believed to be senior figures in the organisation, itself proscribed as a terrorist group in Spain and France. All four people were killed, with a fifth person, apparently unconnected to ETA, injured in the shooting. This represented the deadliest attack carried out by the GAL. Although two of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> apprehended shortly after the shooting, controversy surrounded the possible involvement of senior figures in the Spanish police.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{washed and}} anointed, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> dressed in <b>the</b> temple garment, a {{religious}} undergarment which <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> instructed to wear throughout {{his or her}} life. (Since 2005, <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> LDS Church version of the ritual already come clothed in this garment prior to the washing and anointing.) Finally, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> given a [...] "new name" [...] {{which he or she}} is instructed never to reveal except under certain conditions in the temple.|$|R
5000|$|For knockouts, a ten-count {{similar to}} boxing and kickboxing <b>is</b> used. If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> unable {{to answer the}} ten-count, it is {{declared}} a TKO and that fighter has lost the match. However, if <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> able to answer the ten-count, the fight resumes and one point is deducted.|$|R
30|$|The test {{requires}} <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> {{to reach}} forward beyond {{the length of}} his/her arm without loss of balance. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> on two legs, positioned shoulder width apart (or seated if <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> could not stand). <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> requested to lift one arm up to 90 °, forward flexion and extend fingers. Test-retest reliability and validity was established in a previous study (Duncan et al. 1990).|$|R
5|$|The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal and {{the debut}} of the X Division TerrorDome were {{promoted}} as featured matches for the Sacrifice undercard. The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal was announced by Cornette on the April24 episode of Impact!. The rules of the contest involved two stages: a standard battle royal in which competitors fought to eliminate wrestlers by throwing them over the top rope and a ladder match in which the final two wrestles fought to retrieve a contract that had been hung above the ring. An added stipulation to the bout was that the loser's head would be shaved and the winner would earn a TNA Women's Knockout Championship match. On the May8 episode of Impact!, Gail Kim won a Ten-Woman Clippers on a Pole match that granted her immunity from having her head shaven if she lost at the event. During the April24 episode of Impact!, TNA announced plans to introduce a new match type in the near future. The TerrorDome was announced on the May1 episode of Impact!, and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> announced on the May8 episode. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{vessels of}} the U.S. Navy's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron opposed by vessels of the Confederate Navy's Mosquito Fleet; {{the latter were}} {{supported}} by a shore-based battery of four guns at Cobb's Point (now called Cobb Point) near the southeastern border of the town. The battle {{was a part of}} the campaign in North Carolina that was led by Burnside and known as the Burnside Expedition. The result was a Union victory, with Elizabeth City and its nearby waters in their possession and the Confederate fleet captured, sunk, or dispersed.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles {{went on to}} Destination X {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in an Ultimate X Challenge match. An Ultimate X Challenge match has three stages. Stage one {{involves}} the four men being paired up into two tag teams and having a standard tag team match, with {{the person who is}} pinned being eliminated from the bout. Then it becomes a standard match involving three people, with the one being pinned in that phase being eliminated from the match. The final two then fight to climb the ropes and retrieve the championship that hangs in the middle. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> announced for the match on the March 11 episode of Impact!, with Elix Skipper and Ron Killings being added to face Styles. The final participant was determined in a match that pitted Christopher Daniels against Chris Sabin, which Daniels won. Styles would lose the championship to Daniels at the event.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>participant</b> should <b>be</b> {{a female}} {{over the age}} of 18  years without the history of mammary gland excision. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> shouldn’t <b>be</b> {{pregnant}} confirmed by negative urine pregnancy test. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> presents with suspicious breast clinical symptoms and/or previous breast findings classified BI-RADS ≥  3 on mammography and/or ultrasound. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> willing to have all imaging procedures completed (MRI, CESM) within a 3 -week interval.|$|R
50|$|The {{executor}} in a transitive sentence always {{precedes the}} experiencer. However, when an event is proceeded by a lone <b>participant,</b> <b>the</b> semantic {{content of the}} event determines whether <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> an executor or an experiencer. This can only be determined syntactically if <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> marked by <b>the</b> preposition ʔuł-, which marks the experience.|$|R

5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

5|$|C. Rajagopalachari, a close {{associate}} of Gandhi, led the march which had close to 150 volunteers, {{most of whom}} belonged to the Indian National Congress. It began at Trichinopoly (now Tiruchirappalli) on 13 April 1930 and proceeded for about 150 miles towards the east before culminating at Vedaranyam, a small coastal town in the then Tanjore District. By collecting salt directly from the sea the marchers broke the salt law. As {{a part of the}} march, Rajagopalachari created awareness among the people by highlighting the importance of khādī as well as social issues like caste discrimination. The campaign came to an end on 28 April 1930 when <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> arrested by the police. Its leader Rajagopalachari was imprisoned for six months. The march along with the ones at Dandi and Dharasana drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement.|$|E
5|$|For {{the main}} event, the CMLL ring crew quickly erected a 15-foot tall steel cage {{around the ring}} as <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> introduced. The match {{started out with a}} 10-minute period where no one would be allowed to leave the cage, forcing the two Infernales squads to fight each other. When the 10 minutes were up Tarzan Boy was quick to climb up the cage and over the top, {{escaping}} while everyone else was fighting. Moments later he was joined by teammate Rey Bucanero. Mephisto was the first to escape the cage for his team, leaving four men in the ring. Moments later both Último Guerrero and Averno climbed out of the cage. This left El Satánico to fight Máscara Mágica where the only way to win was to pin their opponent or force them to submit. In the end, the veteran Satánico forced his masked opponent to submit to win the match and the Los Infernales name. Afterwards Máscara Mágica removed his mask per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulations and revealed his birth name, Antonio Gómez Medina, formerly known as Talismán Jr.|$|E
5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for an entire year, most contestants had given up their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and told them about the hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of the con and how <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 that many of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, {{and he wanted to}} see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, CMLL left the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) but {{retained}} {{control of the}} NWA World Welterweight Championship as their main championship of the welterweight division. They also promoted the Mexican National Welterweight Championship as a secondary title for the Welterweight division. In 1991 they decided to create a series of CMLL-branded world championships, {{one of which was}} for the welterweight division. They held a four-man tournament on February 15, 1992, to crown the first welterweight champion. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> Fuerza Guerrera, El Felino, América and El Khalifa; in the finals, Fuerza Guerrera defeated El Khalifa to become the first champion. On July 16, 1992, the Mexican National Welterweight Champion defeated CMLL Welterweight Champion América, vacating the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. In 1993 control of the Mexican National Welterweight Championship was transferred from CMLL to rival promotion Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA).|$|E
5|$|MOHH {{may have}} been the first hip-hop dance {{convention}}, {{but it is not the}} only one that exists. Urban Dance Camp (UDC) is a six-week-long German-based dance convention held every year in Lörrach, a small town on the border of France and Switzerland. In a report on the event by a local paper, Bettina Kraft, the manager of UDC, estimated that 85% of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> from outside of Germany. In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase, a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers, dance crews, and UDC teachers. Dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, Les Twins, I.aM.mE, b-boy Lilou, and b-boy Hong 10 have performed at the showcase in the past.|$|E
30|$|In 64.0 % of {{the cases}} of CPD participation, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> male, and in 36.0 % of <b>the</b> cases, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> female.
