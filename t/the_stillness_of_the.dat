His most popular and requested work is his 1850 painting On the Wing, which portrays a sportsman with dead game at his feet, about to shoot down his next target. Ranney produced at least four different versions of this print, the most recognized of which was reserved for the Butler Institute of American Art. It was published in the gift book Ornaments of Memory in 1856 and 1857. This version is set in a more windblown environment, noted for the contrast generated with <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human figures within it.

2500|$|Kate (1844–1924) was {{the first}} of the Terry {{children}} to make the family name famous on the English stage, beginning her career as a small child. According to the academic Nina Auerbach, Kate may have been the most accomplished actor among her siblings, quickly gaining praise in the plays of Shakespeare, among others. Contemporary critics thought the same: The Manchester Guardian ended its report of her last performance before her retirement: [...] "In our unwilling acceptance of her farewell, we must now rest satisfied with the memory of the peerless beauty of her merry-hearted acting ... like the music of a bewitching melody piercing <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night, and ending just when the ear longed for the next note." [...] She gave up acting when she married the businessman Arthur James Lewis (1824–1901) in 1867 when she was 23. She made only two later stage appearances, the first in 1898, in a small role supporting her daughter Mabel in a new play in the West End; the second was in 1906 at her sister Ellen's jubilee celebrations at Drury Lane. Of her four children, all daughters, only the youngest, Mabel, followed her into the theatrical profession. The two middle daughters were Janet and Lucy. Kate's eldest daughter, also named Kate, married Frank Gielgud; their four children included Val and John Gielgud.|$|E

So, for instance, the bipolarism feeling/thinking is changed into the heartfelt reflection («riflessione sentita»), whose constituent are inseparabile; besides, the beginning contrast between author and reader becomes a dialectic relationship in which the reader (thanks to <b>the</b> dialectic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judgement and to the irony) is brought at <b>the</b> same level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author and becomes and sort of co-author. In this way, Manzoni’s thought and writing turn <b>the</b> typical <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anthitetic structures into <b>the</b> restlessness <b>of</b> a mobile system; this is true for the Promessi Sposi, whose artistic form consists in the relentless movement which transforms the several structural dualisms, present at different levels, into systems which create a continuos movement, the very same movement that, according to Manzoni, represents <b>the</b> restlessness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moral man...|$|R

40|$|The visual journal {{has been}} a {{constant}} companion to artists and designers. It fulfills <b>the</b> multiple functions <b>of</b> a scrapbook, a sketchpad, an observation notebook, a filing cabinet and an archive. Collecting ideas and artifacts using digital devices is an important process for artists and designers today. However, the accessibility provided by these tools also leads to problems in traditional visual journaling. The increasingly diverse formats (such as, audio, video, or digital codes) can pose difficulties when working in conjunction with tangible materials. The storage, access, and usage of materials also need to be reconsidered. The key question is not whether digital production tools or software systems can replace physical journals, but: how can digital artifacts be accessed fluidly along with other tangible materials?

40|$|Chan Ding {{training}} is beneficial {{to health and}} emotional wellbeing. More and more people have taken up this practice {{over the past few}} years. A major training method of Chan Ding is to focus on the ten Mailuns, i. e., energy points, and to maintain physical stillness. In this article, wireless wearable accelerometers were used to detect physical <b>stillness,</b> and <b>the</b> created physical <b>stillness</b> index (PSI) was also shown. Ninety college students participated in this study. Primarily, accelerometers used on the arms and chest were examined. The results showed that the PSI values on the arms were higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chest, when participants moved their bodies in three different ways, left-right, anterior-posterior, and hand, movements with natural breathing. Then, they were divided into three groups to practice Chan Ding for approximately thirty minutes. Participants without any Chan Ding experience were in Group I. Participants with one year of Chan Ding experience were in Group II, and participants with over three year of experience were in Group III. The Chinese Happiness Inventory (CHI) was also conducted. Results showed that <b>the</b> PSI <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three groups measured during 20 – 30 min were 0. 123 ± 0. 155, 0. 012 ± 0. 013, and 0. 001 ± 0. 0003, respectively (p < 0. 001 ***).

40|$|For decades Mihály Csíkszentmihályi’s {{concept of}} ‘flow’ has {{influenced}} the way creative action is theorized, particularly when those theories reference <b>the</b> creativity <b>of</b> artists. (Bourguignon & Dorsett, 2002) ‘Flow’ has it’s origins in Csíkszentmihályi’s admiration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist’s ability to optimize <b>the</b> routines <b>of</b> studio practice, to make routine intrinsically rewarding. (Csíkszentmihályi, 1988) In contrast, the collecting, archiving and display of material culture and art objects in museums is usually {{thought of as}} a cessation of flow (for example Dewey, 2009). Despite <b>the</b> busy routines <b>of</b> attentive conservators and curators, museum objects are severed from the sensory registers that shape our day-to-day embodied experiences <b>of</b> things. However, <b>the</b> unworldly <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> museum environment has itself become a creative proposition as, in the past twenty years, artists have sought to engage with the poetic and political dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> museal process. (Putnam, 2001) This paper interrogates Csíkszentmihályi’s view of creative action from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> two artists whose artworks respond to <b>the</b> everyday discontinuities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> museum. The authors draw {{on a wide range of}} theoretical approaches to ‘everyday’ practices including de Certeau and Lefebvre as well as key texts on <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> ma, a Japanese term for poignant intervals and meaningfully discontinuous experiences (for example Matsuoka, 2000). Recent works by the artists are used to illustrate <b>the</b> semiotics <b>of</b> creative action in which spatial and temporal disruption motivates <b>the</b> ‘flow’ <b>of</b> signification. Here Thomas Short’s (2004) account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘discovery’ <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indexical sign by C. S. Peirce and Rosalind Krauss’ ‘Notes on the Index’ are useful. The paper concludes with an evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> ‘semiotic uncertainty’ in generating artworks in response to two museum collections: the unplayable musical instruments at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the Parkes archive at the Centre for Economic Botany, Kew – <b>the</b> largest accumulation <b>of</b> unused Japanese paper in existence...|$|R

After dissecting around the hiatus esophagus, the abdominal esophagus was pulled up by using a vessel tape and as much dissection as possible was performed around the cranial esophagus. The dilated esophagus was then pulled caudally and straightened under observation by gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIS). The vagal nerves, including the hepatic branch, were preserved. Myotomy was performed for 6  cm on the esophageal side and 2  cm on the gastric side (Heller myotomy) and dilation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrow segment observed via GIS.
