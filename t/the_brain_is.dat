5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> {{protected}} by the skull, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier. However, <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> still susceptible to damage, disease, and infection. Damage {{can be caused by}} trauma, or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> susceptible to degenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dementias including Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and clinical depression, are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions. The brain can also be the site of tumours, both benign and malignant; these mostly originate from other sites in the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{study on}} how {{language}} is represented, processed, and acquired by <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> called neurolinguistics, {{which is a}} large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience, cognitive linguistics, and psycholinguistics.|$|E
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E

5|$|Lack of CSF {{pressure}} and volume can allow {{the brain to}} sag and descend through the foramen magnum (large opening) of the occipital bone, {{at the base of}} the skull. The lower portion of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms. Nerves that can be affected and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> the most sensitive. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to have children, and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E
5|$|Several {{complications}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E

30|$|<b>Brain</b> {{harvesting}} required <b>the</b> {{use of a}} round {{reciprocating saw}} to facilitate skull sections of approximately 5  cm. These sections were performed from the frontal region to the posterior fossa. These bone sections were removed whilst simultaneous dissection of the dura avoided parenchymal tearing. Once <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> fully exposed, <b>the</b> olfactory bulbs, optic chiasm, tentorium, and cranial nerves were progressively sectioned as <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> lifted from <b>the</b> base of the skull. This approach achieved a controlled dissection avoiding injury to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> tissue and ensuring a cautious brain removal as previously demonstrated [27]. <b>The</b> <b>brains</b> <b>were</b> weighed prior to insertion into a formalin bath for an immersion fixation during a minimum of 3  weeks.|$|R
5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury occurs when <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> a fast {{tissue and}} might be in {{supersaturated}} state in the early phase of decompression. It acts as a gas reservoir and feeds any local bubble which will grow. The bubble may just proceed through the capillaries to the venous side for another cycle, but may be trapped and will then grow in place, causing local restriction of the blood supply and finally ischemia. This may develop into central neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> {{not fully}} understood, and {{research}} is ongoing. Neuroscientists, along with researchers from allied disciplines, study how {{the human brain}} works. The boundaries between the specialties of neuroscience, neurology and other disciplines such as psychiatry have faded as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to Greenough's work, the {{prevalent}} belief {{was that the}} structure of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> determined very early in life and did not change substantially other than to degenerate {{as a result of}} damage due to injury, illness, or aging. It was believed that synapses were formed early in brain development, and that once the initial structure of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> formed, no further synapse formation occurred. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> believed to be an anatomically static structure and memories were believed to result from synaptic activity within a fixed nervous system. [...] According to this view, what you were born with determined your potential {{for the rest of your}} life.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> {{the largest}} known of any modern or extinct animal, {{weighing}} on average about , {{more than five}} times heavier than a human's, and has a volume of about 8,000cm3. Although larger brains generally correlate with higher intelligence, {{it is not the only}} factor. Elephants and dolphins also have larger brains than humans. The sperm whale has a lower encephalization quotient than many other whale and dolphin species, lower than that of non-human anthropoid apes, and much lower than humans'.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> effectively asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> to provide coherent {{control over the}} actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on {{one part of the}} body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other.|$|E

5|$|The hippocampus, {{strictly}} speaking, {{is found}} only in mammals. However, the area it derives from, the medial pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates.

5|$|The motor {{system of}} <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}} for the generation and control of movement. Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action of muscles. The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the torso and limbs. The cranial nerves carry movements related to the eyes, mouth and face.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the anatomy of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study the brain. Specimens from other animals, which may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information. Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are important in studying the brain. The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of {{each part of the}} brain.|$|E
50|$|Secondary tumors of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>are</b> metastatic {{and have}} invaded <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> from cancers {{originating}} in other organs. This {{means that a}} cancerous neoplasm has developed in another organ elsewhere {{in the body and}} that cancer cells have leaked from that primary tumor and then entered the lymphatic system and blood vessels. They then circulate through the bloodstream, and <b>are</b> deposited in <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> There, these cells continue growing and dividing, becoming another invasive neoplasm of the primary cancer's tissue. Secondary tumors of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>are</b> very common in the terminal phases of patients with an incurable metastasized cancer; the most common types of cancers that bring about secondary tumors of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>are</b> lung cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma, kidney cancer, and colon cancer (in decreasing order of frequency).|$|R
50|$|Here {{are seven}} common {{neurologic}} dysfunctions categorized {{into one of}} four domains that are motor, sensory, cognitive, and communicational dysfunctions. For each dysfunction, specific parts of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>are</b> impaired, and <b>the</b> corresponding locations of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>are</b> denoted with Brodmann area numbers. In neuroscience, a Brodmann area is a conventional way to express different regions of cerebral cortex based on diverse cortical functions.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie <b>the</b> <b>Brain</b> <b>is</b> a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts {{on the rest of}} the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E
