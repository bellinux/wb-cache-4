50|$|Originally, {{designs and}} motifs were not {{drawn on the}} cloth. The design was first {{outlined}} with needle and thread, followed by focal points, and then the filling motifs were done. In a kantha with a predominant central motif the centre was done first, followed by corner designs and the other details. In some types of kanthas (carpet, lik and sujni, etc.) wooden blocks were used to print the outline. The blocks are replaced today by patterns drawn in <b>tracing</b> <b>papers.</b>|$|E
40|$|Museums, libraries, and {{archives}} contain large {{collections of}} pigment-coated and <b>tracing</b> <b>papers.</b> These papers {{are produced by}} specially formulated compositions and manufacturing procedures that make them particularly vulnerable to damage as well as reactive to solvents used in conservation treatments. In order to evaluate the effects of solvents on such papers, several research projects were designed to consider the variables of paper composition, properties, and aging, as well as type of solvent and technique of solvent application. This paper summarizes findings for materials characterization, degradative effects of aging, and some effects of solvents used for stain reduction, and humidification and flattening, of pigment-coated and modern <b>tracing</b> <b>papers.</b> Pigment-coated papers have been used, virtually {{since the beginning of}} papermaking history, for their special properties of gloss and brightness. These properties, however, may render coated papers more susceptible to certain types of damage (surface marring, embedded grime, and stains) and more reactive to certai...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{carefully}} performed facial {{analysis can}} serve as a strong foundation for successful facial reconstructive and plastic surgeries, rhinoplasty or orthodontics. Aim: The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the facial features and qualities of the Igbo Nigerian adult male using photometry. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty subjects aged between 18 and 28 years were studied at the Anambra State University, Uli, Nigeria. The frontal and right lateral view photographs of their faces were taken and traced out on <b>tracing</b> <b>papers.</b> On these, two vertical distances, nasion to subnasal and subnasale to menton, and four angles, nasofrontal (NF), nasofacial, nasomental (NM) and mentocervical, were measured. Results: The result showed that the Igbo Nigerian adult male had a middle face that was shorter than the lower one (41. 76 % vs. 58. 24 %), a moderate glabella (NF= 133. 97 °), a projected nose (NM= 38. 68 °) and a less prominent chin (NM= 125. 87 °). Conclusion: This study is very important in medical practice as it can be used to compare the pre- and post-operative results of plastic surgery and other related surgeries of the face...|$|E

50|$|<b>Tracing</b> <b>paper</b> {{is named}} as such {{for its ability}} for an image to be traced onto it. When <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is placed onto a picture, the picture is easily {{viewable}} through the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Thus, it becomes easy to find edges in the picture and trace the image onto the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Pure cellulose fiber is translucent, {{and it is the}} air trapped between fibers, that makes paper opaque and looks white. If the fibers are refined and beaten until all the air is taken out, then the resulting sheet will be translucent. Translucent papers are dense and contain up to 10% moisture at 50% humidity. This type of paper is roughly 25% lighter than regular paper.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAccurate wound {{assessment}} {{is a critical}} task for patient care and health cost reduction at hospital but even still worse {{in the context of}} clinical studies in laboratory. This task, completely devoted to nurses, still relies on manual and tedious practices. Wound shape is measured with rules, <b>tracing</b> <b>papers</b> or rarely with alginate castings and serum injection. The wound tissues proportion is also estimated by a qualitative visual assessment based on the red-yellow-black code. Further to our preceding works on wound 3 D complete assessment using a simple freehanded digital camera, we explore here the adaptation of this tool to wounds artificially created for experimentation purposes. It results that tissue uniformity and flatness leads to a simplified approach but requires multispectral imaging for enhanced wound delineation. We demonstrate that, in this context, a simple active contour method can successfully replace more complex tools such as SVM supervised classification, as no training step is required and that one shot is enough to deal with perspective projection errors. Moreover, involving all the spectral response of the tissue and not only RGB components provides a higher discrimination for separating healed epithelial tissue from granulation tissue. This research work is part of a comparative preclinical study on healing wounds. It aims to compare the efficiency of specific medical honeys with classical pharmaceuticals for wound care. Results revealed that medical honey competes with more expensive pharmaceuticals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Herein, {{we report}} three {{different}} analytical applications of multi-layers of oxidised graphene nanoribbons (GNOs). In {{the first section}} of this paper, the most significant results concern the effect of GNOs on the proliferation of NIH 3 T 3 murine fibroblasts. Results show that GNOs represent the most biocompatible nanomaterials (compared with other ones, such as carbon black, single-wall carbon nanotubes pristine and treated carbon nanotubes) to use as nano-carrier in nanomedicine. In fact, GNO has been successfully used 'in vitro', for the transfection of the viral genome, particularly that relating to the hepatitis A virus (HAV - that normally is not able to replicate in some cell lines), in mammalian cells (BGM-Buffalo Green Monkey). The cell imaging is performed using the auto-fluorescence property of GNO (without additional steps of chemical conjugation with fluorescent probes), one of many extraordinary optical features exhibited by this new nanomaterial. In the second section, GNOs have been functionalised with ionic liquids (ILs) in order to obtain nanocomposite materials with enhanced physical-chemical properties. Latter are very useful for the restoration of modern <b>tracing</b> <b>papers,</b> obtained by refining forced (suffering from typical problems due to poor preservation of cultural heritage, such as gaps, tears and flaps). The results show that the tear is to be newly 'consolidated' and GO/ILs create bridges that make solidify the flaps. The optical microscope images show encouraging results because they do not appreciate significant variations in the optical properties of the substrate, after the treatment. In the third section, ionic liquids are used to disperse GNO to obtain stable and homogeneous nano-emulsions, to cast directly on the Screen-Printed Electrode (SPE) surfaces. New chemical sensors for the selective electrochemical detection of (a) neurotransmitters and (b) NADH (for the assembly of dehydrogenase biosensors) have also been assembled...|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of modern-day home sewing patterns contain multiple sizes in one pattern. Once a pattern {{is removed from}} a package, you can either cut the pattern based on the size you will be making or you can preserve the pattern by tracing it. The pattern is traced onto fabric using one of several methods. In one method, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> with transferable ink on one side is placed between the pattern and the fabric. A tracing wheel is moved over the pattern outlines, transferring the markings onto the fabric with ink that is removable by erasing or washing. In another method, <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is laid directly over a purchased pattern, and the pieces are traced. The pieces are cut, then the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is pinned and/or basted to the fabric. The fabric can then be cut to match the outlines on the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Vintage patterns may come with small holes pre-punched into the pattern paper. These are for creating tailor's tacks, a type of basting where thread is sewn into the fabric in short lengths {{to serve as a}} guideline for cutting and assembling fabric pieces.|$|R

50|$|For {{traditional}} media (such as paint), {{the division}} between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for computer-generated art.

In this case, a layout done on <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) {{to see how it}} would eventually appear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.|$|R
