25|$|A needs assessment, an {{analysis}} of corporate and individual goals, is often undertaken prior {{to the development of}} a training program. In addition, a careful needs analysis is required in order to develop a systematic understanding of where training is needed, what should be taught, and who will be trained. A training needs analysis typically involves a three-step process that includes organizational analysis, <b>task</b> <b>analysis</b> and person analysis.|$|E
25|$|Instructional design, the {{systematic}} design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a taxonomy of educational objectives created by Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched mastery learning, an instructional strategy in which learners only advance {{to a new}} learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered {{that a combination of}} mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. Gagné, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of <b>task</b> <b>analysis</b> in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives connected by prerequisite relationships.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Task</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{a process}} in which a task is {{analyzed}} into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: forward chaining, backward chaining and total task presentation. <b>Task</b> <b>analysis</b> has been used in organizational behavior management, a behavior analytic approach to changing the behaviors of members of an organization (e.g., factories, offices, or hospitals). Behavioral scripts often emerge from a <b>task</b> <b>analysis.</b> Bergan conducted a <b>task</b> <b>analysis</b> of the behavioral consultation relationship and Thomas Kratochwill developed a training program based on teaching Bergan's skills. A similar approach was used for the development of microskills training for counselors. Ivey would later call this [...] "behaviorist" [...] phase a very productive one and the skills-based approach came to dominate counselor training during 1970–90. <b>Task</b> <b>analysis</b> was also used in determining the skills needed to access a career. In education, Englemann (1968) used <b>task</b> <b>analysis</b> as part of the methods to design the Direct Instruction curriculum.|$|E
2500|$|An {{organizational}} {{analysis is}} {{an examination of}} organizational goals and resources {{as well as the}} organizational environment. The results of an organizational analysis help to determine where training should be directed. The analysis identifies the training needs of different departments or subunits. It systematically assesses manager, peer, and technological support for transfer of training. An organizational analysis also takes into account the climate of the organization and its subunits. For example, if a climate for safety is emphasized throughout the organization or in subunits of the organization (e.g., production), then training needs will likely reflect an emphasis on safety. A <b>task</b> <b>analysis</b> uses the results of a job analysis to determine what is needed for successful job performance, contributing to training content. With organizations increasingly trying to identify [...] "core competencies" [...] that are required for all jobs, <b>task</b> <b>analysis</b> can also include an assessment of competencies. A person analysis identifies which individuals within an organization should receive training and what kind of instruction they need. Employee needs can be assessed using a variety of methods that identify weaknesses that training can address.|$|E
2500|$|The Operator Function Model (OFM) is {{proposed}} {{as an alternative}} to traditional <b>task</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques used by human factors engineers. An operator function model attempts to represent in mathematical form how an operator might decompose a complex system into simpler parts and coordinate control actions and system configurations so that acceptable overall system performance is achieved. The model represents basic issues of knowledge representation, information flow, and decision making in complex systems. Miller (1985) suggests that the network structure {{can be thought of as}} a possible representation of an operator's internal model of the system plus a control structure which specifies how the model is used to solve the decision problems that comprise operator control functions.> ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Task</b> <b>analysis</b> means {{learning}} about users' goals and users' ways of working. <b>Task</b> <b>analysis</b> can also mean {{figuring out what}} more specific tasks users must do to meet those goals and what steps they must take to accomplish those tasks.
