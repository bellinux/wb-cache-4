5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that a patient is experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|When the {{announcer}} {{at the ball}} asks {{if there is a}} doctor in the house, Mac puts his hand up, to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. A unconscious patient lies on an operating table. Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under the blanket, and kisses her. Caroline alleges that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> stalking Mac, and repeating the assertion that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> transgender.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present our {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic experience with antiphospholipide syndrome (APS) and vascular thrombosis. Ninety-nine patients with positive antiphospholipide antibodies (aPL) and vascular thrombosis were included in <b>the</b> study: forty <b>patients,</b> according to clinical classification criteria, had primary antiphospholipide syndrome (PAPS), and fifty-nine patients had secondary antiphospholipide syndrome (SAPS). In PAPS group, 82. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> LA-positive, 37. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> IgG aCL-positive, 27. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> IgM aCL-positive, and 15 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> IgG antib 2 GPI-positive.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> {{observed}} as convalescent {{following the}} operation. No fever <b>was</b> observed. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> discharged after 14  days of intravenous antibiotic administration for MRSA that was detected in {{culture of the}} purulent material. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> dated up a control meeting for planning of infertility treatment.|$|R
5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} prednisolone and ciclosporin if <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, {{the side effects of}} these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction. This is usually deferred until 24–48hours after admission, when <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> stable and has shown some improvement with antibiotics, but may need to happen as an emergency in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment, or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (which happens in 15% of cases).|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the history and examination. To confirm the diagnosis, as well as excluding alternative causes, several investigations are required; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> more likely to have an alternative problem: children, men, the elderly, or women who are not overweight.|$|E

30|$|Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> {{shifted to}} general ward and was kept under observation. Within few days, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> {{discharged}} from <b>the</b> hospital with strict recommendations of continuous follow-up.|$|R
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> {{completely}} dependent upon caregivers. Language {{is reduced to}} simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately {{not be able to}} perform even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where they}} are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.|$|E
5|$|Generally, if <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> {{treated and}} survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> {{placed under}} NHF during 30  min {{in the same}} {{conditions}} as for NHF-nebulization with an empty nebulizer. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> kept blind between the NHF-nebulization and Control-NHF procedures.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>patient</b> {{underwent}} an explorative laparotomy. Upon {{confirmation of}} neither lymphovascular invasion nor solid organ metastases, {{we decided to}} proceed with Whipple’s procedure. The postoperative course of <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> uneventful. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> discharged, and adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{incidence}} of cerebral infarction increased with advancing age where 85.6 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> between 46 and 90  years and 14.4 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> ≤[*] 45  years.|$|R
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less than six months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, {{and as long as the}} hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{systematic}} {{collection of data}} based on observation of the patient's behavior while <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> in the clinician's view during the interview. The purpose is to obtain evidence of symptoms and signs of mental disorders, including danger to self and others, that are present {{at the time of}} the interview. Further, information on the patient's insight, judgment, and capacity for abstract reasoning is used to inform decisions about treatment strategy and the choice of an appropriate treatment setting.|$|E

30|$|On discharge, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> given <b>the</b> ward’s contact number, {{in case of}} problems, and {{analgesia}} in {{the form}} of diclofenac or co-dydramol. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> instructed to do a urine pregnancy test 2  weeks after the procedure. No follow-up <b>was</b> specifically arranged. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> instructed to get in contact if experiencing heavy bleeding, pyrexia, severe abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal discharge or had a positive pregnancy test.|$|R
30|$|In {{the morning}} of {{postoperative}} day (POD) 1, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> fully alert and responsive. Neither sensory nor motor neurological disturbance <b>was</b> observed. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> discharged on foot on POD 15 without further complications.|$|R
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
5|$|Sato and Reed {{return to}} Enterprise with the sad news that Archer {{did not make}} it off the weapon. Ferried on an Aquatic ship, Enterprise then returns to Earth, but they are unable to contact Starfleet. Surprised, T'Pol orders Tucker and Ensign Mayweather to fly a shuttlepod down to San Francisco, where they are {{suddenly}} attacked by what seem to be P-51s. The final scene switches to a World War II German field-hospital. A doctor summons some SS officers to examine the unfamiliar uniform of a burns patient who was recently brought in. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> revealed as Archer. One of the SS personnel steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to be a gray-skinned alien.|$|E
5|$|Tail lift or ramp – Ambulances can {{be fitted}} with a tail lift or ramp in order to {{facilitate}} loading a patient without having to undertake any lifting. This is especially important where <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> obese or specialty care transports that require large, bulky equipment such as a neonatal incubator or hospital beds. There may also be equipment linked to this such as winches which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E
30|$|During patient {{telephone}} interviews, PSQI {{questions were}} prioritized first, with BADL/IADL questions asked second if <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> willing to continue.

5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which developed {{from the work of}} the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers' perspective it was assumed {{that the only way to}} comprehend a patient's experience is through his or her own description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.|$|E
5|$|The {{images of}} the patient with the applicators in situ are {{imported}} into treatment planning software and <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> brought into a dedicated shielded room for treatment. The treatment planning software enables multiple 2D {{images of the}} treatment site to be translated into a 3D ‘virtual patient’, within which {{the position of the}} applicators can be defined. The spatial relationships between the applicators, the treatment site and the surrounding healthy tissues within this ‘virtual patient’ are a copy of the relationships in the actual patient.|$|E
5|$|The team {{employs the}} {{differential}} diagnosis method, listing possible etiologies on a whiteboard, then eliminating most of them, usually {{because one of the}} team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless; this usually causes further complications, but—as the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidence—eventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly. House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character. Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.|$|E
30|$|After <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> discharged, she {{was called}} back for weekly beta-hCG follow-ups.
