5|$|The player begins {{inside a}} space station called Starport {{orbiting}} the planet Arth. Here <b>they</b> <b>buy</b> and sell minerals, Endurium (fuel), and artifacts, recruit and train crew members, and upgrade parts of the ship. The player hires a crew from five species to man the ship's six posts: navigator, science officer, engineer, communications officer, doctor, and captain. A crewman's proficiency {{is determined by the}} relevant skill: a science officer with a high science skill can determine more of a planet's properties and detect aliens at a greater range, for example. Skills are increased through training, which must be purchased. One crewman can man multiple posts, but different species have different maximum skill levels. The ship is initially equipped only with engines and a limited supply of Endurium, a type of crystal used as fuel. The ship can be modified and upgraded through the purchase of weapons, armor, and shields.|$|E
50|$|The term Big Data {{describes}} the increasing volume and velocity of heterogeneous data {{that is coming}} into the enterprise.

25|$|On October 2, 2014, Groupon {{unveiled}} Snap, a new app {{specifically for}} giving customers cash back when <b>they</b> <b>buy</b> certain items {{at the grocery}} store.

25|$|Bonds are {{bought and}} traded mostly by {{institutions}} like central banks, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and banks.

Most individuals who want to own bonds do so through bond funds. Still, in the U.S., nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding are held directly by households.|$|E

25|$|A small {{investment}} fund can potentially yield a higher return {{because it can}} concentrate its investments in {{a small number of}} good opportunities without driving up the purchase price as <b>they</b> <b>buy</b> in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large {{investment fund}} must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole. As the size of the market controlled grows, the results will be closer to market average.|$|E
25|$|Investors may not {{be members}} of stock exchanges. Rather they must buy and sell {{securities}} through broker-dealers which are registered with the appropriate regulatory body for that purpose. In accepting investors as clients, broker-dealers take on the risks of their clients {{not being able to}} meet their financial obligations. Hence retail (individual) investors generally are required to keep their investment assets in custody with the broker-dealer through which <b>they</b> <b>buy</b> and sell securities. A broker-dealer would normally not accept an order to buy from a retail clients unless there is sufficient cash on deposit with the broker-dealer {{to cover the cost of}} the order, nor sell unless the client already has the security in the broker-dealer's custody.|$|E
25|$|Producers and producer-groups {{spend this}} social premium to support {{socioeconomic}} {{development in a}} variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. <b>They</b> <b>buy</b> capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.|$|E

25|$|Sternberg & Lubart’s Investment Theory. Using {{the metaphor}} of a stock market, they {{demonstrate}} that creative thinkers are like good investors – <b>they</b> <b>buy</b> low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence {{is just one of}} the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 2010s, Kreuzlingen's {{downtown}} began {{to experience a}} dearth of shoppers as many of them, including buses from elsewhere in Switzerland that pass through the city, started crossing the border to shop in Konstanz instead, due to lower prices for basic items in Germany, a favorable exchange rate between the euro and the franc and a German VAT refund that allows shoppers from non-European Union countries such as Switzerland to get back {{as much as a}} fifth of the price of the goods <b>they</b> <b>buy.</b> Elected officials from the city have asked the national government to negotiate a change in this policy with their German counterparts as they feel it is anti-competitive; at the same time some Konstanz residents, feeling displaced in their own hometown by the onslaught of Swiss on weekends, have opened businesses in Kreuzlingen that primarily cater to other Germans.|$|E
