This study aims to better understand how social face works across cultures, and to distinguish the line between benevolent and malicious deception. Data was collected from universities in both Japan and the United States, and analysed using a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) with cultural group as the independent variable, moral judgements of the scenarios as the dependent variable, and attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>face</b> as a covariate.

40|$|Trait {{anxiety is}} {{associated}} with deficits in attentional control, particularly {{in the ability to}} inhibit prepotent responses. Here, we investigated this effect while varying the level of cognitive load in a modified antisaccade task that employed emotional facial expressions (neutral, happy, and angry) as targets. Load was manipulated using a secondary auditory task requiring recognition of tones (low load), or recognition of specific tone pitch (high load). Results showed that load increased antisaccade latencies on trials where gaze <b>toward</b> <b>face</b> stimuli should be inhibited. This effect was exacerbated for high anxious individuals. Emotional expression also modulated task performance on antisaccade trials for both high and low anxious participants under low cognitive load, but did not influence performance under high load. Collectively, results (1) suggest that individuals reporting high levels of anxiety are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cognitive load on inhibition, and (2) support recent evidence that loading cognitive processes can reduce emotional influences on attention and cognition...|$|E

40|$|Background: Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) {{is associated}} with a mood-congruent processing bias in the amygdala <b>toward</b> <b>face</b> stimuli portraying sad expressions that is evident even when such stimuli are presented below the level of conscious awareness. The extended functional anatomical network that maintains this response bias has not been established, however. Aims: To identify neural network differences in the hemodynamic response to implicitly presented facial expressions between depressed and healthy control participants. Method: Unmedicated-depressed participants with MDD (n = 22) and healthy controls (HC; n = 25) underwent functional MRI as they viewed face stimuli showing sad, happy or neutral face expressions, presented using a backward masking design. The blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal was measured to identify regions where the hemodynamic response to the emotionally valenced stimuli differed between groups. Results: The MDD subjects showed greater BOLD responses than the controls to masked-sad versus masked-happy faces in the hippocampus, amygdala and anterior inferotemporal cortex. While viewing both masked-sad and masked-happy faces relative to masked-neutral faces, the depressed subjects showed greater hemodynamic responses than the controls in a network that included the medial and orbital prefrontal cortices and anterior temporal cortex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Face washing is {{important}} to interrupt the transmission of trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. We aimed to assess the household and personal factors that affected water use and face washing practices in Kongwa, Tanzania. Methods We conducted a household water use survey in 173 households (329 children) in January, 2010. Self reported data on water use practices, observed water in the household, and observed clean faces in children were collected. Contingency table analyses and logistic regression analyses were used to measure associations between unclean faces and risk factors. Results We found that women are recognized as primary decision makers on water use in a household, and respondents who reported laziness as a reason that others do not wash children's faces {{were significantly more likely}} to have children with clean faces. Washing was reported as a priority for water use in most households. Sixty four percent (95 % Confidence Interval = 59 %- 70 %) of children had clean faces. Conclusions Attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>face</b> washing and household water use appear to have changed dramatically from 20 years ago when clean faces were rare and men made decisions on water use in households. The sources of these attitudinal changes are not clear, but are positive changes that will assist the trachoma control program in strengthening its hygiene efforts. </p...|$|E

Depressed and healthy participants showed distinct hemodynamic responses to masked-sad and masked-happy faces in neural circuits known to support the processing of emotionally valenced stimuli and to integrate the sensory and visceromotor aspects of emotional behavior. Altered function within these networks in MDD may establish and maintain illness-associated differences in the salience of sensory/social stimuli, such that attention is biased toward negative and away from positive stimuli...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent {{results show}} that humans can respond with a saccadic eye {{movement}} <b>toward</b> <b>faces</b> much faster and with less error than toward other objects. What feature information does your visual cortex need to distinguish between different objects so rapidly? In a first step, we replicated the "fast saccadic bias" <b>toward</b> <b>faces.</b> We simultaneously presented one vehicle and one face image with different contrasts and asked our subjects to saccade {{as fast as possible}} to the image with higher contrast. This was considerably easier when the target was the face. In a second step, we scrambled both images to the same extent. For one subject group, we scrambled the orientations of wavelet components (local orientations) while preserving their location. This manipulation completely abolished the face bias for the fastest saccades. For a second group, we scrambled the phases (i. e., the location) of Fourier components while preserving their orientation (i. e., the 2 -D amplitude spectrum). Even when no face was visible (100 % scrambling), the fastest saccades were still strongly biased <b>toward</b> the scrambled <b>face</b> image! These results suggest that the ability to rapidly saccade to faces in natural scenes depends, at least in part, on low-level information contained in the Fourier 2 -D amplitude spectrum...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that face processing in the primate brain occurs in a network of category-selective cortical regions. Combined functional MRI (fMRI) -single-cell recording studies in macaques have identified high concentrations of neurons that respond more to faces than objects within face-selective patches. However, cells with a preference for faces over objects are also found scattered throughout inferior temporal (IT) cortex, raising the question whether face-selective cells {{inside and outside of}} the face patches differ functionally. Here, we compare the properties of face-selective cells inside and outside of face-selective patches in the IT cortex by means of an image manipulation that reliably disrupts behavior <b>toward</b> <b>face</b> processing: inversion. We recorded IT neurons from two fMRI-defined face-patches (ML and AL) and a region outside of the face patches (herein labeled OUT) during upright and inverted face stimulation. Overall, turning faces upside down reduced the firing rate of face-selective cells. However, there were differences among the recording regions. First, the reduced neuronal response for inverted faces was independent of stimulus position, relative to fixation, in the face-selective patches (ML and AL) only. Additionally, the effect of inversion for face-selective cells in ML, but not those in AL or OUT, was impervious to whether the neurons were initially searched for using upright or inverted stimuli. Collectively, these results show that face-selective cells differ in their functional characteristics depending on their anatomicofunctional location, suggesting that upright faces are preferably coded by face-selective cells inside but not outside of the fMRI-defined face-selective regions of the posterior IT corte...|$|E

40|$|Faces are salient social stimuli whose {{features}} {{attract a}} stereotypical pattern of fixations. The {{implications of this}} gaze behavior for perception and brain activity are largely unknown. Here, we characterize and quantify a retinotopic bias implied by typical gaze behavior <b>toward</b> <b>faces,</b> which leads to eyes and mouth appearing most often in {{the upper and lower}} visual field, respectively. We found that the adult human visual system is tuned to these contingencies. In two recognition experiments, recognition performance for isolated face parts was better when they were presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field locations. The recognition cost of reversed locations was equal to_ 60 % of that for whole face inversion in the same sample. Similarly, an fMRI experiment showed that patterns of activity evoked by eye and mouth stimuli in the right inferior occipital gyrus could be separated with significantly higher accuracy when these features were presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field locations. Our findings demonstrate thathumanface perception is determined not only by the local position of features within a face context, but by whether features appear at the typical retinotopic location given normal gaze behavior. Such location sensitivity may reflect fine-tuning of category-specific visual processing to retinal input statistics. Our findings further suggest that retinotopic heterogeneity might play a role for face inversion effects and for the understanding of conditions affecting gaze behavior <b>toward</b> <b>faces,</b> such as autism spectrum disorders and congenital prosopagnosia.

The latter test was included because prior research suggested a high effect size. Our data supported hypotheses (a) and (b) but not (c).
