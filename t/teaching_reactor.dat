50|$|There are two nuclear {{research}} reactors that serve the Texas A&M University Nuclear Science Center. The older {{of the two}} is the AGN-201M model, a low-power <b>teaching</b> <b>reactor.</b> The newer reactor, the TRIGA Mark I, is focused strongly towards research.|$|E
40|$|The UTR- 10 {{research}} and <b>teaching</b> <b>reactor</b> at Iowa State University (ISU) {{has been converted}} from high-enriched fuel (HEU) to low- enriched fuel (LEU) under Grant No. DE-FG 702 - 87 ER 75360 from the Department of Energy (DOE). The original contract period was August 1, 1987 to July 31, 1989. The contract was extended to February 28, 1991 without additional funding. Because of delays in receiving the LEU fuel and the requirement for disassembly of the HEU assemblies, the contract was renewed first through May 31, 1992, then through May 31, 1993 with additional funding, and then again through July 31, 1994 with no additional funding. In mid-August the BMI cask was delivered to Iowa State. Preparations are underway to ship the HEU fuel when NRC license amendments for the cask are approved...|$|E
50|$|The Argonaut class reactor is {{a design}} of small nuclear {{research}} reactor. Many {{have been built}} throughout the world, {{over a wide range}} of power levels. Its functions are to <b>teach</b> nuclear <b>reactor</b> theory, nuclear physics and for use in engineering laboratory experiments.|$|R

40|$|Each of the Active Learning {{strategies}} {{employed to}} <b>teach</b> <b>Reactor</b> Physics material has been or {{promises to be}} instructionally successful. The Cooperative Group strategy has demonstrated a statistically significant increase in student performance on the unit exam in teaching conceptually difficult, transport and diffusion theory material. However, this result was achieved {{at the expense of}} a modest increase in class time. The Tutorial CBI programs have enabled learning equally as well as classroom lectures without the direct intervention of an instructor. Thus, the Tutorials have been successful as homework assignments, releasing classroom time for other instruction. However, the time required for development of these tools was large, on the order of two hundred hours per hour of instruction. The initial introduction of the Case-Based strategy was roughly as effective as the traditional classroom instruction. Case-Based learning could well, after important modifications, perform better than traditional instruction. A larger percentage of the students prefer active learning strategies than prefer traditional lecture presentations. Student preferences for the active strategies were particularly strong when they believed that the strategies helped them learn the material better than they would have by using a lecture format. In some cases, students also preferred the active strategies because they were different from traditional instruction, a change of pace. Some students preferred lectures to CBI instruction, primarily because the CBI did not afford them the opportunity to question the instructor during the presentation...|$|R
50|$|As of 2006, the {{university}} was holding discussions with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about {{construction of a new}} High-Temperature <b>Teaching</b> and Test <b>Reactor</b> which, if successful, would finish licensing and construction around 2012. It would also be the first university based research reactor to be built in the US in roughly a decade, {{and one of the few}} HTGR type reactors in the world.|$|R
50|$|The University of Texas of the Permian Basin (UTPB) and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), {{are proposing}} a {{multifaceted}} energy research facility called the High-Temperature <b>Teaching</b> & Test <b>Reactor</b> (HT3R or HT3R) {{to be located}} in Andrews County, Texas. The proposal envisions a 25MWt (Megawatt thermal) reactor operated by a merchant nuclear power operating company with the education and science at the facility managed through an arrangement between LANL and UTPB/UTS (University of Texas System).|$|R
5000|$|Odessa {{has also}} {{taken steps to}} diversify the energy it produces. A new wind farm has been {{constructed}} in northern Ector County. A new coal pollution mitigation plant has been announced for a site previously entered in the Futuregen bidding. The new plant will be run by Summit Power and will be located near Penwell. This new plant {{could lead to the}} creation of 8,000 jobs in the area. Plans are in place for a nuclear power plant to be run in conjunction with the nuclear engineering department at University of Texas of the Permian Basin, called High-Temperature <b>Teaching</b> and Test <b>Reactor.</b> This reactor is planned to be near Andrews.|$|R
50|$|The HT3R {{will be the}} {{experimental}} cornerstone of a new energy research center at the UTPB. Since the early 1990s no new university <b>teaching</b> and training <b>reactors</b> have been constructed and in fact many across the United States have been shut down. Further, only two other aging water-cooled research reactors, one at the University of Missouri (1966) and one at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (1967), are capable of operating at power levels greater than 10 MWt that can provide useful facilities for fuel qualification, training, and basic advanced research. Neither of these reactors can provide the enhanced capabilities necessary for education, research and pilot-scale testing for Gen-IV reactor systems.|$|R
50|$|The University of Texas of the Permian Basin (UTPB) {{began in}} 1973. UTPB was an upper level and {{graduate}} university until the Texas Legislature {{passed a bill}} in spring 1991 to allow the university to accept freshmen and sophomores. As of 2006, the university was holding discussions with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about {{construction of a new}} High-Temperature <b>Teaching</b> and Test <b>Reactor</b> which, if successful, would finish licensing and construction around 2012. It would be the first university-based research reactor to be built in the US in roughly a decade, and {{be one of the few}} HTGR-type reactors in the world. In January 2006, UTPB's School of Business was awarded accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB). AACSB is generally regarded as the premier accreditation agency for the world's business schools. According to the university, only 30% of business schools in the United States, and 15% of world business schools, have received AACSB accreditation.|$|R
