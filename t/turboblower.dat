40|$|As for the <b>turboblower,</b> {{there are}} various studies {{of the types of}} vanes or of the {{impeller}} considering the effects of the inlet and exit angles of vanes. In these experiments, we did the performance tests with each impeller and compared the results with one another, holding the inlet angle constant and changing the exit angles, e. q. of the backward curved, forward curved and radial vanes, and again holding the intermediate vane in the center on the pressure side and the negative pressure side, of the vane...|$|E

40|$|Abstract　Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} {{for the effects of}} an impeller blade number on the performance and the noise characteristics of a centrifugal <b>turboblower.</b> The impeller changes its blade number as 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24. In general, it becomes high for the efficiency of the blower together with its total pressure as the impeller has more blades. Noticeably, the efficiency tends to nearly constant when the impeller has more than 8 blades, while the total pressure shows a constant tendency as the impeller has more than 12 blades. Specific sound pressure level becomes nearly constant for the case of the impeller having 8 - 12 blades. In conclusion, the optimal blade number of the test impeller results 12...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{a control}} {{system for the}} {{aeration}} of a bioreactor is developed using fuzzy logic algorithms. The main variable to be controlled is the ammonium concentration at the reactor output, which is measured {{by means of an}} ammonium-nitrate ion selective probe. The resultant start and stop cycles are the result of a hysteresis comparator strategy in which the commutation thresholds depend on the current energy period. A system based on fuzzy logic updates the algorithm parameters on-line in arder to get the optimal performance of the process as the operating conditions and influent load changes. The objective of this fuzzy algorithm, named as LOB 02 is to comply at all times with the effluent ammonium limits, while optimizing the number of commutations of the <b>turboblower</b> and minimizing the energy consumption in the most expensive rate periods. During the aeration cycles, the algorithm adjusts the air flow blown to the bioreactor to get the optimum ammonium oxidation rate, providing just the amount of oxygen the microorganisms can consume...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{presentation}} of the results that concerned the influence of morphology of eutectic silicon crystals on mechanical properties, especially on the cleavage fracture toughness of AlSi 5 Cu 1 alloy. Design/methodology/approach: Microscopic studies – optical microscope NIKON 300 and quantitative analysis of geometrical parameters of microstructure – image analysis program APHELION, tensile and fracture toughness tests – testing machine INSTRON 8810. Findings: The sizes of silicon crystals and values of yield strength, tensile strength and plane strain fracture toughness have been determined. Relationships between mechanical properties and silicon crystals size were described using Hall-Petch equation. It was found that a decrease in silicon crystals causes an increasing in strength and in fracture toughness. Practical implications: This paper is part of the previous author’s investigations which results in modification of the casting technology of <b>turboblower</b> compressor impellers. Originality/value: The microscopic observations indicated that alloy cracking begins with nucleation and growth of micro-cracks in the silicon crystals of large size, in orthogonal plane to tension direction. The hard and brittle silicon crystals are very strong barriers for slip in the stressed alloy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper an {{investigation}} is made of two stages of a multistage <b>turboblower</b> having a vaneless diffuser behind the impeller and guide vanes at the inlet to the nest stage. The method employed was that of investigating {{the performance of the}} successive elements of the blower (the impeller, vaneless diffuser, ets.) whereby the kinematics of the flow through the blower could be followed and the pressure at the different points computed. The character of the flow and the physical significance of the loss coefficients could thereby be determined so as to secure the best agreement of the computed with the actual performance of the blower. Since the tests were carried out for various delivery volumes, the dependence of the coefficients on a number of factors (angle of attack, velocities, etc.) could be obtained. The distribution of the losses that occur during the transformation of dynamic pressure at the impeller exit into static pressure could be found and likewise the range within which the friction coefficient varies in the vaneless diffuser. With the aid of factors having a certain physical significance, the centrifugal blower could be computed {{on the basis of a}} more or less schematical consideration of the phenomena occuring during the air flow through it, and the use of arbitrary factors and recourse to the geometrical similtude law thus avoided. The present investigation largely summarizes all the previous work af the CHI Blower Section on the different elements of a centrifugal blower. Some considerations on the analysis of model test data for application to full-scale are presented in the appendix...|$|E
