500|$|Several of Rivera's colleagues credit {{him with}} popularizing the cutter among major league pitchers. Fellow closer Jason Isringhausen, who adopted the pitch {{later in his}} career, said, [...] "I think he's been an {{influence}} on everybody that throws it. Everybody saw what [...] could do, basically with one pitch. Nobody could throw it like he did, but now, {{you talk about the}} evolution of the cutter—just ask hitters about it and <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> everybody's throwing one. And they hate it." [...] Al Leiter, whose signature pitch was a cutter, echoed Isringhausen's sentiments: [...] "Now, everybody throws it and Mo has had a huge influence on that. Pitchers watched him and marveled at what he did with one pitch." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "There {{are a lot}} {{of great}} {{technicians}} in advertising. And unfortunately they talk the best game. They know all the rules. <b>They</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that people in an ad will get you greater readership. <b>They</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that a sentence should be this short or that long. <b>They</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that body copy should be broken up for easier reading. They can give you fact after fact after fact. They are the scientists of advertising. But there's one little rub. Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science, but an art." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Honesty" [...] is a piano ballad with {{synthesizer}} embellishments. It {{opens with}} [...] "sad and tender" [...] piano chords. According to Ken Bielen {{in his book}} The Words and Music of Billy Joel, Liberty DeVitto's drums and cymbal crashes, remind listeners that [...] "the track is a predecessor of the power ballads of the 1980s and 1990s". It talks about the inherent lack of honesty even in the closest of relationships. In the song Joel sings the lines [...] "Honesty is such a lonely word". Joel further sings about wearing his heart on his sleeve in [...] "Honesty". According to Chuck Klosterman of The New York Times, [...] " [...] implies {{that the only way}} you can tell that someone really cares about you is if <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> you're bad." [...] "Leningrad" [...] (1989), a song from Joel's eleventh studio album Storm Front, has been compared to [...] "Honesty". According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, [...] "Honesty" [...] is a pop rock and classical rock song written in the key of B♭ major. The song is set in common time and performed in a slow tempo of 80 beats per minute. Joel vocals range from the note of Bb2 to Bb4.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{highlight}} in {{the debate}} happened when candidates were asked by Chris Matthews {{if they need to}} go to Congress to get authorization to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, if they were president of the United States. While Hunter, Huckabee, McCain, Thompson and Giuliani replied they would not obtain Congressional authorization if there was an imminent threat from Iran. Romney replied, [...] "You sit down with your attorneys and (<b>they)</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what you have to do..." [...] Paul advocated obtaining Congressional authorization, which he claimed is mandated by the US Constitution.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, Weber {{complained of}} both the control exerted by {{consolidated}} studios, {{as well as the}} ever more strenuous censorship of the Hays Code: [...] "I have received many offers, but in each case I'm hampered with too many conditions. ... The producers select the stories, select the cast, tell you how much you can pay for a picture and how long you can have to make it in. All this could be borne. But when <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that they also will cut your picture, that is too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor often loses out to Brooke, as Thorne (Ridge's brother) loses out to Ridge. When {{asked in}} 2011 {{where she would}} like her storyline to go, Tylo said: [...] "I think we should see Thorne and Taylor get strong and stand up to these people who mowed them down." [...] In March 2012, Tylo said that Taylor is finally {{learning}} to pursue what she wants instead of always putting others first. She said, [...] "In psychology, <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{to be true to}} yourself. Maybe she is finally doing that, even though in her moral compass she knows that it is better to put other people first. She has been going after what she wants instead. It is a very good growing place for Taylor to go back to reality and realize that she is not perfect and that she needs to try not looking so perfect so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film's fiery final {{sequence}} {{was shot}} without a stunt performer {{filling in for}} Leigh McCloskey. After the production's principal photography had been completed, the film's producer, Claudio Argento, asked if McCloskey {{would be willing to}} perform the stuntwork himself, as the stuntman hired for the job had broken his leg. The producer assured the actor: [...] "It'll be absolutely safe". The actor agreed, and when he walked onto the set the following day he observed [...] "three rows of flexiglass in front of everything and everyone is wearing hard hats. I'm the only guy standing {{on the other side of}} this! ...Needless to say, I did it all on instinct... I still feel that blast of the door blowing by me. When <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> in words, its one thing, but when you feel that glass go flying past you with a sound like a Harrier jet, you never forget it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 26, 2014, Smith stated on the Hollywood Babble-On No. 183 episode, why he’s {{glad that}} he made Tusk, Smith added, [...] "Everything in my life would suck right now if I hadn't made that movie. I'm back in movies now. I've got three lined up, {{and this is the}} fucking grand news. Tusk was the {{absolute}} bridge to Clerks III. Because of Tusk, I got my financing for Clerks III." [...] Smith continued, [...] "A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately get Clerks III made for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it was Tusk, it was people going 'Holy fuck! What else do you have?'
