Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a {{conflict}} where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its reproductive fitness. Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.|$|E

Makkhi's father resolves the situation by accepting an apology from Chulbul. Chulbul meets Dayal Babu (Anupam Kher), a local political leader, who also dislikes Chedi. With his help, Chulbul adulterates the breweries of Chedi, and wrongly frames him for it.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{was formed}} as Newton Heath L F.C. in 1878 by <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> the Carriage and Wagon Works of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Newton Heath depot. In 1901, {{the club was}} in over £2,500 of debt and facing a {{winding-up}} order; however, they were saved by local brewer John Henry Davies, who changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After Davies' death in 1927, the club fell into financial difficulties once again, but James W. Gibson stepped in as a new financial benefactor in 1931. Gibson himself died in 1951, but while ownership of the club passed to his widow, Violet, control of the club passed to director and former player Harold Hardman.|$|E

5|$|As the Industrial Revolution {{began in}} the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, the Welsh metal mines {{declined}} and mining in Cornwall and Devon became viable once more. Women and girls were recruited in large numbers for work in ore processing. Women and children accounted for up to half <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> the area's copper mines. Although machinery was capable of performing much of the work done by bal maidens, the industry grew so quickly that the number of women and girls working grew steadily even though their numbers fell as a proportion of the workforce to 15–20% by 1850. At the peak of the Cornish mining boom, in around 1860, at least 6000 bal maidens were working at the region's mines; the actual number is likely to have been much higher. While it was not unusual for girls to become bal maidens at the age of six and to work into old age, they generally began at around age 10 or 11 and left work once they married.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the {{university}} {{responded to a}} series of New York Times interviews that showed a pattern of labor abuses in its fledgling Abu Dhabi location, creating a statement of labor values for Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers had to sleep under beds. According to the article, workers who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly arrested. Reports also claimed that those arrested by police were later abused at the police station. Many workers who were not local were then deported to their home countries. The university quickly responded to the reports with an apology to <b>the</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>In</b> 2015, NYU compensated thousands of migrant workers on its Abu Dhabi complex.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews {{to leave the}} city within the next two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic, co-op, kitchen, and dining room for <b>the</b> <b>workers,</b> <b>in</b> addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.|$|E

5|$|Qiao Weiyue {{also built}} five double slipways (lit. dams) between Anbei and Huaishi (or, the quays on the Huai waterfront). Each of these had ten lanes for the barges {{to go up}} and down. Their cargoes of {{imperial}} tax-grain were heavy, and as they were passing over they often came to grief and were damaged or wrecked, with loss of the grain and peculation by a cabal of <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> league with local bandits hidden nearby. Qiao Weiyue therefore first ordered the construction of two gates at the third dam along the West River (near Huaiyin). The distance between the two gates was rather more than 50 paces (250ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great roof like a shed. The gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out. He also built a horizontal bridge to protect their foundations. After this was done (to all the double slipways) the previous corruption was completely eliminated, and the passage of the boats went on without the slightest impediment.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} is often asked why Marxism is so credible still {{for people of}} the Third World. The author maintains that this is often so because Marx's description {{of the position of}} <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> a capitalist society has consistently appealed to <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> developed industrial countries, and has helped them to define their position within society for themselves. He goes to explain how Marx's definition of <b>the</b> <b>worker's</b> position <b>in</b> nineteenth century England can be made applicable to the position of <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> most Third World countries - and in particular also to the position of <b>the</b> Non-White <b>worker</b> <b>in</b> South Africa. He points out a few of the most striking similarities, and comes to the conclusion that {{there is no doubt that}} most Non-Whites in South Africa find a socialist/communist dispensation more appealing than a capitalist one. The only way that he can see to change the definition that the Non-White has of changing his definition of his sociopolitical situation is to change South African society. He then outlines certain changes which should enjoy a very high priority in South Africa...|$|R
