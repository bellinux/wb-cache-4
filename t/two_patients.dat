5|$|In {{two small}} studies of <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> and another with one patient {{suffering}} from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume {{necessary for a}} patient to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{overexposure}} is {{most frequently}} associated with manganism, a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons {{employed in the}} production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations. The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> who were manganese grinders.|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{patients}} with a right-hemisphere CVA and 8 {{patients with}} a left-hemisphere CVA were examined for selective attention deficits using {{a variant of the}} Stroop color-word task: the picture-word interference task. Experiments 1 and 2 first compared the performance of the <b>two</b> <b>patient</b> groups and a control group in three tasks of increasing difficulty: picture-word detection, word reading, and picture naming. The results showed that (a) the <b>two</b> <b>patient</b> groups were significantly slower than the control group, but did not differ from each other, and (b) the difference in mean RT between the <b>two</b> <b>patient</b> groups and the control group did not increase with task difficulty. In Experiment 3, the subjects were required to name pictures while ignoring accompanying distractors: nonletter symbols, unrelated words or semantically related words. In this task, the right hemisphere patients showed a much larger semantic interference effect than both the left hemisphere patients and the control group. It is argued that this finding most probably reflects problems in visual selective attention with the right hemisphere patients...|$|R
30|$|Data were {{analyzed}} using SPSS 20.0 or two-tailed independent Student’s t-test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. The <b>two</b> <b>patient</b> cohorts were compared by a Kaplan-Meier survival plot, and the log rank P values are calculated.|$|R

5|$|The polyptych was {{commissioned}} to provide both comfort and {{warning to the}} dying. It was intended to remind them of their faith, and direct their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning in the chapel, within view of the patients' beds. Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed {{within sight of the}} altarpiece for those too ill to walk, where it was visible to them through a pierced screen. There were usually only <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> per bed, luxurious at a time when six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was as important as the treatment of physical ailments.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Dr. V. S. Ramachandran and his lab {{proposed}} that caloric stimulation might {{be effective in}} treating Dejerine–Roussy syndrome.

25|$|A {{study from}} Sweden in 2002 {{attempted}} {{to follow up}} 18 patients for approximately 2 years after having been previously diagnosed with awareness under anesthesia. Four of the nine interviewed patients were still severely disabled due to psychiatric/psychological after-effects.

Another three patients had less severe, transient mental symptoms, although they could cope with these in daily life. <b>Two</b> <b>patients</b> denied any lasting effects from their awareness episode.|$|E
25|$|<b>Two</b> <b>patients</b> {{initially}} {{diagnosed with}} fibromyalgia were subsequently {{shown to have}} myotonia congenita.

Genetic analysis of the skeletal muscle chloride channel which is the underlying cause of myotonia congenita revealed that both patients had mutations in this gene. Over 130 mutations in this gene have been described and the phenotype is very variable which may account for the difficulty in the initial diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|The altarpiece was {{probably}} commissioned in the mid-1470s {{for the new}} apse, and almost certainly completed in 1479. The central frame is inscribed in Latin and reads; OPUS. IOHANNES MEMLING. ANNO. M. CCCC. LXXIX, The date gives clues to the donors on the exterior panels; and because one died in 1475, scholars are confident in a start date before that year. Memling probably began work on the piece as early as 1473, when plans were made to extend the already large 240-bed infirmary, which, with <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> per bed, served about 500 people.
