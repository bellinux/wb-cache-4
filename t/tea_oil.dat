5|$|Rural {{families}} that sold a large agricultural surplus {{to the market}} not only could afford to buy more charcoal, <b>tea,</b> <b>oil,</b> and wine, but they could also amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming families could often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk wares, while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for public works projects and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that could lift water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{advanced}} greatly {{under the}} Song. The Song government started {{a series of}} irrigation projects that increased cultivatable land, and encouraged peasants to cultivate more land. The total area of cultivated land was greatly increased to 720 million mou, a figure unsurpassed by later dynasties. A variety of crops were cultivated, unlike the monocultures of previous dynasties. Specialised crops like oranges and sugar cane were regularly planted alongside rice. Unlike the earlier self-sufficient peasantry of the Han and Tang eras, rural families produced a surplus which could be sold. The income allowed families to afford not only food, but charcoal, <b>tea,</b> <b>oil,</b> and wine. Many Song peasants supplemented their incomes with handicraft work.|$|E
25|$|Chief Commissioner's Province (1874–1905): In 1874, the Assam {{region was}} {{separated}} from the Bengal Presidency, Sylhet was added to it and its status was upgraded to a Chief Commissioner's Province. The capital was at Shillong. The people of Sylhet protested the inclusion in Assam. Assamese, which was replaced by Bengali as the official language in 1837, was reinstated alongside Bengali. In 1889, oil was discovered at Digboi giving rise to an oil industry. In this period Nagaon witnessed starvation deaths, {{and there was a}} decrease in the indigenous population, which was more than adequately compensated by the immigrant labor.

40|$|<b>Tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> {{is used as}} {{a natural}} remedy, but is also a popular {{ingredient}} in household and cosmetic products. Oxidation of <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> may result in degradation products, such as ascaridole, which may cause allergic contact dermatitis. We investigated the prevalence of sensitization to ascaridole, the optimal patch test concentration and we studied co-sensitization of ascaridole and oxidized <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil.</b> A total of 290 patiënts with eczema were patch tested with ascaridole 1 %, 2 % and 5 % in petrolatum. Ascaridole 2 % seems to be the most favorable patch test concentration based on the ratio of positive (5. 5 %), irritant (1. 7 %) and doubtful (4. 1 %) reactions. Six patients showed a positive reaction to oxidized <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil.</b> All patients with a positive reaction to <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> showed a positive reaction to ascaridole. This finding suggests that ascaridole is contact allergen in <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil.</b> A total of 24 patients showed a positive reaction to ascaridole without a positive reaction to <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil.</b> Six out of these 24 patients were exposed to <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> en developed eczema after using products containing <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil.</b> Patch testing with ascaridole elicits clinically relevant positive reactions, which are missed by patch testing with <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> alone...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{essential}} oil of Melaleuca alternifolia (<b>tea</b> tree <b>oil)</b> and its components have antimicrobial activity against {{a wide range}} of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and viruses. The mechanism(s) by which Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 10662 maintains a decreased susceptibility to <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> and components was investigated. Results: Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid enhanced the antimicrobial activity of <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> and terpinen- 4 -ol against stationary phase P. aeruginosa while polymyxin B nonapeptide enhanced the activity of <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> and γ-terpinene. Pre-treatment with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone increased the susceptibility of exponential phase cells to sub-inhibitory concentrations of <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil,</b> terpinen- 4 -ol and γ-terpinene, indicating that intrinsic tolerance to <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> and components is substantially energy dependent. Conclusions: Increased tolerance to <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> in P. aeruginosa {{is directly related to the}} barrier and energy functions of the outer membrane, and may involve efflux systems...|$|R

To these clumps or plantations we shall return later on when I come to describe the home life {{of some of our}} nearest neighbours; here the houses only, with or without trees growing about them, need be mentioned as parts of the landscape. The houses were always low and scarcely visible at a distance of a mile and a half: one always had to stoop on entering a door. They were built of burnt or unburnt brick, more often clay and brushwood, and thatched with sedges or bulrushes. At some of the better houses there would be a small garden, a few yards of soil protected in some way from the poultry and animals, in which a few flowers and herbs were grown, especially parsley, rue, sage, tansy, and horehound. But there was no other cultivation attempted, and no vegetables were eaten except onions and garlic, which were bought at the stores, with bread, rice, mate <b>tea,</b> <b>oil,</b> vinegar, raisins, cinnamon, pepper, cummin seed, and whatever else they could afford to season their meat-pies or give a flavour to the monotonous diet of cow's flesh and mutton and pig. Almost the only game eaten was ostrich, armadillo, and tinamou (the partridge of the country), which the boys could catch by snaring or running them down. Wild duck, plover, and such birds they rarely or never tasted, as they could not shoot; and as to the big rodent, the vizcacha, which swarmed everywhere, no gaucho would touch its flesh, although to my taste it was better than rabbit.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} some {{potentially}} interfering substances and {{conditions on the}} antimicrobial activity of Melaleuca alternifolia (<b>tea</b> tree) <b>oil</b> was investigated.

Minimum inhibitory or cidal concentrations differed from controls by two or more dilutions, for one or more organisms, where Tween- 20, Tween- 80, skim-milk powder and bovine serum albumin were assessed. These differences were not seen when assays were performed in anaerobic conditions, or in the presence of calcium and magnesium ions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> {{is used as}} {{a natural}} remedy, but is also a popular {{ingredient}} in household and cosmetic products. Oxidation of <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> results in degradation products, such as ascaridole, which may cause allergic contact dermatitis. OBJECTIVES: To identify the optimal patch test concentration for ascaridole, and to investigate the relationship between a positive reaction to ascaridole and a positive reaction to oxidized <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil.</b> PATIENTS/MATERIALS/METHODS: Three hundred and nineteen patients with eczema were patch tested with ascaridole 1 %, 2 %, and 5 %, and 250 patients were patch tested with oxidized <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> 5 %. Readings were performed on D 3 and D 7 according to a patch test calibration protocol. RESULTS: With an increasing ascaridole test concentration, the frequency of positive reactions increased: ascaridole 1 %, 1. 4 %; ascaridole 2 %, 5. 5 %; and ascaridole 5 %, 7. 2 %. However, the frequencies of irritant and doubtful reactions also increased, especially for ascaridole 5 %. A positive reaction to ascaridole was related to a positive reaction to <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This study is in support of ascaridole being a sensitizer. We recommend patch testing with ascaridole at 2 %. The finding that every positive reaction to oxidized <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil</b> is accompanied by a positive reaction to ascaridole suggests that ascaridole might be a contact allergen in oxidized <b>tea</b> tree <b>oil...</b>|$|R
