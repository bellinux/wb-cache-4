5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.

25|$|In astronomy, interplanetary {{scintillation}} {{refers to}} random {{fluctuations in the}} intensity of radio waves of celestial origin, on the timescale of a few seconds. It {{is analogous to the}} <b>twinkling</b> one sees looking at stars in the sky at night, but in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum rather than the visible one. Interplanetary scintillation is the result of radio waves traveling through fluctuations in the density of the electron and protons that make up the solar wind.|$|E
25|$|In particular, I {{shall never}} forget the Barbarians game at Cardiff Arms Park to end our Grand Slam tour of 1984. We weren't in such good shape – our {{discipline}} had surrendered to celebration after beating Scotland and we knew {{this was to be}} Europe's game of retribution against us. We seemed to be constantly counter-attacking to get out of trouble and then Campese struck. He made a break from within his own half, the defence came at him and he stepped left and right with remarkable speed. And in the <b>twinkling</b> of an eye, the try line was his. But he had one defender to beat, the Welsh centre Robert Ackerman. Ackerman, unfortunately, had criticised the Australian victory after our crushing victory in the Test against Wales and Campo didn't have the words to retaliate then. But he retaliated now, with his feet and hands. He turned Ackerman inside out, threatening to go past, then changing direction, offering himself to be tackled then accelerating away until the crowd erupted, first in disbelief, then in sheer amusement and joy at what they were seeing. One yard from the line, Campo passed to Michael Hawker, and I'm sure, to this day, the pass was forward, but the referee knew he had seen artistry of incomparable dimension at work and the only reward he could offer was a try, which he duly did. It's an image I'll always associate with Campese. It remains for me the metaphor of his career.|$|E

500|$|Later in 1994, Dunst co-starred in {{the drama}} film Little Women {{opposite}} Winona Ryder and Claire Danes. The film received favorable reviews.

500|$|Popular with {{teammates}} and {{known for his}} sportsmanship, Marsh was regarded as an average fielder and had minimal batting skill, with a batting average of 5.00.

Les Poidevin described Marsh as [...] "a well set-up, perfectly built ... man, with an ebony-black, smooth, clear shining skin and <b>twinkling</b> black eyes" [...] who [...] "is quite good looking". Marsh was short for a fast bowler standing 5ft 7ins (170cm) tall. In later years, Marsh experimented with the googly.

500|$|At one stage, Bradman went 13 {{first-class}} innings {{without a}} century, the longest such spell of his career, prompting suggestions that Bodyline had eroded his confidence and altered his technique.

500|$|Manohla Dargis, whilst {{generally}} ambivalent {{towards the}} film, called the lead performances {{one of its}} principal attractions.
