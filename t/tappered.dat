40|$|Background: Some {{concern has}} been raised related {{to the use of}} {{tacrolimus}} in pediatric transplant in children because of its toxicity against pancreatic beta-cells. Cautious use of tacrolimus and early withdrawal of steroids could provide a more refined and safer treatment under such circumstances. Objective: To describe our experience related to beta-cell toxicity and cardiovascular profile in 31 kidney- transplanted children in a two-year period with an immunosuppressor regime based on basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid (MMF) and <b>tappered</b> steroids. Patients and methods: 18 boys and 13 girls (mean age 9 ± 8 years) were transplanted in a two year period from a cadaveric donor (mean age 11 ± 9 years). Basiliximab was employed at days 0 and 4 post-transplant period, and tacrolimus was administered by mouth in the first 24 hours post-transplant (0. 15 mg/kg/day) to reach levels between 6 and 10 mcg/ml. Higher levels were eluded. MMF was administered at the same time (20 mg/kg/day) to obtain levels between 2 and 4 ng/ml. Steroids were administered (5 mg/kg/day to 1. 5 mg/kg/day at the 7 th day post-transplant, <b>tappered</b> to 0. 15 mg/kg/day at the 90 th day and withdrawn completely at the 360 th day in 92 % of patients). Lipid profile and adverse events were monitored. Results: Tacrolimus levels were maintained at 8 ± 2. 2 micg/ml at the 3 first months and after through the follow-up period, between 6 ± 2. 3 microg/ml. Mean hemoglobin A 1 c levels did not differ between baseline (5. 54 %) at 12 and 48 months (5. 54 ± 0. 32 % and 5. 48 ± 0. 24 % respectively). New-onset post-transplant diabetes mellitus did not occur at all. Mean baseline total cholesterol and triglycerides prior to transplantation were 211 ± 47. 5 mg /dL and 156. 2 ± 33. 2 mg /dL respectively. At the 12 th month post-transplant total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly lower (192. 8 ± 43. 6 mg/dL and 124. ± 26. mg/dL respectively p < 0. 001), and also at the 24 th month post-transplantation (198. 3 ± 18. 3 mg/dL and 138 ± 20. 1 mg/dL respectively p< 0. 005). Creatinine levels were maintained between 0. 4 and 1. 2 mg/dl. Conclusions: Despite initial concerns related to the beta-cell toxicity of tacrolimus or unfavourable cardiovascular profile our data suggest that cautious use of tacrolimus and early withdrawal of steroids provide a safe and useful therapeutic approach to pediatric kidney-transplant...|$|E

The antenna size has been reduced by 50 percent with respect to conventional spiral antenna used for same frequency band. This antenna adequately satisfies all of the generally standardized physical constraints and limitations placed upon airborne platforms. The spiral helix consists of a spiral antenna with a spiral radiator, the balanced to unbalanced (balun) transformer, backing cavity and a helical antenna where the outer ends of spiral antenna are terminated with a helix.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to re-examine Leon Williams {{geometric}} theory and to find the degree of correspondence between the face and the tooth form in the population of Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two thousand individuals with intact frontal teeth, in age between 17 and 24 years, were measured for 3 horizontal distances on the face: temporal width (Ft-Ft), zygomatic width (Zyg-Zyg) and gonial width (Go-Go) and for 3 horizontal distances on the both upper incisors: cervical width (CW), contact point width (CPW) and incisal width (IW). The length of the face (Tr-Gn) as well as the length of the central maxillary incisors were also measured. The results revealed: 1. Men had significantly larger dimensions for all facial and tooth dimensions (p 0. 05); the left and the right central incisors were of identical dimensions and forms (p > 0. 05). 2. The width of upper central incisors were smaller approximately 1. 5 mm than in west Europeans. 3. Upon the relation between the 3 horizontal dimensions measured on the face and upper maxillary incisor, 11 facial forms and 10 upper central tooth forms could be recognised in the study population, but 98 % of the population had only 3 tooth and face forms. Face shapes: oval face – 83. 3 %, square-tapered face – 9. 2 % and tapered face – 7 %; tooth forms: tapered-square incisor – 53 %, oval incisor – 30 %, <b>tappered</b> incisor – 16 %. 4. Reversed and enlarged tooth form was in line associated with the facial form in only 30 %, while the most common combination was of the oval face form and the tapered-square central incisor (45 %). 5. These results disapprove William’s theory and may be helpful for the choice of artificial teeth in complete denture construction and the dental industry...|$|E
40|$|O desenho do implante é um fator de grande relevância na distribuição das tensões geradas nos tecidos perimplantares. A proposição deste estudo foi avaliar a distribuição das tensões de cinco diferentes desenhos de implantes, quando submetidos a carregamentos axiais uniformemente distribuídos. Foram confeccionadas cinco mandíbulas fotoelásticas, nas quais estavam inseridas os implantes utilizados nesta pesquisa <b>Tappered</b> Effect (TE 4. 1 X 12 mm- Straumann Dental Implant System), Bone Level (BL 4. 1 X 12 mm- Straumann Dental Implant System), Regular Neck Standard Plus (RNSP 4. 1 X 12 mm- Straumann Dental Implant System), Ankylos (AK 4. 5 X 11 mm- Dentsply Ind e Com Ltda), Branemark MKIII (MKIII 3. 75 mmX 11. 5 mm- Nobel Biocare AB). Estas mandíbulas foram posicionadas no crânio fotoelástico, e cargas axiais, uniformemente distribuídas de 2, 3 e 4 bars foram aplicadas. Dos cinco implantes utilizados, o BL e o AK apresentam plataforma reduzida e formato cilíndrico, o TE apresenta o formato cônico, RNSP e MKIII formato cilíndrico, sendo que estes apresentam plataforma regulares. Os resultados obtidos mostram que ambos os implantes, apresentaram tensões na região onde se localizam as roscas dos implantes. Os implantes BL e AK, ficaram livres de tensões na região cervical. O implante MKIII foi o que apresentou maiores tensões na região apical, e ao longo do implante não foram observadas tensões dissipadas. O implante RNSP apresentou maiores tensões na região do pescoço do implante. O TE apresentou tensões bem distribuídas ao longo do implante, mas não houve isenção de tensões na região do pescoço. Concluímos que implantes que apresentam plataformas reduzidas (AK e BL) geram tensões distantes da região cervical. Apesar dos implantes TE e RNSP apresentarem plataformas de mesma dimensão, o RNSP apresentou maiores tensões na região da plataforma, podendo concluir que implantes de formatos cônicos distribuem de maneira favorável as tensões. O MKIII apresentou maiores tensões na região apical. The {{design of}} the implant is a highly {{relevant}} factor {{in the distribution of}} stresses generated in the peri-implant tissues. The proposition {{of this study was to}} evaluate the stress distribution of five different designs of implants, when subjected to axial loads uniformly distributed. Were prepared five photoelastic jaws, in which the implants used in this research were inserted: <b>Tappered</b> Effect (TE- 4. 1 X 12 mm Straumann Dental Implant System), Bone Level (BL- 4. 1 X 12 mm Straumann Dental Implant System), Regular Neck Standard Plus (RNSP 4. 1 X 12 mm- Straumann Dental Implant System) Ankylos (AK- 4. 5 X 11 mm Dentsply Ind e Com Ltda), Branemark MKIII (3. 75 mmX 11. 5 mm MKIII, Nobel Biocare AB). The mandibles were positioned on the photoelastic skull, and axial loads, uniformly distributed in 2. 3 and 4 bars were applied. Among the five implants used, the BL and AK have reduced platform and cylindrical, the TE has conical shape, and MKIII RNSP cylindrical shape, and these have regular platform. The results show that both implants showed tensions in the region where we find the threads of the implants. Implants BL and AK, were free of cervical tension. The MKIII implant showed the highest stresses in the apical region and along the implant there were no tensions dissipated. The implant RNSP showed greater tension in the neck of the implant. The TE showed tensions well distributed over the implant, but there was no relief of tension in the neck. We conclude that implants that have reduced platform (AK and BL) create tension distant from the cervical region. Despite RNSP TE implants have the same dimension platforms, the RNSP showed higher stress in the region of the platform, and may conclude that implants conical distribute favorably tensions. The MKIII showed higher stress in the apical region...|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Idiopathic retroperitoneal {{fibrosis}} (IRF) is {{an uncommon}} disease {{characterized by a}} retroperitoneal fibrotic tissue that often involve the ureters, leading to the obstructive nephropathy and variable impairment of renal function. Findings strongly suggest an autoimmune etiology. Surgery, medical treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, {{or a combination of}} both are proposed. The optimal treatment has not been established yet. The aim {{of this study was to}} present our experience with combined immunosuppressive therapy of IRF, steroids (S) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Methods. We prospectively followed four patients with IRF from January 2004 to December 2006. Three patients had an active disease with bilateral hydronephrosis. In the two of them acute renal failure was presented, and ureteral catheters were inserted in one in order to manage ureteral obstruction. One patient has came to our unit with a relapse of IRF and incipient chronic renal failure after the prior therapy with ureterolysis and immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine and tamoxifen). All patients received steroids and MMF. Two patients were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulses (250 mg each), for three consecutive days, followed by oral prednisone 0. 5 mg/kg/day. The other two patients received oral prednisone at the same dose. Prednisone was gradually <b>tappered</b> to a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg/day. Simultaneously, all patients received MMF, initially 1 g/day with the increase to 2 g/day. Results. After four weeks of the therapy all symptoms disappeared, as well as a hydronephrosis with a decrease of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and Creactive protein (CRP) to normal level in all patients. Three patients remain in remission untill the end of the follow up. One patient had a relapse because of stopping taking the therapy after six months. He was treated by oral prednisone 0. 5 mg/kg/day, which was gradually decreased. After twelve weeks hydronephrosis disappeared and CRP returns to the normal level. Conclusion. The combination of steroids and mycophenolate mofetil led to the remission of IRF with a strong and quick immunosuppressive effect. It also provided avoiding the long-term use of high steroid dose and surgical procedures. ...|$|E
40|$|Aerosols may {{be defined}} as an {{ensemble}} of solid and / or liquid particles suspended in a gas with sizes ranging from a few nanometers to a few micrometers. Aerosols released {{in the course of}} industrial processes may represent a threat for workers and the environment. Possible emission of micrometric / submicrometric particles such as CNT (carbon nanotube) powders at production sites or heavy metals at exhaust stacks of foundries and incinerators are two telling examples. The above considerations emphasize the need to develop an instrument allowing in-situ and real-time elemental identification and mass concentration determination of airborne particles. A LIBS-based system may be the appropriate tool to deal with such delicate issue. LIBS consists in focusing a powerful laser pulse on a material (solid, liquid, gas, aerosol, nanoparticle flow) whose elemental composition is to be determined. The strong heating of the sample at the focusing spot leads to the ignition of a hot and luminous transient ionized gas called plasma. Plasma light contains the signature of all the chemical elements the interrogated material is made of. This signature is read by sending the emitted light through a spectrometer equipped with a detector. The LIBS signal presents itself as an optical emission spectroscopy spectrum displaying lines corresponding to the detected elements. LIBS displays advantages of great interest for industrial applications. Detection of all the elements is possible at various pressure conditions. In addition, samples do not need preliminary preparation making LIBS eligible for on-line monitoring. It is a multielemental analysis technique with simultaneous detection of all the elements contained in the sample. Being all optical, it is not intrusive requiring only optical access to the sample and thus allowing in-situ measurements. LIBS is potentially fast and suitable for real-time monitoring, its speed depending on the number of laser shots required to obtain reliable results. Remote or stand-off analyses are even possible, if need be. The aforementioned features do make LIBS a promising analytical chemistry method intended to be operated at industrial sites. Current elemental analysis techniques require time consuming procedures involving several steps. Skilled personnel are sent to the sites where samples are to be picked up. Back to the laboratory, these are prepared prior to the analysis itself. The LIBS systems developed at INERIS are intended to be operated on-site, in automatic mode, without manual intervention except for maintenance. Experiments carried out at INERIS have demonstrated the potentialities of the LIBS technique for in-situ and real time quantitative detection of heavy metals in particulate form. A transportable LIBS system was first calibrated in laboratory using aerosol generators. Particle size distribution of the generated aerosol was obtained from an APS (Aerosol Particle Sizer) whereas the mass concentration of the targeted elements was inferred from TEOM (<b>Tappered</b> Element Oscillating Microbalance) measurements. The LIBS analyzer was then put to the test in a French research and development center specialized in metal casting (CTIF). Mass concentrations of copper particles released through an evacuation duct when melting copper bars in an induction furnace were monitored in real time. Other experiments aiming at detecting possible particle emission when handling CNT powders were performed in a high safety cell at ARKEMA research center. A LIBS system was implemented along with TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) samplers. TEM sampling allowed differed analysis of morphologies, sizes and elemental composition of the emitted particles. Real time particle elemental composition monitoring was assured by LIBS. Though the obtained results are qualitative, LIBS spectra crosschecked with TEM observations of the collected particles demonstrated LIBS potentialities to identify carbone nanotubes intertwined in bundles. A spectral signature based on simultaneous detection of carbon, iron and aluminum (the latter two being catalyst and catalyst support respectively) was found to act as a fingerprint allowing CNT bundle identification...|$|E
