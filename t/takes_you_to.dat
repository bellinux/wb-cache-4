25|$|For trekkers, the Spiti Valley is a paradise, {{offering}} challenging treks {{to explore}} the new heights of the Himalayas. The treks <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the popular trekking routes in the area includes Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako. There are some very high altitude treks also {{where you have to}} cross passes- like Parangla Pass (connecting Ladakh with Spiti Valley), Pin Parvati Pass, Baba Pass, Hampta Pass treks, Spiti Left Bank Trek are few to name. Please note that you carry all the necessary things before you head out for a trekking tour to Spiti. Tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, heavy wooolens, sunscreen and sunglasses are a must.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> area B, but going south from area B did not {{take you back to}} area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles for the sake of puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E
25|$|The Port of Ios is at {{the head}} of the Ormos harbor in the northwest. From there the bus or a 15-minute walk up the steep donkey path <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the village, known as Chora. Chora is a white and very picturesque cycladic village, full of stairs and narrow paths that make it {{inaccessible}} for cars of any kind. Today, the main path through this village is completely taken over by tourism in terms of restaurants, boutiques, bars and discothèques. Apart from the port and the village of Chora, Ios has only a few small settlements, just a group of spread out houses in the background of major beaches (Theodoti, Kalamos, Manganari). Since the 1990s, the island mayor Pousseos has worked on Ios' development towards attracting different types of tourists. With the help of European Community funds some roads have been built, all of them paved, and a scenic amphitheater has been created by the German architect Peter Haupt (who died in 2003) at the top of the village hill. Unfortunately, cultural events rarely take place up there.|$|E

Doyle imitated a didgeridoo by playing guitar with a wah-wah pedal. Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times praised [...] "Big Red Rock", saying that it [...] "suggests the huge expanse of the outback, then <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the Aboriginal secrets [...] the power surrounding the area [...] in a burst of truly inspired musicianship".|$|E

500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E
500|$|Namrata Joshi from Outlook {{rated the}} film with 3 stars out of 4 and {{commented on the}} simple, unpretentious storyline that dramatised {{important}} events from the champion's life. Bhawana Somaaya rated the film 4 stars out of 5, stating that film was not solely a medium for entertainment and that {{the main purpose of}} Mary Kom was to depict courage, stability, truth and innocence. The Economic Times gave a rating of 4 stars out of 5, noting that the film is {{well on its way to}} being one of the most praised sports-based films since Chak De India and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and wrote [...] "This is one of those boxing movies which is much more than boxing. It <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a place which is beyond ruptured cheeks, cracked jaws, and fractured ribs of the protagonist." [...] Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra rated the film 3 out of 5 noted it as a [...] "worthy attempt" [...] and said that the film had sincerity and was crafted with care. Mayank Shekhar also rated the film with 3 stars, stating that his biggest concern before getting into the film was that the film-makers (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) would excessively [...] "Bollywood-ise" [...] Kom's story. He commented that this fear was [...] "thankfully" [...] not found.|$|E

[...] The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Bill Carter's book reveals explosive new details about the Jay Leno-O'Brien debacle." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV.com wrote, [...] "the story takes an amazingly candid look at the conversations and arguments that went on behind the scenes. It even <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the moment when O'Brien decides that he has to walk away from 'The Tonight Show.'" [...] Paul Schwartzman of The Washington Post wrote that it [...] "is a great read and an example of narrative journalism's power when practiced by a reporter steeped in his subject matter." [...] Lynette Rice of Entertainment Weekly gave Carter's book a rating of B-, and wrote, [...] "In the end, Carter presents a pretty compelling argument that while the fourth-place network lost the public relations war, it probably won the late-night battle." [...] Speaking on his program The Howard Stern Show, host Howard Stern said of Carter's writing style, [...] "It is just endlessly fascinating the way he paints this picture." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller {{scored the}} game 7.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "a basic action {{game with a}} heavy dose of button mashing {{and a little bit of}} task management." [...] Finding the combat repetitive, he argued, [...] "even with the rage moves the combat can get pretty dull after a while." [...] He was also {{critical}} of the graphics, writing [...] "detail is sometimes sacrificed to achieve that nice frame rate. The character models are blocky, and they don't animate particularly well. Additionally, all the textures are fuzzy and bland." [...] He concluded, [...] "Spartan: Total Warrior is a pretty fun, though derivative, action game that should keep you entertained for at least the six or seven hours it <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get through the story.

2500|$|Before Perverted-Justice {{began working}} {{primarily}} with law enforcement, child safety advocate Julie Posey described Perverted-Justice's tactics as [...] "a gross invasion of privacy." [...] Posey indicated {{that she did}} not feel the methods employed by Perverted-Justice were completely effective. [...] "What it does is embarrass them for the moment... but then they'll go and get a different screen name and know to check things out a little more thoroughly next time." [...] Posey and Perverted-Justice founder Xavier Von Erck appeared on Fox News Channel shortly thereafter, where Posey remarked, [...] "It’s more of an entertainment site, actually. You go there, you click on a link of a picture that <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> that person’s chat-log and that person has a scale—a sliminess scale as he calls it—and you can rate the pervert from, I think it’s, one to five.

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{several kinds of}} global supervenience relations, which were {{introduced}} to handle cases in which worlds are the same at the base level and also at the supervenient level, but where the ways the properties are connected and distributed in the worlds differ. [...] For example, it is consistent with global mental–physical supervenience on the simple formulation described above for two worlds {{to have the same}} {{number of people in the}} same physical states, but for the mental states to be distributed over those people in different ways (e.g. I have my father's thoughts in the other world, and he has my thoughts). [...] To handle this, property-preserving isomorphisms (1-1 and onto functions between the objects of two worlds, whereby an object in one world has a property if and only if the object which that function <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> in the other world does) are used, and once this is done, several varieties of global supervenience can be defined.|$|E
2500|$|... 3 also {{produced}} an application called [...] "Skype on 3" [...] which brought the same functionality to S60 and J2ME-capable phones (but not iPhone or Android, although some unofficial Android versions were distributed).

This service is available in Australia, Ireland and the UK; it has been discontinued in Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy and Sweden. A company called iSkoot (now Qualcomm iSkoot Inc.) was behind {{at least some of}} the clients and back-end servers but iSkoot announced a shutdown scheduled for 20 January 2011.

2500|$|Jordan Pundik later accounted, [...] "I'm not {{comparing}} my band to the Beatles whatsoever, {{but their}} [...] records were simple songs {{about love and}} relationships, and people could relate to their songs because they understood what {{they were trying to}} say. That's what this record reminds me of. There's not weird metaphors. It's just straight up, wearing your heart on your sleeve." [...] Steve Klein emphasised the shift in mood from their previous album by stating, [...] "I think every record we make we try and capture a time period. When writing the songs for Coming Home it was more positive than negative. I felt on the last record, Catalyst, we were very negative lyrically. You can tell that by the titles [...] "All Downhill From Here" [...] and [...] "This Disaster," [...] it was a heavier record. Coming Home on the other hand <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a different place. It’s the record I feel we’ve been waiting our whole career to do, taking everything people love about NFG and bringing it to the next level." [...] Bassist Ian Grushka further explained, [...] "We only really talk about personal things that have affected us first-hand, our songs are about emotions rather than some political agenda." [...] The song, [...] "When I Die" [...] was written by Gilbert about the death of his father. When initially writing the bridge section for the song, Gilbert found the experience emotionally draining and had to leave the studio in order to compose himself. Despite this, he maintains that while song is [...] "sad", it remains [...] "a good sad." [...] He reflected this in the album's liner notes by adding, [...] "It is a song about accepting death and finding the bright side of the situation. I'm no longer afraid to die because I have my father there waiting for me on the other side." ...|$|E
