5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt at a}} school field trip, Edna Krabappel calls an {{emergency}} strike {{on behalf of the}} Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly spending on the school. The school is closed and students cope in their own ways. The parents of Springfield attempt to act as substitute teachers until the strike is over but this is deemed unsuccessful. Eventually, the two sides are forced into talking and think of a resolution: using <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> normal.|$|E
5|$|While {{the school}} {{continued}} operation through {{and after the}} war, economic hardships in the Reconstruction era caused <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> temporarily close in the late 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{was born}} in Phoenix, Arizona, to David and Charlotte Affeldt. His father {{was a member of}} the United States Air Force, and Affeldt lived in Guam, Merced, California, and Spokane, Washington, growing up. While in Merced, Affeldt and his father would {{frequently}} attend Oakland Athletics games, and Affeldt enjoyed watching Mark McGwire, Jose Canseco, and Dave Stewart. Affeldt attended Northwest Christian High School, a Division 2-B school in Colbert, Washington. He participated in three sports while there, but it was baseball that drove several major league scouts to <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> see him pitch. He graduated in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind and goes to <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers {{the boys and girls}} are standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults.|$|E
5|$|Between 1954 and 1960, {{the student}} body at New England more than doubled to over 500 {{students}} with a corresponding increase in staff and faculty, forcing <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> erect temporary, weatherboard huts to accommodate its expanded facilities and classrooms. In 1958, the university received £900,000 in government grants for facilities improvements and Madgwick presided over the planning and construction of over ten permanent buildings on the main campus, {{some of which were}} completed after Madgwick retired in 1966.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened {{with the passage of the}} 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> close.|$|E

5|$|Casson moved {{control of}} <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> a {{non-profit}} company in 1948, remaining as vice-chairman and medical director. She created the Elizabeth Casson Trust in 1949, intended to improve occupation therapy education and treatment. In 1951, Casson was awarded an OBE {{for her work}} at Dorset House and was also made an honorary fellow of the World Federation of Occupational Therapists.

5|$|Dartmouth College fielded {{its first}} {{football}} team in 1881, {{when the school}} challenged Amherst College to a two-game series. They won the first contest, one touchdown to none, and tied the second. The following year, the team played their first major opponent when they traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts and played the Harvard Crimson. Dartmouth was blown out 53–0, and a rivalry with Harvard formed. The Dartmouth football team developed through the 1880s, skipping the 1885 season but challenging several major opponents. Prior to Wurtenburg's arrival, the school had won four Triangular Football League championships in seven years. Wallace Moyle was the first coach hired by the program; he served in that position during the two years before Wurtenburg's appointment and led <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> a 9–7 record.|$|E
5|$|Dorset House had {{space for}} 800 {{patients}} in residence during the 1930s, moving to Bromsgrove during World War II. The building was damaged during the war, so in 1946, the School of Occupational Therapy moved to Oxford, whilst the patients moved to Clevedon. To ensure costs were kept {{down for the}} patients, Casson subsidised their treatment from her own funds. She began to release control of the projects in 1948, first by passing <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> a nonprofit company with her as vice-president and remaining as medical director. Then, in 1949, Casson created the Elizabeth Casson Trust which focused on occupational therapy treatment and education, {{with the majority of}} funds going to Dorset House school. In 1992, the school became part of Oxford Brookes University.|$|E

However, he decommitted after Princeton Tigers head coach Guy Gadowsky left <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> start the Division I hockey program at Penn State. Following Gadowsky to Penn State was not an option, as the program {{did not have a}} varsity team at the time.

Under Tribus, the Thayer School offered its first doctorates in engineering.|$|E
