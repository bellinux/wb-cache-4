5|$|The {{decision}} also {{stipulates that}} if the OPCW Director-General determined {{there had been a}} delay in implementation of the decision, <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> should be discussed within 24 hours, when it should be decided whether <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> should be submitted to the UN Security Council.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of several acid hydrolases in different {{sections of the}} C. N. S. of various mammalian has been evaluated. The enzymes which have been studied are: beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase, alpha-mannosidase. The enzymes show a higher activity in <b>the</b> gray <b>matter</b> than in <b>the</b> white <b>matter.</b> <b>The</b> results are interpreted {{on the assumption that}} glyco-lipoprotein turnover is higher in <b>the</b> gray <b>matter</b> than in <b>the</b> white <b>matter,</b> since myelin, which is the major component of <b>the</b> white <b>matter,</b> is a relatively stable structure...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} and unbiased stereological method {{was applied to}} estimate <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> volume, <b>the</b> total volume, total length and mean diameter of the myelinated fibers in <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> and <b>the</b> total volume of the myelin sheaths in <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> of rat brain. <b>The</b> white <b>matter</b> volume was obtained with the Cavalieri principle. Four tissue blocks were sampled from <b>the</b> entire white <b>matter</b> in a uniform random fashion. The length density of the myelinated fibers in <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> {{was obtained from the}} isotropic, uniform, random sections ensured by the isector. The volume density of the myelinated fibers in <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> was estimated by point counting. The total length and the total volume of the myelinated fibers in <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> were estimated by multiplying <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> volume and <b>the</b> length density and the volume density of the myelinated fibers in <b>the</b> white <b>matter,</b> respectively. <b>The</b> size of nerve fibers was derived by measuring the profile diameter perpendicular to its longest axis. The results were satisfactory {{in the sense that the}} sampling variance introduced by the stereological estimation procedure was a minor fraction of the observed variance. The comparison of <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> and <b>the</b> myelinated fibers in <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> between rat brain and human brain was also made in the present study...|$|R
5|$|According to the players, {{they refused}} to divulge more {{strategic}} material, such as team tactics and player selection policies. One of the most publicised {{of a series of}} betting controversies in cricket in the 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> was initially covered up by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which decided that it was sufficient to privately fine the players. The ACB concluded that, since Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> to the International Cricket Council, and there <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> ended.|$|E

5|$|British {{officials}} asked President Wilson for his consent on <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> on {{two occasions}} – first on 3 September, when he replied the time was not ripe, and later on 6 October, when he agreed {{with the release of}} the declaration.|$|E
50|$|Sadananda {{explains}} that hearing is determination that the Vedanta teaches non-duality of Brahman {{on the basis}} of six characteristic signs - a) presentation of <b>the</b> subject <b>matter</b> at <b>the</b> beginning and the conclusion, b) repetition or repeated presentation of <b>the</b> subject <b>matter,</b> c) originality i.e. <b>the</b> subject <b>matter</b> is not known through any other source, d) result or utility of <b>the</b> subject <b>matter,</b> e) eulogy or praise of <b>the</b> subject <b>matter</b> and f) demonstration or reasoning in support of <b>the</b> subject <b>matter.</b> Shravana results in the genuine ascertaining of the true import of the Vedic texts and statements.|$|R

5|$|Brooks {{then took}} a {{petition}} to the General Assembly, asking for a recount. The assembly took up <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> on April 20, 1873 and voted 63 to 9 not to allow Brooks to contest the election. This did not deter Brooks, and he applied to the Arkansas Supreme Court for a writ of quo warranto, and was again denied. They also ruled that state courts had no jurisdiction in <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> and dismissed the case.

5|$|In Australia, however, {{public opinion}} about <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> was divided with many Australians {{opposed to the}} issue on moral grounds, feeling that the {{situation}} was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure, while others felt it {{necessary in order to}} achieve final victory. The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> and on 28 October 1916 <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> was decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent, with the no vote prevailing. Despite the result, the issue split the Labor Party and the pro-conscription prime minister, Billy Hughes, ultimately left the party and joined with members of the opposition that supported conscription to form a new party, known as the Nationalist Party.|$|E
