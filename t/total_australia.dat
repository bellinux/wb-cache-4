Compost can improve overall soil health when incorporated into the soil or surface-applied as a soil conditioner. Despite differing in nutrient requirements, crops such as wheat, barley, oats, maize, canola, lucerne, fruit trees, grapes, sugar cane and many more can all benefit from the addition of pasteurised and composted organic materials. Compost can improve the soil’s physical, biological and chemical properties and positively enhance actively growing crops. Australian farmers are leading the way in the application methods of organic materials both above and below the soil surface. This continued used of composted organics completes the law of return cycle in the soil food chain, where nutrients removed through the plants, are returned to the soil.|$|E
