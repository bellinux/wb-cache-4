40|$|The {{objective}} was to develop and characterize a potential method to alleviate the issues regarding post impact effective modulus of composites in a tubular geometry. The hypothesis was {{that the use of}} a metallic substrate may increase post impact stiffness characteristics of the sample geometry, compared to a traditional fiber reinforced composite tube, in the torsion and tensile loading scenarios. This required the manufacture of non substrate fiber reinforced composite samples and aluminum substrate composite samples, and testing under torsion and tension loading scenarios. Main sample testing was carried out below the sample yield point, and therefore tests were nondestructive in nature. This research has concluded with statistical significance that an aluminum substrate decreases loss in <b>torsional</b> effective <b>modulus</b> following impact compared to a composite shaft only composed of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy. Samples with both aluminum sleeve factor levels produced significantly lower post impact effective modulus change compared to traditional composite counterparts. This appears to be correlated with the elimination of visible fiber and matrix rupture during the impact event. Therefore, <b>torsional</b> effective <b>modulus</b> decrease of the aluminum sleeve tubes appears to be dictated by tube geometry change. This is in contrast to traditional composite tubes, where a decrease in effective modulus was primarily dictated by the decrease in fiber cross sectional area. This research has concluded that the aluminum substrate decreases post impact tensile effective modulus change compared to traditional composite tubes, but statistical significance could not be attained due to the high degree of variance within each of the sleeve thickness factor levels. Samples with aluminum sleeves produced lower post impact effective modulus change compared to the traditional composite counterparts, but each sample sleeve thickness factor level variance was relatively high compared to the difference in mean values...|$|R

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{have been considered}} to optimize specific properties of Fibre Reinforced Composites (FRP). Firstly, carbon nanotubes (CNT) -epoxy nanocomposites are applied directly onto the brittle glass fibre surface as ‘healing coatings’ to reduce the stress concentrations, thus improving the reinforcing efficiency in the composite. Secondly, while using CNT-epoxy as bulk matrix, the processing and fabrication of CNTs containing hybrid composites is considered through ‘prepregging’. The effects of CNT/epoxy nanocomposite coatings applied to the fibre surface on tensile strength of single glass fibres are evaluated at different gauge lengths. It is shown that 0. 3 wt% CNT/epoxy nanocomposite coating {{gives rise to a}} significant increase in tensile strength of the fibre for all gauge lengths, better than the neat epoxy coating. The changes in prevailing failure mechanisms influenced by the epoxy and nanocomposite coatings have been identified. Effects of CNT structure, morphology and dispersion characteristics affected by CNT content, on crack healing efficiencies are also evaluated. The crack healing efficiency is much higher for the fibres coated with straight, less entangled CNTs than those with highly entangled CNTs, indicating the CNT dispersion state in the coating played an important role. Prepregs of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer composites containing CNTs are produced based on a solvent-less prepregging process. This work provides the comprehensive evaluation of the processing and curing parameters affected by the incorporation of CNT in CFRP prepreg manufacturing. The viscosity difference between the epoxies with and without CNTs is reduced by employing a temperature slightly higher than ambient. Based on the findings obtained from the rheological studies, suitable processing parameters are chosen for lab-scale production of CFRP prepregs. The effects of surfactant-treated CNTs on cure behaviour of epoxy and CFRP prepreg are also evaluated.

Bending studies provided a measure of compressive strength, with fibers exhibiting buckling for compressive stresses of approximately 700 MPa. The state of stress in model cylindically orthotropic fiber structures was analyzed using anisotropic elasticity theory. Tension. compression, torsion and bending were examined in order to compare the predicted level of transverse stress with the measured (relatively low) lateral strength. ^ Optical microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction were used to examine the structure of PBT fibers.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{anomalous}} behavior of solid He- 4 at low temperatures with {{particular attention to}} the role of structural defects present in solid. The discussion centers around the possible role of two level systems and structural glassy components for inducing the observed anomalies. We propose that the origin of glassy behavior is due to the dynamics of defects like dislocations formed in He- 4. Within the developed framework of glassy components in a solid, we give a summary of the results and predictions for the effects that cover the mechanical, thermodynamic, viscoelastic, and electro-elastic contributions of the glassy response of solid He- 4. Our proposed glass model for solid He- 4 has several implications: (1) The anomalous properties of He- 4 can be accounted for by allowing defects to freeze out at lowest temperatures. The dynamics of solid He- 4 is governed by glasslike (glassy) relaxation processes and the distribution of relaxation times varies significantly between different <b>torsional</b> oscillator, shear <b>modulus,</b> and dielectric function experiments. (2) Any defect freeze-out will be accompanied by thermodynamic signatures consistent with entropy contributions from defects. It follows that such entropy contribution is much smaller than the required superfluid fraction, yet it is sufficient to account for excess entropy at lowest temperatures. (3) We predict a Cole-Cole type relation between the real and imaginary part of the response functions for rotational and planar shear that is occurring due to the dynamics of defects. Similar results apply for other response functions. (4) Using the framework of glassy dynamics, we predict low-frequency yet to be measured electro-elastic features in defect rich He- 4 crystals. These predictions allow one to directly test the ideas and very presence of glassy contributions in He- 4. Comment: 33 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|Atomic Force Acoustic Microscopy (AFAM) and Lateral Atomic Force Acoustic Microscopy (LAFAM) are dynamic {{enhancements}} of the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). They {{combine the}} high lateral {{resolution of the}} AFM technique with an excessive sensitivity of a vibrating AFM cantilever to the elastic moduli of an investigated surface. Rectangular-shaped AFM cantilevers behave like a beam clamped from one side. When excited, it can vibrate in a bending or torsional mode. The value of the free resonance frequencies depend on the geometry of the cantilever and its mechanical properties. The AFM cantilever contacting a sample surface via the tip is an equivalent of a beam with two ends clamped. Such a system is stiffer and its "contact" resonance is shifted to higher frequency {{as compared to the}} free resonances. The value of the contact resonance frequency depends on the tip-sample forces, like elastic, electrostatic, hydrostatic, and lateral (friction) forces allowing one to deduce information on the surface properties related to these forces. The tip-sample interactions can be described as a set of vertical and lateral springs with dampers. The spring describing vertical forces corresponds to tip-sample vertical contact stiffness which contains both the elastic constants of the tip and the sample, and their contact area. The spring constant of the lateral spring is the lateral tip-sample contact stiffness that contains information about the G modulus. Depending on whether one insonifies either longitudinal or shear waves in the sample, one of the springs can be investigated in detail. The bending modes are excited by out-of-plane oscillations of a sample surface caused by longitudinal waves. A transversal wave with direction of polarization perpendicular to the long axis of the cantilever beam induces torsional vibrations of the cantilever. AFAM and LAFAM techniques can be applied in a spectroscopy and in an imaging mode. In the spectroscopy mode the amplitude of the cantilever vibrations is measured in the function of an applied ultrasound frequency. For small amplitudes of the surface vibrations the value of the contact resonance frequencies can be used to calculate the indentation modulus (bending mode) and shear <b>modulus</b> (<b>torsional</b> mode). When the excitation amplitude increases the measured resonance curves display non-linear behavior. Analysis of such non-linear spectra can provide information about adhesion and friction {{in the case of the}} bending and torsional modes, respectively. Usually the amplitude of the cantilever vibration at a frequency close the contact resonance frequency is used for imaging purpose. However, it is also possible to display the contact resonance frequency as an imaging quantity. Examples of spectra in linear and non-linear range, as well as images obtained on various samples with help of AFAM and LAFAM technique will be presented. We will also demonstrate the application of bending and torsional modes of cantilever vibrations for detection of out-of-plane and in-plane oriented ferroelectric domains in the so-called ultrasonic piezo-mode technique...|$|R

In prokaryotes, plasmids and genomic DNA is underwound, a property apparently required for proper initiation of replication. In eukaryotes'nuclei, DNA is highly compacted by successive stages of coiling. First, it is organized in nucleosomes by winding twice around the histone core, forming a bead on a string structure of nucleosomes known as chromatin, which is further compacted by winding into a solenoidal structure about 34 nm in diameter.

The objective of this research program is to study the dynamics of a composite driveshaft before and after ballistic damage is incurred. Driveshafts are tested under static and dynamic loads to obtain material, mechanical, and vibrational characteristics. In the dynamic tests, driveshafts with and without ballistic damage are observed to determine the critical speeds. The <b>torsional</b> <b>modulus,</b> the longitudinal modulus, and Poisson's ratio are determined from the static tests. Computational models are used to perform parametric studies and to complement the experimental program. Numerical simulations incorporate both beam and shell theory into the analysis. Additionally, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) was used to help determine the extent of the damage caused by the projectile...|$|E
40|$|The {{closure of}} long equilibrated {{denaturation}} bubbles in DNA is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations. A minimal mesoscopic model is used where the double-helix {{is made of}} two interacting bead-spring freely rotating strands, with a non-zero <b>torsional</b> <b>modulus</b> in the duplex state, κ_ϕ= 200 to 300 kT. For DNAs of lengths N= 40 to 100 base-pairs (bps) with a large initial bubble in their middle, long closure times of 0. 1 to 100 microseconds are found. The bubble starts winding from both ends until it reaches a 10 bp metastable state. The final closure is limited by three competing mechanisms depending on κ_ϕ and N: arms diffusion until their alignment, bubble diffusion along the DNA until one end is reached, or local Kramers process (crossing over a torsional energy barrier). For clamped ends or long DNAs, the closure occurs via this latter temperature activated mechanism, yielding {{for the first time}} a good quantitative agreement with experiments.

40|$|Vehicle body {{structures}} {{are characterized by}} load-carrying thin-walled beam-members, typically formed by spot-welded panels, with sections variations and discontinuities that highly influence both the static and the dynamic behaviour of the entire structure. Vehicle body concept modelling is an active field of research. Different methodologies are available, either based on the geometric analysis of the spatial mass distribution at each relevant cross-section or on static finite element (FE) based characterization of the beam properties. This paper presents a new methodology for estimating the cross-section properties of automotive structures with a beam-like behaviour. It {{is based on a}} dynamic FE approach, which allows estimating the stiffness characteristics (e. g. quadratic moments of inertia, <b>torsional</b> <b>modulus,</b> etc.) of equivalent 1 D beam elements, using the natural frequencies estimated by means of a modal analysis on the original 3 D FE model of the structure. The proposed method has been validated through an application case, comprising the analysis of a thin-walled beam with double-symmetric cross-section, formed by two spot-welded panels. status: publishe...|$|E

A research program has been completed on the dynamic elastic modulus measurements for several nickel and iron aluminide based intermetallics. The PUCOT (piezoelectric ultrasonic composite oscillator technique) was used for this purpose. Stress waves generated by the PUCOT were used to resonate the samples at ultrasonic frequencies. Longitudinal measurements were made at 100 kHz and the torsional measurements were made at 80 kHz. Tests were conducted from room temperature up to 1100 'C. The elastic behavior in this interval was studied. Damping and strain amplitude data were obtained simultaneously with the elastic constants for each specimen at all temperatures. Arrhenius plots were drawn from the temperature and damping data. Activation energies were determined for all specimens tested. The Young's and <b>torsional</b> <b>modulus</b> data obtained in the present research were compared with those already available for similar intermetallic compounds and alloys...|$|E
40|$|In the following, {{a theory}} is given {{with the purpose}} of {{establishing}} a mathematical relation between the stress and the strain in a crystal when plastically deformed. The existence of a "secondary structure" in crystals is adopted as a basic hypothesis. This structure was pointed out by Professor F. Zwicky to be a consequence of what he calls "cooperative phenomena. " The assumption that gliding in crystals takes place between the blocks of the secondary structure is the starting point of the following theory. The additional hypothesis of assuming a statistical distribution of the different forces which produce gliding between the blocks, gives us the means for going further in the calculations. The final result which is the stress strain curve of a crystal, is an exponential law containing three constants, i. e., the <b>torsional</b> <b>modulus</b> G, the elastic limit, (γs,τs) and the maximum applicable stress τm. The form of the hysteresis cycles is deduced from the same considerations and moreover a formula is obtained for the areas of the cycles. Experimental verifications were made on a single crystal of copper, and also on ordinary microcrystalline copper...|$|E
