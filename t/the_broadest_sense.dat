5|$|The {{judicial}} establishment, in <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense,</b> {{is composed}} of qadis, who give binding judgements in specific court cases, and muftis {{and other members of}} the ulema, who issue generalized but highly influential legal opinions (fatwas). The Grand Mufti is the most senior member of the judicial establishment as well as being the highest religious authority in the country; his opinions are highly influential among the Saudi judiciary. The judiciary proper (that is, the body of qadis) {{is composed of}} about 700 judges, a relatively small number (according to critics) for a country of over 23 million.|$|E

25|$|A hallucination, in <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense</b> of the word, is a {{perception}} {{in the absence of}} a stimulus. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness.|$|E
25|$|These {{stories were}} written from 1887 to 1897 for the {{magazine}} Der Gute Kamerad. Most of the stories are set in the Wild West, but Old Shatterhand is just a figure and not the first-person narrator as {{he is in the}} travel stories. The best known volume is Der Schatz im Silbersee. In <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense</b> the early works Im fernen Westen and Der Waldläufer belong to these category.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{cryptanalysis}} is {{a general}} form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. In <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense,</b> it {{is the study of}} how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output. In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformation, discovering where the cipher exhibits non-random behavior, and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key (cryptography key).|$|E

Elected as a Republican to the United States Senate, he served from March 4, 1867 to March 3, 1873, although Josiah Failing was an Oregon delegate at the second convention that re-nominated Abraham Lincoln and the following one that chose Grant (and he also served as a Republican state chairman).|$|E

The Austrian National Defence Academy, the Royal Military College of Canada, the Royal Danish Defence College, the Finnish National Defence University, the Netherlands Defence Academy, the Norwegian Defence University College, the Swedish National Defence College and the Baltic Defence College established this society with the intention to further research and academic education in military arts and sciences in <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{theoretical}} investigation {{there is}} only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> <b>sense</b> of <b>the</b> term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> <b>sense</b> of <b>the</b> term), so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur.|$|R

25|$|An {{expression}} {{system is a}} system specifically designed {{for the production of}} a gene product of choice. This is normally a protein although may also be RNA, such as tRNA or a ribozyme. An {{expression system}} consists of a gene, normally encoded by DNA, and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the DNA into mRNA and translate the mRNA into protein using the reagents provided. In <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense</b> this includes every living cell but the term is more normally used to refer to expression as a laboratory tool. An expression system is therefore often artificial in some manner. Expression systems are, however, a fundamentally natural process. Viruses are an excellent example where they replicate by using the host cell as an expression system for the viral proteins and genome.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{the style}} {{that was to}} become known as Baroque evolved in Italy in the early 17th century, at {{about the time that}} the first fully Renaissance {{buildings}} were constructed at Greenwich and Whitehall in England, after a prolonged period of experimentation with Classical motifs applied to local architectural forms, or conversely, the adoption of Renaissance structural forms in <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense</b> with an absence of the formulae that governed their use. While the English were just discovering what the rules of Classicism were, the Italians were experimenting with methods of breaking them. In England, following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, the architectural climate changed, and taste moved {{in the direction of the}} Baroque. Rather than evolving, as it did in Italy, it arrived fully fledged.|$|E
500|$|Atheism is, in <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense,</b> {{the absence}} of belief in the {{existence}} of deities. Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist. [...] In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Atheism is contrasted with theism, which, in its most general form, is the belief that at least one deity exists.|$|E

Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.|$|E
500|$|Taxon is the {{bi-monthly}} {{journal of}} the IAPT. The journal, which was initiated in 1951, publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense.</b> Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification. Taxon also contains matters related to botanical nomenclature, and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names and proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). Publication of such matters in Taxon satisfies the required submission to the General Committee. The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant Biosystematics, reviews and notices of books and other publications, and news {{in the world of}} plant systematics. [...] Although the journal is [...] "devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany", {{it has been in the}} past criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics.|$|E
500|$|For Ursula Franklin, {{technology}} {{is a set of}} practices in the [...] "here and now" [...] rather than an array of machines or gadgets. It is also a comprehensive system. [...] "Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." [...] Her definition is similar to the French thinker Jacques Ellul's concept of technique. Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. [...] "Technology has built the house in which we all live," [...] she writes, [...] "today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house." [...] As such, {{technology is}} a central element of the here and now. [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>sense</b> of the term, the here and now is our environment, that is, all that is around us—the ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves—'the way things are done around here.'" [...] Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.|$|E
