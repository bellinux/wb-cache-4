5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman {{intended}} to follow You Only Live Twice with <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> the Golden Gun, inviting Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in Cambodia, and the Samlaut Uprising made filming impractical, {{leading to the}} production being cancelled. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was produced instead with George Lazenby as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> the Golden Gun or Diamonds Are Forever. The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript {{to his friend}} (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 {{on the recommendation of}} Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights – published posthumously.

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing {{and he had been}} dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{then decided}} to start {{production}} on <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> the Golden Gun after Live and Let Die. This was the final Bond film to be co-produced by Saltzman as his partnership with Broccoli was dissolved after the film's release. Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions's parent company, Danjaq, LLC, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me, for three years.|$|E

Following its publication, Chatwin became friends with composer Kevin Volans, who was inspired to base a theatre score on the book. The project evolved into an opera, <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> Footsoles of Wind (1993).|$|E

5000|$|Toby's Room {{received}} a generally good reception, {{especially when it}} came to talking about the themes of what a female artist does in wartime, and how one deals with those that are disfigured and suffering as a result of war.

Eliot's The Wasteland as a touchstone for the First World War. ("the wound and the wasteland are the same thing. They aren't metaphors for each other, it's closer than that.") ...|$|R
