500|$|Very {{was known}} as an eccentric, prone to odd {{behavior}} and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, [...] "I felt within me a new will... {{it was not a}} feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being [...] "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, [...] "I had <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that you are doing your own will, and not the will of your father". Very also claimed that he was {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, [...] "cannot the spirit parse & spell?" [...] Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women—he called it his [...] "sacrifice of Beauty".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, Ellis {{auditioned for}} the debut series of The Voice UK, a reality {{television}} singing competition. The show saw Ellis giving a blind audition {{in front of}} its four coaches. She sang [...] "Son of a Preacher Man" [...] but it failed to progress her further after none of the coaches turned round to select her {{to be in their}} groups. Her audition aired on BBC One in March; the panel reacted with positive feedback. Tom Jones consoled her: [...] "You seem like you've already made it," [...] referring to her theatrical career, while Danny O'Donoghue stated, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> a really phenomenal job, I really did. I can't fault that, all I can fault is myself for not turning around. I am looking for a specific type of girl singer and you're not it but you will be for 99% of the UK I am sure." [...] Her name later trended on social networking site Twitter. Ellis affirmed that it was a big risk to take, but added, [...] "this industry is all about taking risks. It was a risk to be publicly said 'no' to, but it's character-building for me and you get back on the horse and you carry on." ...|$|E

6000|$|... [With a sneer.] Well, {{it was a}} {{wonderful}} fine thing <b>you</b> <b>did</b> when <b>you</b> married him, Jenny. And <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>done</b> precious well for yourself, too.|$|R
5000|$|Jake Gold: [...] "You {{delivered}} it. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> {{exactly what}} we <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> with that song." [...] (1) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Kangaroo. 'I {{wish that}} I hadn't. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> it by charms and incantations, {{but this is}} a {{practical}} joke.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,' she replied. 'I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} me, or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.' ...|$|E
60|$|FATHER DEMPSEY. Oh, I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> D'ye see the top o the Roun Tower there? That's an antiquity worth lookin at.|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't {{anything}} to forgive. There {{have been times}} when I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> care. I've deceived myself, that's all. Goodbye, Anne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{makes me}} horrid to myself," [...] she replied wofully, [...] "but if I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> had <b>done</b> that I could more readily believe the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I undastand now," [...] {{she said}} one day, [...] "what that recta meant by wantin' {{me to make}} life ba'd for you; he saw how easy you was to spoil. Miss Milray is one to praise you to your face, and disgrace you be hind your back, and so I tell you. When Mrs. Milray <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>done</b> wrong she come and said so; and you can't forgive her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean?" [...] asked Eunice {{with pale}} lips. [...] "You {{are trying to}} frighten me; I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not believe in such things." ...|$|R
6000|$|Horrocks {{answered}} with a grunt. [...] "The cone," [...] he said, and then, as one who recovers himself, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not hear." ...|$|E
6000|$|And Cecily, {{turning away}} from the window, leant against the wall for support, and her pale face crimsoning, said, 'I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Well, I {{have an idea}} {{which will}} drag these people like a magnet. I thought it out coming down in the train.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Kangaroo. [...] "I {{wish that}} I had n't. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> it by charms and incantations, {{but this is}} a {{practical}} joke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I quite {{agree with}} you that Grace {{has nothing to do with}} it. I only {{referred}} it to that source because I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> {{all that}} fussy part {{and take care}} of the pounds, as you call them. Need I worry about it? I do hate sums, so!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Yet {{how should}} you? It is Lady Constantine's boy--her only child. His fond mother little {{thinks he is}} {{so far away from}} home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] she answered, frankly, [...] "I {{am glad to}} hear that. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not really}} like me, because you never called me by my name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't take {{kindly to}} the breed," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "Gridley didn't. And--if you'll excuse my saying so much--I should hardly have <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> yourself, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell them?" [...] {{repeated}} the innocent Swann. [...] "Lor' bless my soul, how <b>you</b> <b>do</b> jump at conclusions, Hardy. I only {{asked you to}} tidy yourself for my sake. I have an artistic eye. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> had <b>done</b> it to please me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am really}} sorry. I took {{you for a}} man of the world. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> merely <b>did</b> not wish to know anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean your}} character," [...] he said determinedly. [...] "I {{have always known}} how strong and noble it was, but I never quite <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> could <b>do</b> {{anything}} so beautiful as this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] stammered Miles, [...] "my poor Anne {{is not up}} to your mark--not clever {{like you}} or Jenny--but I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> like her pretty handy ways." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> love me {{it looked}} very {{like it a}} month ago, unless you have turned coquette, and I can't quite believe that," [...] he {{answered}} bitterly.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you loved}} me as I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> you would not--you could not-- have thus taken from me my darling little maid. Oh! shame, shame on you, father--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not mean}} {{to speak to me}} at all," [...] said Amelia. [...] "I {{supposed}} the cut was to be extended from papa to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The devil!" [...] he ejaculated. [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come from? We all <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were <b>done</b> for {{and gone}} where {{you ought to}} have gone a long time ago. His lordship will be mighty pleased to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You want to {{know what}} I think of Emily," [...] she answered. [...] "Your letter told me you were in love; but I didn't believe your letter. I have always doubted whether you were capable of feeling true love--until I saw Emily. The moment she entered the room, I knew that I had never {{properly}} appreciated my brother. You are in love with her, Miles; and you are a better man than I <b>thought</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Does</b> that express my opinion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{n't mean}} to speak to you to-day. But {{sometime}} I did mean to speak; because, whatever I was, I loved you; and I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> n't dislike me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not--ladies so seldom do," [...] {{continued}} the paying teller suavely. [...] "But {{there are no}} funds to your credit. Has not your banker or correspondent advised you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Lionel coldly, {{rising up}} to leave the room, then pausing just as his hand was on the door, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> feel for me, Marian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You don't think I {{would do}} {{anything}} of that sort? But I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> might know. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> remember their first settling here?' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Drake. Well, anyway, you'll take a glass just {{to settle}} it from me. (She brings {{the bottle and}} fills for him.) There, that's pure; that'll <b>do</b> <b>you</b> no harm. But O, Kit, Kit, I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were <b>done</b> with all this Jack-a-shoring.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Farnam {{gave her}} a {{thoughtful}} look. [...] "Well, that's plausible; but I never <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> greedy. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want the extra pay?" ...|$|R
