The PC version of the game implements mouse chording; the player has to hold the right mouse button to activate the crosshairs, and <b>then</b> <b>click</b> or hold at the left mouse button to shoot or use an item, such as a camera.|$|E
25|$|Once {{one or more}} {{units have}} been {{selected}}, the player can click {{on the ground to}} make them walk to the selected spot, or click on an enemy to make them attack. Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the right direction. This is accomplished by pressing the left or the right arrow key or moving the mouse to rotate the direction of the units as they move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially important when using formations, of which there are nine available. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and <b>then</b> <b>click</b> on the ground where they want the units to form. The player can also order all selected units to scatter and to retreat. All formations, as well as commands such as stopping, guarding, scattering, retreating, and reversing direction, are also available via a single click in the Control Bar {{at the bottom of the}} screen.|$|E

500|$|Exiles {{graphics}} and sound received nearly universal praise, and were credited with completing the game's immersion. The puzzles {{were described as}} less difficult and more contained, meaning that players {{did not have to}} experiment with switches and <b>then</b> <b>click</b> several screens away to see the effect, as in Riven. Macworlds Peter Cohen praised Presto for giving out bits of story throughout the game, rather than providing exposition only during opening and closing sequences. The pacing and rewards system was also appreciated by reviewers. IGN concluded their review of the game by stating that Presto had done [...] "a pretty good job with a notable addition to the series". The Daily Telegraph offered even stronger praise, saying that Presto had crafted the best Myst game in the series thus far, a sentiment that was echoed in other publications. The editors of Computer Games Magazine named Exile the best adventure game of 2001, and called it [...] "a breath of fresh air amidst the otherwise barren crop of adventure titles." [...] They also presented the game with their [...] "Best Art Direction" [...] and [...] "Best Acting" [...] awards, the latter for Dourif's performance.|$|E

If the user acquires a cookie and <b>then</b> <b>clicks</b> the [...] "Back" [...] button of the browser, the state on the browser is generally not the same as before that acquisition.
