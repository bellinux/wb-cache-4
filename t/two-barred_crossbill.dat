50|$|The {{species of}} crossbills are {{difficult}} to separate, and care is needed even with the two-barred/Hispaniolan crossbill, the easiest. The other species are identified by subtle differences in head shape and bill size, and the identification problems formerly led to much taxonomic speculation, with some scientists considering that the parrot and Scottish crossbills and possibly the Hispaniolan and <b>two-barred</b> <b>crossbills</b> are conspecific.|$|R
50|$|The <b>two-barred</b> <b>{{crossbill}}</b> (Loxia leucoptera), {{known as}} the white-winged crossbill in North America, is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It has two subspecies, white-winged crossbill Loxia leucoptera leucoptera in North America, and <b>two-barred</b> <b>crossbill</b> Loxia leucoptera bifasciata in NE Europe and N Asia.|$|E

50|$|The {{seeds are}} an {{important}} food for some birds, notably pine siskin, redpoll, and <b>Two-barred</b> <b>crossbill.</b>|$|E
50|$|It was {{formerly}} regarded as conspecific with the <b>two-barred</b> <b>crossbill</b> (L. leucoptera), {{from which it}} is now assumed it evolved.|$|E
50|$|Another {{crossbill}} on Hispaniola {{was previously}} {{treated as a}} subspecies, Loxia leucoptera megaplaga, but is now treated as a distinct species, Hispaniolan crossbill, Loxia megaplaga. It {{is associated with the}} Hispaniolan pine Pinus occidentalis, and differs from <b>two-barred</b> <b>crossbill</b> in darker plumage and a stouter bill.|$|E
50|$|The {{top of the}} old {{coal mine}} spoil heap has been {{converted}} into a viewing site for birdwatchers, and gives panoramas over an extensive forested area. It is best known for viewing raptors, especially goshawks, best seen from late morning onwards in February and March. In February 1998, a female <b>two-barred</b> <b>crossbill</b> was present in a crossbill flock, drawing birdwatchers from across Britain.|$|E
50|$|The crossbills are characterised by the mandibles {{crossing}} {{at their}} tips, {{which gives the}} group its English name. They are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation to assist the extraction of the seeds from the cone. <b>Two-barred</b> <b>crossbill</b> has a strong preference for larch (Larix), in Eurasia using Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) and Dahurian larch (L. gmelinii), and in North America Tamarack larch (L. laricina). It will also take rowan Sorbus berries, and in North America, also eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and white spruce (Picea glauca) cones.|$|E
50|$|The {{arboretum}} {{was founded}} in 1902 and is today maintained by a trust. At its inception it {{was intended as a}} testing ground for foreign species of conifers. Today it contains slightly less than 100 species of conifers and over 200 species of broad-leaved tree, in addition to other plants. Several of the trees are arranged in larger constellations rather than as individual specimen. Arboretum Mustila's collection of rhododendrons and azaleas is furthermore notable. The many species of trees occasionally attract locally rare birds, e.g. spotted nutcracker and <b>two-barred</b> <b>crossbill.</b> The arboretum is open to visitors for a fee and contains several walkways.|$|E

50|$|The Massawepie Mire is a boreal {{peatland}} bog in Piercefield, New York, {{located near}} Massawepie Lake. Covering {{an area of}} over 900 acres, the mire is the largest bog in New York State. This large size is due to its position in a large, shallow glacial basin. Much of the bog is on the property of Massawepie Scout Camps, and the camp partners with the Nature Conservancy to preserve the ecosystem. The Massawepie Mire is noted for birdwatching, with several species of rare birds occupying the area including spruce grouse, gray jay, Lincoln's sparrow, boreal chickadee, and the <b>two-barred</b> <b>crossbill.</b> Flora includes the carnivorous pitcher plants and sundew, tamarack pines and black spruce trees, {{as well as the}} sphagnum moss that makes up the base of the bog.|$|E
