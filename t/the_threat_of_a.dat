5|$|On 22 June, Germany {{launched}} a massive attack upon the Soviet Union; this attack all but removed <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German {{invasion of the}} United Kingdom. However, the British still had to consider <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German invasion due {{the possibility that the}} Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught and the ease in which Germany could transfer troops back to the west. In late 1941, the arrival of autumn and winter weather meant that the threat of invasion subsided. This, coupled with the production of new equipment for the British army, allowed the War Office to begin steps to better balance the army due to the large number of infantry units formed during the preceding year and a half. As part of this reform, the County Divisions were disbanded.|$|E

5|$|That night, 200,000 {{troops and}} 2,000 tanks entered the country. They first {{occupied}} the Ruzyně International Airport, where air deployment of more troops was arranged.

5|$|With {{the twin}} {{victories}} of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time {{it became apparent}} that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished.|$|E

5|$|After the war many castles were slighted, damaged to {{put them}} beyond {{military}} use, but Parliament was concerned about <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, {{at a cost of}} £1,703 a year. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have been stripped of its valuable lead and remaining resources, including the roofs.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Cardiff Castle {{escaped the}} slighting, or {{deliberate}} damage and destruction, that affected many other castles. Probably because of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pro-Royalist invasion by the Presbyterian Scots, a Parliamentary garrison was installed instead and the castle remained intact. The Herberts continued {{to own the}} castle as the Earls of Pembroke, both during the interregnum and after the restoration of Charles II. The castle's constable continued to act as mayor {{of the town of}} Cardiff, controlling the meetings of the town's burgesses, bailffs and aldermen; the Herberts usually appointed members of the more important local gentry to this position during the period.|$|E
5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French invasion, Sir Thomas Page surveyed the blockhouse in 1778 {{and concluded that}} its guns were too closely packed together {{and that they could}} not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was occupied by Captain Richard Swanley, a supporter of Parliament. In December 1648 it was briefly used to detain the King before his trial and execution.

During the years after Modell's move and the Browns' suspension, a dozen new stadiums were built for NFL teams. Citing the precedent set by the Browns' relocation, NFL owners used <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> move to convince their cities to build new stadiums with public funds.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} perceived <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Catholic {{crusade against}} heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution {{that would not}} offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
25|$|Few days after, the Spanish forces re-established {{control over}} the {{fortress}} of Rheinberg.

Lahars {{pose a threat to}} the nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchina, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) {{recovered}} Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261, the restored Byzantine Empire faced <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Latin crusade {{to reclaim the}} city. The antagonistic Greek Despotate of Epirus and the Latin states of southern Greece, fearful of the Byzantine resurgence, sought aid from the Kingdom of Sicily, first under Manfred of Sicily (r. 1258–1266), and after 1266 under the ambitious Charles of Anjou (r. 1266–1285), who quickly established himself as Byzantium's chief antagonist. Countering the Angevin ruler's alliances and efforts to conquer Byzantium would occupy the remainder of Michael VIII's reign.|$|E

40|$|While {{virtually}} all currency crisis models recognise {{that the decision}} to abandon a peg depends on how tenaciously policy makers defend it, this is seldom modelled explicitly. We add <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interest rate defence to the global game model of Morris and Shin (American Economic Review 88, 1998). With an endogenous defence, actions of speculators may become strategic substitutes instead of the usual complements. Nevertheless, our generalised model remains tractable and has a unique threshold equilibrium. It provides additional insights. For instance, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interest rate defence makes speculation riskier and this may be sufficient to keep speculators out when fundamentals are still relatively strong.

5|$|It {{was used}} in {{relation}} to the Government of Ireland Act 1914, which had been under <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Lords veto, now removed. Ulster Protestants had been firmly against the passing of the bill. However, it never came into force because of the outbreak of the First World War. Amendments to the Parliament Act 1911 were made to prolong the life of the 1910 parliament following the outbreak of the First World War and 1935 parliament because of the Second World War. These made special exemptions to the requirement to hold a general election every five years.|$|E
5|$|Kerr invited Whitlam and Minister for Labour Senator Jim McClelland {{to lunch}} on 30 October, {{immediately}} preceding an Executive Council meeting. At that meal, Kerr proposed a possible compromise. If the Opposition were to allow supply to pass, Whitlam would not advise a half-Senate election until May or June 1976, and the Senate would not convene until 1 July, thus obviating <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible temporary Labor majority.

5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E
