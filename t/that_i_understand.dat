500|$|Thirty-four {{years after}} Branded to Kill, Suzuki {{directed}} Pistol Opera (2001), a loose sequel co-produced by Shochiku and filmed at Nikkatsu. The character Goro Hanada returns {{as a mentor}} figure to the new Number Three, played by Makiko Esumi. However, Joe Shishido was replaced by Mikijiro Hira {{in the role of}} Hanada. Suzuki has said that the original intention was for Shishido to play the character again but that the film's producer, Satoru Ogura, wanted Hira for the role. Reviews were of a favourable nature on par with its predecessor. Jonathan Rosenbaum supposed, [...] "Can I call a film a masterpiece without being sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it? I think so..." [...] Although some, such as Elvis Mitchell for The Village Voice, felt its zeal fell slightly short of the original.|$|E
2500|$|According to Christopher Hitchens, Moore {{had argued}} in a {{previous}} public debate that Osama bin Laden was to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and thus questions the treatment of bin Laden in the film. [...] "Something – I cannot guess what, since we knew as much then as we do now – has since apparently persuaded Moore that Osama Bin Laden is as guilty as hell. Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous 'distraction' from the fight against him. I believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the convenience of this late conversion." [...] Hitchens was subsequently invited to appear on Joe Scarborough's MSNBC talk show, Scarborough Country, at which point a tape recording of his debate with Moore at the Telluride Film Festival in 2002 was replayed.|$|E
2500|$|In circles {{concerned}} with copyright and intellectual property issues, Wood {{is known as}} the artist of the unsigned satirical Disneyland Memorial Orgy poster, which first appeared in Paul Krassner's magazine The Realist. The poster depicts a number of copyrighted Disney characters in various unsavory activities (including sex acts and drug use), with huge dollar signs radiating from Cinderella's Castle. Wood himself, as late as 1981, when asked who did that drawing, said only, [...] "I'd rather not say anything about that! It was the most pirated drawing in history! Everyone was printing copies of <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> some people got busted for selling it. I always thought Disney stuff was pretty sexy... Snow White, etc." [...] Disney took no legal action against either Krassner or The Realist but did sue a publisher of a [...] "blacklight" [...] version of the poster, who used the image without Krassner's permission. The case was settled out of court.|$|E

2500|$|... "'I Won't Give Up' {{was written}} selfishly. As {{many of my}} songs are, I write {{for the purpose of}} {{understanding}} what the hell's going on in my life, my position in the world, processing that lesson and that miracle that I'm learning. Seeing it on the page, proving to myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that I can move on. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for. Whether we want to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after." ...|$|E

60|$|By persuading him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> what he meant, I rose in his estimation.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{answered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> very well, as {{his case}} {{seemed to be}} like my own.|$|R
60|$|Then it was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> why {{the old man}} was so solicitous {{regarding}} John's injury.|$|R

60|$|FANNY. He {{never told}} you ANYTHING--for the matter of <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> you had found out {{everything}} for yourself.|$|R
60|$|As a proof <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> him, <b>I</b> {{promised the}} secrecy {{which he had}} every right to expect from me.|$|R
60|$|Rectus couldn't; but <b>I</b> {{told her}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> the {{language}} tolerably well, {{and asked her}} why she wished to know.|$|R

60|$|If Bladesover is my key for the {{explanation}} of England, I think my invincible persuasion <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> Russia was engendered by the circle of Uncle Frapp.|$|E

60|$|I {{felt very}} ignorant, {{but what could}} I do? I was so entirely unacquainted with the subject <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> nothing about it even then.|$|R
60|$|Now it was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> {{what was}} in Jerry's mind, and only with {{difficulty}} could I restrain myself from running forward at full speed.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Stackpole seemed unmoved by this consideration; she was {{thinking}} of something else and presently expressed it. [...] "I'm not sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you about Lord Warburton." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{could hardly}} believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> him. [...] "Do you assert," [...] I said, [...] "that my {{medicine}} would have killed me, if I had taken the rest of it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you, Don Martin," [...] said Mrs. Gould, coldly, {{preserving}} the low key of their conversation. [...] "But, speaking as if I did, {{who is the}} other?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The woman {{perceived}} instantly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> her, but {{her control}} was perfect. Her will was diabolical, yet {{for a moment}} a gleam of anger darkened her eyes. Then she answered naturally: ...|$|R
