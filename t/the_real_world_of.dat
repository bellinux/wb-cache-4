25|$|Basic {{training}} commences with 'pep talks' {{to boost}} {{the morale of the}} new recruit. This is a ten-day phase in which the inductee is familiarised with <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> intelligence and espionage, as opposed to the spies of fiction. Common usages, tradecraft techniques and classification of information are taught. Financial and economic analysis, Space Technology, Information Security, Energy Security and Scientific knowledge is imbibed to the trainees. The recruit is made to specialise in a foreign language and introduced to Geo strategic analysis. Case studies of other agencies like CIA, KGB, ISI, Mossad and MI6 are presented for study. The inductee is also taught that intelligence organisations do not identify who is friend and who is foe, the country's foreign policy does. Basic classroom training in tactics and language are imparted to R officers at the residential Training and Language Institute in Gurgaon. A multi-disciplinary school of economic intelligence is also being set up in Mumbai to train intelligence officers in investigating economic crimes like money laundering for terror purposes etc.|$|E

500|$|The 1990s are remembered, {{by many in}} the West, as a time of {{relative}} prosperity and satisfaction. [...] According to some historians, visionary politics appeared to be on the decline. [...] However, even after Satin entered New York University School of Law in 1992, he expressed no desire to abandon his project of helping to construct a post-liberal, post-Marxist ideology. [...] He did admit to being disillusioned with his approach. [...] "I knew my views (and I personally) would benefit from engagement with <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> commerce and professional ambition", he wrote.|$|E
500|$|Based on {{southern}} Europe countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, Karnaca is warmer and sunnier than Dunwall. Reference photos were used {{from a variety}} of places to help design the city, including Cuba, Lyon and Malibu, California. The buildings in Karnaca frequently have flat roofs and more ornate windows. Photography from the 1920s was examined in order to help build a setting with a historical disposition, using reference websites like Shorpy.com and looking at the work of Agustín Casasola. Whereas Dishonored was largely built on <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> 1837, Dishonored 2 draws ideas from [...] "the architectural forms, popular fashions, and far-out technologies" [...] of 1851. Arkane tried to take architectural concerns into account, and considered the effect the wind would have on the way the city developed, with energy being generated by wind turbines. Level designers and level architects collaborated throughout the entire production as locations were built. In making Karnaca, a style of Art Nouveau was applied.|$|E
500|$|Writer Sangita Gopal {{analysed}} the [...] "intensification of {{the aesthetic}} effects of Hindi cinema" [...] in the narrative scheme of the film. During the confrontation scene between Yash and Rahul Raichand, a [...] "thundering background score" [...] coupled with [...] "360° panning shots" [...] were used to build up melodrama. She added that while such scenes simply began by reprising previous face-offs in several melodramatic Hindi films (such as Mohabbatein of 2000), they gradually shifted [...] "to a more realist register as the framework moves from a sociology to a psychology of the family". Mazur mentioned the use of [...] "dream sequences" [...] in the film {{as a means of}} escapism. He referred to the song [...] "Suraj Hua Maddham" [...] as an extradiegetic sequence that allowed Rahul and Anjali to be physically intimate [...] "in ways that they could not in <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> the film." [...] He added that the characters conveyed a plethora of emotions not through extensive dialogue but through the exchange of glances, which were demonstrated by extreme close-ups on their eyes.|$|E

500|$|Persona 4 blends {{traditional}} RPG gameplay with simulation elements. The player {{controls the}} game's protagonist, {{a teenage boy}} who is named by the player, who comes {{to the town of}} Inaba for a year. Gameplay is divided between <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> Inaba, where the protagonist carries out his daily life, and the mysterious [...] "TV World", where various dungeons filled with monsters known as Shadows await. With the exception of scripted events, such as plot progression or special events, players can choose to spend their day how they like, be it participating in various real world activities, such as joining school clubs, taking part-time jobs, or reading books, or exploring the TV World's dungeons to gain experience and items. Days are broken up into various times of day, the most frequently recurring being [...] "After School/Daytime" [...] and [...] "Evening", with most activities causing time to move on. Certain activities are limited depending on the time of day, days of the week, and the weather, with most evening activities unavailable if the player visits the TV World that day. Furthermore, some activities and dialogue choices may be limited by the protagonist's five attributes; Understanding, Diligence, Courage, Knowledge, and Expression, which can be increased by performing certain activities that build them. Whilst the player is free to choose how to spend their time, if they fail to rescue someone who is trapped in the TV World by the time fog appears in town, which takes place after several days of consecutive rain, that person will get killed by the shadows and the game will end, forcing the player to return to a week prior. As the game progresses, the protagonist forms friendships with other characters known as [...] "Social Links", which are each represented by one of the Major Arcana. As these bonds strengthen, the Social Links increase in Rank, which grant bonuses when creating new Personas in the Velvet Room. Additionally, strengthening Social Links with the main party members grant them additional abilities, such as the ability to perform a follow-up attack or an additional ability for their Persona.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Plautus, Rome was expanding, and having much success in Greece. W.S.

2500|$|Advancing optical {{spectroscopy}} {{was identified}} as a high priority by a National Science Foundation workshop in supporting counterterrorism and general intelligence community needs. These needs were seen as most critical in the WMD context. The highest priority was increasing the sensitivity of spectroscopic scanners, since, if an attack has not actually taken place, the threat needs to be analyzed remotely. In <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> attempting early warning, expecting to get a signature of something, which is clearly a weapon, is unrealistic. Consider that the worst chemical poisoning in history was an industrial accident, the Bhopal disaster. The participants suggested that the [...] "intelligence community must exploit signatures of feedstock materials, precursors, by-products of testing or production, and other inadvertent or unavoidable signatures." [...] False positives are inevitable, and other techniques need to screen them out.|$|E

The work was drawn primarily by Garry Leach and Alan Davis. The third series that Moore produced for Warrior was The Bojeffries Saga, a comedy about a working-class English family of vampires and werewolves, drawn by Steve Parkhouse. Warrior closed before these stories were completed, but under new publishers both Miracleman and V for Vendetta were resumed by Moore, who finished both stories by 1989. Moore's biographer Lance Parkin remarked that [...] "reading them through together throws up some interesting contrasts – in one the hero fights a fascist dictatorship based in London, in the other an Aryan superman imposes one." ...|$|E
