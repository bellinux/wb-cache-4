Kelly and Kate had gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him.

5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or <b>two</b> <b>drinks</b> for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, in Southeast Asia, Red Bull and Krating Daeng {{are often}} {{confused}} as both use the Red Bull name in their packaging, {{although they are}} two separate products aimed at different markets. The main difference is that Red Bull comes in a tall blue and silver can while the Thailand Red Bull, or Krating Daeng, is in a smaller gold can. The <b>two</b> <b>drinks</b> also differ in terms of taste —- Red Bull has less sugar and is carbonated. The flavouring used for Red Bull is still produced in Bangkok and exported worldwide.|$|E
25|$|With firmer {{ground the}} pedrails {{came off the}} guns and their teams of eight and ten horses were reduced to six. It also became {{possible}} to use wheeled vehicles, and in January the War Office agreed to the infantry divisions being re-equipped with wheeled transport trains. These were to replace camel transport, {{on the condition that}} drivers would be found locally, as no transfers from other campaigns were possible. Although camel trains remained important throughout the war, together with pack mules and donkeys, where roads were bad and in hilly trackless terrain, where the horse-drawn and mule-drawn wagons, motor lorries and tractors could not go, they began to be replaced. General service and limber wagons drawn by horses or mules were grouped in supply columns, with the transport wagons of the regiments, the machine–gun squadrons, and the field ambulances, to travel on easier but less direct routes. However, all these animals required vast quantities of food and water, which greatly increased pressure on the lines of communication. During the advance across the Sinai, although it was established that horses did better with <b>two</b> <b>drinks</b> a day instead of three, the volume remained the same.|$|E

500|$|At a coroner's inquest, several {{witnesses}} had {{testified that}} they saw Shay shoot Euell after an argument over a sugar bowl.

At trial, Anderson said that Shay had <b>two</b> <b>drinks</b> at the cafe. She said that Euell had been staring at her, was rude to them and lunged toward Shay before the shooting. The cafe's manager said that Euell had not been rude to Shay. Two waiters denied that Euell had lunged at Shay. A cashier testified that when Shay asked for sugar, Euell pointed out that there was already some on his table, but he brought two more bowls. She said that Shay called Euell [...] "smarty" [...] and confronted Euell with the gun while the waiter was walking away. Shay denied being drunk and said that Euell hit him and threatened to kill him before the shooting.|$|E
500|$|Visitors to the Stonewall Inn in 1969 {{were greeted}} by a bouncer who {{inspected}} them through a peephole in the door. The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called [...] "Lily Law", [...] "Alice Blue Gown", or [...] "Betty Badge"), visitors {{would have to be}} known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for <b>two</b> <b>drinks.</b> Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private [...] "bottle club", but rarely signed their real names. There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or black lights. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching. In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by [...] "queens"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go. Only a few transvestites, or men in full drag, were allowed in by the bouncers. The customers were [...] "98 percent male" [...] but a few lesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless adolescent males, who slept in nearby Christopher Park, would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks. The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens and early thirties, and the racial mix was evenly distributed among white, black, and Hispanic patrons. Because of its even mix of people, its location, and the attraction of dancing, the Stonewall Inn was known by many as [...] "the gay bar in the city".|$|E

This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard; a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voice-over explains: [...] "Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers." [...] During this voice-over, Steed pours <b>two</b> <b>drinks</b> from the wine bottle and Mrs Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together. Fade to black and then the opening titles proper begin.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1951, the mufti of Egypt {{issued a}} fatwa stating that both Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola were {{permissible}} for Muslims to drink. [...] In order {{to arrive at}} that decision, the Department of Fatwas had the Ministry of Public Health analyze {{the composition of the}} <b>two</b> <b>drinks.</b> [...] As they did not find the pepsin or any narcotic or alcoholic substances to be present, nor any [...] "microbes harmful to health," [...] the mufti found that it was not forbidden under Islamic law. [...] Occasionally the debate regarding whether or not Coca-Cola or Pepsi is drinkable by Muslims does continue to appear, notably recently in 2012 when a French study was released declaring that Coca-Cola contained a small amount of alcohol. Muslims are not permitted to drink alcohol, however the amount of alcohol found in the beverage was discovered so small as to be permissible according to the fatwa system.|$|E

2500|$|In {{less than}} a century, the {{one-time}} province was named [...] "Gothia", by authors including the 4th-century Orosius. The existence of Christian communities in Gothia is attested by the Passion of [...] Sabbas, [...] "a Goth by race" [...] and by the martyrologies of Wereka and Batwin, and other Gothic Christians. Large number of Goths, Taifali, and according to Zosimus [...] "other tribes that formerly dwelt among them" [...] were admitted into the Eastern Roman Empire following {{the invasion of the}} Huns in 376. In contrast with these peoples, the Carpo-Dacians [...] "were mixed with the Huns". Priscus of Panium, who visited the Hunnic Empire in 448, wrote that the empire's inhabitants spoke either Hunnic or Gothic, and that those who had [...] "commercial dealings with the western Romans" [...] also spoke Latin. He also mentions the local name of <b>two</b> <b>drinks,</b> medos and kam. Emperor Diocletian's Edict on Prices states that the Pannonians had a drink named kamos. Medos may have also been an Illyrian term, but a Germanic explanation cannot be excluded.|$|E
2500|$|The more alcohol a woman drinks, {{the more}} likely she is to get breast cancer. [...] The {{relationship}} is linear and dose-dependent. [...] Even low levels of alcohol consumption carry some risk. [...] A {{study of more than}} one million middle-aged British women concluded that each daily alcoholic beverage increases the incidence of breast cancer by 11 cases per 1000 women. This means that among a group of 1000 women who drink one alcoholic beverage per day, they will have 11 extra cases of breast cancer when compared to a group of women who drink less than one alcoholic beverage per week; a group of 1000 women who have four drinks per day will have an extra 44 cases of breast cancer compared to non-drinkers. [...] One or <b>two</b> <b>drinks</b> each day increases the relative risk to 150% of normal, and six drinks per day increases the risk to 330% of normal. [...] Approximately 6% of breast cancers reported in the UK are due to women drinking alcohol.|$|E
2500|$|Gin {{drinking}} in England rose significantly {{after the government}} allowed unlicensed gin production, {{and at the same}} time imposed a heavy duty on all imported spirits such as French brandy. This created a larger market for poor-quality barley that was unfit for brewing beer, and in 1695-1735 thousands of gin-shops sprang up throughout England, a period known as the Gin Craze. Because of the low price of gin, when compared with other drinks available at the same time, and in the same geographic location, gin began to be consumed regularly by the poor. Of the 15,000 drinking establishments in London, not including coffee shops and drinking chocolate shops, over half were gin shops. Beer maintained a healthy reputation as it was often safer to drink the brewed ale than unclean plain water. Gin, though, was blamed for various social problems, and it may have been a factor in the higher death rates which stabilized London's previously growing population. The reputation of the <b>two</b> <b>drinks</b> was illustrated by William Hogarth in his engravings Beer Street and Gin Lane (1751), described by the BBC as [...] "arguably the most potent anti-drug poster ever conceived." [...] The negative reputation of gin survives today in the English language, in terms like [...] "gin mills" [...] or the American phrase [...] "gin joints" [...] to describe disreputable bars, or [...] "gin-soaked" [...] to refer to drunks. The epithet [...] "mother's ruin" [...] is a common British name for gin, the origin of which is the subject of ongoing debate.|$|E
