25|$|The {{target of}} the right-wing vested {{interests}} was a famous annual May Day celebration at the Portella della Ginestra. A {{few days before the}} festivities, Giuliano received a letter that was evidently the culmination of negotiations. After reading it, the bandit chieftain burned it and announced, “The hour of our liberation has come. We are going to attack the Communists, to go to fire on them on May 1 at Portella della Ginestra.” One of his bandits protested that women and children would be present. The chieftain replied that only leaders would be targeted. Giuliano's behavior before and after the armed action indicate that he believed that he and his men would be offered pardons for their crimes if all went well on May Day, an outcome ostensibly guaranteed by some prominent Sicilian. According to Giuliano's later statements, his main aim of the day was the capture of Girolamo Li Causi, head of the Communist party of Sicily—any other action was a diversionary <b>tactic</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> Li Causi's capture. Although scheduled to speak, Li Causi did not attend.|$|R
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of ladybird beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) eggs are apparently infertile-they do not develop an embryo and are consumed by larvae hatching within the egg batch. The predicted benefits of egg consumption for larvae are empirically well supported. An important question, however, remains: are these eggs a maternal strategy to feed offspring (i. e., trophic eggs) or did egg eating evolve to exploit unavoidably infertile eggs? We investigated the adaptive value of infertile eggs in laboratory experiments with multicoloured Asian ladybirds (Harmonia axyridis). Female H. axyridis were assigned to low and high resource environments for brief intervals; we predicted that <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> egg cannibalism, such as infertile egg production and hatching asynchrony, would be adopted in low food environments in which starvation risk for offspring is greater. We conducted two experiments in this manner that provided females with information about resource levels through prey feeding or scent. We also observed female oviposition patterns and tested for infertile egg distributions that departed from random. Females produced 56 % more infertile eggs in the low vs. the high food treatment; however, hatching synchrony did not change. We consider a potential confound between information and nutrition state unlikely because ladybirds are well able to tolerate low food for 24 h, the duration of trials, and because females were in good condition when trials began. Results suggest that ladybirds use information from prey encounter to manipulate the proportion of trophic eggs {{in a manner consistent}} with the adaptive hypothesis, the first evidence of trophic egg plasticity in a non-eusocial insect. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R

The terms bujutsu and bugei have more discrete definitions, at least historically speaking. Bujutsu refers specifically to the practical application of martial tactics and techniques in actual combat. Bugei refers to the adaptation or refinement of those <b>tactics</b> and techniques <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> systematic instruction and dissemination within a formal learning environment.|$|R
40|$|Girella tricuspidata {{is widely}} {{distributed}} and harvested by recreational and commercial fishers along the coastline of eastern Australia. The present study examined {{variability in the}} reproductive biology and growth of individuals within populations of G. tricuspidata across 3 estuaries (Clarence, Tuggerah and Tuross) and assessed population connectivity via a large-scale tagrecapture study in which fish were tagged across 9 estuaries. Spawning occurred predominantly between June and September in the Clarence River and between October and January in the Tuross River, suggesting that spawning occurs {{later in the year}} at higher latitudes. The recruitment of young to nursery grounds was spatially and temporally variable. G. tricuspidata are group-synchronous spawners, and the estimated batch fecundity was positively correlated with fish length. The estimated length and age at which 50 % of G. tricuspidata attained reproductive maturity was similar for both sexes: ~ 286 mm fork length (FL) and 4. 1 yr for males and 295 mm FL and 4. 5 yr for females. G. tricuspidata were aged using otoliths to > 26 yr, whereas the reading of scales consistently underestimated the age of fish older than 5 yr. Growth was flexible but varied significantly between sexes and among estuaries; females grew faster than males and attained a larger asymptotic length in the Clarence and Tuross Rivers but not in Tuggerah Lake. Growth was rapid for both sexes until 4 to 5 yr of age, after which it slowed. Of the 6871 G. tricuspidata tagged, 15 % were recaptured, with 96 % of these fish recaptured in the estuary in which they were initially tagged. The recaptured individuals that migrated between estuaries predominantly displayed a northward movement into the prevailing coastal current, which is probably a life-history <b>tactic</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> wide dispersal of eggs and larvae along eastern Australia. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Intimate partner sexual {{violence}} (IPSV) is a concerning, yet relatively understudied form of intimate partner violence (IPV). Furthermore, {{the majority of}} research regarding {{sexual violence}} fails to differentiate between different forms of control used <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> this violence. Although IPV {{has been linked to}} a multitude of adverse physical and health outcomes, it is less clear how these outcomes vary by type of control experienced. Using data from the 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS), the current study examines the physical and non-physical <b>tactics</b> used <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> sexual violence, and the associated health outcomes. Potential gender differences in tactics experienced and resulting victim health are also explored. Results show that while physical force is associated with the greatest number of health outcomes, all three <b>tactics</b> are related <b>to</b> reporting adverse health. Additionally, gender analyses reveal that {{women are more likely to}} suffer from frequent headaches, injuries, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and to report a greater number of physical health outcomes and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, while men who experienced physically forced sexual violence are more likely to report overall worse mental health than their female counterparts. These findings, along with policy implications and directions for future research, are then discussed...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 In {{the social}} context, {{distinct}} worldviews provide multiple, subjective, durable and conflicting views of natural resource situations. This research analyzes worldviews that shape people's perceptions, understandings and evaluations of forests and forestry {{in order to}} examine conflict associated with forestry issues. Differences in local residents' views of wildland fires and the fire recovery management situation affecting three communities in north central Washington are explored. In addition, insights for facilitating worldview differences that inevitably surface in value-laden natural resource conflicts emerge from this study. Data was gathered through 122 semi-structured interviews; subjects represented diverse interests, attachments and ideologies relative to forestry. A key-informant and chain-referral selection strategy accessed social networks interested in forestry management issues. Qualitative data analysis identified issues salient to fire recovery management and themes characteristic of shared forest values. Five general views of fire recovery represented the relationships between the level of human intervention in forest management strategies and the level of risk affecting the ecosystem or neighboring communities. Levels of intervention were relatively tangible, but levels of risks varied by subjective definitions of desirability. The acceptability of specific forest management tactics could be traced to different values one places on the forest and worldviews through which one sees and understands the situation. These views of fire recovery were compared to an existing typology that focused on social relationships, cultural biases and general views of nature. The five views found in the data could be explained by four universal worldviews of nature. Worldviews evolve from individual cognition and social interaction. To the extent that worldviews are value based, they tend to be distinct and enduring because values are not easily changed. Conflict grounded in worldview differences is therefore often inevitable and unresolvable. However, collaborative conflict management provides natural resource professionals with <b>tactics</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> discussion {{in the face of these}} differences and to generate improvements in the relationships and the conflict situations. Implications from this study suggest constructive conflict management and natural resource policy can accommodate worldview diversity...|$|R

40|$|Entrepreneurial {{marketing}} (EM) {{has been}} studied from diverse approaches {{over the past three}} decades. One common approach to studying EM focuses on exploring EM adoption from a firm capability perspective. Another view emphasises the role of the business context to understand EM. These diverse approaches have led to rich, yet fragmented views of EM. This thesis is built upon these debates and proposes to reconcile the dichotomy of EM research. In doing so, both the business context and firm are taken into account to provide a holistic approach to study EM. The research employed an interpretive philosophical position and qualitative research design in examining EM in the Vietnamese independent hospitality industry. A combination of purposive and snowball sampling methods was used to recruit 30 participants for in-depth interviews. Data triangulation was achieved by using observations and fieldnotes. This thesis contributes to the EM literature by applying a comprehensive approach to understand EM from a structuration perspective. The findings reveal the enabling and constraining role of business structures which results in different <b>tactics</b> firms use <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> EM; a typology of four EM scripts is developed to conceptualise various EM adoption which represent the reciprocal relationship between firms and business structures...|$|R
