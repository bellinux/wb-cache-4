5|$|At {{the police}} station, Pang {{confirms}} that Alan {{is actually an}} undercover cop. Tequila tracks Alan down to his sailboat to try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation, but the two are ambushed by the remnants of Hoi's gang. Tequila and Alan manage to kill their attackers just before Wong arrives, which allows Alan to keep his cover. Wong realizes {{that one of his}} gangsters named Foxy (Tung Wei), is an informant for the police. Foxy is beaten at the docks by Wong's henchman Mad Dog (Philip Kwok) in front of Alan and Wong. Alan then shoots Foxy in the chest, although he secretly placed a cigarette lighter in Foxy's breast pocket earlier to prevent the shot from being fatal. Foxy finds Tequila at a jazz bar and informs him that Wong's armory is in the nearby Maple Group Hospital. As Tequila takes Foxy to the hospital, Wong finds out that Foxy is alive and sends Alan to kill Foxy, as well as sending Mad Dog separately to cover Alan. At the hospital, Alan confronts Tequila, demanding to know the whereabouts of Wong's arsenal. While Alan and Tequila are distracted, Foxy is killed by Mad Dog.|$|E

25|$|The {{predominant}} {{school of}} thought in the 13th century was the Thomistic reconciliation of the teachings of Aristotle with Christian theology. The Condemnation of 1277, enacted at the University of Paris, placed restrictions on ideas that {{could be interpreted as}} heretical; restrictions that had implication for Aristotelian thought. An alternative was presented by William of Ockham, following the manner of the earlier Franciscan John Duns Scotus, who insisted that the world of reason and the world of faith had to be kept apart. Ockham introduced the principle of parsimony– or Occam's razor– whereby a simple theory is preferred to a more complex one, and speculation on unobservable phenomena is avoided. This maxim is, however, often misquoted. Occam was referring to his nominalism in this quotation. Essentially saying the theory of absolutes, or metaphysical realism, was unnecessary <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
25|$|One of the ‘B’ {{variants}} (Hill ‘6’) has a copyist’s gloss which {{proposes a}} meaning of ‘27,000 and 70 hides’ <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “27 and 70” reference: the “belong to it” {{refers to the}} entire list enumerated, a grand total. However, none of the ‘B’ lists can give us that total as they miss out between three and five burh. Therefore, the archetype of ‘B’ must have included these, as did that of ‘A’. However, by recalculating the mistranscriptions and supplying the missing burh figures from ‘A’ then the ‘restored’ total would be 28,671. Hill then turns to {{the second part of}} the final sentence “and 30 to the West Saxons”, this too is glossed as ‘30,000’ by the copyist ‘6’ so that it seems to refer to hides; but Hill proposes that it refers to the 30 burh; there are in fact 31 of these in the combined lists, but he then proposes that Buckingham (at 1600 hides) is in fact Mercian, that is not of “the West Saxons”, so is not included in the grand total. The adjusted total of 27,071 then concurs with the final ‘B’ sentence/statement.|$|E

Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued on into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host {{to walk away from the}} network. Following his Wednesday, January 20 edition, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation. Meanwhile, Ron Meyer passingly suggested to Zucker and Gaspin, based off the public outcry, that they should stick with O'Brien; the two executives agreed to send him on his way. O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.|$|E

500|$|Film theorist David Roche {{writes that}} Lynch films do not simply tell detective stories, but rather force the {{audience}} {{into the role}} of becoming detectives themselves <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narratives, and that Mulholland Drive, like other Lynch films, frustrates [...] "the spectator's need for a rational diegesis by playing on the spectator's mistake that narration is synonymous with diegesis". In Lynch's films, the spectator is always [...] "one step behind narration" [...] and thus [...] "narration prevails over diegesis". Roche also notes that there are multiple mysteries in the film that ultimately go unanswered by the characters who meet dead ends, like Betty and Rita, or give in to pressures as Adam does. Although the audience still struggles <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stories, the characters are no longer trying to solve their mysteries. Roche concludes that Mulholland Drive is a mystery film not because it allows the audience to view the solution to a question, but the film itself is a mystery that is held together [...] "by the spectator-detective's desire to make sense" [...] of it.|$|E

500|$|Contrasting {{with this}} binary division, Gardell divides Heathenry in the United States {{into three groups}} {{according}} to their stances {{on the issue of}} race: the [...] "anti-racist" [...] group which denounces any association between the religion and racial identity, the [...] "radical racist" [...] faction which sees it as the natural religion of the Aryan race that cannot rightly be followed by members of any other racial group, and the [...] "ethnic" [...] faction which seeks a middle-path by acknowledging the religion's roots in Northern Europe and its connection with those of Northern European heritage. The religious studies scholar Egil Asprem deemed Gardell's threefold typology [...] "indispensable in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diverging positions within the broader discourse" [...] of Heathenry. The religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein also adopted this tripartite division, although she referred to the groups as the [...] "racial-religious", [...] "a-racist", and [...] "ethnicist" [...] factions respectively.|$|E
500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude".

The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E

500|$|But his {{philological}} concerns {{now were}} {{only a small part}} of a much larger project <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature of the Greek culture itself. His work in this period shows a theoretical sophistication far beyond his earlier efforts, extending his theory of literacy toward a theory of culture itself. He said of the Dipylon inscription, a poetic line scratched into a vase and the earliest Greek writing known at the time, [...] "Here in this casual act by an unknown hand there is announced a revolution which was destined to change the nature of human culture." [...] It is this larger point about the differences between oral and literate culture that represents Havelock's most influential contribution. Walter J. Ong, for example, in assessing the significance of non-oral communication in an oral culture, cites Havelock's observation that scientific categories, which are necessary not only for the natural sciences but also for historical and philosophical analysis, depend on writing. These ideas were sketched out in Preface to Plato but became central to Havelock's work from Prologue to Greek Literacy (1971) onward.|$|E
500|$|As {{the title}} of the work suggests, the main theme of the novel deals with Henry Fleming's attempt to prove himself a worthy soldier by earning his [...] "red badge of courage". The first twelve chapters, until he {{receives}} his accidental wound, expose his cowardice. The following chapters detail his growth and apparently resulting heroism. Before the onset of battle, the novel's protagonist romanticized war; what little he knew about battle he learned from books: [...] "He had read of marches, sieges, conflicts, and he had longed to see it all". Therefore, when confronted by the harsh realities of war, Henry is shocked, and his idealism falters. Finding solace in existential thoughts, he internally fights <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> senseless world in which he finds himself. When he seems {{to come to terms with}} his situation, he is yet again forced into the fears of battle, which threaten to strip him of his enlightened identity. Joseph Hergesheimer wrote in his introduction to the 1925 Knopf edition of the novel that, at its heart, The Red Badge of Courage was a [...] "story of the birth, in a boy, of a knowledge of himself and of self-command." ...|$|E
500|$|Verbal {{report is}} widely {{considered}} to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues. [...] For one thing, if verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other branches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected. [...] Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology, which means treating verbal reports as stories {{that may or may not}} be true, but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted. [...] Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language: [...] this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language. [...] As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may feel that it is possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely: [...] a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.|$|E
