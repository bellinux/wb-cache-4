5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him {{to believe that he}} was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At <b>times</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> malleable, yet at <b>times</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known as}} the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E

5|$|Cassel (from Flemish; Kassel {{in modern}} Dutch spelling) is a commune in the Nord départment in {{northern}} France. Built on a prominent hill overlooking French Flanders, {{the town has}} existed since Roman <b>times.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> developed by the Romans into an important urban centre and {{was the focus of}} a network of roads, which are still in use today, that converge on the hill. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Cassel became an important fortified stronghold for the rulers of Flanders which was repeatedly fought over before finally being annexed to France in the 17th century. It was the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during part of the First World War. In 1940, during the German invasion of France, Cassel was the scene of a fierce three-day battle between British and German forces which resulted in much of the town being destroyed.|$|E

The phrase was simplified to cuprum, hence the English copper. Aphrodite (Venus in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients {{were associated with the}} seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.|$|E

The functions of the municipality are devolved into six departments: General administration/personnel, Engineering, Revenue, Public Health, Town planning and IT.

The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen.

Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap <b>times.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> held in overcast weather conditions.

5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have been}} known since ancient times; salt (sodium chloride) {{has been an important}} commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word salary, referring to salarium, money paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt. While potash has been used since ancient <b>times,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.|$|E
5|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} in the Indian subcontinent since ancient <b>times.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening {{in most parts of}} the world.

Different species seem to have originated from different locations with Saccharum barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming from New Guinea. One of the earliest historical references to sugarcane is in Chinese manuscripts dating back to 8th century BC that state that the use of sugarcane originated in India.|$|E

During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|E

The morning of 6 May 1945 two K-Class blimps from Lakehurst, New Jersey, K-16 and K-58, joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers. K-16 also attacked with 7.2-inch rocket bombs. Numerous depth charge and hedgehog attacks from Atherton and Moberly resulted in planking, life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap floating to the surface. With the loss of all 55 officers and men, U-853 {{was one of the last}} U-boats sunk during World War II. and, with , the last to be sunk in US waters.
