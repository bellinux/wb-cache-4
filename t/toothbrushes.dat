25|$|In Europe, William Addis of England is {{believed}} to have produced the first mass produced toothbrush in 1780. In 1770, he had been jailed for causing a riot. While in prison he decided that using a rag with soot and salt on the teeth was ineffective and could be improved. After saving a small bone from a meal, he drilled small holes into the bone and tied into the bone tufts of bristles that he had obtained from one of the guards, passed the tufts of bristle through the holes in the bone and sealed the holes with glue. After his release, he became wealthy after starting a business manufacturing <b>toothbrushes.</b> He died in 1808, bequeathing the business to his eldest son. It remained within family ownership until 1996. Under the name Wisdom <b>Toothbrushes,</b> the company now manufactures 70 million <b>toothbrushes</b> per year in the UK. By 1840 <b>toothbrushes</b> were being mass produced in England, France, Germany, and Japan. Pig bristles were used for cheaper <b>toothbrushes</b> and badger hair for the more expensive ones.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: The thesis {{explored}} {{influences on}} emergence of <b>toothbrushing</b> as a dyadic process through infancy with influences conceptualised throughout using Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model. Influences {{were used to}} develop methods to support novice mothers {{to establish and maintain}} <b>toothbrushing</b> routines with infants. METHODS: Study One: Qualitative interview study with novice mothers of infants exploring influences on emergence of dyadic <b>toothbrushing</b> routines (n= 16). Study Two: Using collected qualitative data to develop and standardise a psychometric scale measuring parental self-efficacy (PSE) for enforcing <b>toothbrushing</b> routines with infants (n= 91). Study Three: Cross-sectional observational study of dyadic interactions during <b>toothbrushing</b> episodes, using three age groups of infant, 12 -months, 18 -months and 24 -months (each n= 12). Study Four: Development and evaluation of an intervention to increase maternal control of the brush dyadic <b>toothbrushing</b> using three study groups (each n= 11). RESULTS: Study One: A total of 25 influences on emergence of dyadic <b>toothbrushing</b> were identified. Many of these influences were identified as lying within the mother-infant dyad. Study Two: Scale items were generated from the 25 sub-themes identified from the qualitative study. Overall reliability of the scale was α=. 934 and it was found to contain five components. Study Three: Significant differences (p <. 001) were found between the three groups in frequency and duration of maternal and infant control of holding and using the <b>toothbrush</b> during observed episodes. Study Four: The picture book intervention did not significantly affect frequency and duration of either maternal or infant control of holding and using the <b>toothbrush</b> during observed episodes. Conclusion: Many influences on emergence of dyadic <b>toothbrushing</b> come from the mother-infant dyad. Some may pose challenges, such as infant drive for self-toothbrushing. However, some influences such as PSE may facilitate the routine. Further work should focus on supporting caregivers to maintain control of holding and using the <b>toothbrush</b> during dyadic <b>toothbrushing...</b>|$|R

25|$|Because enamel is {{vulnerable}} to demineralization, prevention of tooth decay {{is the best way}} to maintain the health of teeth. Most countries have wide use of <b>toothbrushes,</b> which can reduce the number of dental biofilm and food particles on enamel. In isolated societies that do not have access to <b>toothbrushes,</b> it is common for those people to use other objects, such as sticks, to clean their teeth. In between two adjacent teeth, floss is used to wipe the enamel surfaces free of plaque and food particles to discourage bacterial growth. Although neither floss nor <b>toothbrushes</b> can penetrate the deep grooves and pits of enamel, good general oral-health habits can usually prevent enough bacterial growth to keep tooth decay from starting. Genetic variations, in humans, might contribute to the intrinsic structural integrity of the enamel, and to its predisposition to demineralization or attack from bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Dental {{implants}} {{have increased}} the use of titanium and titanium alloys in prosthetic applications. Whitening toothpastes with peroxides are available for patients with high aesthetic requirements, but the effect of whitening toothpastes on titanium surfaces is not yet known, although titanium is prone to fluoride ion attack. Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study was to compare Ti- 5 Ta alloy to cp Ti after <b>toothbrushing</b> with whitening and conventional toothpastes. Ti- 5 Ta (%wt) alloy was melted in an arc melting furnace and compared with cp Ti. Disks and <b>toothbrush</b> heads were embedded in PVC rings to be mounted onto a <b>toothbrushing</b> test apparatus. A total of 260, 000 cycles were carried out at 250 cycles/minute under a load of 5 N on samples immersed in toothpaste slurries. Surface roughness and Vickers microhardness were evaluated before and after <b>toothbrushing.</b> One sample of each material/toothpaste was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and compared with a sample that had not been submitted to <b>toothbrushing.</b> Surface roughness increased significantly after <b>toothbrushing,</b> but no differences were noted after <b>toothbrushing</b> with different toothpastes. <b>Toothbrushing</b> did not significantly affect sample microhardness. The results suggest that toothpastes that contain and those that do not contain peroxides in their composition have different effects on cp Ti and Ti- 5 Ta surfaces. Although no significant difference was noted in the microhardness and roughness of the surfaces brushed with different toothpastes, both toothpastes increased roughness after <b>toothbrushing.</b> FAPESP [2010 / 07312 - 0...|$|R

25|$|Modern {{toothbrush}} {{originated in}} China. The first bristle toothbrush resembling the modern one {{was found in}} China. Used during the Tang Dynasty (619–907), it consisted of hog bristles. The bristles were sourced from hogs living in Siberia and northern China because the colder temperatures provided firmer bristles. They were attached to a handle manufactured from bamboo or bone, forming a toothbrush. In 1223, Japanese Zen master Dōgen Kigen recorded on Shōbōgenzō that he saw monks in China clean their teeth with brushes made of horsetail hairs attached to an oxbone handle. The bristle toothbrush spread to Europe, brought from China to Europe by travellers. It was adopted in Europe during the 17th century. The earliest identified {{use of the word}} toothbrush in English was in the autobiography of Anthony Wood who wrote in 1690 that he had bought a toothbrush from J. Barret. Europeans found the hog bristle <b>toothbrushes</b> imported from China too firm and preferred softer bristle <b>toothbrushes</b> made from horsehair.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was the {{evaluation}} of the dental plaque and the influence of determined hygienic factors on gingival recession occurrence in 455 students of The Medical University of Białystok. All the subjects were examined in artificial light, with the use of the probe, mirror, and parodontometer. The distribution of stained dental deposits were estimated with the use of the plaque index according to Quigley and Hein. Moreover, the students were to fill a survey of their own project concerning hygienic habits. The results underwent statistical analysis. The dental plaque was not present in 71 people. Gingival recession was revealed in 134 out of 455 subjects.
