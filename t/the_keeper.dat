5|$|United States Life-Saving Service District 9 {{opened a}} {{life-saving}} station at Presque Isle in 1876. William Clark was <b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> from 1877 until he drowned in 1891. He was succeeded by Andrew Jansen, who was <b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> until 1914. When the Life-Saving Service and the Revenue Cutter Service merged in 1915 {{to become the}} United States Coast Guard, LSS Presque Isle, also called the Erie life-saving station, became Coast Guard Station #236. The station, still in operation, is assigned to the Ninth District of the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Lambert {{was born}} at his parents' house in Blue Boar Lane, Leicester, on 13 March 1770. His father, also named Daniel Lambert, had been the huntsman to Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford, {{and at the time}} of his son's birth was <b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> of Leicester's gaol. The eldest of four children, Daniel Lambert had two sisters, and a brother who died young.|$|E
5|$|The show {{moved from}} its {{traditional}} once-weekly Saturday broadcast to being broadcast twice-weekly primarily on Monday and Tuesday, {{although there were}} regional variations to the schedule. Castrovalva, together with the previous two serials, <b>The</b> <b>Keeper</b> of Traken and Logopolis, form a trilogy involving {{the return of the}} Master. They were released on DVD under the banner title New Beginnings.|$|E

5|$|According to {{traditional}} accounts, Laozi was a scholar {{who worked as}} <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> of the Archives for the royal court of Zhou. This reportedly allowed him broad access to {{the works of the}} Yellow Emperor and other classics of the time. The stories assert that Laozi never opened a formal school but nonetheless attracted a large number of students and loyal disciples. There are many variations of a story retelling his encounter with Confucius, most famously in the Zhuangzi.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Jingeling, <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> of the Keys to Santa's Workshop, {{was created}} in 1956 as a radio {{spokesman}} to promote the toys sold at Halle's Department Store in Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Jingeling was immediately popular and became an annual fixture at Halle's where he prowled the seventh floor toy department entertaining shoppers. The costumed character was first played by Max Ellis, a Cleveland Play House actor, and then by Earl W. Keyes, a television producer and director, who remained with the role for many years. In addition to his department store duties, Mr. Jingeling appeared on a local children's television program telling stories, singing songs, and reminding viewers to visit Halle's.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of London, the rebels {{approached}} Smithfield and Clerkenwell Priory, the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller which was headed by Hales. The priory was destroyed, along with the nearby manor. Heading west along Fleet Street, the rebels attacked the Temple, a complex of legal buildings and offices owned by the Hospitallers. The contents, books and paperwork were brought out and burned in the street, and the buildings systematically demolished. Meanwhile, John Fordham, <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> of the Privy Seal and one of the men on the rebels' execution list, narrowly escaped when the crowds ransacked his accommodation but failed to notice he was still in the building.|$|E

50|$|The {{staff of}} the station {{consisted}} of a head keeper and three assistant <b>keepers.</b> <b>The</b> families of <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> lived with them at the station. The Station had a residence for <b>the</b> head <b>keeper</b> and his family, and another for <b>the</b> assistant <b>keepers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>keeper's</b> {{house and}} {{lighthouse}} is protected as a culturally important building since 1978. Today <b>the</b> <b>keeper's</b> {{house is a}} private residence to an artist and contains an art studio and showroom.|$|R
5|$|Ranulf Flambard (c. 1060– 5 September 1128) was {{a medieval}} Norman Bishop of Durham and an {{influential}} government minister of King William Rufus of England. Ranulf {{was the son}} of a priest of Bayeux, Normandy, and his nickname Flambard means incendiary or torch-bearer, and may have referred to his personality. He started his career under King William I of England, probably in the compilation of the Domesday Book, as well as being <b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> of the king's seal. On the death of William I, Ranulf chose to serve the new king of England, William Rufus.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Keeper</b> or Master of the Rolls and Records of the Chancery of England, {{known as}} the Master of the Rolls, {{is the second most}} senior judge in England and Wales after the Lord Chief Justice, and serves as President of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal and Head of Civil Justice. The {{position}} dates from at least 1286, although it is believed that the office probably existed earlier than that.|$|E
5|$|The National Gallery {{opened to}} the public on 10 May 1824, housed in Angerstein's former townhouse at No. 100 Pall Mall. Angerstein's {{paintings}} were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont's collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend William Holwell Carr's bequest of 35 paintings. Initially <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> of Paintings, William Seguier, bore the burden of managing the Gallery, but in July 1824 some of this responsibility fell to the newly formed board of trustees.|$|E

50|$|Spring Break for <b>the</b> <b>Keepers</b> means a DHI cruise from Florida {{through the}} Panama canal to Los Angeles, with stops in exotic {{locations}} including Castaway Key, Disney's private island. However, for <b>the</b> <b>Keepers</b> <b>the</b> vacation {{may not be}} as much of a break as they'd hoped. With an ongoing battle for Walt Disney World's engineering base back home and Overtakers aboard the ship plotting something catastrophic, <b>the</b> <b>Keepers</b> are in a battle for their lives and the lives of the guests aboard the ship.|$|R
50|$|A sixteen-foot covered {{passageway}} connected the tower to <b>the</b> two story <b>keeper’s</b> dwelling, allowing for extra protection when <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> {{would go to}} the tower in harsh weather. A full cellar was built under the house, and here <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> would store personal items as well as oil for the lamp.|$|R
5|$|The castle {{was last}} {{referred}} to in active use in 1316, after which it was probably allowed to decay; further stonework was taken by <b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> of Rockingham Forest in 1373, by which time the castle had probably been abandoned. By the 15th century, Sauvey formed a subsidiary property of Withcote manor - {{a reversal of the}} old land holding pattern. Its structures had mostly been dismantled or destroyed by 1622 and had gone entirely {{by the end of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|The first Hispanic {{to serve}} in the United States Revenue Cutter Service, {{predecessor}} to the Coast Guard, was Juan Andreu who from 1824 to 1845 served as <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> of the St. Augustine Lighthouse in Florida, thus making him also the first Hispanic to oversee a U.S. federal installation of any kind. Maria Andreu (a.k.a. Maria Mestre de los Dolores), a family member, followed in his footsteps and served as Keeper of the same lighthouse from 1859 to 1862, becoming the first Hispanic-American woman {{to serve in}} the Coast Guard (USRCS) and the first Hispanic-American woman to command a U.S. federal shore installation.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, a {{decision}} was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal again went on {{the attack}} as the second half began, with another corner won {{following}} a header by Buchan. Hulme drifted in a well placed cross, but nothing was made of it. It was then Cardiff's turn to attack. Curtis sent in a low shot which was saved by Lewis in the Arsenal goal. Shortly afterwards, Butler, the Arsenal midfielder, was struck hard in the face by the ball causing a brief delay to play. The game resumed, and McLachlan took it down the wing for Cardiff, who passed it to Davies, but his shot was just wide of the post. Buchan attempted to return the game to Arsenal's tempo, with a long pass to the left wing for Hoar, but Cardiff City's James Nelson had him covered. City's attacking continued, and a chance was had by Hardy which appeared to shake Lewis in goal as <b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> didn't gather the ball cleanly.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{technical}} knowledge, {{the most important}} officers were the three Prothonotaries, {{the first and third}} of whom were appointed by the Chief Justice and the second by the Chief Justice on the advice of the Custos Brevium. They were responsible for enrolling records of litigation, including anything that raised a point of law, and were often consulted by the court due to their detailed technical knowledge. The Chief Justice also appointed the Clerk of the Warrants, Clerk of the Treasury (also known as the Clerk of Hell), <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> of the Seal, the Clerk of Essoins and the Clerk of Acknowledgments of Fines and Recoveries (who was officially the Chief Justice's own clerk, rather than that of the court), as well as other officials. The Custos Brevium appointed the Clerk of the Juries, responsible for issuing writs of Habeas Corpus.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, <b>the</b> <b>keeper,</b> Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
50|$|About 16-18 {{specimens}} (excluding subfossil bones) are now known. They {{were collected}} by <b>the</b> lighthouse <b>keeper's</b> cat, by <b>the</b> <b>keepers,</b> and by professional collectors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} was operated {{and maintained}} by <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> whose responsibility included operation of fog signals found {{located on the}} northern and southern tips of the island. The prison guards facilitated <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> to blow <b>the</b> fog horns as they were in advantageous position stationed on the elevated watch towers; the guards who were in position to see [...] "a bank of fog started to roll through the Golden Gate", would inform notify <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> so that <b>the</b> fog horns could be activated.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt of}} it. <b>The</b> <b>keepers</b> and kept were soon made to {{exchange}} places. Not that exactly either--for the madmen had been free, but <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> were shut up in cells forthwith, and treated, I {{am sorry to}} say, in a very cavalier manner." ...|$|R
5|$|Edward {{had managed}} this last {{category}} of personal treasure through an organisation called the Privy Wardrobe. <b>The</b> <b>Keeper</b> of the Privy Wardrobe {{was responsible for}} guarding and recording the king's belongings, and dispatching particular items around the kingdom, potentially giving them as gifts to the monarch's family and friends. The Privy Wardrobe was initially based in the Tower of London in Edward's reign and became focused on handling the supplies for his campaigns in France. This probably encouraged the King to decide {{to build a new}} tower in Westminster to host a separate branch of the Privy Wardrobe specifically to manage his personal jewels and plate. In practice, this branch also managed the clothes, vestments and similar goods belonging to the royal household– effectively, the non-military parts of the King's property.|$|E
5|$|Frederic G. Kenyon {{opposed to}} the Burkit's view and argued that Cyril firmly {{believed}} in the Egyptian origin of the codex. A. S. Fulton, <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> of the Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts (in British Museum), in 1938 re-examined the Athanasius note, and gave it as his opinion that on palaeographical grounds it could be dated 13th to 14th century and that the 17th century was excluded. In 1945 T. D. Moschonas published a catalogue of the library of the Patriarch of Alexandria, in which he printed two Greek notes, both from 10th-century manuscripts of John Chrysostom, inserted by the Patriarch Athanasius III. The two notes must have been written between 1308 and 1316. Although the note in the Codex Alexandrinus is entirely in Arabic, and therefore no identity of hand the Greek notes can be expected, the similarity of wording leaves no doubt that this also {{is the work of}} Athanasius III.|$|E
5|$|Her {{husband was}} removed from office by the Texas Secession Convention for refusing to swear loyalty to the Confederacy. Margaret became a war-time mother, whose eldest son joined the Confederate Army and was taken {{prisoner}} at the Battle of Shiloh. Her husband died {{before the end of}} the war. In her few remaining years, she became <b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> of the Sam Houston legacy and opened his records to a trusted biographer. When she died of yellow fever four and a half years later, Margaret could not be buried with her husband in a public cemetery in Huntsville for fear of contamination, and was instead interred next to her mother on private property.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} was automated in 1987 and in 2002 <b>the</b> lighthouse <b>keeper</b> {{position was}} eliminated and the lighthouse is now controlled electronically from the mainland. In January 2005, a severe storm breached the bulkhead wall and destroyed <b>the</b> <b>keeper's</b> house. After <b>the</b> <b>keeper's</b> house was repaired its ownership {{was transferred to}} the local Austevoll municipality. A hotel now operates the facility as a dependency.|$|R
