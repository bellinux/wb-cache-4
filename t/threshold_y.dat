40|$|To derive O- 3 dose {{response}} relationships (DRR) {{for five}} European forest trees species and broadleaf deciduous and needleleaf tree plant functional types (PFTs), phytotoxic O- 3 doses (PODy) were related to biomass reductions. PODy was calculated using a stomatal flux model {{with a range of}} cut-off <b>thresholds</b> (<b>y)</b> indicative of varying detoxification capacities. Linear regression analysis showed that DRR for PFT and individual tree species differed in their robustness. A simplified parameterisation of the flux model was tested and showed that for most non-Mediterranean tree species, this simplified model led to similarly robust DRR as compared to a species- and climate region-specific parameterisation. Experimentally induced soil water stress was not found to substantially reduce PODy, mainly due to the short duration of soil water stress periods. This study validates the stomata O- 3 flux concept and represents a step forward in predicting O- 3 damage to forests in a spatially and temporally varying climate.

40|$|Two {{different}} indices {{have been}} proposed for estimation of the risk caused to forest trees across Europe by ground-level ozone, (i) the concentration based AOT 40 index (Accumulated Over a Threshold of 40 ppb) and (ii) the recently developed flux based AFstY index (Accumulated stomatal Flux above a flux <b>threshold</b> <b>Y).</b> This paper compares the AOT 40 and AFstY indices for three forest trees species at different locations in Europe. The AFstY index is estimated using the DO 3 SE (Deposition of Ozone and Stomatal Exchange) model parameterized for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and holm oak (Quercus ilex). The results show a large difference in the perceived O 3 risk when using AOT 40 and AFstY indices both between species and regions. The AOT 40 index shows a strong north-south gradient across Europe, whereas there is little difference between regions in the modelled values of AFstY. There are significant differences in modelled AFstY between species, which are predominantly determined by differences in the timing and length of the growing season, the periods during which soil moisture deficit limits stomatal conductance, and adaptation to soil moisture stress. This {{emphasizes the importance of}} defining species-specific flux response variables to obtain a more accurate quantification of O 3 risk. A new flux-based model provides a revised assessment of risks of ozone impacts to European forests. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Unfairness among {{best-effort}} flows is {{a serious}} problem on the Internet. In particular, UDP flows or unresponsive flows that do not obey the TCP flow control mechanism can consume a large share of the available bandwidth. High-rate flows seriously affect other flows, so it is important to identify them and limit their throughput by selectively dropping their packets. As link transmission capacity increases and the number of active flows increases, however, capturing all packet information becomes more difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel method of identifying high-rate flows by using sampled packets. The proposed method simply identifies flows from which Y packets are sampled without timeout. The identification principle is very simple and the implementation is easy. We derive the identification probability for flows with arbitrary flow rates and obtain an identification curve that clearly demonstrates the accuracy of identification. The characteristics of this method are determined by three parameters: the identification <b>threshold</b> <b>Y,</b> the timeout coefficient K, and the sampling interval N. To match the experimental identification probability to the theoretical one and to simplify the identification mechanism, we should set K to the maximum allowable value. Although increasing Y improves the identification accuracy, both the required memory size and the processing power grow as Y increases. Numerical evaluation using an actual packet trace demonstrated that the proposed method achieves very high identification accuracy with a much simpler mechanism than that of previously proposed methods.

Small increases in [pi]m (0. 1 MPa) temporarily decreased P and growth, which recovered fully in 5 to 10 min. Under stronger [pi]m (up to 0. 6 MPa), elongation stopped {{for up to}} 30 min and then resumed at lower rates. Recoveries in P through solute accumulation and lowering of Y enabled growth under water stress. P recovery was as much as 0. 3 MPa at [pi]m = 0. 6 MPa, but recovery rate declined as water stress increased, suggesting turgor-sensitive solute transport into the growth zone. Under strong [pi]m, P did not recover in the basal part of the growth zone, {{in conjunction with a}} 30 % shortening of the growth zone. Time courses showed Y beginning to decrease within several minutes after stress imposition, from about 0. 65 MPa to a minimum of about 0. 3 MPa in about 15 min.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} changes in ozone {{precursor}} emissions as well as climate change on the future ozone exposure of the vegetation in Europe were investigated. The ozone exposure is expressed as AOT 40 (Accumulated exposure Over a Threshold of 40 ppb O 3) as well as POD Y (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above a <b>threshold</b> <b>Y).</b> A new method is suggested to express how {{the length of the}} period during the year when coniferous and evergreen trees are sensitive to ozone might be affected by climate change. Ozone precursor emission changes from the RCP 4. 5 scenario were combined with climate simulations based on the IPCC SRES A 1 B scenario and used as input to the Eulerian Chemistry Transport Model MATCH from which projections of ozone concentrations were derived. The ozone exposure of vegetation over Europe expressed as AOT 40 was projected to be substantially reduced between the periods 1990 – 2009 and 2040 – 2059 to levels which are well below critical levels used for vegetation in the EU directive 2008 / 50 /EC as well as for crops and forests used in the LRTAP convention, despite that the future climate resulted in prolonged yearly ozone sensitive periods. The reduction in AOT 40 was mainly driven by the emission reductions, not changes in the climate. For the toxicologically more relevant POD 1 index the projected reductions were smaller, but still significant. The values for POD 1 for the time period 2040 – 2059 were not projected to decrease to levels which are below critical levels for forest trees, represented by Norway spruce. This study shows that substantial reductions of ozone precursor emissions have the potential to strongly reduce the future risk for ozone effects on the European vegetation, even if concurrent climate change promotes ozone formation...|$|E
40|$|Ground-level ozone (O 3) is a harmful air {{pollutant}} causing reduced crop yield and quality, reduced forest growth and {{negative effects on}} human health in {{large parts of the}} world. O 3 is generally seen as a regional scale air pollution problem, but O 3 concentration ([O 3]) variation on a smaller geographical scale can be considerable. Knowledge of the size of this local scale variation and the underlying causes is important in environmental monitoring and assessments of O 3 exposure. The local scale variation in [O 3] in Sweden was investigated and described in relation to local climate and site characteristics such as altitude, topography, vicinity to the coast and local NO emissions based on measurements of [O 3] and meteorology with a mobile monitoring station. In addition, [O 3] and [NO 2] were measured with passive diffusion samplers and [O 3] data from permanent monitoring stations were analysed. The strength of nocturnal temperature inversions was found to be crucial in determining the differences in average [O 3] and diurnal [O 3] range (DOR) at rural sites in southern Sweden. Inland low sites experienced stronger nocturnal temperature inversions, lower average [O 3] and larger DOR compared to inland high and coastal sites. In addition, the underlying surface (important for the deposition rate), advection of O 3 -rich marine air and local NO emissions also influence the local scale variation of [O 3]. The negative effects of O 3 on vegetation are more closely related to the plant uptake of O 3 through the stomata than to the [O 3] in the ambient air. Environmental factors such as humidity, temperature and light, influence the degree of stomatal opening and thus the stomatal O 3 flux into the leaf interior. The flux-based PODY-index (phytotoxic O 3 dose above a flux <b>threshold</b> <b>Y)</b> was used to assess the O 3 risk for vegetation. It allows modification of O 3 uptake by climatic conditions to be incorporated in O 3 risk assessment for vegetation. A large part of the local scale variation in [O 3] in southern Sweden occurs during night-time. At night the stomatal O 3 uptake by vegetation is low and the risk of O 3 damage is therefore not greatly influenced. Thus, plant stomatal O 3 uptake and O 3 risk for vegetation are less influenced by the site position in the landscape than 24 -hour average [O 3]. At the coastal sites the [O 3] were higher also during daytime, which implies an increased risk of negative effects of O 3 on vegetation compared to inland sites. The influence of potential future climate change on the flux-based risk of negative effects of O 3 on vegetation in Europe was investigated with modelled future [O 3] from the chemistry transport model MATCH and meteorology from the regional climate model RCA 3. The future plant O 3 uptake and risk of O 3 damage to vegetation was predicted to remain unchanged or decrease in Europe, despite substantially increased modelled [O 3] in Central and Southern Europe. The expected reduction in stomatal conductance with rising atmospheric [CO 2] is of large importance for this result. However, the magnitude of the CO 2 effect is uncertain, especially for trees. If the CO 2 effect {{will turn out to be}} small, future climate change has the potential to dramatically increase the flux-based O 3 risk for vegetation in Northern and Central Europe...|$|E

In recent years the eastern Australia state power networks have been connected across state boundaries in order to improve robustness under increasing load demands and deliver power at competitive prices. However, this interconnectivity is likely to increase susceptibility of the network to space weather. Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) flow in power transmission lines as the result of “geoelectric” fields and their associated geomagnetic field variations according to Faraday's Law. In this paper previously documented occurrences of GIC activity from regions around the world are investigated and categorized by their effects on nearby power networks. A frequency domain filter that produces an index representing GIC activity is applied to geomagnetic field data recorded at locations near the documented GIC activity to determine risk level “GIC index” thresholds. Geomagnetic field data from the Australian region are processed using the “GIC filter” to provide a preliminary risk assessment of space weather related GIC activity to the Australian power network.

Ground-level O 3 is known to adversely affect O 3 -sensitive vegetation, including reducing the yield of O 3 -sensitive crops such as common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The reduction in wheat yield has been shown to be linearly related to the phytotoxic O 3 dose above a flux <b>threshold</b> of <b>Y</b> (PODY) accumulated over a specific period. In the current study, we tested whether the flux-effect relationships for wheat yield and 1, 000 -grain weight were affected by the temporal profile of O 3 exposure. A modern wheat cultivar (Skyfall) was exposed to eight different realistic O 3 profiles repeated weekly: four profiles with increasing background O 3 concentrations (ca. 30 – 60 ppb) including small peaks and four profiles with increasing O 3 peak concentrations (ca. 35 – 110 ppb). Both wheat yield and 1, 000 -grain weight declined linearly with increasing PODY. The slope of the flux-effect relationships was not affected significantly by the profile of O 3 exposure. Hence, flux-effect relationships developed for wheat based on exposure to enhanced peak O 3 concentrations are also valid for the changing European O 3 profile with higher background and lower peak concentrations. The current study also shows that the modern wheat cultivar Skyfall is more sensitive to O 3 than European wheat varieties tested for O 3 sensitivity in the 1980 s and 1990 s...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{transmutation}} {{of radioactive}} waste, {{that might be}} in plenty produced in consequence of industrial reprocessing the irradiated nuclear fuel, would be based, most probably, on applying of intense neutron fluxes (both thermalized and fast) provided by fission reactors and accelerator-driven target-blankets, A lack of the reliable experimental data concerning some bothering nuclides makes difficult to ground practic~ expediency of the very transmutation approach. So, up to recently consistent appraisals not always could be done even for rather elaborated systems with neutrons of thermal spectrum (say, transmuting rate of 137 Cb/gOSr through capture of thermal neutron). Similarly, {{in the case of}} minor actinides (with relatively high fission <b>thresholds)</b> a scarcit <b>y</b> of the relevant database enables to estimate, for instance, a burning down of these nuclides in complicated hard neutron spectra (including neutron fields around spallation target driven by NGeV proton/deuteron beams of NMW power), in essential, only on the basis of general considerations. In order to narrow a gap between the experimental data spreading under an ideology of accelerator based large-scale neutron production (say) for purposes of nuclear fue...|$|R
30|$|Because {{exposure}} and thresholding of CHPs can have both independent and interacting effects on HP accuracy (Song et al. 2014), these two processes {{should be examined}} together. A uniform basis for comparison of CHP {{exposure and}} thresholding effects was achieved by using two parameters, exposure manipulation and thresholding manipulation. Exposure manipulation was the extent of exposure deviating from the reference exposure measured under an unobscured overcast sky. Thresholding manipulation was transformed from the grey-scale threshold value using the regression model established by Song et al. (2014), in which the relationship between exposure manipulation (X) and the optimal <b>threshold</b> value (<b>Y)</b> is Y[*]=[*] 260.542 /(1 [*]+[*]e(−X+ 1.422)/ 1.160). This model determines the optimal threshold values for CHPs exposed with specific exposure manipulations. If a CHP is analysed with a threshold value which is the optimal threshold value for CHPs acquired with exposure manipulation of S stop, this CHP is analysed with thresholding manipulation of S stop. For example, the optimal threshold value for CHPs acquired with exposure manipulation of +[*] 3 stop is 202. When a CHP is analysed with a threshold value of 202, its thresholding manipulation is +[*] 3 stop. The ETM extent can be quantified by subtracting the thresholding manipulation from the exposure manipulation. When the ETM extent of a CHP is 0 stop, that means this CHP is analysed with its optimal threshold value and it can provide a correct estimate for HP. Positive ETM extents indicate that CHPs are overexposed or analysed with threshold values that are too low, so that gap fraction is overestimated. Negative ETM extents underestimate gap fraction, {{as a result of}} underexposing CHPs or analysing CHPs with threshold values that are too high.|$|R

This system monitors these wastages over the sequence of exit epochs {t 0 = 0 and tk; k = 1, 2,∙∙∙} that form a re-current process and admit recruitment when the cumulative loss of man hours crosses a <b>threshold</b> level <b>Y,</b> which is also called the breakdown level. It is assumed that the inter-exit times Tk = tk− 1 − tk, k = 1, 2,∙∙ ∙ are independent and identically distributed random variables with a common cumulative distribution function (CDF) B(t) = P(Tk < t) which has a tail 1 – B(t) behaving like t−v with 1 < v < 2 as t → ∞. The amounts {Xk} of wastages incurred during these inter-exit times {Tk} are independent and identically distributed random variables with CDF P(Xk < X) = G(x) and Y is distributed, independently of {Xk} and {tk}, as an exponentiated exponential law with CDF H(y) = P(Y < y) = (1 − e−λy) n. The mean waiting time to break down of the system has been obtained assuming B(t) to be heavy tailed and as well as light tailed.

40|$|In this work, the {{response}} of temperate coniferous forests to ozone air pollution (O 3) in the mountain environment of the High Tatra Mts. (Western Carpathians) was analyzed. The modelling of stomatal O 3 flux is a complex method for the estimation of phytotoxicity of O 3 pollution to forest vegetation. Stomatal flux-based critical levels (CLef) for effects of O 3 on radial growth {{take into account the}} varying influences of O 3 concentration, meteorological variables, soil properties, and phenology. The application of the model DO 3 SE (Deposition of Ozone for Stomatal Exchange) at five experimental plots with altitudes varying from 810 to 1, 778 m a. s. l. along vertical and spatial profile in the High Tatra Mts. revealed the high phytotoxic potential of O 3 on spruce forests during the growing season 2014. The accumulated stomatal O 3 flux above a <b>threshold</b> of <b>Y</b> (1 nmol m− 2 s− 1), i. e. POD 1 (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose) ranged from 13. 6 mmol m− 2 at the Kolové pleso site (1, 570 m a. s. l.) to 16. 2 mmol m− 2 at Skalnaté Pleso site (1, 778 m a. s. l.). CLef for POD 1 (8 mmol m− 2) recommended for the protection of spruce forests were exceeded at all experimental plots from early July. Similarly, AOT 40 index suggests vulnerability of mountain forests to O 3 pollution. AOT 40 values increased with altitude and reached values varying from 6. 2 ppm h in Stará Lesná (810 m a. s. l.) to 10. 7 ppm h at Skalnaté Pleso close to the timber line (1, 778 m a. s. l.). Concentration-based critical level (CLec) of 5, 000 ppb h was exceeded from June to August and was different for each experimental site...|$|R
