5|$|As many as 15 German Tornados {{undertook}} {{combat operations}} {{as a part}} of NATO's campaign during the Bosnian War; this was the first combat operation for the Luftwaffe since World War II. The Tornados, operating from Piacenza, Italy, flew reconnaissance missions to survey damage inflicted by previous strikes and to scout targets for other aircraft to strike. These reconnaissance missions were reportedly responsible for a significant improvement in target selection <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
5|$|The allies had no 'standing army', nor {{was there}} any {{requirement}} to form one; since they were fighting on home territory, they could muster armies as and when required. Different-sized allied forces thus appeared <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> These numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{week before}} the 2006 New York State Democratic Convention, Brown was {{described}} as a political confidant of Democratic New York Attorney General candidate Andrew Cuomo. He seconded Cuomo's nomination at the convention on May 30, 2006. <b>Throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> Brown {{was described as a}} close political advisor to Cuomo. He was noted as (along with Charles Rangel) one of the important black political leaders that Cuomo courted on his road to victory.|$|E

5|$|A {{key part}} of Blamey's plan was for Australian and US forces to {{maintain}} pressure on the Japanese garrison around Salamaua to the south-west in the lead up to the landing {{in an effort to}} draw Japanese reinforcements away from Lae. In this they were completely successful; the Japanese 51st Division continued to reinforce the position around Salamaua, with thousands of Japanese troops, including elements of several infantry regiments and an artillery regiment, being moved to the area <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> Allied intelligence estimated that there were 7,250 Japanese soldiers in Lae, of whom 5,100 were in combat units.|$|E
5|$|Buckner had a keen {{interest}} in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H. Pendleton, he loyally supported the party's nominee <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the general}} election, Humphrey faced former Vice President Richard Nixon of New York, the Republican Party nominee. Nixon led in most polls <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> and {{successfully}} criticized Humphrey's role in Vietnam, connecting {{him to the}} unpopular president and the general disorder in the nation. Humphrey experienced a surge in the polls in the days prior to the election, largely due to incremental progress {{in the peace process}} in Vietnam and a break with the Johnson war policy, but was defeated by Nixon on Election Day.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the custom}} of the times—that {{candidates}} not appear to seek the office—Tyler stayed home <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and the Democratic candidate, Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren. The presidential election was settled by the Electoral College, but for {{the only time in}} American history, the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|He {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1972–73 season, his confidence and form suffered as defenders marked him more closely and poor diet saw his weight rise to over 14 stone. Captain Frank McLintock remarked to the management that Kennedy was only operating at 60% capacity, and Kennedy was fined £200 before he began to shed weight and rediscover his form. Arsenal finished the season in second place, and he scored just nine league goals <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|In the league, Augustinsson played {{every minute}} of the first 30 games, until he was rested for the final two away games when the trophy was already secured {{in the middle of}} May. He {{assisted}} to nine goals <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> placing him as tied leader with Nicolaj Thomsen and Rasmus Falk. Ekstra Bladet ranked him as one of the five best players for Copenhagen, awarding 5 of 6 stars for his performance, citing an improvement compared to the spring part of the season.|$|E

5|$|After Antietam, Ewing {{was placed}} on sick leave because of chronic dysentery, and was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General on November 29, 1862. He transferred West and served <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> before Vicksburg, leading the assaults made by General Sherman; and upon its fall was placed in command of a division in the XVI Corps. At Chattanooga, he was given command of the 4th Division of the XV Corps, which formed the advance of Sherman's army and carried Missionary Ridge. Prior to the Battle of Chattanooga, Ewing's command led a diversionary raid {{that resulted in the}} destruction of the Empire State Iron Works in Dade County, Georgia, which was being refurbished to increase the South's manufacturing capability. Sherman considered Ewing his most reliable division commander.|$|E
5|$|Burnley manager John Haworth used 23{{different}} players {{during the}} 1920–21 season, {{and there were}} nine different goalscorers. The team played in a 2–3–5 formation <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> with two fullbacks, three halfbacks, two outside forwards, two inside forwards and a centre forward. Billy Watson played {{the highest number of}} games, appearing in all 45First Division and FA Cup matches. Billy Nesbitt and Joe Anderson each played 43 times. Anderson was the top goalscorer for Burnley in the campaign with 31competitive goals, including 25 in the league, the highest total since Bert Freeman's 36goals in 1912–13. With a tally of 23 goals, Bob Kelly was the second-highest scorer, followed by Benny Cross with 15, including the goal that won the title for Burnley. Club captain Tommy Boyle was the highest-scoring defender, with seven goals in 38league appearances. Winger Billy Nesbitt scored five times during the season.|$|E
5|$|He {{missed the}} 1977–78 {{pre-season}} {{with a knee}} injury, but recovered well enough to make 36 appearances <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> Kaye was sacked after a poor start to the season, {{and was replaced by}} Bremner's former Leeds teammate Bobby Collins, who had joined the club as assistant manager in the summer; as at Leeds, Bremner had applied for the vacant managerial role, but was rejected. After being turned down for the job he announced his intention to retire as a player {{at the end of his}} contract in summer 1978. The season was a disaster, and though Collins was sacked and replaced by youth coach Ken Houghton in February, results did not improve and Hull were relegated in last place, ten points from safety.|$|E
50|$|On 30 May 1697 Murray was {{appointed}} colonel of a Scots regiment in the Dutch States Army.

5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1941, the Italian held port of Tobruk {{fell to the}} AIF and 25,000 Italians became prisoners. During January and February 1941, the 6th Division, {{together}} with British units, pushed the Italian army back across Libya, including actions at Derna, Barce and Benghazi. The Italian Tenth Army was destroyed. Although Wavell initially planned to leave the 6th Division in Cyrenaica for defence, the 7th Division was still insufficiently trained and equipped. As such in early April 1941, the 6th Division was withdrawn from North Africa to defend Greece and replaced by the 9th Division, which {{took part in the}} epic Siege of Tobruk between April and November 1941 against Italian and German forces. <b>Throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> the division lost 241 killed, 790 wounded and 21 captured.|$|E

5|$|On 3 October, Vale {{secured the}} biggest ever win at Vale Park when they beat York City 5–0. Seven days later Vale's clean sheet streak {{came to an}} end, though they still secured a 2–1 victory over Chesterfield at Saltergate; Cyril Hatton was the scorer for Chesterfield, though it proved not enough to save his team's unbeaten home record. Albert Mullard had a penalty kick saved {{towards the end of}} the game by goalkeeper Ron Powell, the only one of two {{penalties}} the club were awarded <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> Vale then beat Tranmere Rovers 2–0 after their defence successfully contained the threat posed by the division's then-top scorer Cyril Done. The following week they won 1–0 at Halifax Town in a game where Ken Griffiths hit the woodwork three times.|$|E
5|$|The 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was {{initially}} divided up, with each company {{attached to a}} different brigade of the 7th Division. Peeler's D Company—assigned to the 25th Brigade—was originally tasked with the maintenance and general repair of the road network in its locality. However, when the Vichy French launched a counter-attack on 15 June, the battalion was concentrated in the Merdjayoun area {{in an effort to}} prevent any further French gains. On the night of 27 June, after a costly assault against the Vichy French at Merdjayoun earlier that day, Peeler led out a patrol to recover the wounded. Four soldiers were discovered and brought back to the Australian lines. Despite suffering heavy casualties in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion served <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> including participation in the decisive Battle of Damour in July.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknown to Bompart's force, Humbert's {{army and}} the {{rebellion}} as a whole had been defeated by the British Army a week before Bompart departed France. Bompart's squadron too was woefully understrength consisting of only a single ship {{of the line and}} eight frigates carrying 3,000 men. This small force faced {{a large proportion of the}} British Channel Fleet, which was prepared for a second invasion attempt after Humbert's army had landed unopposed in August. As a result, Bompart's force was spotted just a few hours after he left Brest and he was then chased into the Atlantic Ocean by several British frigates which followed him for a week until he was able to lose them in heavy weather. This weather persisted <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> causing significant damage to both sides in a series of storms.|$|E
