2500|$|Cox {{returned}} home again at about 3:00. She reported hearing no sound and seeing no light from Kelly's room. Elizabeth Prater, who was woken by a kitten walking over her neck, and Sarah Lewis both reported hearing a faint cry of [...] "Murder!" [...] at about 4:00a.m., {{but did not}} react because they reported that it was common to hear such cries in the East End. She claimed not to have slept and to have heard people {{moving in and out}} of the court throughout the night. She <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> someone leaving the residence at about 5:45a.m. Prater did leave at 5:30a.m., to go to the Ten Bells public house for a drink of rum, and saw nothing suspicious.|$|E
60|$|Then came a pause, lasting till Theodora <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the carriage.|$|E
6000|$|Carol <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a grunt {{from the}} {{traveling}} salesman {{at the end}} of the table, and Kennicott's jerking elbow was a grunt embodied. She persisted: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{will know}} better another time,' <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a whistling, {{squeaking}} sound--it was Mr. Stone whispering the third page of his manuscript: ...|$|R
60|$|Edith <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> {{it was a}} portrait, but she was by {{no means}} certain, and most assuredly was quite unacquainted with the name of the original, if there were an original.|$|R
60|$|Barbara {{looked about}} the table. Mrs. Cartwright {{was at the}} other end and Barbara <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had not <b>heard.</b> <b>She</b> touched the young doctor.|$|R
60|$|It was a holiday, and Rose up in {{her room}} <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the voices of her cousins, so she ran down to welcome them, but found no one there.|$|E
60|$|The thin voice died away, {{and there}} was silence so intense that Benita <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the {{scraping}} of the feet of a green lizard which crept across a stone a yard or two away.|$|E
60|$|Wilbur {{turned and}} went silently to the kitchen. Miss Cynthia <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a sob. She went with a firm step into the little bedroom off the hall and took a purse out of a drawer.|$|E
6000|$|Ah, old {{author of}} 'The Way of the World,' you knew--you knew!" [...] Grace moved. He <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> {{some part of}} his soliloquy. He was sorry--though he had not taken any {{precaution}} to prevent her.|$|R
6000|$|... (From it <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> clearly <b>heard</b> a voice, {{even the}} accents of [...] her husband calling her when night was {{wrapping}} {{the earth with}} [...] darkness; and on the roof the lonely owl in funereal strains kept oft [...] complaining, drawing out into a wail its protracted notes.) ...|$|R
60|$|Amy. Yes, sir; {{she always}} said she {{believed}} you were alive, because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> should have <b>heard</b> something of you {{if you had been}} dead.|$|R
6000|$|Gavinia <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the chink {{of another}} five shillings, {{and her mouth}} opened so wide that a {{chaffinch}} could have built therein. [...] "Is he {{to look for a}} bottle in the pond?" [...] she asked, eagerly.|$|E
60|$|Still she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the trader make {{an offer}} for her boy;--could she be mistaken? Her heart swelled and throbbed, and she involuntarily {{strained}} him {{so tight that}} the little fellow looked up into her face in astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|So it was settled, {{and they}} left the luncheon table. Marian {{happened}} to be the last lady, and whether it was fancy or not she was not sure, but she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> on Walter's lips, a self-reproachful whisper of [...] "Coward." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{not long}} away; for Florence was yet weeping in the great room and nourishing these <b>thoughts,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> him come back. He ordered the {{servants}} to set about their ordinary occupations, and went into his own apartment, where he trod so heavily that she could hear him {{walking up and down}} from end to end.|$|R
6000|$|... â€œShe made no sign, she had {{returned}} to her desolate contemplation of the boy. Davidson <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had not <b>heard</b> him even, when with an unchanged expression she spoke under her breath.|$|R
6000|$|Carley {{did not ask}} {{any more}} questions. Natural history was not her {{favorite}} study and {{she was sure she}} could dispense with any first-hand knowledge of desert beasts. <b>She</b> <b>thought,</b> however, <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> one of the men say, [...] "Big varmint prowlin' round the sheep." [...] To which Hutter replied, [...] "Reckon it was a bear." [...] And Glenn said, [...] "I saw his fresh track by the lake. Some bear!" ...|$|R
60|$|Their retreat was so chosen {{that while}} they could watch the river, they could watch the house. No one had passed in or out, since the {{daughter}} <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the father calling. No one could pass in or out without being seen.|$|E
6000|$|Benita {{felt that}} the act was just, and the awful {{punishment}} deserved. Yet that laugh of Jacob's jarred upon her, for in it she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the man's heart speaking; and oh, its voice was merciless! Surely Justice should not laugh when her sword falls! ...|$|E
60|$|One night, she {{had stolen}} to her usual window, and {{was sitting there}} very sorrowfully--for {{the old man had}} been worse that day--when she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> her name {{pronounced}} by a voice in the street. Looking down, she recognised Kit, whose endeavours to attract her attention had roused her from her sad reflections.|$|E
60|$|How little <b>she</b> had <b>thought,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> him say his prayers, and {{exchanged}} kisses {{with him at}} the side of his little bed, that {{it was the last time}} for many a long day; and that her hungry spirit would have to feed itself on that last smile and kiss of the fat hand, as she looked out of her husband's window as the carriage drove away.|$|R
60|$|The beasts grew {{weary of}} lapping up clouds. Their appetites were {{satisfied}} for a while, {{at any rate}} she saw their tongues no more. The air was very hot and heavy, and the darkness very dense, it seemed to press about her {{as though she were}} plunged in cream. Yet Rachel <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> sounds through it, a sound of feet to the west and a sound of feet to the east.|$|R
60|$|While Emlyn mused there quite alone--for at {{this hour}} none entered the place, nor would until the next morning--she <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> strange noises, as of some one stirring, which came from the {{neighbourhood}} of the statue. Now many would have been scared and departed; but not so Emlyn, who only sat still and listened. Presently, without moving her head, she looked also. As it happened, {{the light of the}} setting sun, pouring through the west window, fell almost full upon the figure, and by it <b>she</b> saw, or <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> saw, that the eye-sockets were no longer empty; there were eyes in them which moved and flashed.|$|R
60|$|As Jeanne {{finished}} speaking {{she placed}} her finger on her lips, for she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a slight noise without. The countess {{closed her eyes and}} then lay down on her pillow, while Jeanne stood as if watching her. The next instant the door opened noiselessly and Sister Felicia entered. She moved with a noiseless step up to Jeanne.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{clutched}} {{her dress and}} ran. At first, she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> Barbara behind, but she owned she had not her sister's pluck and fear gave her speed. She must get {{as far as possible}} from the pool before she stopped. Besides, she imagined something broke through the undergrowth near the trail, but her heart beat and she could not hear properly.|$|E
6000|$|Betty, who {{was active}} and strong, {{followed}} him, Margaret coming next. As {{she reached the}} deck Betty <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a voice say in Spanish, of which she understood something, [...] "Fool! Why have you brought both?" [...] but the answer she could not catch. Then she turned and gave her hand to Margaret, and together they walked forward {{to the foot of}} the mast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, and {{you have}} not?" [...] he said thoughtfully. [...] "I gave her a lift from the barn homewards; but I did not tell her either; for I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might have <b>heard</b> {{of it in the}} town, and was keeping back her {{congratulations}} from shyness, and all that." ...|$|R
50|$|Wendy has an ear {{on top of}} {{her head}} that can hear <b>thoughts.</b> When <b>she</b> was dumped by her boyfriend Xavier, she began to make everyone's life miserable. Soon, it is {{revealed}} that Mrs. Jewls has had her baby. Wendy attempts throwing it out the window-but not before listening to its <b>thoughts.</b> And what <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> was pure love. She falls in love with Louis, and shows everyone her third ear. Louis says he loves her too; she doesn't have to hear his <b>thoughts,</b> <b>she</b> can see it in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|When Grace and Kit {{had gone}} a short {{distance}} they heard voices and a rattle of sticks in the wood, but the noise got fainter and she imagined the beaters were moving the other way. Ferrars, who shot at the woodcock, had probably not had time to tell Osborn about his carelessness, and {{it looked as if}} nobody else had been posted near the road. This was something of a relief, but Grace felt anxious. A gate not far off led to a drive in the wood, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> Osborn's voice.|$|R
60|$|She {{saw that}} she had touched him, for he cast {{a quick glance at}} the door, as if to make sure that nobody had heard his boast. As he did so, Evelyn <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a faint {{movement}} outside, but she knew she might be mistaken, and Gomez did not seem to notice anything. To distract his attention, she flung another jibe at him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was long}} past midnight when Grace woke, she knew not how, and looking up, saw {{a light in}} the room, and Mary sitting still over a book, her head resting on her hands. She lay quiet and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a sob. She was sure she heard tears drop on the paper. She stirred, and Mary was at her side in a moment.|$|E
60|$|Presently she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a low {{knock at}} the front door, and went to see. As she opened it a savage swirl of damp wind rushed in, and the {{shrinking}} figure leaning {{against one of the}} fluted columns of the Grecian porch seemed to cower before its fury. It was a woman who stood there, a woman whose emaciated face wore a piteous expression, as she lifted it to Mrs. March.|$|E
60|$|Following that meeting, {{with all}} its power to change and {{strengthen}} Joan, there were uneventful days in which she rode the gulch trails and grew able to stand the jests and glances of the bandit's gang. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> saw and <b>heard</b> everything, yet insulated her true self in a callous and unreceptive aloofness from all that affronted her.|$|R
60|$|Yes, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>she</b> were dying, {{he would}} relent. <b>She</b> <b>thought,</b> that if <b>she</b> lay, serene and not unwilling to depart, upon the bed that was curtained round with {{recollections}} of their darling boy, {{he would be}} touched home, and would say, 'Dear Florence, live for me, and we will love each other as we might have done, and be as happy as {{we might have been}} these many years!' <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that if <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> such words from him, and had her arms clasped round him' she could answer with a smile, 'It is too late for anything but this; I never could be happier, dear father!' and so leave him, with a blessing on her lips.|$|R
60|$|The second tower lay almost {{directly}} in her path. To make a detour would not lessen {{the chance of}} detection, it would only lengthen the period of her danger, and so she laid her course straight for the hill where her flier was, regardless of the tower. As she passed the first enclosure <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the sound of movement within, but the gate did not open and she breathed more easily when it lay behind her. She came then to the second enclosure, the outer wall of which she must circle, as it lay across her route. As she passed close along it <b>she</b> distinctly <b>heard</b> not only movement within, but voices. In the world-language of Barsoom <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a man issuing instructions--so many were to pick usa, so many were to irrigate this field, so many to cultivate that, and so on, as a foreman lay out the day's work for his crew.|$|R
