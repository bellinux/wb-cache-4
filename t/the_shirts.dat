5|$|England have {{typically}} worn all-white shirts, white shorts with navy and white socks. The emblem on <b>the</b> <b>shirts</b> {{is a red}} rose, rather than the Plantagenet Three Lions displayed on <b>the</b> <b>shirts</b> of the England football and cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O2 is the shirt sponsor. The change strip is normally red, although prior {{to the introduction of}} the red strip, navy blue was used and was reintroduced for the 2016-17 season. Purple was used as the change strip as of the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England track-suits from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. For the 2011 Rugby World Cup the change kit was black.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shirts</b> worn by {{players of}} Ipswich Town did not sport a crest until the mid-1960s, when they adopted a design {{featuring}} a gold lion rampant guardant {{on a red}} background on the left half and three gold ramparts on a blue background on the right half. In 1972, the crest was redesigned {{as the result of}} a competition, won by the Treasurer of the Supporters Club, John Gammage. Each element of the new design was intended to represent the region.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} brand of their kit {{manufacturers}} Kappa, IFK Göteborg have the logos {{of the following}} companies visible on their shirt and shorts: Prioritet Finans, a financial-services company; Serneke, a construction company; Elkontakt, an electrical contractor; Morris Law, a law firm; NRC Group, a rail-infrastructure contractor; Atea, an IT-infrastructure company; Rasta, a chain of road restaurants and motels; German automakers Volkswagen; and league sponsors Svenska Spel, a government-owned gambling company (whose logo {{is on the right}} sleeve of <b>the</b> <b>shirts</b> of all Allsvenskan teams).|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's first shirt sponsor was Gulf Air, agreed {{during the}} 1983–84 season. The club were then {{sponsored}} by Grange Farms, Bai Lin Tea and Simod before a long-term deal was signed with Commodore International in 1989; Amiga, {{an offshoot of}} Commodore, also appeared on <b>the</b> <b>shirts.</b> Chelsea were subsequently sponsored by Coors beer (1994–97), Autoglass (1997–2001), Emirates (2001–05), Samsung Mobile (2005–08) and Samsung (2008–15). Chelsea's current shirt sponsor is the Yokohama Rubber Company. Worth £40million per year, the deal is second in English football to Chevrolet's £50million-per-year sponsorship of Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped shirts, with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn <b>the</b> <b>shirts</b> ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} with <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> stays is that they come off. For this problem there are solutions in the form of belts that go around your waist, inside your pants. Some are made of rubber and work by friction to keep <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> from sliding up. There is at least one style that has molded hooks that grips the material of <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> and <b>the</b> pants keeping <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> tails tucked.|$|R
50|$|The third kit is a {{white shirt}} with a v-neck collar, with a red trim on the sleeves, and the club badge {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>shirt.</b> <b>The</b> <b>shirt</b> also {{includes}} <b>the</b> club's sponsors; CK Beckett logo is written on the front of <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> in red. <b>The</b> Palmer logo is on the back of <b>the</b> <b>shirt,</b> and <b>the</b> Puma logo appears on the chest and sleeves of <b>the</b> <b>shirt.</b> <b>The</b> shorts are red with a white trim, which includes the sponsor logo, Bapp For Bolts, {{at the back of the}} shorts. The socks are white, the players were seen wearing white socks, when they were wearing the third kit, during a match against Cardiff in December 2016.|$|R
50|$|A {{detachable}} collar is a shirt collar separate from <b>the</b> <b>shirt,</b> fastened {{to it by}} studs. The collar is usually made of a different fabric from <b>the</b> <b>shirt,</b> in which case it is almost always white, and, being unattached to <b>the</b> <b>shirt,</b> can be specially starched to a hard cardboard-like consistency.|$|R
5|$|Occasionally, the Belgian team {{directly}} supported charity. Between 1914 and 1941 {{they played}} at minimum five unofficial games {{of which the}} returns were for charitable purposes: two against France, and three against the Netherlands. In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader Michel D'Hooghe. Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican industrial city of Toluca, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a plus sign {{on the shoulders of}} their jerseys and auctioning <b>the</b> <b>shirts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The colours {{used by the}} {{original}} Panthers were black and white. Home shirts were black with {{a black and white}} striped lining on the shoulders. When the club reformed in 1980, the black and white colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys. In 1996 red was added to the colour scheme of <b>the</b> <b>shirts.</b> In 2001–02 the club's colour scheme was changed to black and gold. Home jerseys are gold with a black lining with away jerseys being the reverse. In 2007–08, the Panthers brought out a predominantly white third jersey for the Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, bank Credireal was Atlético's first shirt sponsor. After one sponsorless {{season in}} 1983, Precon, a {{construction}} company, appeared on <b>the</b> <b>shirts</b> in 1984 and 1985; it {{was replaced by}} Agrimisa bank in 1986. In 1987, Coca-Cola sponsored all participating clubs of Copa União, and the brand remained on Atlético's kits until 1994. The club was subsequently sponsored by TAM Airlines (1995–96), Tenda (1997–98), and had temporary deals with Fiat and Telemar in 1999. Two sponsorless years followed, before permanent deals were signed with Fiat (2002–03), MRV Engenharia (2004–07) and Fiat again in 2008. After one more season without a brand on the club's shirts, BMG, a bank that was owned by the former club president Ricardo Annes Guimarães, was the main sponsor from 2010 to 2014. MRV returned as the club's main shirt sponsor in 2015, being replaced by state-owned bank Caixa Econômica Federal in 2016.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> team's <b>shirt</b> {{supplier}} was Puma. <b>The</b> <b>shirt</b> sponsor was Ginsters.|$|R
50|$|The collar is {{attached}} to <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> {{by a pair of}} studs like those shown. <b>The</b> <b>shirt</b> has a tunic collar, a short upright band of fabric with a hole at the back and one on each side at the front. The stiff collar {{is attached}} at the back before <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> is donned (and the tie placed under the collar for a turndown collar), then <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> is put on, after which the front stud is pushed through the collar to fasten it.|$|R
50|$|The current colours are the traditional, {{with the}} crest of the club on the left upper part of <b>the</b> <b>shirt.</b> <b>The</b> name of the sponsor (if any) is {{normally}} placed in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>shirt.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{crest of}} IFK Göteborg has {{its origins in}} the coat of arms {{of the city of}} Gothenburg which in turn is based on several other heraldic arms. The lion on a field of silver and blue is the heraldic arms of the House of Folkung, and the lion holds the Three Crowns of Sweden, both symbols being used in the coat of arms of Sweden. This arms was granted to Gothenburg by Gustavus Adolphus. The coat of arms of the city sees the lion facing the {{sinister}} (heraldic left, which is viewer's right) side which often is interpreted as a fleeing lion, the normal being a lion facing the dexter (heraldic right) side, and IFK chose to use the latter on the club crest. Finally the three letters IFK were added on top. This crest has been used since it first appeared on the kit in 1919. These main elements have not been modified since then, but during the years several different designs of the crest have been used, occasionally having the lion facing the sinister side. In the early 1980s, the club standardised the design and only minor changes—such as element colours and different hues—have been made since then, {{with the exception of the}} years 1997–1999 when IFK, with Reebok as kit sponsors, used a crest with some more distinct changes to the standard elements. Before 1919 various other symbols were used, with the four-pointed star of the IFK associations featuring on <b>the</b> <b>shirts</b> until 1910.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Headington United, orange and blue striped shirts were worn with navy shorts and socks. The {{design of the}} shirt changed regularly, with the stripes being changed every few seasons. After joining the Southern League, the blue stripes were lost for good and a lighter shade of orange {{was used for the}} shirt. The yellow kit was first worn during the 1957–58 season, with black shorts and yellow socks. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the black shorts were first {{replaced}} with yellow ones, and then with light blue shorts. Since the early 1990s, the strip has been composed of the yellow shirt and navy coloured shorts and socks. A large variety of away kits has been used over the years, ranging from red and black stripes on <b>the</b> <b>shirts,</b> to a fully white kit. The first sponsor to appear on the shirt was Sunday Journal, a local newspaper, in 1982. Between 1983 and 1985, there were three sponsors: BPCC, Pergamon and the Sunday People. Following those were Wang Laboratories (1985 to 1989), Pergamon (1989 to 1991), Unipart (1991 to 2000), Domino (2000 to 2001) and Buildbase (from the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001 to 2010). Following the return to the Football League, Bridle Insurance were announced as new shirt sponsors. The Bridle deal ended after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season. The home sponsor for the 2013–14 season was announced as Animalates, with the away kit being sponsored by Isinglass Consulting for that same season after winning an innovative prize draw. That one-year deal with Isinglass was extended for the 2014–15 season, again featuring on the away kits only.|$|E
25|$|U.S. presidents, {{including}} Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Barack Obama, {{have worn}} <b>the</b> <b>shirts</b> {{as a sign}} of solidarity when visiting the Cuban community in Miami and when attending Latin American summits. Visiting politicians are sometimes given <b>the</b> <b>shirts</b> by Cuban American or Latin American political leaders.|$|E
50|$|Yakan {{women are}} {{excellent}} weavers, and {{are famous for}} their beautifully woven traditional costumes of cotton and pineapple cloth. The basic garment {{for men and women}} consists of a tight-fitting upper garment with tight-fitting trousers called sawal. <b>The</b> <b>shirt</b> is open in front from lapel down to the waist, using up to 40 sequined or golden buttons. To close <b>the</b> <b>shirt,</b> a long string is crisscrossed from one button to the other so that when tightly drawn, <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> closes from top to bottom. Usually <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> remains open since the string is often lost. Over <b>the</b> <b>shirt,</b> male and female wear a tight-fitting jacket, which is exquisitely embroidered in the front and back, with cuffs decorated with multicolored sequins.|$|R
50|$|In 1942 Cruzeiro {{played one}} game {{under the name}} Ypiranga, and for this game a blue shirt with a central {{horizontal}} stripe was used. In 1943 Cruzeiro played its first game under its current name. <b>The</b> <b>shirt</b> used then was an all blue shirt with a large white v-neck (scapular) design. The shorts and stockings were white. In 1950, due to bad stadium lighting, Cruzeiro began to use an all-white shirt during night games. <b>The</b> <b>shirt,</b> which featured blue details and blue shorts and white stockings, was used for nine years. In 1956, Cruzeiro used, for a short while, a new shirt that {{was made up of}} white and blue horizontal stripes. The uniform was not used in many games. There was a change to <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> in 1959; <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> became all blue, a design that would influence later <b>shirts.</b> In <b>the</b> 1959 <b>shirt,</b> instead of using its normal crest Cruzeiro simply used the five stars, in the crest, loose on <b>the</b> <b>shirt.</b> <b>The</b> <b>shirt</b> made its debut in the Estádio dos Tecelões, in a friendly match against Renascença, on September 19.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> {{that he wore}} in the 1913 FA Cup Final was {{auctioned}} at Christie's in London. <b>The</b> <b>shirt</b> {{sold for}} £5,875, far exceeding the estimate of £1,000-1,500.|$|R

25|$|He began wearing {{colorful}} beaded shirts in concert, originally out {{of necessity}} so everyone in the audience could see him {{without the aid of}} binoculars. Bill Whitten designed and made <b>the</b> <b>shirts</b> for Diamond from the 1970s till approximately 2007.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, a man buys <b>the</b> <b>shirt</b> at {{a garage}} sale. At {{a parking lot}} prior to a Def Leppard concert, he surrenders it to a female fan after she flashes him.
