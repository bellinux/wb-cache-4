40|$|AIMS: Patients with {{isolated}} {{left ventricular}} non-compaction (IVNC) {{are at high}} risk for developing ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias.</b> However, no analysis of invasive electrophysiological (EP) findings in these patients has yet been performed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of EP findings in 24 patients with IVNC. Ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> were inducible in nine patients; of these, two patients had sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and two patients had ventricular fibrillation. No specific electrocardiographic or echocardiographic finding was predictive of VT inducibility. Three of the 9 patients with inducible VT experienced ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> during the follow-up of 61. 4 +/- 50 months, whereas no <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> or sudden deaths were noted in 12 patients without inducible VT during the follow-up of 30 +/- 19 months (3 patients in the latter group were lost to follow-up). Supraventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> were inducible in seven patients. CONCLUSION: Our present study provides the first comprehensive analysis of EP findings in patients with IVNC. Ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias can readily be induced in these patients, whereas the inducibility of a sustained monomorphic VT is relatively low. Further studies including long-term follow-up are required to investigate the role of EP testing for arrhythmic risk stratification in these patients...|$|R

50|$|The {{prognosis}} for TIC after {{treatment of the}} underlying <b>tachyarrhythmia</b> is generally good. Studies show that left ventricular function often improves within 1 month of treatment of the <b>tachyarrhythmia,</b> and normalization of the left ventricular ejection fraction occurs {{in the majority of}} patients by 3 to 4 months. In some patients however, recovery of this function can take greater than 1 year or be incomplete. In addition, despite improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction, studies have demonstrated that patients with prior TIC continue to demonstrate signs of negative cardiac remodeling including increased left ventricular end-systolic dimension, end-systolic volume, and end-diastolic volume. Additionally, recurrence of the <b>tachyarrhythmia</b> in patients with a history of TIC has been associated with a rapid decline in left ventricular ejection fraction and more severe cardiomyopathy that their prior presentation, which may be a result of the negative cardiac remodeling. There have also been cases of sudden death in patients with a history of TIC, which may be associated with worse baseline left ventricular dysfunction. Given these risks, routine monitoring with clinic visits, ECG, and echocardiography is recommended.|$|E

40|$|Sinus node disease (SND), {{a common}} {{indication}} to implant a pacemaker, is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), either at implantation (paroxysmal AF) or during follow-up, which often evolves to persistent or permanent AF.

Asymptomatic atrial <b>tachyarrhythmias,</b> being associated with increased risk of stroke, have important prognostic implications, and their detection could guide decision-making about antithrombotic prophylaxis. Pacing mode and pacing algorithms can influence the occurrence of AF and atrial <b>tachyarrhythmias.</b> In DDD/DDDR pacing mode, reduction of unnecessary right ventricular pacing positively affects the occurrence and evolution of AF, but patients with a history of atrial <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> maintain an increased risk of arrhythmic events. In the MINERVA study, the use of algorithms that act in the atrium for preventive pacing and atrial antitachycardia pacing while minimizing right ventricular pacing was beneficial in patients with SND and previous atrial <b>tachyarrhythmias,</b> and was associated with a significant reduction in evolution to permanent AF.

50|$|For TIC due to atrial fibrillation, rate control, rhythm control, and RF {{catheter}} ablation can {{be effective}} to control the <b>tachyarrhythmia</b> and improve left ventricular systolic function.

In patients with TIC due to other types of SVT, RF catheter ablation is recommended as a first-line treatment. In patients with TIC due to VT or PVCs, both antiarrhythmics and RF catheter ablation can be used. However, the options for antiarrhythmic agents are limited because certain agents can be proarrhythmic in the setting of myocardial dysfunction in TIC. Therefore, RF catheter ablation is often a safe and effective choice for treatment VT and PVCs causing TIC.

The effects of KB-R 7943, a Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger blocker, on arrhythmogenesis in hearts with chronic myocardial infarction (MI) remain unclear. MethodsDual voltage and intracellular Ca 2 + (Cai) optical mapping was performed in nine rabbit hearts with chronic MI and four control hearts. Electrophysiology studies including inducibility of ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias,</b> ventricular fibrillation dominant frequency, action potential, Cai alternans, Cai decay, and conduction velocity were performed. The same protocol was repeated in the presence of KB-R 7943 (0. 5, 1, and 5 μM) after the baseline studies. ResultsKB-R 7943 was effective in suppressing afterdepolarizations and spontaneous ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> in hearts with chronic MI. Surprisingly, KB-R 7943 increased the inducibility of ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> in a dose-dependent manner (11 %, 11 %, 22 %, and 56 % at baseline and with 0. 5, 1, and 5 μM KB-R 7943, respectively, p= 0. 02). Optical mapping analysis revealed that the underlying mechanisms of the induced ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> were probably spatially discordant alternans with wave breaks and rotors. Further analysis showed that KB-R 7943 significantly enhanced both action potential (p= 0. 033) and Cai (p= 0. 001) alternans, prolonged Cai decay (tau value) in a dose-dependent manner (p= 0. 004), and caused heterogeneous conduction delay especially at peri-infarct zones during rapid burst pacing. In contrast, KB-R 7943 had insignificant effects in control hearts. ConclusionsIn this chronic MI rabbit model, KB-R 7943 has contrasting effects on arrhythmogenesis, suppressing afterdepolarizations and spontaneous ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias,</b> but enhancing the inducibility of <b>tachyarrhythmias.</b> The mechanism is probably the enhanced spatially discordant alternans because of prolonged Cai decay and heterogeneous conduction delay...|$|R
40|$|Twelve cardiac {{electrophysiology}} centers {{conducted an}} open label prospective trial of bethanidine sulfate, an oral bretylium analog, {{for the prevention}} of ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> during programmed electrical stimulation. The study group included 56 patients (44 men, 12 women; mean age 60 years; 55 with structural heart disease). Sixteen patients had both ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, 30 had ventricular tachycardia alone and 10 had ventricular fibrillation alone. Programmed stimulation on no antiarrhythmic drugs induced sustained ventricular tachycardia in 46 patients, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 4 patients and ventricular fibrillation in 6 patients. During programmed ventricular stimulation after 59 trials of 20 to 30 mg/kg body weight of oral bethanidine (acute dosing in 40 patients, and divided dosing over 24 hours in 19 patients), no ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> were inducible in 6 patients (11 %), sustained ventricular tachycardia was converted to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 3 patients (5 %), ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> remained inducible in 39 patients (70 %) and spontaneous ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> occurred more frequently in 4 patients (7 %). Side effects prevented repeat testing in four patients. The 10 patients presenting with only ventricular fibrillation appeared to have a higher response rate: no ventricular <b>tachyarrhythmias</b> were inducible in 2 patients and sustained ventricular tachycardia was converted to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 2 patients. Despite protriptyline administration in 54 of 59 bethanidine trials, symptomatic hypotension occurred in 30 trials (51 %).
