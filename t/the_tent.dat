5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through the roof of <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{is presumed}} to have died on 29 March 1912, or {{possibly}} one day later. The positions of the bodies in <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> when it was discovered eight months later suggested that Scott {{was the last of}} the three to die.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the items}} from the expedition, {{including}} the balloon-silk boat and <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> are {{on display at the}} Andréeexpeditionen Polar Centre at Grenna Museum, Sweden. The expedition is also featured in the Spitsbergen Airship Museum in Longyearbyen, Svalbard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{change in}} {{regulations}} was aimed {{in particular to}} benefit <b>the</b> large <b>tents</b> of <b>the</b> Oktoberfest: So, smoking in <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> is still legal, but <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> usually have non-smoking areas. The sale of tobacco in <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> is now legal, but is widely boycotted by mutual agreement.|$|R

50|$|Augustamnica Prima had Pelusium as {{metropolis}} (administrative centre) and {{was under}} a corrector, who governed the following cities: Pelusium, Setroithes (or Sethroitis), Tanis, Thmuis, Rhinocorura, Ostracine (or Ostracina), Pentaschoinon, Casium, Aphnaion, Hephaestus, Panephysis, <b>the</b> <b>Tents</b> outside Gerra, <b>the</b> <b>Tents</b> inside Gerra, Thennesus, Panephusis.|$|R
5|$|The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party {{remained}} unknown until 1924, when an American vessel {{landed at}} Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established {{that this was}} Anderson's party. No {{cause of death was}} established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One theory was that <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> had blown away in a storm and that the party had frozen to death. Another was carbon monoxide poisoning within <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> and the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope {{around her neck and}} while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage to the realm of the dead.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{prosperity}} gospel teachers embraced televangelism {{and came}} to dominate religious programming in the United States. Oral Roberts was among the first, developing a syndicated weekly program that became the most watched religious show in the United States. By 1968, television had supplanted <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> meeting in his ministry.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tents</b> were {{exhibited}} at the U.S. Patent Office, and transferred the Smithsonian Institution in 1881. It wasn't until 1901, nearly 40 years after their seizure, that <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> and Washington artifacts were returned to the Lees' son, George Washington Custis Lee.|$|R
50|$|Second Lounge On The Farm festival, {{held over}} three days, with {{almost double the}} amount of acts as the last. <b>The</b> Acoustic <b>Tent</b> from WSSL, <b>the</b> Arabesque <b>tent,</b> <b>the</b> DJ <b>tent</b> was renamed <b>the</b> Hoedown, and the main stage renamed the Arabesque stage cover. New {{additions}} included the Sheep Dip, <b>The</b> Further <b>Tent</b> and <b>The</b> Festival Folly stage.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>tents</b> {{themselves}} served what organizers {{called a}} [...] "symbolic" [...] role, since members of Occupy Harvard continued attending school and {{work during the}} encampment. Some students criticized participants for not being present with <b>the</b> <b>tents.</b> (Many students themselves felt conflicted about competing obligations to the demonstration and to their academic work.) <b>The</b> <b>tents</b> were reportedly purchased with funds from the Student Labor Action Coalition, and the Service Employees International Union. The occupation consisted of 30 tents and {{a core group of}} 100 activists at Harvard.|$|R
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Judith and Holofernes has an equally gruesome detail. As Judith loads the enemy's head onto a basket carried by her maid and covers {{it with a}} cloth, she looks towards <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> apparently distracted by the limbs of the decapitated corpse flailing about.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected {{for the grand}} opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. <b>The</b> <b>tent</b> was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate. In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas. When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section. Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's mirror-like finish.|$|E
5|$|A {{century of}} storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, {{which are now}} encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 {{glaciologist}} Charles R. Bentley estimated that <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> with the bodies was under about 75feet (23m) of ice and about 30miles (48km) from {{the point where they}} died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg.|$|E
25|$|The carts {{were set}} up to form a solid {{defensive}} circle with forks facing out. Within <b>the</b> circle <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> {{were set up}} in rows on one side and, facing <b>the</b> <b>tents,</b> <b>the</b> animals on the other side. The animals are kept outside when deemed safe.|$|R

5|$|Besides {{the final}} scene, other aspects were discussed: Garcia noted the acting of Richard Madden {{and how the}} Freys had been introduced. Ryan praised {{the wide range of}} {{emotions}} used by Emilia Clarke while playing Daenerys, and how Peter Dinklage played Tyrion's frustration and confusion during the episode. Both she and McNutt were glad that Tyrion's exposition scene in <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> with Bronn and Shae did not use sex to keep viewers, as was done in past episodes.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are made of a folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds {{prevented}} Mawson {{from continuing}} for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove, he boiled {{the remainder of}} the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.|$|E

5|$|The {{plot of the}} novella {{describes}} the life journey of fourteen-year-old Eréndira, who is living with her grandmother when she accidentally sets fire to their home. The grandmother forces Eréndira to repay the debt by becoming a prostitute as they travel the road as vagrants. Men line up to enjoy Eréndira's services. She eventually escapes {{with the assistance of}} her affectionate and somewhat gullible lover, Ulises, but only after he murders her grandmother. After the murder, Eréndira runs off into the night alone, leaving him in <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> with the dead body of her grandmother.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistance}} is given intelligence by an unidentified informant from the Cylon command structure, {{by use of}} a secret dead drop; flipping a dog bowl and hiding some documents inside <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> next to it. One piece of intelligence given is information on a Cylon communications blocker; the resistance makes use of that information to contact a Raptor orbiting the planet. The Raptor returns to Galactica with news they have made contact with the resistance on the planet.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, the thrall {{girl was}} taken away to the ship. She removed her bracelets and gave them to the old woman. Thereafter she removed her finger rings and gave them to the old woman's daughters, who had guarded her. Then they took her aboard the ship, {{but they did not}} allow her to enter <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> where the dead {{chieftain}} lay. The girl received several vessels of intoxicating drinks and she sang and bade her friends farewell.|$|E

5|$|A {{category}} of ticket packages {{was created to}} be sold by an auction process at prices estimated at up to $1,000. All proceeds were donated to Music for Relief, a non-profit organization founded by Linkin Park to support disaster relief and programs to protect and restore the environment. Additionally, one dollar per concert ticket sold was contributed to the charity. A tent of Music for Relief was staffed by local volunteers at each concert. <b>The</b> <b>tent</b> featured a photo booth which enabled fans to document their concert experience and express their support to take action on climate change, {{leading up to the}} United Nations Climate Summit that took place on September 23, 2014 in New York City. Various clean energy tools were also showcased.|$|E
5|$|At {{morning they}} find that three cairns have been built around their tent during the night, which unnerves them. As they continue, Heather realizes her map is missing and Mike later reveals he kicked it into a creek the {{previous}} day out of frustration, which prompts Heather and Josh to attack him in a rage. They realize they are now lost and decide simply to head south. They eventually reach a section where they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night, they hear sounds again, including the sound of children laughing among other strange noises. After an unknown force shakes <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn.|$|E
5|$|No one at Truckee Lake {{had died}} during the interim between the {{departure}} of the first relief party and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
