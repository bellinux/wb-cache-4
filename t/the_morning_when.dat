5|$|That night Halverson, his copilot, and his {{engineer}} pooled their candy rations for {{the next}} day's drop. The accumulated candy was heavy, {{so in order to}} ensure the children were not hurt by the falling candy, Halvorsen made three parachutes out of handkerchiefs and tied them to the rations. In <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> Halverson and his crew made regular supply drops, they also dropped three boxes of candy attached to handkerchiefs. They made these drops once a week for three weeks. Each week, the group of children waiting at the Tempelhof airport fence grew significantly.|$|E
5|$|Bill Johnstona {{left arm}} bowler who could bowl both pace and spinwas not {{initially}} in Bradman's {{plan for the}} First Test at Trent Bridge. However, Bradman changed his mind on <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> rain was forecast. Johnston was played {{in the hope of}} exploiting a wet wicket; he had previously taken match-winning figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively on rain-affected surfaces. In addition, McCool had been struggling with an injury on his spinning finger, and Bradman was worried McCool would not have the endurance required for a five-day Test, which was two days longer than a normal tour match. Johnston's inclusion at the expense of McCool was the only difference between the team for the First Test and those against Worcestershire and the MCC. Johnston subsequently cemented his position by taking nine wickets in the matchthe most among the Australians. Johnson, the only specialist spinner chosen, took 1/85.|$|E
5|$|British forces {{landed at}} Calvi on 19 June, and {{immediately}} began moving guns ashore {{to occupy the}} heights surrounding the town. While Nelson directed a continuous bombardment of the enemy positions, Stuart's men began to advance. On 12 July Nelson was {{at one of the}} forward batteries early in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> a shot struck one of the sandbags protecting the position, spraying stones and sand. Nelson was struck by debris in his right eye and was forced to retire from the position, although his wound was soon bandaged and he returned to action. By 18 July most of the enemy positions had been disabled, and that night Stuart, supported by Nelson, stormed the main defensive position and captured it. Repositioning their guns, the British brought Calvi under constant bombardment, and the town surrendered on 10 August. However, Nelson's right eye had been irreparably damaged and he eventually lost all sight in it.|$|E

5|$|Foraging {{takes place}} {{mostly on the}} ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by {{dropping}} vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.|$|E
5|$|The JNA, {{warned about}} {{reinforcements}} to the 137th Infantry Brigade, abandoned {{its plan to}} advance to Barilović. It reoriented its efforts to reach the Korana Bridge {{in the village of}} Malići, down the road from Gornji Velemerić and Carevo Selo (where its tanks were stopped the day before). The battle resumed in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> JNA tanks (supported by the Yugoslav Air Force, artillery and multiple rocket launchers) broke through positions held by the 2nd Guards Brigade at 1:00p.m., reaching Carevo Selo before they were stopped again by the HV. Shortly afterwards, the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Brigade arrived from Zagreb to Duga Resa and were attached to the 137th Infantry Brigade. One company of the battalion was deployed to Vinica Hill, and a second was deployed west of Carevo Selo (where it relieved troops from the 2nd Guards Brigade).|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the day started early in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> skirmishes broke out in a bar, which led to an Arsenal fan being stabbed. Later in the day, Galatasaray fans {{occupied}} City Hall Square before heading towards Arsenal fans in bars nearby. The Galatasaray fans were later attacked from behind by members of British hooligan firms seeking revenge for the Istanbul stabbings. Despite deploying 2,000 officers to the area and having prior warning of potential trouble, the police were unable to control the riot until they fired tear gas at the rioters. This led to 19 injuries, including 4 stabbings, and 60 arrests with similar events occurring in England and Turkey {{in the aftermath of the}} riots.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} day, Syrian {{aircraft}} bombed the Israeli village Kinneret {{and the regional}} school Beit Yerah, on the southwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee. By evening, Samakh (Tzemah) had fallen and a new Israeli defensive line {{was set up in}} the Deganias, facing the Syrian counterparts. At night, a Palmach company from Yiftach's 3rd Battalion attempted to recapture Samakh's police station. They stealthily reached the school next to the station, but the assault on the actual fort was warded off. On the morning of May 19, a message was sent from Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada that they were preparing for an evacuation, although when the order was given to stay put, the villages had already been abandoned, mostly to Afikim. In <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> the villagers carried out an order to return to their positions, local Arabs were already present at the location. The Syrian troops then captured the villages without a fight, and proceeded to loot and destroy them. Aharon Israeli wrote that an order was given not to disclose the flight of Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan's residents, but this became clear as fire and smoke rose from the villages, and hurt the morale of the Israelis making defensive preparations in the Deganias.|$|E

After the week of wedding celebrations with Leah, Jacob married Rachel, and he continued to work for Laban for another seven years.|$|E
25|$|São Paulo {{is known}} for its rapidly {{changing}} weather. Locals say that all four seasons can be experienced in one day. In <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> winds blow from the ocean, the weather can be cool or sometimes even cold. When the sun hits its peak, the weather can be extremely dry and hot. When the sun sets, the cold wind comes back bringing cool temperatures. This phenomenon happens usually in the winter.|$|E
25|$|The main shock on 4 September caused {{widespread}} {{damage and}} several power outages, {{particularly in the}} city of Christchurch, New Zealand's second largest city. Two residents were seriously injured, one by a collapsing chimney and a second by flying glass. One person {{died of a heart attack}} suffered during the quake, although this could not be directly linked to the earthquake. Mass fatalities were avoided partly due to there being few houses of unreinforced construction, although this was also aided by the quake occurring during the early hours of <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> most people were off the street.|$|E

George and Rachel George, an issue-less aged couple living a retired life in their home, Karikkanvilla, in Meenthalakkara, a remote village near the Kerala town of Tiruvalla. The matter was reported to Kerala Police, who launched {{an investigation into the}} apparently unnatural deaths. The crime scene did not leave any clues except for some foot marks and the Police found out the marks were made by shoes manufactured outside India.|$|E
25|$|Square dancers {{dance to}} a variety of music, mostly Chinese popular songs, both {{contemporary}} and historic. The hobby began in the mid-1990s, as middle-aged women who had been forced into retirement began doing it to keep themselves occupied. Its popularity notwithstanding, square dancing {{has been the subject of}} considerable controversy in the 2010s China due to complaints of noise pollution in the evening or morning hours. Dancers in China's increasingly populous cities congregate in public areas because there are few dedicated facilities where they could go. Residents of nearby apartment complexes who have been disturbed by the high volume of multiple dance groups' musical accompaniment, especially late in the evening and early in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> they are trying to sleep, have sometimes reacted violently.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} patrolled by two {{security}} guards, {{both of whom}} were supposed to patrol independently at least once an hour, or once every two hours later in the night, one being primarily responsible for the visitor pavilion and one for the dock. The guards were required to keep a log of their patrols, but after the fire the relevant page was found to be missing from the book. It was later found, already filled in reporting uneventful patrols of the site up to 7 am in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> the guards would have gone off duty. The alarm was raised when one of the guards called the fire brigade; before this the two reported that they had smelled burning plastic and had been investigating to try to determine its source.|$|E

25|$|To {{get access}} to the show courts, fans will {{normally}} have to queue overnight. This is done by fans {{from all over the}} world and, although considered vagrancy, is part of the Wimbledon experience in itself. The All-England Club allows overnight queuing and provides toilet and water facilities for campers. Early in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight. Tickets returned by people leaving early go on sale at 2:30pm and the money goes to charity. Queuing for the show courts ends after the quarter finals have been completed.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Rosamond's brother, Fred, is reluctantly {{destined for}} the Church. However, he {{is in love with}} Mary Garth, who will not accept him until he {{abandons}} the Church and settles on a more suitable career. At one time, Mr Featherstone bequeathed Fred a considerable fortune, but Featherstone later rescinded this will. However, Featherstone, on his deathbed, begs Mary to destroy the second will. Mary refuses and begs Featherstone to wait until <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> a new and valid will can be drawn up, but he dies before this can be done. In debt, Fred is forced to take out a loan guaranteed by Mary's father, Caleb Garth. When Fred cannot repay the loan, Caleb Garth's finances are compromised. This humiliation shocks Fred into reassessing his life, and he resolves to train as a land agent under the forgiving Caleb.|$|E
25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> the lights are usually shut off. If the filmmakers had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them $40–$60,000, so instead Hudlin had the three hug, and the lights were {{eventually}} shut off as usual. When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E
