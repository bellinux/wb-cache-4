40|$|We {{have shown}} that the {{hydroxyl}} radical scavengers sodium benzoate, phenol, dimethyl sulfoxide, sodium formate, and mannitol protect chicken erythrocyte (Ec) <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> from lysis by K-cells in plaque assays. The protection afforded by benzoate, phenol, mannitol, and dimethyl sulfoxide was abrogated if the <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> were pretreated with sodium chromate. Neither superoxide dismutase nor catalase protected Ec <b>target</b> <b>cells,</b> indicating that superoxide and H 2 O 2 are not involved in lysis. The lysis obtained on chromium-treated Ec <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> in the presence of benzoate, phenol, and mannitol is likely due to singlet oxygen, because 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane and bilirubin, singlet oxygen scavengers, protected chromium-treated Ec <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> in the presence of phenol.

40|$|A new {{technique}} using HBsAg-coated Chang <b>cells</b> as <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> {{was developed in}} order to measure cell-mediated immune reactions to HBsAg. The specificity of cytotoxic reactions was tested in experiments using Chang cells conjugated with human serum albumin. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) specific for the HBsAg-coated <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> was demonstrated up to dilutions of anti-HBsAg serum of 10, 000 : 1, when lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of normal individuals were added to the <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> Spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) to HBsAg-coated <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> was demonstrated for lymphocytes from patients with hepatitis B and from patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH), but not for lymphocytes from healthy controls.

In experiments using purified lymphocyte populations evidence is presented that the CMC is T-cell dependent. HLA-restriction of the CMC was not observed.

40|$|SUMMARY-The {{kinetics}} of the {{in vitro}} interaction be-tween activated mouse macrophages and tumor <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> were studied in Swiss-Webster female mice with the use {{of the in}}hibition of uptake of tritiated thymidine by <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> as a quantitative measure of macrophage-effected cytostasis. Unlike the normal macrophage, the in-dividual activated macrophage had an enhanced capacity to inhibit DNA synthesis in tumor <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> Such cy-tostasis appeared to result from direct contact between activated macrophages and <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> Culture condi-tions discouraging direct contact caused little or no cy-tostasis, regardless of the ratio of macrophages to tar-get cells.

5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the <b>target</b> <b>cell,</b> the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E

40|$|The {{pattern of}} species {{restriction}} in cytostatic activity of human breast-milk macrophages (Mph) and murine starch-activated peritoneal exudate (PE) Mph was investigated. Human Mph had appreciable cytostatic activity only for human <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> {{and not for}} murine or avian <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> In contrast, murine Mph were particularly cytostatic for <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> from heterologous species and not as cytostatic for other murine cells. This difference in the activity of murine Mph was more notable when freshly explanted fibroblasts were used as <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> than when the cytostasis of long-term tissue culture lines was measured. Experiments with peripheral blood monocytes from the two species indicated that this pattern of reactivity may be common to mononuclear phagocytes from other sources. Therefore, human Mph are preferentially cytostatic for <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> of self species; whereas, murine Mph are equally if not more cytostatic for <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> from other species...|$|R

5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the <b>target</b> <b>cell.</b> These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E

40|$|Natural killer (NK) {{activity}} is inhibited by the contact of peripheral blood lymphocytes with primary monolayer cell cultures of both benign and malignant origin. In this study {{the effect of}} interferons (IFNs) on the inhibition has been analysed. Both alpha IFN- and gamma IFN-pretreated peripheral blood lymphocytes are effectively inhibited by monolayer <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> IFN treatment of lymphocytes does not change cytotoxicity against the inhibitory <b>target</b> <b>cells,</b> although it enhances reactivity against NK-sensitive <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> Treatment of monolayer cells with interferons significantly reduces their inhibitory capacity. However, diminished inhibition of NK activity by the IFN-treated <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> is not associated with increased lysis, probably due to their decreased sensitivity to natural killer cytotoxic factors (NKCF). In 18. 5 % of the cases studied, monolayer <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> induced endogenous IFN production in lymphocytes. In these cases no inhibition of the NK activity of the effector cells was seen. According {{to the results of}} this paper, IFNs have a dual effect on the NK regulatory system: they enhance the NK activity of the effector <b>cells</b> against NK-sensitive <b>target</b> <b>cells,</b> and they change the NK resistant <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> {{in a way that makes}} them less inhibitory to NK activity but simultaneously more resistant to the toxic factors secreted by NK cells...|$|R
