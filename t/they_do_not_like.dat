It is unknown if Tiny and Lou are brothers. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to give elephant rides unless Willa wants them to. Tiny and Lou sleep in the garage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the zones}} most subject to inundations, {{conifers}} are more rare, since <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> {{in general the}} wetter zones. In these forests, one can find broadleaf trees such as the aspen, very common in the Lower Dalälven, but rare {{in the rest of}} the country. These forests also have English oaks and small-leaved lindens and the wetter forests are mostly made up of alders, birch trees and willows. The richness of these forests and in particular their undergrowth depends above all on the nature of the soil. The poorer soils grow blueberries, bog bilberries, wild rosemary and cloudberry, whereas the richer soils are home in particular to Lily of the valley, woodland strawberries, purple small-reed and yellow loosestrife.|$|E
25|$|In {{fields and}} {{plantations}} of plants <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to eat, e.g., cereals or eucalyptus, the greater rhea {{can be a}} species quite beneficial to farmers. It will eat any large invertebrate it can catch; its food includes locusts and grasshoppers, true bugs, cockroaches, and other pest insects. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed cerrado and agricultural land in Minas Gerais (Brazil), R. a. americana was noted to be particularly fond of beetles. It {{is not clear whether}} this applies to the species in general but for example in pampas habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while Orthoptera might be more important. The greater rhea is able to eat Hymenoptera in quantity. These insects contain among them many who can give painful stings, though the birds do not seem to mind. Sometimes, greater rheas will gather at carrion to feed on flies; they are also known to eat dead or dying fish in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.|$|E

He {{used to collect}} the taxes from the people. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to pay their taxes, and so <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the tax-gatherers, and despised them. And thus the pharisee thanked God that he was <b>not</b> <b>like</b> that publican. 'I fast twice in the week. I pay tithes of all that I possess.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Robyn {{fought with}} her former record label (Jive Records), as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> {{the sound of}} her new synthpop material. In {{particular}} <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> {{the sound of her}} song [...] "Who's That Girl", which charted at #26 in the UK and #37 in Sweden. Robyn decided in early 2005 to leave Jive Records in order to start her own record label thus Konichiwa Records was created, with the aim of liberating Robyn artistically.|$|R
500|$|Comic Book Guy {{opens the}} season premiere {{by telling the}} viewers {{that there will be}} hints in the episode as to the {{conclusion}} of the romance between Ned and Edna. After the revised introduction, where Homer sneaks late into work, sings to the tune of The Police's [...] "Walking on the Moon", and marks up his time card to make it seem like he was on time and had put in some overtime hours, Homer is surprised to find that a new security guard named Wayne has been hired at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He repeatedly tries to befriend Wayne, only to be coldly shunned at every attempt. Meanwhile, while making crackers for Bart and Lisa, Marge daydreams that she has become a contestant on a cooking show called Master Chef. The show is judged by Tom Colicchio and he praises her crackers, awarding her the prize of a new kitchen. However, when Marge stops daydreaming and gives the crackers to her children, they tell her <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> them because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> change.|$|E
500|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{know about the}} forum and have on several {{occasions}} read the comments made on it. The character Comic Book Guy is often used in the show to lampoon {{and respond to the}} newsgroups fans. In interviews some writers have admitted that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> being scrutinized, but other writers have participated in the discussions on the forum. Independent commentators call the forum an example of an [...] "active audience" [...] and have claimed The Simpsons is tailor-made for such a forum.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, New Brian's {{constant}} cheerfulness {{begins to}} aggravate Stewie. Stewie pleads for Brian to return, but he informs him {{that as long}} as New Brian is there, he has no place in the Griffin household. Stewie reveals to New Brian that [...] <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> several of his traits, including how he humps the leg of one of their chairs, but New Brian replies by boasting about how he violated Rupert, Stewie's teddy bear. Stewie then brutally kills and chops up New Brian off-screen, throws his remains in the garbage and forges a suicide note. The Griffins then ultimately accept Brian back, while Stewie, traumatized by what happened to Rupert, frantically washes him in the shower while comforting him.|$|E

Lutz (John Lutz), Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway), Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), and Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson)—vent {{their anger}} at Liz; they {{complain}} that Boston is colder than New York, and <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> sharing an {{office with the}} all-male staff of Boston Bruins fans who write for the Bruins Beat. Liz gets a tip from Jack to find a common enemy in the Boston affiliate of NBC. Liz comes up with the name [...] "Dale Snitterman", and tells the staff that Snitterman is causing all of their problems, not realizing until later {{that she had seen}} the name somewhere and did not make it up. At that point, the staff finds Snitterman (Ray Bokhour) and harass him.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, PSXextreme's Ben Dutka, felt that Zack was {{not worthy of}} his own game, believing that only players with [...] "halfway decent memories" [...] and a [...] "hardcore completionist mentality" [...] {{will be able to}} {{remember}} Zack's appearances in the original Final Fantasy VII. IGN UK expressed a mixed opinion about the character, feeling his personality was sometimes annoying, although it served to contrast with the serious attitudes of the other main characters. Similarly, VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole called Zack Cloud's [...] "identical twin in all but hair colour," [...] and complained about his personality being [...] "annoying" [...] {{during the first half of}} the game. Destructoid agreed, telling players not to expect to enjoy Zack if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> [...] "cocky teenagers," [...] and even labelling him an [...] "annoying cockhole." [...] Gameplanet criticized Rick Gomez' acting, finding it more immature than they expected. PALGN called Zack an unfamiliar character in the series since his only appearances were in backstories.|$|E

2500|$|The Culture {{stories are}} largely about {{problems}} and paradoxes that confront liberal societies. The Culture itself is an [...] "ideal-typical" [...] liberal society; that is, as pure an example {{as one can}} reasonably imagine. It is highly egalitarian; the liberty of the individual is its most important value; and all actions and decisions {{are expected to be}} determined according to a standard of reasonability and sociability inculcated into all people through a progressive system of education. It is a society so beyond material scarcity that for almost all practical purposes its people can have and do what they want. If <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the behavior or opinions of others, they can easily move to a more congenial Culture population centre (or Culture subgroup), and hence there is little need to enforce codes of behavior.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} novel, Harry, Ron, and Hermione {{are no longer}} {{students}} of Care of Magical Creatures, and Hagrid is both angry and disappointed with them during {{the first part of}} the book, but he soon realises that it is not because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> him. Later in the novel, Aragog dies, and Hagrid risks his life to recover the acromantula's body to give it a proper funeral. After the funeral, he and Horace Slughorn drink excessive amounts of Firewhisky, and Harry takes advantage of this situation (under the influence of Felix Felicis potion, otherwise known as [...] "liquid luck") to retrieve a certain memory from Slughorn. Towards the end of the book, Death Eaters attack Hogwarts and Hagrid's hut is set on fire as he tries to fight them. [...] During Dumbledore’s funeral, Hagrid is seen carrying the Headmaster’s body.|$|E
