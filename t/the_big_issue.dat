5|$|Specific {{business}} models for street newspapers vary widely, ranging from vendor-managed papers that place the highest value upon homeless empowerment and involvement to highly professionalized and commercialized weeklies. Some papers (especially in Europe) operate as autonomous businesses, while others operate {{as parts of}} existing organizations or projects. There are papers that are very successful, such as the UK-based <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue,</b> which in 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of 1 millionUSD in profits, but many papers sell as few as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.|$|E

25|$|Street {{newspapers}} are {{a tool for}} allowing homeless individuals to work. In New York City, in 1989, a street newspaper was created called Street News which put some homeless to work, some writing, producing, and mostly selling the paper on streets and trains. Street News is written pro bono {{by a combination of}} homeless, celebrities, and established writers. In 1991, in England, a street newspaper, following the New York model was established, called <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> and is published weekly. Its circulation has grown to 300,000.|$|E

500|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue,</b> the world's {{most widely}} circulated street newspaper, {{is a good}} example of these two schools of thought. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news; while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless, the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them. [...] In the late 1990s when the London-based paper began making plans to enter markets in the United States, many American street newspaper publishers reacted defensively, saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> or that <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless. The reaction to <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized, professional papers and more grassroots-style ones, with papers such as <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money. [...] Some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to [...] "fill the void" [...] in mainstream media coverage, whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income.|$|E

500|$|Unlike most street newspapers, the UK-based <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> focuses {{mostly on}} celebrity news and interviews, rather than {{coverage}} of homelessness and poverty. It is still sold by homeless vendors {{and uses the}} bulk of its proceeds to support homeless individuals and advocacy organizations for the homeless, but the paper's content is mostly written by professional staff and geared towards a broad audience.

500|$|Street {{newspapers}} are sold mainly by homeless individuals, but the newspapers vary {{in how much}} content is submitted by them {{and how much of}} the coverage pertains to them: while some papers are written and published mainly by homeless contributors, others have a professional staff and attempt to emulate [...] mainstream publications. [...] These differences have caused controversy among street newspaper publishers over what type of material should be covered and to what extent the homeless should participate in writing and production. [...] One popular street newspaper, <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue,</b> has been a focus of this controversy because it concentrates on attracting a large readership through coverage of mainstream issues and popular culture, whereas other newspapers emphasize homeless advocacy and social issues and earn less of a profit.|$|E

500|$|Fraser Nelson, {{editor of}} The Spectator, {{suggested}} the programme had highlighted {{a section of}} society who have been forgotten by the politicians: [...] "These people are people who otherwise don’t have a voice. They don’t vote, so for many years they have just not mattered". Nelson's comments were echoed by Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail, who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically: [...] "The real scandal of Benefits Street, in fact, is what it tells us about a welfare system that abandons thousands of people – {{through no fault of}} their own – to a life without hope or ambition, effectively turning them into an underclass, dependent on the charity of the State." [...] Charlie Brooker also felt the programme had been [...] "broadly sympathetic" [...] to those it portrays. In the Daily Mirror, entrepreneur John Bird, founder of <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue,</b> wrote that although Benefits Street did not fully represent the spectrum of people who claim benefits, it did show what could happen to those forgotten by the system [...] "who get caught in a kind of social suicide".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of street newspapers, people were often {{reluctant}} to buy from homeless vendors for fear that they were being scammed. Furthermore, many of the more activist papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived to be unprofessional and lackluster. [...] Topics covered are sometimes seen as lacking newsworthy content, and of little relevance or interest to [...] the general public or the homeless community." [...] have traditionally been long on personal essays and short on hard news". [...] Organizations in Montreal and San Francisco have responded to these criticisms by offering workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors. Papers such as StreetWise have in the past been criticized as [...] "grim" [...] and for having vendors that are too loud and intrusive. Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as many people will donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then throw it away. Howley has described readers' hesitance or unwillingness to read the papers as [...] "compassion fatigue". On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue,</b> are often targets of criticism for being too [...] "mainstream" [...] or commercial.|$|E
