5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> eruptions {{in terms}} of activity, {{explosive}} eruptions and effusive eruptions. Explosive eruptions are characterized by gas-driven explosions that propels magma and tephra. Effusive eruptions, meanwhile, are characterized by the outpouring of lava without significant explosive eruption.|$|E
5|$|Revolving {{funds are}} similar to the Proprietary funds used by state and local governments for business-like activities. The term, revolving, means that it conducts a {{continuing}} cycle of activity. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> revolving funds in the Federal Funds Group: public enterprise funds and intragovernmental revolving funds.|$|E
5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances {{are taken into}} the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E

5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} the budding of new polyps. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp {{develops}} on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc {{with a series of}} mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E
5|$|In mammals <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> {{immunoglobulin}} light chain, {{which are}} called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate {{length of a}} light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Teleostei).|$|E
5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem. Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on {{the degree to which}} objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.|$|E

5|$|In the People's Republic of China, Mongolian is a co-official {{language}} with Mandarin Chinese in some regions, notably the entire Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The traditional alphabet {{has always been}} used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the Sino-Soviet split. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> written Mongolian used in China: the traditional Mongolian script, which is official among Mongols nationwide, and the Clear script, used predominantly among Oirats in Xinjiang.|$|E
5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} {{are truly}} elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons {{are composed of}} two up quarks (each with charge +) and one down quark (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.|$|E
5|$|The Sharia {{courts have}} general {{jurisdiction}} over most {{civil and criminal}} cases. At present, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> courts of first instance: general courts and summary courts dealing with lesser cases. Cases are adjudicated by single judges, except criminal cases if the potential sentence is death, amputation or stoning {{when there is a}} panel of three judges. There are also two courts for the Shia minority in the Eastern Province dealing with family and religious matters. Appellate courts sit in Mecca and Riyadh and review decisions for compliance with Sharia.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> electoral {{division}} or constituency in Singapore: the Single Member Constituency (SMC) and the Group Representation Constituency (GRC). In a GRC, {{a number of}} candidates comes together to stand for elections to Parliament as a group. Each voter of a GRC casts a ballot for a team of candidates, and not for individual candidates. The GRC scheme was brought into existence on 1 June 1988 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1988 and the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 1988.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> field events: jumps, and throws. In jumping competitions, {{athletes are}} judged {{on either the}} length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an {{ordinary}} one. The pre-copulatory behavior of scaly-breasted munia includes {{a sequence of}} actions. The first involves either the male or female playing with nest-material. As soon as a bird has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zig-zag path. Once a bird lands close to its partner, the male bends towards the female and wipes its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E

5|$|All baleen {{whales are}} carnivorous; however a 2015 study {{revealed}} they house gut flora {{similar to that}} of terrestrial herbivores. Different kinds of prey are found in different abundances depending on location, and each type of whale is adapted to a specialized way of foraging. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> feeding behaviors: skim-feeding and lunge-feeding, but some species do both depending on the type and amount of food. For example, Antarctic whales mostly feed on euphausiids; however, this is mainly effective for lunge-feeders, whereas skim-feeders, like the right whales, feed primarily on copepods. They feed alone or in small groups. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food, and their kidneys excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> multiplicities. In his set theory, {{when it is}} assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms to explain why {{elements}} always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen {{and the other is}} 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E
