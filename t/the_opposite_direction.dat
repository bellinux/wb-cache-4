5|$|The term Cyclone {{was coined}} by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to {{describe}} the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the term {{for the kind of}} weather around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> of a cyclone. In British English, <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{considers}} the extended {{problem of the}} boundary layer flow over a flat plate or Blasius problem by considering a uniform free stream parallel to a static or moving flat plate. The plate is assumed to move in <b>the</b> same or <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> to <b>the</b> free stream. The governing partial differential equations are first transformed into an ordinary differential equation, before being solved numerically. Dual solutions are found to exist when the plate and the free stream move in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{considered}} the flux of neutrinos moving from the source in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions.</b> <b>The</b> state of two neutrinos moving in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> is a superposition of the state |ψ_ 12 > and the state |ψ_ 21 > in which the positions of neutrinos are interchanged. Neutrinos in the state |ψ_ 21 > are P-transformed with respect to neutrinos in the state |ψ_ 12 > therefore if one detects neutrinos in the state |ψ_ 12 > it is forbidden to detect neutrinos in the state |ψ_ 21 >. Under detection the number of neutrinos decreases two times, and the energy of neutrinos increases two times. Hence one can detect only {{one half of the}} solar neutrino flux predicted by the SSM that may provide a solution for the solar neutrino puzzle...|$|R

Essentially, the aerobatic Immelmann comprises an ascending half-loop followed by a half-roll, resulting in level flight in <b>the</b> exact <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> at a higher altitude.

5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing.

5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap {{may be involved in}} the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E

5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> in the fall.

5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time.
