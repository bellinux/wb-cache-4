5000|$|Radeau <b>Land</b> <b>Tortoise</b> (Shipwreck) is the Lake George {{site of a}} {{shipwreck}} {{from the}} French and Indian Wars era. The vessel is a radeau. Simple in construction, it was built by Capt. Samuel Cobb of Falmouth, now Portland, Province of Maine for the British and Colonial forces in 1758 to help combat the French in North America. She was built in just over a month, launched, tested ("rowed well with 26 oars") and then two days later intentionally sunk by adding ballast with plans to re-float her {{in the spring of}} 1759. This plan was never fulfilled, however, leaving the <b>Land</b> <b>Tortoise</b> at the bottom of Lake George for more than two centuries. [...] It {{is believed to be the}} oldest intact warship in North America, and is the only surviving ship of its type. [...] It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998.

50|$|Dug by the Cure {{river in}} a {{limestone}} massif from the Mesozoic (secondary era), the caves {{were used as}} shelter by humans since at least 200,000 years ago.

5000|$|The {{habitat of}} a sea turtle has a {{significant}} influence on its morphology. Sea turtles are able to grow so large because of the immense size of their habitat: the ocean.
