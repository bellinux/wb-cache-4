5000|$|Comparing {{himself with}} Ferreira, Mourinho wrote, [...] "One is a coach with a 30-year career, the other <b>with</b> a three-year <b>one.</b> <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> 30 years {{has never won}} anything; <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> three years has won a lot. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> who has coached for 30 years has an {{enormous}} career; <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> three years has a small career. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> a 30-year career will be forgotten when he ends it; <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> three could end it right now and he could never be erased from history. This could be {{the story of a}} donkey who worked for 30 years but never became a horse." [...] Despite these claims by Mourinho, Ferreira went on to make history by becoming the first Portuguese coach to win three consecutive titles in Portugal, a feat that Mourinho never achieved. Mourinho also was Ferreira's assistant in 1990-91, for Estrela da Amadora.|$|R

International election observers concluded that had opposition parties contested, they could have garnered seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the program was to reduce traffic and air {{pollution}} (it was based on a fee structure according to the vehicle's engine emission standards) and to use the funds raised through the charge to finance public transportation projects, cycle paths and green vehicles. This program was similar to the congestion pricing programs implemented in London and Stockholm, but actually corresponded to a variation of these pricing schemes as only vehicles with high-polluting engines entering the ZTL were charged, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> older most polluting engines were banned.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 1960s there was growing {{concern in the}} United States {{about the effects of}} urban sprawl and the {{resulting}} urban decay that followed. Major cities across the country were watching their downtown cores turn into ghost towns as the suburbs expanded and caused a flight of capital out of the cities. The only cities that were combatting this were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> effective mass transit systems, cities like New York City and Boston, where the utility of the subway was greater than a car. However, these solutions were extremely expensive to develop, well beyond the budgets of smaller cities or the suburbs of larger ones. Through the 1960s there was a growing movement in urban planning circles that the solution was the personal rapid transit system, small automated vehicles that were much less expensive to develop.|$|E
25|$|During the Spanish colonial period, Spaniards {{developed}} a complex caste {{system based on}} race, which was used for social control and which also determined a person's rights in society. There were four main categories of race: (1) Peninsular - a Spaniard born in Spain, (2) Criollo (fem. criolla) - a person of Spanish descent born in Mesoamerica, (3) Indio (fem. India) - {{a person who is}} a native of, or indigenous to, Mesoamerica, and (4) Negro (fem. Negra) - a person of African slave descent. There were also other caste groups like the Mestizos/Mestizas that had one Spanish and one Indian parent. The Castizos which had one Mestizo parent and one Spanish parent, the children of a Castizo were generally accepted as a Criollo. Mulatto/Mulatta were usually <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> one Spanish and one Black parent, if a mulatto was born in slavery they were considered slaves as well unless the mother was free then they would be free too.|$|E

25|$|Braille was {{introduced}} to Britain in 1861. In 1876, a French-based system with a few hundred English contractions and abbreviations was adopted as the predominant script in Great Britain. However, the contractions and abbreviations proved unsatisfactory, and in 1902 the current grade-2 system, called Revised Braille, was adopted in the British Commonwealth. In 1878, the ideal of basing all braille alphabets {{of the world on}} the original French alphabetic order was accepted by Britain, Germany, and Egypt (see International Braille). In the United States at the time, three scripts were used: non-braille New York Point; American Braille, which was reordered so that the most frequent letters were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> the fewest dots; and a variation of English Braille, which was reordered to match the English alphabet, assigning the values wxyz to the letters that, in France and England, stood for xyzç. A partially contracted English Braille, Grade 1½, was adopted in Britain in 1918, and fully contracted Grade 2, with a few minor concessions to the Americans, was adopted in 1932. The concessions were to swap the British two-dot capital sign with the one-dot emphasis sign, which had generally been omitted anyway (as capitals had been in New York Point), to drop a few religious contractions from general usage, and to introduce a rule stating that contractions and abbreviations should not span 'major' syllable boundaries.|$|E
25|$|During {{her first}} term, Benazir Bhutto had {{strained}} {{relationship with the}} Pakistan Armed Forces, especially with Pakistan Army. Army chief Mirza Aslam Beg had cold relations with the elected prime minister, and continued to undermine her authority. As for the military appointments, Benazir Bhutto refused to appoint General Beg as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, instead invited Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey to take {{the chairmanship of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 1988, Benazir Bhutto appointed Air Chief Marshal Hakimullah as the Chief of Air Staff and Admiral Jastural Haq as the Chief of Naval Staff. In 1988, shortly after assuming the office, Benazir Bhutto paid a visit to Siachen region, to boost the moral of the soldiers who fought the Siachen war with India. This was the first visit of any civilian leader to any military war-zone area since the country's independence in 1947. In 1988, Benazir appointed Major-General Pervez Musharraf as Director-General of the Army Directorate General for Military Operations (DGMO); and then-Brigadier-General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani as her Military-Secretary. In 1989, the Pakistan Army exposed the alleged Operation Midnight Jackal against the government of Benazir Bhutto. When she learned the news, Benazir Bhutto ordered the arrest and trial of former ISI officer Brigadier Imtiaz Ahmad and Major Amir Khan, it was later revealed that it was General Beg who was behind this plot. General Beg soon paid the price in 1993 elections, when Benazir Bhutto politically destroyed the former general and his career was over before taking any shifts in politics. During her first term, Benazir Bhutto had successfully removed senior military officers including Lieutenant-Generals Hamid Gul, Zahid Ali Akbar Khan, General Jamal A. Khan, and Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan, all of whom had anti-democratic views and were closely aligned to General Zia, replacing them with officers who were educated in Western military institutes and academies, generally <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> more westernised democratic views.|$|E
