5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> is only truly parallax free at infinity, <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> has an error circle {{equal to the}} diameter of the collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of <b>the</b> <b>sight)</b> this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E
5|$|As the {{computor}} {{held the}} level line and was sending angle commands to <b>the</b> <b>sight,</b> it eliminated {{the need for}} a two-axis gyro in the sighting head itself. The gyro on <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> head only adjusted for rotation of the aircraft around its roll axis.|$|E
5|$|Holographic weapon sights {{are similar}} in layout to {{reflector}} sights but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead, a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into <b>the</b> <b>sight.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E
50|$|On October 3, 2011 <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> {{of almost}} 20 {{porpoises}} {{was reported in}} Chinese media. <b>The</b> <b>sighting</b> was done from a bridge in Nanjing city. It should be noted however, that <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> has not been confirmed by independent media sources.|$|R
50|$|To achieve natural {{point of}} aim, the shooter settles into {{position}} while not looking through <b>the</b> <b>sights.</b> Some shooters actually close their eyes, but this can upset the natural maintenance of balance because the brain uses visual cues to help stay in balance. The shooter looks through <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> only after ensuring the position is comfortable and the firearm is {{resting in the}} stance with minimal muscle tension. If <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> are not resting on the desired point of impact, the shooter adjusts the position by repeating the same steps until <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> rest on <b>the</b> target. After achieving a comfortable and natural position, if <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> {{are not on the}} target, the shooter adjusts his stance (moves his feet) until <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> are on target. The arm, head and body position do not change; when standing only the feet are moved to bring <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> onto target.|$|R
5000|$|In {{temperature}} extremes <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> exhibited thermal drift, {{which is when}} <b>the</b> <b>sight's</b> point of aim differed from its point of impact.| ...|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> manually. The drift angle was whatever angle <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on <b>the</b> <b>sight.</b> Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on <b>the</b> <b>sight)</b> were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical calculator inside the console, or computor. The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> head to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> head replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern reflector sight that {{was easy to see}} at night. <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> could be rotated manually to view objects well in front of the aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sights,</b> in <b>the</b> {{form of an}} open-framework tube {{containing}} a crosshairs, was mounted to the horizontal slider on a vertical square tube. Sightings could be taken either through the crosshairs or along open <b>sights</b> on <b>the</b> top of the tube. A geared rack running {{down the back of}} the tube held <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> at a selected angle, and the angle was adjusted by rotating a geared knob {{on the right side of}} <b>the</b> <b>sights.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> were rotated upwards, they forced the horizontal slider to the rear, moving the pointer over the map.|$|R
50|$|The {{first leg}} of the tour {{featured}} <b>The</b> <b>Sights.</b> Whilst on their first European leg in June, 'The Bots' opened up for them. During their second US leg of the tour in June and July, either Urge Overkill, The Protomen or <b>the</b> <b>Sights</b> opened for them depending on the show. During their second European tour in October, <b>the</b> <b>Sights</b> opened for them again.|$|R
50|$|Each holiday group {{includes}} {{an equal number}} of blind/partially sighted and sighted individuals. Blind travellers pair daily with different <b>sighted</b> ones, and <b>the</b> <b>sighted</b> traveller describes <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> to their blind partner. The role of <b>the</b> <b>sighted</b> individual is to be a fellow traveller and not to act as a carer. Sighted travellers receive a discount on the price of their holiday in return for this ‘use of their eyes’.|$|R

5|$|Akhtab {{eventually}} {{managed to}} enter and persuade them that the Muslims would surely be overwhelmed. <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> of the vast Confederate armies, surging over the land with soldiers and horses {{as far as the}} eye could see, swung the Qurayza opinion in the favour of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism. This was added to the range angle calculated by the computor to move <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> head. Levelling the system required adjustment of both the computor and <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> head. Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried out on the ground and then left alone. Any adjustments required were recorded on a card fixed {{to the front of the}} computor.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sights</b> are of <b>the</b> {{traditional}} SIG {{design and}} configuration, with a dot on <b>the</b> front <b>sight</b> and a rectangle on <b>the</b> rear <b>sight.</b> To aim using <b>the</b> <b>sights,</b> <b>the</b> shooter simply aligns the dot over the rectangle. The magazine release is located behind {{and below the}} magazine floor plate. The magazine is released by pushing the lever towards {{the rear of the}} grip, at which point the magazine can be removed from the pistol.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the reason}} why rifles are sighted in for {{specific}} target distances. This means that <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> are adjusted so that the bullet will hit the location on the target viewed in the center of <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> at a known distance. When shooting at a target significantly closer or farther than the distance for which <b>the</b> rifle was <b>sighted</b> in, <b>the</b> shooter must know about how much higher or lower than the center of <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>the</b> bullet will hit and adjust the aim accordingly. The study of bullet trajectories after they leave the firearm is known as external ballistics.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of navigation data collected using a hand-held space sextant {{on the second}} and third manned Skylab missions was presented. From performance data and astronaut comments it was determined that: (1) the space sextant, <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> station, and <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> techniques require modification; (2) <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> window must be of good optical quality; (3) astronaut performance was stable over long mission time; and (4) sightings made with a hand-held sextant were accurate and precise enough for reliable interplanetary manual navigation...|$|R

5|$|It {{is claimed}} that <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> of harbour, from St. Decuman’s Church, {{was the primary}} {{inspiration}} for Coleridge to start the poem, having walked over the Quantock Hills, {{from his home in}} Nether Stowey, with friends William and Dorothy Wordsworth. In September 2003, a commemorative statue, by Alan B Herriot of Penicuik, Scotland, was unveiled at the harbour.|$|E
50|$|In Switzerland the SG 510 is {{also used}} for target {{shooting}} matches. For this <b>the</b> standard iron <b>sights</b> can be replaced by target shooting diopter and globe sight <b>sighting</b> lines. When <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> line radius is kept at its original length Swiss sport shooters refer to a such modified rifle as Stgw 57/02. When <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> line radius is lengthened by mounting <b>the</b> globe <b>sight</b> nearer to <b>the</b> muzzle it {{is referred to as}} Stgw 57/03.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Flash <b>Sight</b> Picture is {{a method}} of {{allowing}} the cognitive faculties of the shooter to align the target and <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> without <b>the</b> delay involved in the conscious alignment of sights, as used when slow-firing a rifle at a distant target. In point shooting, by contrast, the pistol is drawn from the holster and fired from the hip, without <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> being aligned at all.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sights</b> are military-style ghost {{ring and}} are {{adjustable}} {{in the field}} using only a cartridge rim. <b>The</b> MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny <b>sight</b> rail on top allows use of both conventional and night-vision sights, while retaining use of <b>the</b> original <b>sights.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate <b>the</b> <b>sight,</b> like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
5|$|The main {{design feature}} of the Mk. XIV was that it gave the bomb aimer more {{time to work on}} the problem of {{bringing}} the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> throughout the bomb run. <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus their eyes on the target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} line on <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> was relatively short, {{and could not}} be used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|E
40|$|Extinctions {{of plant}} and animal species are rarely {{observed}} directly and must be inferred from sighting or collection records. The inference about extinction that can be drawn from a sighting record depends on <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> rate. Existing methods assume that the form of <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> rate is known and may be sensitive to deviations from the assumed form. A simple nonparametric test is proposed that makes minimal assumptions about <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> rate. <b>The</b> test is illustrated by application to collection records of nine Mauritian orchid species...|$|R

50|$|The {{issue of}} using sight-reliant shooting, which {{relies on the}} use of <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> for aiming in close {{quarters}} combat situations, versus point shooting, which does not rely on <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> for aiming in close quarters combat situations, has been debated since as early as 1835.|$|R
5|$|These {{operations}} require {{from all}} of us – officers and men – exceptional efforts, sustained day and night, despite a moral tension tested to its limits by <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> of the devastation wrought by a pitiless invader. However severe the trial may be, you will come through it gallantly.|$|E
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} {{account of the}} battle, given by Henry of Huntingdon, stated that Rædwald's army was split into three formations, led by Rædwald, Rægenhere, and Edwin. With more experienced fighters, Æthelfrith attacked in loose formation. At <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> of Rægenhere, perhaps thinking he was Edwin, Æthelfrith's men cut their way through to him and slew him. After {{the death of his}} son, Rædwald furiously breached his lines, killing Æthelfrith amid a great slaughter of the Northumbrians.|$|E
