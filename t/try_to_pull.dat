5|$|While Lowestoffe was sailing {{through the}} Caicos passage late on 10 August, Pamplin {{realised}} that the strong currents known {{to run through}} the channel had reversed direction and Lowestoffe was running into shallow waters. He attempted to avoid grounding, but to no avail, and the Lowestoffe ran broadside onto Little Inagua (“Heneaga”) Island. The crew threw stores and equipment overboard to lighten the ship, and boats came from other ships in the convoy to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> her off. The attempts to refloat her failed and her crew abandoned her by mid-afternoon. The only casualties were five men who drowned when their boat capsized in the surf. The change in currents also caused the wreck of five merchantmen. In the late afternoon of 11 August Acasta left Bonetta and three of her own boats to help the wrecked vessels and then took command of the convoy.|$|E

Rescuers should avoid endangering themselves unnecessarily and where possible should provide assistance from a safe position, such as a boat, or by providing flotation or a means of towing from a distance.|$|E

In the chaos, the two fight and Ben manages to wrestle the gun away and shoots Harry. Harry stumbles into the cellar and collapses next to Karen, mortally wounded. She has also died from her illness. The ghouls <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> Helen and Barbra through the windows, but Helen frees herself. She returns to the refuge of the cellar to see Karen is reanimated and eating Harry's corpse. Helen is frozen in shock, and Karen stabs her {{to death with a}} masonry trowel. Barbra, seeing Johnny among the zombies, is carried away by the horde and devoured. As the zombies overrun the house, Ben fights off Karen and seals himself inside the cellar, where Harry and Helen are reanimating, and he is forced to shoot them.|$|E

The polaznik goes out into the yard, and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of {{household}} on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The polaznik usually stays for dinner with the family.

Hopman considered sending a torpedo boat to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> Albatross free, but the threat of Russian vessels in the area led him to abandon the idea.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall {{is known as a}} [...] "lone wolf" [...] because he never shows his feelings and seems cold to his associates. His superiors (such as teacher Quistis Trepe) consider him difficult to deal with, but respect his talents. Squall is stoic, with his taciturn nature used for comic relief. He is dragged into a heroic role when Cid, headmaster of Balamb Garden, appoints him leader of the academy midway through the game. During a late battle against Galbadia Garden, Squall has difficulty exhibiting leadership because of his lingering isolation. Although other characters <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> him out of his shell and Rinoa Heartilly expends considerable energy pursuing him, it takes time for him to accept the others' friendship, fall in love with Rinoa and care for her. Squall is more comfortable later in a leadership role, especially when he must fight Ultimecia.|$|E

500|$|The game's design {{came from}} Iwata, {{who was able}} to {{transport}} his original ideas directly into the game as far as the NES' graphical capabilities could be taken at that time. He said: [...] "the goal was really to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off the best graphics on the NES to date. Simple graphics were more or less the standard on the NES at the time but I had this firm belief {{that it was possible to}} do something better, something prettier. I feel like we pulled it off and were able to show people what could be done [...] It left an impression around the office, and from what I've heard [...] influenced the work of other games that were later made by other NES developers as well." [...] The game's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft's staff and an outside composer, Naoki Kodaka, who had previously worked on scores for many of the company's other titles. Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that [...] "none of those people are working together anymore since they've all separated from Sunsoft [...] ".|$|E

500|$|The Phillies {{initially}} acquired Mayberry for {{his power}} hitting potential, and throughout his ascent through the minor leagues, he hit double-digit home runs, but his plate discipline was poor, as {{he struck out}} on over 20% of plate appearances. According to ESPN hot zones, Mayberry hits pitches {{in the middle of}} the plate belt-high, as well as pitches down and inside the best, while he struggles predominantly on outside pitches. Mayberry has long been considered a good athlete, and finally honed his speed to translate it to success on the basepaths – he stole many bases in the minor leagues, but only 14 in the major leagues. The Hardball Times once published a piece that compared his hitting ability to that of Mike Morse in terms of their similar power hitting ability. From 2011–2013, Mayberry performed significantly better against left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers. Against lefties, he totaled 21 home runs and 53 RBIs in 377 at bats with a batting average of [...]273, whereas against righties, he totaled 19 home runs and 81 RBIs in 684 at bats with a batting average of [...]231. Kenny Ayres, a writer for Phillies Nation, commented that [...] "between the long looping swing, chasing sliders three feet outside and his frustrating tendency to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> everything, Mayberry has earned just about as low a score for the season as a position player can have" [...] in regards to his 2013 season.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} generations of baseball, the {{emphasis}} was mostly on bat control, place hitting, bunting, etc. But, starting in 1919, several factors resulted in a dramatic expansion of strategic orientation, supplementing traditional [...] "small ball" [...] with the [...] "power game": a [...] "livelier" [...] ball, because of better materials and a tighter weave; more frequent substitutions of new balls; lighter, more flexible bats; the outlawing of the spitball; {{and the increase in}} attendance which drove owners to build more outfield seating, thus reducing the outfield area significantly. The power game has been encouraged further in recent years, by the construction of new ballparks with smaller outfields than previously, and even the reduction of field size at [...] "classic" [...] ballparks known for spacious outfields; for example, the distance to the fence in deep left field at the original Yankee Stadium was reduced from [...] between 1984 and 1988 (the post-1988 dimensions were maintained at the current Yankee Stadium). Still, it is generally agreed that no one can hit a home run at will, and every successful batter knows never to go to the plate intending to hit a home run. Rather, he should attempt a level swing, <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> only the ball {{on the inside of the}} plate, go the other way with balls low and outside, and otherwise start each at bat intending to drive the ball up the middle, which is the most vulnerable part of the infield (especially if the pitcher is not particularly good at fielding his position).|$|E
