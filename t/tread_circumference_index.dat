40|$|Head <b>circumference</b> inter-orbital <b>index</b> is an {{important}} parameter in craniofacial anthropometry. The knowledge of its normal values for a particular region {{can be used in}} the treatment of certain craniofacial abnormalities. This study was conducted in Otolo, Okofia, Nnewi, Anambra State, Nigeria. A total of 349 (175 females and 174 males) adult Igbo’s between the ages of 19 - 29 years selected for the study. The ages were grouped as follows: 19 - 22 years (167 subjects, 47. 85 %), 23 - 26 years (125 subjects, 35. 81 %) and 27 - 29 years (57 subjects, 16. 33 %). They were made up of Igbo origins. The inner canthal distance (ICD) and head circumferences (HC) of the subjects were measured using standard anthropometric methods and head <b>circumference</b> inter-orbital <b>index</b> calculated as ICD/HCx 100. The result obtained showed that Igbo females had a head <b>circumference</b> inter-orbital <b>index</b> of 10. 49 while the males had head <b>circumference</b> inter-orbital <b>index</b> of 10. 62. Statistical observation showed that the males had a significantly higher (P> 0. 05) head <b>circumference</b> inter-orbital <b>index</b> than the females.

Design: Cross-sectional sample (n = 227; boys = 127) of pre-pubertal Black children (age range 8. 8 to 11. 0 years) from the Bone Health sub-study of the Bt 20 birth cohort study set in Soweto-Johannesburg, South Africa. Measures of height, weight, and waist circumference by anthropometry, total and truncal fat and lean mass by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) were used in the analysis. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to examine the associations between BMI, WC, and body composition outcomes. Results: WC was independent of height when height was raised to a power of approximately 0. 8. BMI and WCI (WC/Ht) were significantly associated with total and truncal fat and lean mass in both sexes (all P < 0. 001). BMI demonstrated consistently and significantly higher correlations with body composition than WCI and this association was significantly greater for fat mass than lean mass.

An {{increase}} in total adiposity {{and in particular}} an abdominal distribution of adiposity {{may contribute to the}} decline in metabolic insulin sensitivity observed in older men and women. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine which measure of abdominal adiposity would provide the best sex-independent predictor of metabolic insulin sensitivity in older men and women. Methods. Insulin sensitivity and abdominal adiposity were measured in healthy, nondiabetic older (64 6 6 years; mean 6 standard deviation) men (n 23) and women (n 31). Metabolic Insulin Sensitivity Index (SI) was determined from a frequently sampled insulin-assisted intravenous glucose tolerance test. Body fat mass and abdominal fat mass were determined from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Anthropometric measures included waist and hip circumferences, height, and body weight. Results. Although waist <b>circumference,</b> waist <b>index</b> (waist <b>circumference</b> divided by height), and waist–hip ratio (WHR) were all lower in women than in men, there was no sex difference in DXA L 1 –L 4 fat mass.

The therapeutic effects on ankle <b>circumference,</b> articular <b>index,</b> and radiographic and histological scores were evaluated in AdIDO-injected ankle joints. We further determined CD 4 þ T-cell numbers and their apoptotic status, CD 68 þ macrophage numbers, kynurenine (a downstream tryptophan metabolite) concentrations, interleukin- 17 (IL- 17) levels, and retinoic acid-related or-phan receptor gt (RORgt) expression in synovial tissues of CIA rats receiving AdIDO treatment. Reduction of ankle <b>circumference,</b> articular <b>index,</b> and radiographic and histological scores were noted in AdIDO-treated ankles, as compared with those receiving injection of control vectors. Furthermore, IDO gene transfer led to decreased infiltrating CD 4 þ T cells with enhanced apoptosis, reduced CD 68 þ macrophage numbers, increased kynurenine levels, lower IL- 17 concentrations, and decreased RORgt expression within the ankle joints. In addition, such a therapy diminished type II collagen-specific IL- 17 production and RORgt expression in CD 4 þ T cells from draining lymph nodes of CIA rats.

We enrolled 511 Taiwanese individuals for the analysis. The clinical usefulness of various parameters [...] such as traditional lipid levels and ratios; visceral adiposity indicators, visceral adiposity index (VAI), and lipid accumulation product (LAP); the product of triglyceride (TG) and FPG (the TyG index); TyG with adiposity status (TyG-body mass index [BMI]) and TyG-waist <b>circumference</b> <b>index</b> [WC]); and adipokine levels and ratios [...] was analyzed to identify IR. For all lipid ratios, the TG/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio had the highest additional percentage of variation in the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; 7. 0 % in total); for all variables of interest, TyG-BMI and leptin-adiponectin ratio (LAR) were strongly associated with HOMA-IR, with 16. 6 % and 23. 2 % of variability, respectively. A logistic regression analysis revealed similar patterns. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that TG/HDL-C was a more efficient IR discriminator than other lipid variables or ratios.

Anthropometric indices of obesity are screening tools to determine subjects at risk of cardiovascular disease all over the world. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between abdominal obesity and the early stage of atherosclerosis by Carotid Intima- Media Thickness (CIMT) on women.   Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 100 healthy women aged 18 – 50 year. Anthropometric indices were measured and calculated according to standard protocol. Cut off points for waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) were 88 cm, 0. 8 and 0. 5 respectively Carotid Intima- Media Thickness was determined by using non-invasive ultrasound as an indicator of early stage of atherosclerosis. Subjects with mean CIMT≤ 0. 8 mm and CIMT> 0. 8 mm were considered as "normal subjects" and "subjects at risk", respectively.   Results: Average age of subjects was 30. 96 ± 8. 1 and the mean of WC, WHR, WHtR and CIMT were 95 ± 0. 17, 0. 87 ± 0. 08, 0. 61 ± 0. 11 and 0. 63 ± 0. 15, respectively.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of frame size is a problematic and ambiguous area. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess the level of agreement between various techniques of assessing frame size in a group of 27 healthy and active men aged 18 - 24 years, and also to assess which anthropometric variables were best associated with a measure of actual frame size (AFS) which is proposed in this study. Actual frame size was measured by the summation of a series of bone breadths, lengths and depths on a sub-sample of 17 men. The results of the study revealed substantial discordance between methods of assessing frame size. The variables which correlated most highly with AFS (P < 0. 01) were body mass, ankle breadth, hand length and chest breadth, respectively. These variables were also positively correlated (P < 0. 01) with fat-free mass (FFM), with no significant correlation with fat mass in either case. Of the various documented methods used to assess frame size, the 'HAT' technique, which incorporates biacromial and bitrochanteric breadths, was more highly correlated with AFS than both elbow breadth (currently used in height-weight insurance tables) and the height/wrist <b>circumference</b> <b>index.</b> The latter measure was not highly correlated with AFS, body mass and FFM in this study. It was concluded that ankle breadth and hand length may be better predictors of frame size in young men than other bone dimensions.

The study was carried out using two groups of carp: control and experimental. The first group was reproduced from the native sperm, the second from the cryopreserved sperm. Findings. Carp reproduction and growing was carried out using native and cryopreserved sperm. This work contains the results of growing 1 + Amur carp of experimental and control groups. Hydrochemical and hydrobiological parameters of the fattening ponds were studied. Peculiarities of the exterior and some hematological parameters of the carp of different origin were characterized. Originality. For the first time we performed a comparison of some biological parameters of Amur carp reproduced using native and cryopreserved sperm. Practical Value. Considering the economic importance of Amur carp due to its use in hybridization, reproduction of its population {{plays an important role in}} the development of the stocks of the pure forms of Amur carp and in the provision of carp farms with appropriate genetic material for its use in the breeding selection...|$|R

The authors screened 8, 312 United Kingdom men and women 3 times over 10 years between 1991 and 2004 for waist <b>circumference,</b> body mass <b>index,</b> systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, serum lipids, C-reactive protein, and interleukin- 6; identified participants with the metabolic syndrome; and measured childhood health retrospectively. Health-related selection was examined in 2 ways: 1) childhood health problems as predictors of adult occupational position and 2) adult cardiometabolic factors as predictors of subsequent promotion at work. Social causation was assessed using adult occupational position {{as a predictor of}} subsequent change in cardiometabolic factors. Hospitalization during childhood and lower birth weight were associated with lower occupational position (both P's ≤ 0. 002). Cardiometabolic factors in adulthood did not consistently predict promotion. In contrast, lower adult occupational position predicted adverse changes in several cardiometabolic factors (waist <b>circumference,</b> body mass <b>index,</b> fasting glucose, and fasting insulin) and an increased risk of new-onset metabolic syndrome (all P's ≤ 0. 008). These findings suggest that health-related selection operates at younger ages and that social causation contributes to socioeconomic differences in cardiometabolic health in midlife...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAge is {{associated}} with increases in body weight, body fat, and abdominal fat. The weakening of the cardiovascular system associated with aging could be countered by increasing levels of physical activity and functional fitness. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of six-week aerobic interval training on some Blood lipids and VO 2 max in female athlete students. Thus, 15 players of university's teams with an average age of 19. 4 – 25. 7, height of 158. 8 – 172. 6 centimetres, and weight of 45. 3 – 63. 8 kg were chosen. The effect of six- week aerobic interval training on body weight, waist <b>circumference,</b> body mass <b>index,</b> triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and VO 2 max was evaluated on pre and post test. The subjects participated in four weekly 60 – 75 minute training sessions in a 6 week period. Descriptive statistic and t-Test at (α= 0. 05) were used to analyze data. The results showed that there was a significant difference in body weight, waist <b>circumference,</b> body mass <b>index,</b> triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and VO 2 max.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} a sample of students from the Central University of Venezuela, according to their socioeconomic status, physical activity, psychobiological habits, family history and cardio-metabolic and anthropometric biomarkers to be used as indicators of risk for Chronic Non Communicable (NCCD). This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study; the sample was 152 students aged between 18 and 29 years. Socioeconomic data, physical activity, psycho-biological characteristics and family medical history were collected by questionnaire. The variables measured were weight, height and waist <b>circumference.</b> Body Mass <b>Index</b> (BMI) and waist-height index was calculated. Cardiometabolic markers were quantified by enzymatic methods. 22. 1 % of the sample was sedentary, with female predominance; 30. 6 % presented overweight, with more than half of men; 11. 7 % had abdominal obesity according to the criterion of waist circumference and 10. 9 % had abdominal obesity according to waist <b>circumference</b> and waist <b>Index</b> - height. The Glu, Col-T, LDL-C and Tg were altered by less than 8 % of the sample, while HDL-C was low in 32. 4 % of the sample. In 17. 6 % of the sample the risk is high by the COL-T / HDL-C ratio. 22. 1 % of the sample was classified as sedentary; this fact, together with a significant prevalence of overweight and low HDL-C concentration, higher in men, represents a dangerous increase in risk factors for NCDs in this group...|$|R
40|$|The obese {{patients}} with diabetes or cardiovascular risk factors {{are associated with}} increased risk of colorectal cancer as well as adenomas under the shared pathogenesis related to atherosclerosis. Here we determined the association between increased arterial stiffness and colorectal adenomas incorporating parameters including age, gender, waist <b>circumference,</b> body mass <b>index,</b> lipid profiles, fasting glucose, and blood pressure. Subjects who simultaneously underwent colonoscopies and pulse wave velocity (PWV) determinations between July 2005 and September 2006 were analyzed, based on which the subjects were classified into two groups as patients group with colorectal adenomas (n =  49) and control group (n =  200) with normal, non-polypoid benign lesions or hyperplastic polyps. Uni- and multi-variate analyses were performed to calculate the odd ratio for colon adenomas. Based on uni-variate analysis, age, waist <b>circumference,</b> body mass <b>index,</b> heart-femoral PWV (hfPWV), and brachial-ankle PWV {{were significantly associated with}} adenomas (p< 0. 05) and multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the heart-femoral PWV, waist circumference, and the levels of LDL-C were significant risk factor for colorectal adenoma. However, arterial stiffness did not affect the progression of colon adenoma. The finding that hfPWV, reflecting aortic stiffness, was increased in {{patients with}} colorectal adenomas lead to conclusion that patients who have prominently increased arterial stiffness can be recommended to undergo colonoscopic examinations {{and at the same time}} we also recommend counseling about the risk for atherosclerosis in those who have colorectal adenomas...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to assess {{associations}} between smoking behavior before and during pregnancy and selected adverse birth outcomes. This study {{is based on the}} Murmansk County Birth Registry (MCBR). Our study includes women who delivered a singleton pregnancy after 37 weeks of gestation (N = 44, 486). Smoking information was self-reported and assessed at the first antenatal visit during pregnancy. We adjusted for potential confounders using logistic regression. The highest proportion of infants with low values of birth weight, birth length, head <b>circumference,</b> ponderal <b>index</b> and of the Apgar score at 5 min was observed for women who smoked both before and during pregnancy. We observed a dose-response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy and the odds of the aforementioned adverse birth outcomes; neither were there significant differences in their occurrences among non-smokers and those who smoked before but not during pregnancy. Moreover, smoking reduction during pregnancy relative to its pre-gestation level did not influence the odds of the adverse birth outcomes. Our findings emphasize a continued need for action against tobacco smoking during pregnancy...|$|R
30|$|Having {{a mother}} who is not {{severely}} undernourished is marginally associated with a lower chance of a child being stunted than among children whose mothers were severely malnourished (OR 0.61, p <  0.10). Furthermore, children whose mothers had no MUAC information also showed a lower likelihood of being stunted than those with severely undernourished mothers (OR 0.34, p <  0.01). This result reinforces the relevance of accurately measuring the mother’s nutritional status (either through MUAC, waist <b>circumference,</b> body mass <b>index</b> or any other characteristic that may work {{as a proxy for}} the mother’s nutritional status), which could be helpful in understanding the factors associated with child malnutrition.|$|R
