I haven't seen a live German; I haven't been within two hundred yards of a shell burst, there has been no attack and I haven't got the V.C. I have made myself muddy beyond describing; I've been working all the time, but I've not fired a shot or fought a ha'porth. We were busy all the time--just at work, repairing the parapet, which had to be done gingerly because of snipers, bringing our food in from the rear in big carriers, getting water, pushing our trench out from an angle slantingways forward. Getting meals, clearing up and so on <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> We make tea in big kettles in the big dug-out, which two whole companies use for their cooking, and carry them with a pole through the handles to our platoons. We wash up and wash and shave. Dinner preparation (and consumption) takes two or three hours. Tea too uses up time. It's like camping out and picnicking in the park. This first time (and next too) we have been mixed with some Sussex men who have been here longer and know the business.... It works out that we do most of the fatigue. Afterwards we shall go up alone to a pitch of our own....|$|E

It is designed to parse the logs, calculate the DKP award and then send the results (the loot, raids, participants and DKP) directly to EQDKP.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} chasing / repousse <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{due to the}} {{repetition}} {{of a number of}} time-consuming stages: The first step is the preparation of the metal by annealing; cleaning to remove the pitch between annealing and work; setting up; and careful work with punches. This process is typically repeated many times during the creation of a chasing/repousse work.|$|E
5000|$|Khir is {{a common}} Bangladeshi sweet dish. Phirni, {{together}} with Zarda, is also typical during Shab-e-Barat and Eid. It is cooked with dense milk, sugar/jaggery, and scented rice (kalijira rice). Although it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to cook, {{it is one of}} the main features of Bangladeshi desserts. A thicker version of khir is used as filling for pitha.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} ways of {{accomplishing}} similar effects - {{one of them is}} called scripting. Scripting helps content creators to decide strings of events in the 3D environment. But there are two problems: one is that users {{have to learn how to}} script which <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Another is that the results aren't visible immediately. And a third problem is that editing the resulting animation is a hit-and-miss process of guessing which corrections to make.|$|E

Katz denies that his strategy is to overly amend and complicate his patents.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the very}} large number of {{documents}} that must digitized, a process that <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the Library has established a sequence of criteria for documents that must be digitized before others and one of the basic criteria is the cultural and historical value of that material. Based on those criteria, these are the documents that have priority in digitization : most requested material which is in poor physical condition, historical books and manuscripts, microfilms and other very required materials.|$|E

50|$|PowerPoint presentations {{can be an}} {{extremely}} useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort {{to put together a}} PowerPoint. For longer presentations, however, PowerPoints can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track. A potential drawback of using a PowerPoint is that it usually <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and energy to put together. There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept was}} {{originally}} created {{to protect the}} rights of livestock holders that had free ranging animals. Without the recognition of animus revertendi, any animal that strayed away from the owner's property onto public land could be killed and taken without any compensation to the original caretaker. It <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and effort to raise and feed a beast. By recognizing that the caretaker has rights, it promotes the care and feeding of animals, especially for human consumption, creates incentive to produce by eliminating the free rider problem. It may also be applied to pets.|$|E

50|$|A level editor {{is often}} limited to {{creating}} levels {{for only a}} certain game engine. Developing a level editor <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and it is more time and cost efficient to release multiple games using the same engine instead of developing a new engine and level editor for each game. Level editors offer some limited scope of content creation, {{but in the case}} of gaming industry solutions the scope is very large allowing an entire game to be created without the need for much support from a programming team. To make larger changes to a game than simply adding new levels, a software development kit (SDK) is sometimes needed.|$|E
5000|$|The Dubai Fountain {{consists}} of many high-pressure water jets and shooters: oarsmen or water robots, {{which can make}} the water seem to dance, shooters, which shoot water upwards; super shooters, which shoot water under more pressure up to 240 feet in the air, and extreme shooters, which can shoot water under the most pressure to 500 ft in the air. These shooters create a loud [...] "boom" [...] noise after water is ejected. The extreme shooters are used the least during each show because it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to build up enough pressure and energy to shoot water that high in the air.|$|E

Sify wrote, [...] "Cable Sankar's plot is ambitious and it is unique {{compared}} {{to some of the}} recent commercial films but falls flat...The problem here is that Cable Sankar has done his paper work with perfection but he missed {{a lot of things in}} screen transition". The Times of India gave 2 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "the film fails to make good on its promise, despite the interesting set-up, mainly because of a tired, overlong romantic track with too many songs and dull conversations that just sap the energy out of it. Some of the scenes have a serial-like quality, there is an unsuccessful attempt at humour and the film <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to get to the plot".|$|E
