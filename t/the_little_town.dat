5|$|Bernese troops {{under the}} command of Sigmund von Erlach then {{advanced}} from Bern to the Aargau to meet the forces of Zürich. Under this double pressure, the peasants' resistance collapsed. Von Erlach's troops numbered about 6,000 men and 19 cannons. The operation was a veritable punitive expedition: the troops plundered the villages along their way and even razed the defenses of the small town of Wiedlisbach, which lost its town privileges and was declared a village again. On June 7, 1653, the Bernese army met with a troop of about 2,000 men of Leuenberger's army who were on their way back from Wohlenschwil. The peasants retreated to Herzogenbuchsee, where they were defeated by von Erlach's troops; <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>town</b> went up in flames {{in the course of the}} battle. Niklaus Leuenberger fled and went hiding, but he was betrayed by a neighbour and was apprehended by the Bernese district sheriff Samuel Tribolet on June 9, 1653.|$|E

To the west it was bounded until the late 12th century by a 1.5-metre deep ditch, with a dyke and pallisade, approximately where Duck (or Dyke) Lane now lies.|$|E

500|$|Lacking in numbers, Eugene {{could not}} seriously disrupt Tallard's march but the French Marshal's {{progress}} was proving pitifully slow. Tallard's force had suffered {{considerably more than}} Marlborough's troops on their march – many of his cavalry horses were suffering from glanders and the mountain passes were proving tough for the 2,000 wagons of provisions. Local German peasants, angry at French plundering, compounded Tallard's problems, leading Mérode-Westerloo to bemoan – [...] "the enraged peasantry killed several thousand of our men before the army was clear of the Black Forest."

500|$|George Gilfillan, in an 1845 {{essay on}} Keats, placed the poem among [...] "The finest of Keats' smaller pieces" [...] and {{suggested}} that [...] "In originality, Keats has seldom been surpassed. His works 'rise like an exhalation.' His language has been formed on a false system; but, ere he died, was clarifying itself from its more glaring faults, and becoming copious clear, and select. He {{seems to have been}} averse to all speculative thought, and his only creed, we fear, was expressed in the words— Beauty is truth,—truth beauty". The 1857 Encyclopædia Britannica contained an article on Keats by Alexander Smith, which stated: [...] "Perhaps the most exquisite specimen of Keats' poetry is the 'Ode to the Grecian Urn'; it breathes the very spirit of antiquity,—eternal beauty and eternal repose." [...] During the mid-19th century, Matthew Arnold claimed that the passage describing <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>town</b> [...] "is Greek, as Greek as a thing from Homer or Theocritus; it is composed with the eye on the object, a radiancy and light clearness being added." ...|$|E
500|$|William Astor, {{motivated}} {{in part by}} {{a dispute}} with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, built the [...] Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street. His father had been the millionaire developer, William Waldorf Astor. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, an elite boutique hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louise Kehrer Boldt. The original plans for the Waldorf were for a hotel with 11 stories. [...] Boldt's wife, Louise, believed that 13 was a lucky number. [...] She persuaded her husband to add two floors to the construction. William Astor's construction of a hotel next to his aunt's house worsened his feud with her, but, with Boldt's assistance, John Astor persuaded his mother to move uptown.
