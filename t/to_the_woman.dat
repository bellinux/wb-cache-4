5|$|Government family-friendly {{initiatives}} such {{as child}} subsidies and cheaper child care facilities can also greatly decrease the gender {{difference in the}} workplace, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> being able to work longer hours outside the home. In addition, when developing policies related to paid work, {{it is important to}} do gender impact assessments in order {{to assess the impact of}} a policy on both the paid and unpaid sector.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel came {{in second}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> in Black {{at the box office}} during its first week, earning £2.2 million. It {{eventually}} topped the UK box office, with £2.3 million, in its second weekend on release. By the end of its UK run, the film had grossed around US$31 million. Prior to its United States debut, the comedy had already grossed US$69 million worldwide and passed both The Queen (2006) and Calendar Girls (2003) in total international grosses. After three months of release, it was ranked the third highest-grossing 2012 release in Australia and New Zealand, behind only The Avengers and The Hunger Games, and the fourth-highest-grossing 2012 title in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and The Man prepare {{food for}} the woman, yet this time The Doctor permits the man to not be blindfolded, and {{encourages}} him to comb his hair. Meanwhile, it is revealed that The Brute has breached the iron gate to the hospital. The Doctor is killed on the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> when chunks of rock rain down from the sky. The Man, who {{does not know how}} to find the woman without The Doctor, attempts to locate her, though he is confronted by The Brute. A fight ensues, with The Man eventually killing The Brute. The Man then locates the woman's room, though is devastated when he discovers that The Brute had already killed her.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor prepares {{some food}} and blindfolds The Man. He leads The Man to {{a part of}} the {{hospital}} where a woman is kept, and gives her the food. The Brute sets fire to {{the front door of the}} hospital, though The Doctor and The Man extinguish the flames. The Man and The Doctor go to bring food <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> again, and The Man gives her a wrapped gift. They then catch The Brute attempting to saw through the iron bar gate, though are able to scare him off.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> in the woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks {{the way it does}} because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{motorcyclist}} fires {{shots at}} the moving car of Lewis and Falsone; the two narrowly avoid injury and the motorcyclist escapes. Almost immediately afterward, Lewis and Falsone are called to investigate {{the shooting death of}} a woman on a nearby street. At the scene they find Stivers (Toni Lewis), who was speaking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> when she was shot; police later conclude Stivers was the real target. While Munch and Kellerman are leaving the hotel, somebody opens fire on them and shoots Kellerman in the arm. Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives {{who were involved in the}} previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney. Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney's death, which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly.|$|E

25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the liposuction-only technique usually applies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> whose oversized breasts require the removal of a medium volume of internal tissue; and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> whose health precludes her being under the extended anaesthesia usual to surgical breast-reduction operations. The ideal lipectomy candidate is the woman whose low-density breasts are principally composed of adipose tissue, have a relatively elastic skin envelope, and manifest mild ptosis. The therapeutic advantages of the liposuction-only technique are the small incision-scars required {{for access to the}} breast interior, hence, a shorter post-operative healing period for the incision scars; the therapeutic disadvantage is limited breast-reduction volumes.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{payments}} are connected with marriage. Amobr, or commutation-fee, was a fee payable to the woman's lord on {{the loss of}} her virginity, whether on marriage or otherwise. Cowyll, or maiden-fee, was a payment due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> from her husband on the morning after the marriage, marking her transition from virgin to married woman. Dowry (agweddi) was the amount of the common pool of property owned by the couple which was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> if the couple separated before the end of seven years. The total of the agweddi depended on the woman's status by birth, regardless of the actual size of the common pool of property. If the marriage broke up after the end of 7 years, the woman was entitled to half the common pool. The portion that was immediately accessible during the marriage, consisting usually of linens, dishes, and other domestic items, was known as argyvrau.|$|E

25|$|Existing {{pregnancy}} {{is not a}} contraindication in terms of safety, {{as there is no}} known harm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> the course of her pregnancy, or the fetus if progestin-only or combined emergency contraception pills are accidentally used, but EC is not indicated for a woman with a known or suspected pregnancy because it is not effective in women who are already pregnant.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not unusual}} that after the PGD, there are more embryos {{suitable}} for transferring back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> than necessary. For the couples undergoing PGD, those embryos are very valuable, as the couple's current cycle may not lead to an ongoing pregnancy. Embryo cryopreservation and later thawing and replacement can give them {{a second chance to}} pregnancy without having to redo the cumbersome and expensive ART and PGD procedures.|$|E

25|$|Mastopexy by {{internal}} surgical approach applies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> who has undergone explantation of breast prostheses. In operative praxis, the plastic surgeon elevates the flaps {{of the cut}} breast-implant capsules, and folds {{them in order to}} increase the volume of the internal mass of the breasts — thereby increasing the projection of the bust from the chest surface. The nipple-areola complex is elevated with plication sutures, and requires no skin resection when there is no excess skin.|$|E
25|$|Different {{measures}} for pain control have {{varying degrees of}} success and side effects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> and her baby. In some countries of Europe, doctors commonly prescribe inhaled nitrous oxide gas for pain control, especially as 53% nitrous oxide, 47% oxygen, known as Entonox; in the UK, midwives may use this gas without a doctor's prescription. Opioids such as fentanyl may be used, but if given too close to birth there is a risk of respiratory depression in the infant.|$|E
