5|$|Due to the damage, {{the name}} Ione was retired {{and will never}} be used for an Atlantic {{hurricane}} again. This was before the formal lists were created, as a result it was not replaced with any particular name.

5|$|The United States, {{the winner}} of all {{previous}} editions of this event, was boycotting the games {{in response to the}} Soviet war in Afghanistan. As a result, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden were expected to win. Australia's Quietly Confident Quartet, however, composed of backstroker Mark Kerry, breaststroker Peter Evans, butterflyer Mark Tonelli, and freestyler Neil Brooks, surprisingly won the final in 3:45.70. They were followed by the silver medalists Soviet Union, 0.22 seconds in arrears, and the bronze medalists Great Britain, as favorites Sweden had been disqualified in the heats. To date, this is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> United States has not won the gold medal in the event.|$|E

5|$|This was Arsenal's 20th Community Shield {{appearance}} and Manchester City's 10th. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> two teams previously {{met in the}} Shield was in 1934, when Arsenal won 40. The 2014 staging of the event {{was the first to}} use vanishing spray, following its success at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

5|$|In 1909 the {{newspaper}} La Gazzetta dello Sport established the Giro d'Italia, {{inspired by the}} success of the Tour de France, which started in 1903. The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, while Carlo Galetti won the two following Giros. In 1912, there was no individual classification, instead there was only a team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> competition has not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was changed from a points-based system to a time-based system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time {{at the end of the}} race would win. The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Trafford Council {{was created}} to {{administer}} the newly formed Trafford Metropolitan Borough and is headquartered at Trafford Town Hall, which was previously named Stretford Town Hall. On its formation in 1974, the council was controlled by the Conservative Party; the Conservatives have been in control 1973–85, 1988–94, and 2004 to the present. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Labour Party was in control was 1996–2002.

5|$|Missouri {{departed}} Yokosuka on 7 April {{and arrived}} at Norfolk on 4 May to become flagship for Rear Admiral E. T. Woolridge, commander, Battleships-Cruisers, Atlantic Fleet, on 14 May. She departed on 8 June on a midshipman training cruise, returned to Norfolk on 4 August, and was overhauled in Norfolk Naval Shipyard from 20 November 1953 to 2 April 1954. As the flagship of Rear Admiral R. E. Kirby, who had relieved Admiral Woolridge, Missouri departed Norfolk on 7 June as flagship of the midshipman training cruise to Lisbon and Cherbourg. During this voyage Missouri was joined by the other three battleships of her class, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Iowa, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> four ships sailed together. She returned to Norfolk on 3 August and departed on 23 August for inactivation on the West Coast. After calls at Long Beach and San Francisco, Missouri arrived in Seattle on 15 September. Three days later she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard where she was decommissioned on 26 February 1955, entering the Bremerton group, Pacific Reserve Fleet.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi {{signed his}} first {{contract}} {{as a senior}} team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150million. His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. While Capello requested to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, {{who were willing to}} pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages. According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay. On 16 September, his contract was updated {{for the second time in}} three months and extended to 2014.|$|E

2500|$|In late June 1950, Bataan was {{en route}} to Japan for a fifth tour when the Korean War started. From early July 1950 until 29 May 1951, the {{destroyer}} operated off Korea; patrolling and blockading, escorting aircraft carriers, and bombarding shore targets. A second Korean tour occurred between 4 February and 31 August 1952, with Bataan fulfilling most of the same duties as before. Bataan was presented with the battle honour [...] "Korea 1950–52" [...] for her service. In November 1953, Bataan visited Singapore. This was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> since <b>the</b> Korean War, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> for <b>the</b> rest of her career, that the destroyer would leave Australian waters.|$|R
5|$|Operation Varsity was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Locust {{was used}} in action with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment or the British Army as a whole. A report issued {{at the end of}} a conference held by the Director (Air) of the War Office in January 1946 {{confirmed}} that the Locust design was considered obsolete; any light tanks to be used in post-war airborne formations would be made from completely new designs. The British Army disposed of a small number of Locusts by transferring them to foreign militaries. Several had their main armaments removed and were used by the Belgian Army as command tanks for their M4 Sherman regiments, and a few Locusts even found their way back to the U.S., where they had their turrets removed and served as agricultural tractors. A larger number of Locusts served with the Egyptian Army, replacing a number of older tank models, such as the Vickers-Armstrong Mark V light tank, that the Egyptian military had acquired during the interwar period. Several company-sized units of Locusts were used by the Egyptians during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.|$|E
5|$|Quackenbush {{became a}} fan {{favourite}} upon {{his arrival in}} Boston, where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin (and fellow Hall of Famer) Eddie Shore. In his first season in Boston, Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points. He continued {{to stay out of}} the penalty box, registering only 4 penalty minutes. However, it marked the first time in three seasons that he was not named to the NHL All-Star Team. The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in 1950–51, forcing the team to use several first year players. While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes, including a game where he played 55 minutes, it also gave him the opportunity to play with his brother Max. It was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> two played professionally together. He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All-Star. Over the next five seasons Quackenbush hovered around the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year.|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was {{a mutual}} naval arms {{limitation}} and disarmament treaty between the five major naval {{powers of the}} time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy {{for the purposes of the}} treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E

5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Red Line shared tracks {{with another}} line was from January 27, 1997 to September 17, 1999, when the Green Line Commuter Shortcut used Red Line tracks from Brookland–CUA to Farragut North. A short {{time after the}} Green Line branch north of Fort Totten opened in the early 1990s, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut began as a six-month experiment. Passengers could board the Green Line between Greenbelt and West Hyattsville and travel as far as Farragut North without having to transfer; the trains {{bypassed}} Fort Totten via a single-track spur between the West Hyattsville and Brookland–CUA stations. Due to its success, the shortcut continued until the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} the 14-Diva single-fall Vickie Guerrero Divas Championship Invitational for the WWE Divas Championship; this marked <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> title was defended at WrestleMania. The match {{started with the}} other wrestlers attacking {{champion}} AJ Lee and her bodyguard, Tamina Snuka. As the match progressed, Aksana met Naomi at the top rope and Natalya slipped under Aksana to perform a powerbomb superplex combination. Tamina pulled Aksana {{out of the ring}} to prevent Natalya from winning, so Natalya clotheslined Tamina on the outside but was prevented from re-entering the ring due to AJ kicking her. AJ applied her signature Black Widow hold on Naomi and won the match, thus retaining her title. WWE reported that AJ won by moving Naomi's hand unto the mat to deceive the referee into thinking that Naomi had submitted.|$|E

5|$|Originally the 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships {{was planned}} to take place at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar, the same venue which hosted short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics. However, because Storhamar was at {{scheduled}} time playing play-offs in the Norwegian Ice Hockey Championship, it was in December 1994 decided to move the tournament to Gjøvik. The championship opened on Friday 17 March with the 1500 meter races, and {{was followed by the}} 500 meter races the following day. The remaining events were held on 19 March. It is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> world championship has been held in Norway. There were set six world records during the championship. Chae Ji-Hoon's time 4:56.29 in the men's 3000 meter and Chun Lee-Kyung at 5:02.18 in the women's 3000 meter. Kim Yun-Mi set the record on the women's 500 meter at 45.33 in an introductory race, while Frederic Blackburn set a world record at 2:19.71 in the semi-final of the 1500 meter. Both the relay teams also set world records: Canada with the men's record at 7:09.76 and the China with the women's at 4:26.68. The hall was one of seven venues used during the group state of the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship.
