25|$|In 1028, {{after his}} return from Rome through Denmark, Cnut set off from England to Norway, {{and the city of}} Trondheim, with a fleet of fifty ships.

Cnut was crowned king, now of England, Denmark and Norway as well as part of Sweden. He entrusted the Earldom of Lade to the former line of earls, in Håkon Eiriksson, with Eiríkr Hákonarson probably dead by this time. Hakon was possibly the Earl of Northumbria after Erik as well.|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} the {{establishment}} of the Fourth Degree, during the nadir of American race relations, a bogus oath was circulated claiming that Fourth Degree Knights swore to exterminate Freemasons and Protestants. In addition, they purportedly were prepared <b>to</b> <b>flay,</b> burn alive, boil, kill, and otherwise torture anyone, including women and children, when called upon to do so by church authorities. [...] "It is a strange paradox", according to some commentators, that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of anti-Americanism.|$|E
50|$|The Flayed One (Death 1, p. 16) is a {{reference}} to the Aztec god Xipe or Totec, who was in the habit of wearing the skin of a flayed man over his own.

2500|$|Two {{months after}} his {{conviction}} and two months prior to his sentencing for the sexual assault, Dahmer murdered his fifth victim. He was a mixed-race 24-year-old aspiring model named Anthony Sears, whom Dahmer met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion, he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before closing time that evening, Sears [...] "just started talking to me". Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears. The following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting <b>to</b> <b>flay</b> the corpse. He then stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which were again disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears [...] "exceptionally attractive", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in acetone and stored them in his work locker. When he {{moved to a new}} address the following year, he took the remains there.|$|E

[...] Hypothermia is possible, as skin is essential for maintaining a person's body temperature, as it provides a person's natural insulation.|$|R

60|$|We have {{likewise}} been to Mr. B------'s [now dead] studio, {{where we}} saw several pretty statues and busts, and among them an Eve, with her wreath of fig-leaves lying across her poor nudity; comely in some points, {{but with a}} frightful volume of thighs and calves.

6000|$|He lit a {{cigarette}} and began to pace the room--his customary manner of preparing himself for the creative mood. After a while he began to dictate--but haltingly. He had come here from Antonelli all primed with fervour and indignation, but it was evident that this feeling had ebbed, that his mind refused to concentrate on what he was saying. Despite the magnificent opportunity <b>to</b> <b>flay</b> the capitalists which their most recent tactics afforded him, he paused, repeated himself, and began again, glancing from time to time reproachfully, almost resentfully at Janet. Usually, on these occasions, he was transported, almost inebriated by his own eloquence; but now he chafed at her listlessness, he was at a loss to account for the withdrawal of the enthusiasm he had formerly been able to arouse. Lacking the feminine stimulus, his genius limped. For Rolfe there had been a woman in every strike--sometimes two. What had happened, during his absence, to alienate the most promising of all neophytes he had ever encountered? ...|$|E
6000|$|All naked {{as he was}} he cut the stag's throat in {{the usual}} manner, and gralloched him with all the skill of Bucklaw. This was very well, and very well {{it would be to}} add a {{description}} of the stag at bay; but as I never happened to see a stag at bay, I omit all that. Dick had achieved success, but his clothes were on one side of a roaring river in spate, and he and the dead stag were on the other. There was no chance of fording the stream, and there was then no bridge. He did not care to swim back, for the excitement was out of him. He was trembling with cold, and afraid of cramp. [...] "A mother-naked man," [...] in a wilderness, with a flood between him and his raiment, was in a pitiable position. It did not occur to him <b>to</b> <b>flay</b> the stag, and dress in the hide, and, indeed, he would have been frozen before he could have accomplished that task. So he reconnoitred.|$|E

He did not explain that many in the town were so disposed; that cruelty grows and feeds upon itself; that there were ladies and gentlemen there who flogged their slaves--men, women, and children--nearly to the death; that one gentleman of an irascible disposition, when irritated by some slight oversight {{on the part of the}} unfortunate boy who acted as his valet, could find no relief to his feelings until he had welted him first into a condition of unutterable terror, and then into a state of insensibility. Neither did he inform them that a certain lady in the town, who seemed at most times to be possessed of a reasonably quiet spirit, was roused once to such a degree by a female slave that she caused her to be forcibly held, thrust a boiling hot egg into her mouth, skewered her lips together with a sail-needle, and then striking her cheeks, burst the egg, and let the scalding contents run down her throat.
