5|$|Suriname-born Milton Kam, who {{had shot}} 10 feature films {{and more than}} 50 short films, {{was chosen as the}} {{director}} of photography. Since Domalpalli's experience was limited to short video films with a different aspect ratio, he was shocked <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the Super 16mm lens the day they commenced the shoot. However, Kam helped him to stay composed during the production.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> {{the history of}} biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations {{should not be taken}} out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1839 Meyerbeer, whilst {{relaxing}} at Boulogne in {{the company}} of Moscheles, {{met for the first time}} with Richard Wagner, who was en route to Paris. Their ensuing relationship (see below) was to have major repercussions for the careers and reputations of both. At this meeting Wagner read to Meyerbeer from the libretto of Rienzi, and Meyerbeer agreed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the score, which indeed he subsequently recommended for performance at Dresden.|$|E

5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{full range}} of {{techniques}} that are available has been summarized in a tree diagram by William Bassett. The ability to utilize any {{and all of these}} techniques hinges on being able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the diamonds which was first demonstrated by visual observations.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} in Shankar was examined {{in detail in}} an article by Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan. The authors question how accurately the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective, given that the test requires the court <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> {{the eyes of a}} reasonable observer in court who is familiar with the relevant facts, whereas most members of the public hear things from secondary sources.|$|E
25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E
25|$|The nose-gear light {{indicators}} {{were designed}} to be fail safe by having two separate light bulbs. This proved to be inadequate, as it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the cover to check whether one of the bulbs had been compromised, meaning that a failure of one bulb would not be detected until both bulbs malfunctioned. The first bulb was thus presumed to have gone inoperative some time before {{the day of the}} flight, while the second bulb broke during Flight 933. The NTSB therefore advised the Federal Aviation Administration to articulate means to avoid similar compromised fail-safe designs in the future. Both pilots had minimum-descent altitude light warnings, which were presumed to have given a visual warning, but because of the work overload, neither pilot directed his attention to these alerts.|$|E

25|$|Cora Lansquenet was {{an artist}} and {{collector}} of paintings from local sales. Niece Susan Banks, heir to Cora's property, goes to her cottage to clear up the possessions and prepare them for auction, {{on the day of}} the inquest into Cora's murder. Miss Gilchrist claims that Cora always painted from life, yet Susan finds one quite recent painting featuring a pier that was destroyed in the war, a view that has been published on picture postcards. The next day, after Cora's funeral, art critic Alexander Guthrie, arrives <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> Mrs Lansquenet's recent purchases as previously scheduled. He finds nothing of any value there. That evening, Miss Gilchrist is poisoned by arsenic in a slice of wedding cake apparently sent to her through the post. She ate just a small portion of it, which saved her. Inspector Morton investigates the Lansquenet murder along with Poirot.|$|E
25|$|In Norden's {{version of}} the system, the bombardier first looked up the {{expected}} time {{it would take for}} the bombs to fall from the current altitude. This time was set into a countdown stopwatch, and the bombardier waited for the target to line up with a set of iron sights {{at the front of the}} bombsight. When the target passed through the sights, the timer was started, and the bombardier then rotated the telescope around its vertical axis to track the target as they approached it. This movement was linked to a second sight through a gearing system that caused the second to move twice as fast as the first. The bombardier continued moving the telescope until the timer ran out. The second sight was now at the correct aiming angle, or range angle; the bombardier moved his eyes <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> this second set of sights to time the drop.|$|E
25|$|Dolphin {{invented the}} 'Welman', a one-man {{submarine}} that was prototyped at Station IX. The miniature submarine had no periscope so {{was hard to}} navigate as the submariner had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> specially armoured glass segments in the small 'conning tower'. The Welman was designed to attach 560-pound explosive charge to its target by magnetic clips, but this could not be made to work reliably. It was decided to try the Welman submarine in {{an attack on the}} Floating Dock in Bergen harbour so on 20 November 1943 MTB635 and MTB625 left Lunna Voe, Shetland, carrying Welmans W45 (Lt. C. Johnsen, Royal Norwegian Navy), W46 (Lt B. Pedersen, Norwegian Army), W47 (Lt. B. Marris, RNVR) and W48 (Lt. J. Holmes, RN). The craft were launched {{at the entrance to the}} fjord. Pedersen's W46 became entangled in an anti-submarine net and had to surface, where she was captured by a German patrol craft. Pedersen survived the war in a prison camp and the other three eventually had to be scuttled. Their operators made their way north with the help of Norwegian resistance members and were picked up in February 1944 by MTB653. The failure made the Royal Navy concentrate on X craft and XE craft, although further Welman trials took place in Australia.|$|E

500|$|Revenge of the Sith {{eventually}} {{became the first}} Star Wars film in which Anakin Skywalker and the suited Darth Vader were played by the same actor in the same film. As Christensen recounted, it was originally intended to simply have a [...] "tall guy" [...] in the Darth Vader costume, but after [...] "begging and pleading" [...] Christensen persuaded Lucas to have the Vader costume used in the film created specifically to fit him. The new costume featured shoe lifts and a muscle suit. It also required Christensen (who is [...] tall) <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the helmet's mouthpiece.|$|E
500|$|Barry planned an enfilade, or what Christopher Jones, {{the former}} BBC {{political}} editor, has called [...] "one long spine of Lords' and Commons' Chambers" [...] which enabled the Speaker of the House of Commons <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> {{the line of}} the building to see the Queen's throne in the House of Lords. Laid out around 11courtyards, the building included several residences with accommodation for about 200people, and comprised a total of 1,180rooms, 126staircases and [...] of corridors. Between 1836 and 1837 Pugin made more detailed drawings on which estimates were made for the palace's completion; reports of the cost estimates vary from £707,000 to £725,000, with six years until completion of the project.|$|E
500|$|Feynman {{was working}} in the {{computing}} room when he was informed that Arline was dying. He borrowed Fuchs' car and drove to Albuquerque where he sat with her for hours until she died on June 16, 1945. He immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the Trinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation. On witnessing the blast, Feynman ducked towards the floor of his truck because of the immense brightness of the explosion, where he saw a temporary [...] "purple splotch" [...] afterimage of the event.|$|E

500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept looking around the room, {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were in the room. When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept looking around the room. Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|E
500|$|A {{reflector}} sight or {{reflex sight}} is an optical device {{that allows the}} user <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed {{on the field of}} view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated reticle) will look like it is {{sitting in front of the}} viewer at infinity. Reflector sights employ some sort of [...] "reflector" [...] to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer's eye position, removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices.|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{said that}} they wanted to depict a {{full-fledged}} battle, [...] "From the beginning we knew that one thing we'd never had on the show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all the forces they can into play in some battlefield that's somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and the other one loses. This is a staple of human history, and we started <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} be there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
