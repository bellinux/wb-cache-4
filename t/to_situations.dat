5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry <b>to</b> <b>situations</b> where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.|$|E

Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help {{in the development of}} prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E

In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story to focus more on the dog and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E
