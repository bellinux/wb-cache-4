5|$|Each of {{the main}} façade's first- and second-story windows and the {{entrance}} are adorned with white wooden label moldings. The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden entrance door, with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps {{leading up to the}} stoop were last restored in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Knight, helm, mantling, crest (or coronet or crown) and sword are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain {{permanently}} affixed {{to the back of the}} stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Ladies) since 1911. <b>The</b> <b>entryway</b> just outside the doors of the chapel has the names of the Order's Knights from before 1911 inscribed into the walls giving a complete record of the members of the order.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, {{three years}} after the first Quaker {{settlers}} arrived in the area, a meeting house was constructed {{on the site of the}} present-day Friends meeting house for US$1,000. Quakers continued to flow into the area through the 1860s and in 1874 the current Friends meeting house was constructed and it has seen little change since it was built. Some minor alterations have taken place, including the addition of a concrete porch to <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> and a shed on the east (rear) facade. The shed was added around 1910 to serve as a storage space and a privy. The building became a social, political, and religious hub for the area Quakers and the site was visited by Friends from other meeting houses around the state. The building is no longer owned by a religious institution, though there are occasional services held there.|$|E
25|$|The old 59,000-seat stadium was {{demolished}} in 1989 {{and replaced}} with a modern 9,044-seat stadium, which includes {{a replica of the}} original concrete arch at <b>the</b> <b>entryway.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like {{the stones}} {{used for the}} rest of the Old City walls, the stones of Jaffa Gate are large, hewn, sand-colored blocks. <b>The</b> <b>entryway</b> stands about 20 feet (6 meters) high, and the wall rises another 20 feet above that.|$|E

25|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} centered on the front façade. It has a recessed porch, enclosed on three sides. The porch has a flagstone platform floor. <b>The</b> <b>entryway</b> is framed by heavy timber beams. The outer posts are vertical and flush with the exterior wall while the two inner posts are angled inward. All four posts support a heavy, square lintel beam.|$|E
25|$|The {{staircase}} {{has three}} floors, {{each with a}} double bay window forming a mezzanine which {{looks out over the}} courtyard. <b>The</b> <b>entryway,</b> which resembles a Roman triumphal arch, is decorated with the initials of Gilles Berthelot and his wife, while the pediments overhanging each window bay are carved with the salamander and ermine of Francis I and his wife, Claude of France, in honour to the monarch of the time.|$|E
25|$|The Italian Society Duke of Abruzzi Hall is a {{rectangular}} single-story red brick structure with a gable roof {{and a yellow}} brick false front. <b>The</b> <b>entryway</b> is through double doors in a projecting barrel-arch porch with semi-circular fanlight.

25|$|In 1995 Berlin, after a {{woman who}} has spent the night leaves his {{apartment}} despite his pleas to her to stay for breakfast, Michael Berg watches an U-Bahn pass by, setting up a flashback to a tram in 1958. A 15-year-old Michael (David Kross) gets off because he feels sick and wanders the streets, pausing in <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> of a nearby apartment building where he vomits. Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a tram conductor, comes in and helps him return home.|$|E
25|$|Construction on bay mud {{sites is}} {{difficult}} because of the soil's low strength and high compressibility. Very lightweight buildings can be constructed on bay mud sites {{if there is a}} thick enough layer of non-bay-mud soil above the bay mud, but buildings which impose significant loads must be supported on deep foundations bearing on stiffer layers below the bay mud, or obtaining support from friction in the bay mud. Even with deep foundations, difficulties arise because the surrounding ground will likely settle over time, potentially damaging utility connections to the building and causing <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> to sink below street level.|$|E
25|$|A {{wraparound}} dentil cornice and a recessed peaked {{hipped roof}} creates {{the illusion of}} a flat roof, just like a palazzo. On either side of the main entrance, a blind arch with an ornamental keystone contains a set of three steel-framed doors, along with a large arched window. Decorative friezes separate the arched window from the doors. When these entryway elements are combined, they create a processional experience through <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> into the grand interior space. The flat-roof illusion, together with the axial symmetry, classical detailing in both structural and decorative elements, heavy ornamentation, and formal setting is typical of the Beaux-Arts style.|$|E
50|$|The Cameron Highlands can be {{accessed}} by road via Tapah, Simpang Pulai, Gua Musang or Sungai Koyan. Tapah and Simpang Pulai are the two approaches from Perak. Gua Musang and Sungai Koyan are <b>the</b> <b>entryways</b> from Kelantan and Pahang, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Enameled terra-cotta sculptures grace <b>the</b> <b>entryways</b> to Meadowlands Hall, Guzman Hall, Archbishop Alemany Library and Caleruega Hall. These terra-cotta sculptures {{have been}} made for centuries by the Della Robia family, a famous Florentine family of sculptors and ceramicists which started with Luca della Robbia.|$|R
50|$|On <b>the</b> interior, <b>the</b> <b>entryways</b> lead to marble-lined vestibules, {{which lead}} to stairways. Each stair {{services}} three apartments per floor, for six on each floor.

25|$|Named after former Illinois {{governor}} John Peter Altgeld, Altgeld Hall {{marks the}} northwest corner of the Quad between the Henry Administration Building and the Illini Union on the corner of Wright and Green Streets. Opened as the Library Hall, the building also served as the Law Building and now is the home of the Department of Mathematics. Designed by Nathan Clifford Ricker, the Romanesque building was the compromise between John Altgeld's preference of Gothic revival style and the classical architecture desired by the board of trustees. The tower was modeled after the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh and <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> after the Ames Free Library in Easton, Massachusetts. The building is one of Altgeld's castles, inspired by Governor Altgeld's interest in Germanic architecture; Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Illinois State University, Eastern Illinois University and Northern Illinois University have similar structures.|$|E
25|$|On the April 22, 1998 {{edition of}} Thunder, Bagwell {{wrestled}} a match against Rick Steiner which he won by disqualification when Scott Steiner interfered on his behalf. Just before that, however, Rick attempted his diving bulldog finishing move, {{which was not}} executed correctly and resulted in Bagwell's head striking Steiner's back, jamming his neck and severely injuring him. Bagwell was diagnosed with several damaged vertebrae and developed spinal shock, leading him to use a wheelchair and neck brace for some time. He returned months later for an interview only to be viciously ridiculed by Hollywood Hogan and shoved to <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> floor. On July 6, after recently having neck surgery, the wheelchair-ridden Bagwell returned to WCW {{in his home state}} of Georgia. Bagwell seemed to have a new attitude and even called out Rick Steiner to offer him his forgiveness. However, Bagwell restrained Rick while fellow nWo member Scott Steiner assaulted him with a steel chair, reaffirming his loyalty to Hogan and the nWo. Bagwell then rose from his wheelchair and helped Scott beat down Rick. In January 1999, the nWo factions emerged, leading Bagwell and Steiner to side with the nWo Wolfpac. Their alliance ended at Uncensored when Bagwell accidentally hit Steiner with a chair, costing him the World Television Championship.|$|E
500|$|In {{the central}} Highlands, power struggles between the Merina and vazimba principalities and later amongst Merina principalities {{over the centuries}} {{inspired}} {{the development of the}} fortified town in Imerina, the central region of the Highlands of Madagascar. The first of these, the ancient Imerina capital of Alasora, was fortified by 16th-century king Andriamanelo, who surrounded the town with thick cob walls (tamboho, made from the mud and dry rice stalks gathered from nearby paddies) and deep trenches (hadivory) to protect the dwellings inside. <b>The</b> <b>entryway</b> through the town wall was protected by an enormous stone disk (vavahady) – five feet in diameter or more – shaded by fig trees (aviavy) symbolic of royalty. The town gate was opened by laboriously rolling the vavahady away from <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> each morning and back into place again in the evening, a task that required a team of men to accomplish it. [...] This fortified town model was adopted throughout Imerina and is well represented at the historic village of Ambohimanga.|$|E

50|$|Connecticut Hall {{remained}} a student dormitory for nearly 200 years, but {{has always been}} joined by other uses. Lacking sufficient space, Thomas Clap and other faculty would hold class sessions in <b>the</b> <b>entryways.</b> Before purpose-built structures could be constructed, a physics laboratory, art gallery, and natural history collection were housed {{in various parts of}} the building.|$|R
500|$|The Beaux Arts style brick {{structure}} {{includes a}} portico on the State Street entrance {{on the north}} side. The façade includes an inscription, [...] "PUBLIC LIBRARY", in Roman type over <b>the</b> <b>entryway,</b> which is sheltered by a rigid metal awning on this north front. The roof of the square-shaped structure is constructed of both metal and tile. Stone is used for architectural accents of lintels and cornices on the exterior. The building remains connected to the neighboring former offices of the YWCA, which is a Pietro Belluschi designed building also owned by Willamette University.|$|E
500|$|Frank Lloyd Wright {{was a young}} {{architectural}} assistant {{working with}} Adler and Sullivan {{at the time the}} Rookery was built in 1888. Architect Daniel Burnham was a friend of Wright patron Edward [...] C. Waller. [...] Waller managed the Rookery; Wright had his offices in the building in 18981899. [...] In 1905 Wright received the commission to redesign the lobby in the building; at the time considered the grandest in Chicago. Wright's work on the Rookery recast <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> in his Prairie style and added a sense of modernity through his simple but effective lighting design. Wright's work on the Rookery is his only work on any building within the downtown cityscape.|$|E
500|$|The {{courthouse}} {{was restored}} by architect William D'Esmond in 1925. D'Esmond {{added a new}} roof and redesigned <b>the</b> <b>entryway</b> and balcony. The building's tenants included the US Post Office and a tax office. [...] The courtroom was upstairs and the Lahaina jail was housed in the basement. The building was listed as a National Historic Landmark and a contributing property of the Lahaina Historic District in 1965, and was restored again in 1990. The courthouse now houses a museum, art galleries, a visitor center, a community meeting room, and public restrooms. [...] The Lahaina Heritage Museum opened upstairs in 2004 with interactive exhibits including videos, photographs, and historical objects. [...] The Lahaina Arts Council and the Lahaina Historic Society have offices in the courthouse.|$|E
50|$|When the Great Race of Yith came to Earth, they warred {{with the}} polyps and soon drove them {{underground}} with their advanced technology. The Great Race then sealed <b>the</b> <b>entryways</b> to <b>the</b> polyps' subterranean abode with trapdoors, which afterwards were diligently guarded. The polyps' cities were left abandoned, {{perhaps as a}} reminder of the horrors that dwelt below.|$|R
