One requires tracking down and destroying a stolen experimental ship; another involves transporting classified {{information on the}} Thargoids' home planet, with Thargoid invasion ships doing their best <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not succeed throughout {{the duration of the}} mission involving multiple interplanetary jumps. Rewards differed depending on the mission - from cash, gems to esoteric hardware such as a cloaking device.|$|E

You can’t approach them. It {{is one of those things}} where they want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{copies of}} the {{original}} Appreciation were ordered destroyed in 1928 and before the [...] "Narrative" [...] had been published Dewar and his brother had already been barred access to the original. [...] However, he continued {{to have a major}} impact on the historiography of the Battle of Jutland by serving throughout the 1920s as Winston Churchill's naval consultant on submarine-warfare. [...] Churchill wrote an anti-Jellicoe tract in his World Crisis, Volume III which in large measure shared Dewar's views on tactics and even some diagrams. [...] Although Dewar would later become a supporter of the Labour Party, after Churchill was passed over for a cabinet position in 1931 Dewar wrote to him on 16 November, [...] "I am very sorry <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not in the new Cabinet. [...] I had hoped you would go to the Admiralty and do very necessary work for the Navy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} Dewey ran such a cautious, vague {{campaign}} came from {{his experience as a}} presidential candidate in 1944. In that election, Dewey felt that he had allowed Roosevelt to draw him into a partisan, verbal [...] "mudslinging" [...] match, and he believed that this had cost him votes. As such, Dewey was convinced in 1948 to appear as non-partisan as possible, and to emphasize the positive aspects of his campaign while ignoring his opponent. This strategy proved to be a major mistake, as it allowed Truman to repeatedly criticize and ridicule Dewey, while Dewey never answered any of Truman's criticisms. Near the end of the campaign, Dewey considered adopting a more aggressive style and responding directly to Truman's criticisms, {{going so far as to}} tell his aides one evening that he wanted to [...] "tear to shreds" [...] a speech draft and make it more critical of the Democratic ticket. However, nearly all of his major advisors – including Edwin Jaeckle, Press Secretary James Hagerty, and aide Paul Lockwood – insisted that it would be a mistake to change tactics. Dewey's wife Frances strongly opposed her husband changing tactics, telling him, [...] "If I have to stay up all night <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't tear up that speech , I will." [...] Dewey relented and continued to ignore Truman's attacks and to focus on positive generalities instead of issue specifics.|$|E
