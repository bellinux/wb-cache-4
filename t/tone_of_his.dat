5|$|It Was Written is {{the second}} studio album by American rapper Nas, {{released}} July 2, 1996 on Columbia Records in the United States. Following the moderate sales success of his acclaimed debut album, Illmatic (1994), Nas chose to focus his efforts in a more mainstream direction. Primarily produced by Trackmasters, it is a departure for him from the raw, underground <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> debut album towards a more polished, mainstream sound. The album features mafioso and gangsta themes, and marks the first appearance of Nas's short-lived supergroup The Firm, which included rappers Foxy Brown, AZ, and Cormega.|$|E
25|$|Gates's letter restated what Bunnell {{wrote in}} September and Roberts wrote in October. However, the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> letter was those hobbyists were {{stealing}} from him, {{not from a}} corporation.|$|E
25|$|In {{his earlier}} novels Stephenson deals heavily in pop culture-laden metaphors and imagery and in quick, hip dialogue, {{as well as}} in {{extended}} narrative monologues. The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> books is generally more irreverent and less serious than that of previous cyberpunk novels, notably those of William Gibson.|$|E

60|$|An ugly thrill {{spread from}} the spot he touched. The <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice were dull and startling, and echoed strangely in Will's heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it {{a matter}} of business?" [...] said Maruja, lightly, yet with a sudden instinctive premonition of coming evil in the {{relentless}} <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice.|$|R
25|$|Book 1 {{contains}} 11 poems; {{the first}} piece is an address by Ovid to his book about how it should act when it arrives in Rome. Poem 3 describes his final night in Rome, poems 2 and 10 Ovid's voyage to Tomis, 8 the betrayal of a friend, and 5 and 6 the loyalty {{of his friends and}} wife. In the final poem Ovid apologizes for the quality and <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> book, a sentiment echoed throughout the collection.|$|E
25|$|With {{his voice}} {{becoming}} increasingly familiar to audiences, Rogers essentially played himself in each film, without film makeup, managing to ad-lib and sometimes {{work in his}} familiar commentaries on politics. The clean moral <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> films resulted in various public schools taking their classes to attend special showings during the school day. His most unusual role {{may have been in}} the first talking version of Mark Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. His popularity soared to new heights with films including Young As You Feel, Judge Priest, and Life Begins at 40, with Richard Cromwell and Rochelle Hudson.|$|E
25|$|The violin maker Antonio Stradivari {{produced}} his instruments {{during the}} Little Ice Age. The colder climate is proposed to {{have caused the}} wood used in his violins to be denser than in warmer periods, contributing to the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> instruments. According to the science historian James Burke, the period inspired such novelties in everyday life as {{the widespread use of}} buttons and button-holes, knitting of custom-made undergarments to better cover and insulate the body. Fireplace hoods were installed to make more efficient use of fires for indoor heating, and enclosed stoves were developed, with early versions often covered with ceramic tiles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you {{given up}} all hope?" [...] Fred {{asked in a}} whisper, for while {{surrounded}} by the dense blackness the full <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice sounded fearsome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pull away, my lad," [...] {{said the}} captain, in the softest <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> deep voice, {{at the same}} time looking his reprover {{straight}} in the face.|$|R
60|$|In {{an instant}} I was wide awake, every nerve and fibre of me, for the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice {{told me that}} {{something}} had happened which bore upon our destinies.|$|R
25|$|Hume {{was very}} outspoken and never feared to criticise {{when he thought}} the Government was in the wrong. Even in 1861, he objected to the {{concentration}} of police and judicial functions {{in the hands of}} police superintendents. In March 1861, he took a medical leave due to a breakdown from overwork and departed for Britain. Before leaving, he condemned the flogging and punitive measures initiated by the provincial government as 'barbarous … torture'. He was allowed to return to Etawah only after apologising for the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> criticism. He criticised the administration of Lord Lytton before 1879 which according to him, had cared little for the welfare and aspiration of the people of India.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} Cortina was most active in 1896–1898, during {{the run-up to}} the Spanish–American War. Busy in the Hispanic New York {{community}} and contributing to a daily Las Novedades, he tried to confront the anti-Spanish frenzy of American press and complained about lack of assistance on part of Madrid, the charges which thanks to Vázquez de Mella reached the Cortes and the government in 1896. Following a visit in Spain, starting 1897 Cortina changed the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> press endeavors; he switched to advertising the claims of Carlos VII. Thanks to his efforts few US periodicals, including New York Herald, published pieces on Carlism. Some quoted Cortina say that 100,000 volunteers waited for an order to rise and that by January 1, 1898, Don Carlos would assume the throne, though also that the claimant would do nothing which might impair international standing of his country.|$|E
500|$|Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba {{recorded}} Supernova {{following his}} collaboration with Charlie Haden {{on the album}} Nocturne, which was co-produced, performed and orchestrated by Rubalcaba. The pianist was named the [...] "most visible musical presence" [...] in Nocturne and the album received the Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album at the 44th Grammy Awards, after being referred to as an [...] "engaging blend of jazz and Latin song" [...] by Don Heckman of Los Angeles Times. About Supernova, Rubalcaba stated that blends the melodic <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> previous album (Inner Voyage) and the lyricism of his early records.|$|E
60|$|As the Bravo spoke, {{he shook}} {{his hand in the}} {{direction}} of the domes of St. Mark, and the deep <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice appeared to heave up from the depths <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two canoes," [...] he said, in {{the deep}} {{guttural}} <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> race, holding up the number of fingers he mentioned, by way of preventing mistakes; [...] "one for you--one for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And how are ye now?' {{said the}} harsh and {{discordant}} <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> female attendant.' Said I not, {{it would come}} upon you--ay, and in this very cave, where ye harboured after the deed?' ...|$|R
500|$|It {{was during}} his time in Florida that Delius {{is said to have}} fathered a son with a local African-American woman named Chloe, {{although}} details of this legend are scarce. [...] Violinist Tamsin Little embarked on a search for descendants of Delius' alleged love child in the 1990s. [...] According to legend, upon Delius' return to Florida some years later to sell the plantation, Chloe, fearing that he had come to take her son away from her, fled with the child and disappeared, and Little believes that this tragic occurrence was a significant influence in the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Lynch and {{his family}} spent five years living in an {{atmosphere}} of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, which would later inform the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back". In Olson's David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, the author posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the [...] Pacific Northwest, giving the director a [...] "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" [...] which has subsequently shaped his films.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{critical}} acclaim of his debut album Illmatic (1994), Nas chose to concentrate his efforts {{in a more}} mainstream direction, {{in contrast to the}} raw, unpolished and underground <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> debut. Despite its significant impact on hip hop at the time, Illmatic did not experience the larger sales of most major releases at the time in hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle (1993). This was due in part to Nas's shy personality and uninvolvement in promoting the record. Nas began to make appearances on other artists' work, including Kool G Rap's [...] "4,5,6" [...] (1995) and Raekwon's [...] "Verbal Intercourse" [...] on his album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… (1995), which made Nas the first non Wu-Tang Clan member to appear on one of its solo recordings. He began to dub himself as Nas Escobar on these guest appearances.|$|E
60|$|The {{priest was}} a large man with beaming, kindly eyes, and a round jovial face. There was no bite in the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> good-natured retort, and so, smiling, the boy raised his visor.|$|R
6000|$|How the man's outraged heart {{sent the}} blood flaming {{up into his}} face and deepened the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> impetuous voice, as he {{stretched}} his arm across the bed, saying, with a terribly expressive gesture,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|While he {{was still}} at table, Toff appeared, with {{profound}} mystery in his manner, and discreet confidence in the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice. [...] "Here's another one, sir!" [...] the Frenchman announced, in his master's ear.|$|R
500|$|Đujić {{became known}} for his fiery speeches, which earned him the {{nickname}} [...] "Father Fire" [...] (...) [...] The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> speeches changed depending on the course of political developments in Yugoslavia and his ideological convictions ranged from right-wing royalist to left-wing progressive. At certain points, Đujić appeared to embrace the fascism of {{the leader of the}} Yugoslav National Movement, Dimitrije Ljotić, and at others, he strongly propagated conservative Chetnik ideology. Đujić's repeated calls for [...] "democracy" [...] and [...] "national rights" [...] prompted the regency of Prince Paul to brand him a [...] "left-wing agitator". He received considerable support from the Serbian Orthodox Church in Knin. He also used his position as a priest and respected local leader to influence how the people of Strmica would vote, instructing his parishioners to cast ballots for a candidate of his choosing in the 1935 Yugoslav parliamentary elections.|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, Feige {{said that}} the project was [...] "as close as it's ever been" [...] while Wright teased the film by tweeting a {{pictogram}} of Ant-Man. In June, Wright spent just under a week shooting footage for a reel {{that would be used}} to test out the potential look and <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> movie, as well as to decide how convincing Ant-Man's powers look on screen. The test footage was screened to audiences during the Marvel Studios panel at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, with Wright confirming that Ant-Man would be happening. Germain Lussier of /Film felt the footage worked and was [...] "awesome", as [...] "it had a totally different vibe from the other Marvel films. It was much more like something you'd recognize from Hot Fuzz." [...] Lussier, along with Katy Rich of CinemaBlend, also enjoyed the costume design choice. That October, Disney scheduled the film for release on November 6, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Waugh's {{adherence}} to Catholic teaching on divorce caused him frustration while awaiting the possible annulment of his marriage. He {{had fallen in}} love with Teresa Jungman, a lively socialite whose Catholicism precluded any intimacy in their relationship since in the eyes of the Church Waugh remained married. Waugh's conversion did not greatly affect the acerbic and sharply satirical <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fiction—his principal characters were frequently amoral and their activities sometimes shocking. Waugh claimed [...] "the right to write of man's depravity in such a fashion as to make it unattractive". When Black Mischief was published in 1932, the editor of the Catholic journal The Tablet, Ernest Oldmeadow, launched a violent attack on the book and its author, stating that the novel was [...] "a disgrace to anybody professing the Catholic name". Waugh, wrote Oldmeadow, [...] "was intent on elaborating a work outrageous not only to Catholic but to ordinary standards of modesty". Waugh made no public rebuttal of these charges; an open letter to the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster was prepared, but on the advice of Waugh's friends was not sent.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the little}} things, his movement, the funny <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice, that showed up big to Anna. The matter-of-fact things he said were absurd in contrast. The things her father said seemed {{meaningless}} and neutral.|$|R
6000|$|... "Search {{towards the}} woods, men," [...] said Lumley, who, {{whatever}} {{he might have}} felt, {{was the only one}} amongst us who seemed unexcited. We could trace no sign of anxiety in the deep <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> steady voice.|$|R
60|$|There was a pause. Mr. Farebrother {{seemed to}} wait for a {{recognition}} of the fact; and the emotion perceptible in the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fine voice gave solemnity to his words. But no feeling could quell Fred's alarm.|$|R
500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Ross' lyrics are {{somewhat}} different, [...] "Red bottom Bawse house big as Baltimore" [...] and [...] "With a blonde bombshell trying {{to bond with}} your boy." [...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him. I love the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice. I think the contrast of his voice and mine would be something special. I always like to do collaborations that people might think are different." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} Dead Head Fred is Fred Neuman (voiced by John C. McGinley), a private detective. [...] Fred {{is the only}} playable character, but since each head gives him a {{different}} set of animations, he could be considered nine separate characters. [...] As he does not have a proper face, Fred's mood is portrayed by the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice and by face-like expressions formed by his eyes and frontal lobes. [...] Fred has a wisecracking, sarcastic personality and occasionally breaks the fourth wall, such as heckling the player when he dies. [...] Ulysses Pitt (Jon Polito), the game's primary antagonist, is a small-time hoodlum turned racketeer. [...] Pitt employs many henchmen throughout Hope Falls, the most prominent of which is his lieutenant Lefty, whose right leg has been amputated and replaced with a tommygun. [...] Fred makes several allies throughout the game, including Dr. Steiner, who resurrected him, his girlfriend Jeanne Rossini (Kari Wahlgren), and his former partner Benny Salazar. [...] Fred's enemies are generally employees of Pitt, like the skeletal [...] "bone thugs", or creatures created by Hope Falls' radiation, like zombies and animated scarecrows.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Sinatra's {{first album}} {{in six years}} was released, , a highly ambitious triple album that {{features}} an array of songs from both the pre-rock era and rock era. It was the first studio album of Sinatra's to feature his touring pianist at the time, Vinnie Falcone, and {{was based on an}} idea by Sonny Burke. The album garnered six Grammy nominations– winning for best liner notes– and peaked at number 17 on Billboards album chart, and spawned yet another song that would become a signature tune, [...] "Theme from New York, New York". That year, as part of the Concert of the Americas, he performed in the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which broke records for the [...] "largest live paid audience ever recorded for a solo performer". The following year, Sinatra built on the success of Trilogy with She Shot Me Down, an album that was praised for embodying the dark <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Capitol years. Also in 1981, Sinatra was embroiled in controversy when he worked a ten-day engagement for $2million in Sun City, in the internationally unrecognized Bophuthatswana, breaking a cultural boycott against apartheid-era South Africa. President Lucas Mangope awarded Sinatra with the highest honor, the Order of the Leopard, and made him an honorary tribal chief.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic's Paula Edelstein {{gave the}} release {{a rating of}} four stars (of a {{possible}} five), stating, [...] "this is classic Rick Braun in a mellow, melodic mood, transporting listeners with the rich <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> muted trumpet voice through the musical landscape <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life." ...|$|R
5000|$|For philosopher Thomas Carlyle Coletti was [...] "by {{the cast}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, by the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice, by his general bearing,(...) {{a man of}} deep and ardent sensibilities, of {{delicate}} intuitions, just sympathies originally an almost poetic soul, or man of genius." ...|$|R
60|$|He held up {{his hand}} in warning. The <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice deepened, the luster <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes brightened. She had stirred in the depths of that great heart the faith in which the man lived--the steady {{principle}} which guided his modest and noble life.|$|R
