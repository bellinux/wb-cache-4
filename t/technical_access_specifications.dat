40|$|Technological {{development}} has flourished lately {{and its role}} in education might {{play a key role in}} young people’s social, educational, and professional life. Educators must teach young people relevant information and skills not only to give them a chance to explore and understand the world around them but also to familiarize them with digital technologies. But before we can educate young people we must empower teachers using digital technology. Because teachers who use digital technologies appropriately are not only good models but also help students develop positive attitudes towards such technologies. Considering that, the purpose of this study is to determine the levels of teachers’ digital enpowerment. Descriptive methods were used in this study to determine current level of teachers’ digital empowerment. It was found that teachers have average levels of digital enpowerment. Looking closer at sub-categories, it was found that their awareness and motivation levels were higher, however, <b>technical</b> <b>access</b> and empowerment levels were average. Comparing males and females showed that both teachers had high scores on awareness and <b>technical</b> <b>access</b> but motivation, empowerment, and over all males and females were roughly average. When sub­categories of digital empowerment was analyzed according to teachers’ specialties, it showed that Computer and Science teachers’ had high scores on awareness, motivation, <b>technical</b> <b>access</b> empowerment and overall average. However, Social Science, Turkish and Language teachers had high scores on awareness and motivation, but <b>technical</b> <b>access,</b> empowerment and overall average were average...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} a generalization {{of the notion}} of XML security view introduced by Stoica and Farkas [45] and later refined by Fan et al. [23]. The model consists of access control policies specified over DTDs with XPath expressions for data-dependent access control. We provide the notion of security views characterizing information accessible to authorized users. This is a transformed DTD schema that can be used by users for query formulation. We develop an algorithm to materialize an authorized version of the document from the view and an algorithm to construct the view from an <b>access</b> control <b>specification.</b> We show that our view construction combined with materialization produces the same result as the direct application of the DTD <b>access</b> <b>specification</b> on the document. We also propose a number of generalizations of possible security policies and show how they affect view construction algorithm. Finally, we provide an evaluation of our system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{interoperability}} {{among different}} data formats over the Internet has drawn increasing interest recently due to {{more and more}} heterogeneous data models are used in different Web services. In order to ease the manipulation of data models for heterogeneous data, generic model management has been intensively researched and also implemented in a prototype since its first introduction. <b>Access</b> control <b>specifications</b> attached to each individual data model require significant amount of efforts to manually specify. Based on a general security model for <b>access</b> control <b>specifications</b> on heterogeneous data models and its visual representation, we present secure model management operators for managing <b>access</b> control <b>specifications.</b> The secure model management operators disccussed in the paper include a secure match operator and a secure merge operator. We introduce a novel graphical schema matching algorithm and extend the algorithm to make a secure match operator. The paper also discusses secure merge principles for the integration of data models. ...|$|R
40|$|UPnP Remote Access {{technologies}} {{enable a}} UPnP device or UPnP control Point, {{such as a}} mobile phone, not currently located in the home or small business network to be securely connected to the home or small business network. This allows the remote UPnP device or control point to discover and interact securely {{with any of the}} UPnP device or control points that are contained within the home or small business network. UPnP Forum has recently published the version 2 Remote <b>Access</b> <b>specifications</b> in August 2011. The key feature of this new version of the specifications is to enable seamless connection between two home or small business networks thus allowing UPnP devices or control point in a home or small business network discover and interact with UPnP device and control point in another home or small business network using existing UPnP protocols. The newly published specifications address a number of features including solution for address collision when connecting two home or small business networks together, provisioning of remote access services, network address translation, and the concept of virtual device that allows multiple devices or services to be exposed to a remote home or small business network under the framework of a single device. The purpose of this white paper is to discover these new exciting features of the latest version of the remote <b>access</b> <b>specifications...</b>|$|R
