2500|$|The {{family moved}} to Chicago, Illinois, when Jemison was three years old, to take {{advantage}} of the better educational and employment opportunities there. Jemison says that as a young girl growing up in Chicago she always assumed she would get into space. [...] "I thought, by now, we'd be going into space like you were going to work." [...] She said it was easier to apply to be a shuttle astronaut, [...] "rather than waiting around in a cornfield, waiting for ET <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> up or something." ...|$|E
2500|$|You gotta realize that, out of {{the whole}} cast, nobody was over thirty. Diane Lane was, I think, eighteen. It was an {{enormous}} Hollywood production. My manager had me hire a limousine <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> up at home and take me to work. I was like, [...] "Jesus, this is incredible. This is... Hollywood. The real Hollywood. The Hollywood they make movies about."... It was scary. And Walter isn't {{the kind of guy}} who works well with kids. He's a cowboy. He's like John Ford. [...] "Don't ask me how to act! I'm a director!" [...] (Laughs) ...|$|E

"In the quarrel that a {{while back}} you sought <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> with <b>me.</b> What I touched on to her mother was the {{peculiar}} range of aspects and interests she's compelled to cultivate by the special intimacies that Mrs. Brook permits her.

2500|$|On Australia Day 2012 he was {{appointed}} as an Officer of the Order of Australia for services to cricket and, through the Ponting Foundation, the community. Ponting was promoted to captain in the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia in Michael Clarke's absence due to injury. However, after only two games as captain he was dropped, having scored only 18 runs in 5 games of the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series. At a press conference thereafter, Ponting conceded, [...] "I don't expect to play one-day international cricket for Australia any more and I'm pretty sure the selectors don't expect <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> either... I will continue playing Test cricket and I'll continue playing for Tasmania as well".|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. G. I bully you? How could I! You're so strong. (Hysterically.) Strong enough <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> {{up and put}} {{me outside}} the door and leave me there to cry. Aren't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} had," [...] said his step-son complacently. [...] "I can always tell. I don't {{see why you}} want <b>to</b> come <b>picking</b> on <b>me,</b> though. I've done nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the Fairy-King and Sylvie {{were talking}} together, but in such low tones that I could not catch the words: so I {{followed}} Bruno, who was picking and eating {{other kinds of}} fruit, in the vain hope of finding some that had a taste. I tried <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> so <b>me</b> myself--but it was like grasping air, and I soon gave up the attempt and returned to Sylvie.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is bad news, indeed," [...] Captain Leslie exclaimed; [...] "and I {{fear that}} the colonel has fallen {{into the hands of}} Argyll's minions. If it be so Farquharson is scarce likely to find the Royalist at anchor when he arrives at the port. Come, Long, let us be stirring. I will hand over the command of the {{regiment}} to Grahame till we return. While I am speaking <b>to</b> him <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> out ten trusty men." ...|$|R

60|$|PURDIE (for whom, alas, we {{need not}} weep). That is the appalling thing. But at present, at any rate, I am a rag at your feet, Joanna--no, at yours, Mabel. Are you going <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> up? I don't advise it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{leave you}} to imagine," [...] said Morley, pathetically, [...] "how it desolates me to forego the pleasure. But my friend Carruthers, of the New York Yacht Club, is <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> {{up here in}} his motor car at 8." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] he said, quickly. [...] "I {{remember}} I {{was quite}} played out when I entered the settlement, and I think I had parted from even some little trifles I carried with me. I am afraid I {{was a poor}} find <b>to</b> those who <b>picked</b> <b>me</b> up, and {{you ought to have}} taken warning. But the doctor has offered to lend me enough to take me to San Francisco, if only to give a fair trial to the machine he has set once more a-going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Peters," [...] he {{said when}} the captain appeared, [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> out for <b>me</b> four men, upon whom you can {{thoroughly}} rely.

60|$|They greeted our {{approach}} {{with the most}} discordant din it had ever been my fortune to hear. A mingling of honk and cackle, it manifested not excitement so much as curiosity. I walked among the boobies, and they never moved except <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> at <b>me</b> with long, sharp bills. Many were sitting on nests, and all around in the sand were nests with eggs, and little boobies just hatched, and others in every stage of growth, up to big babies of birds like huge balls of pure white wool. I wondered where the thousands of mothers were. The young ones showed no concern when I picked them up, save to dig into me with curious bills.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be ready; and you {{can call}} for me at Mrs. Askerton's. I must go down there, and it will save you {{something}} in your walk <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> up at the cottage." [...] And so the arrangements for the day were made.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} been very willing to do that," [...] said Bartley, [...] "but I thought it might remind you of a disagreeable little episode in your own life, when you flung me away, and had to go down on your knees <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> up again." ...|$|E

Stand by <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> up, mates," [...] he shouted, and {{lowering}} {{himself with a}} splash into the water struck out strongly towards them. Dobbs, a poor swimmer, after a moment's hesitation, followed his example.|$|E
5000|$|Mike Bernardo was of Italian {{heritage}} and {{was born in}} Fishhoek near Cape Town on 28 July 1969. His surname was actually Barnardo, but most people knew him as Bernardo. When he was younger, bullies often picked on him and beat him up. Bernardo started with Kyokushin {{to deal with his}} bullies: [...] "I started karate when I was, 12, 13 years old. The reason why I started was, because as a youngster I was quite tall but not strong. A lot of children at school were in gangs and they would always <b>pick</b> and beat <b>me</b> up because I was a big guy so they could prove their friends they were stronger. I took up martial arts lessons and went back to school and when they started <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> on <b>me</b> again and try to beat me up, I beat them all up." ...|$|R

A man in the crosstrees will make it out twenty miles away, and that will tell them where I am, and that I don't want them. If I burn a red light it will be a signal for the yacht <b>to</b> come and <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> up." ...|$|R

Sung Mi-kyung of OSEN likewise stated that Shinee have proved a broader musical spectrum through ballads with [...] "outstanding its sensitivity".|$|R

6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} were," [...] said the {{confidential}} maid. [...] "Hadn't we good cause to scream, {{waiting to be}} killed every minute.

5000|$|His novel The Atrocity Archives (2004) {{focused on}} a British {{intelligence}} agency investigating Mythos-like horrors; using ideas {{similar to those in}} the RPG book Delta Green (1996), Stross commented in an afterword to the book: [...] "All I can say in my defence is... I hadn't heard of Delta Green when I wrote The Atrocity Archive... I'll leave it at that except to say that Delta Green has come dangerously close <b>to</b> making <b>me</b> <b>pick</b> up the dice again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Barry Morgan said I {{ought to}} have one and offered <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>me</b> out a nice one among our set. I asked Josie first, and she hooted at the idea, so I thought I'd let Barry look round.

The island is large, not so large as Bauro, but still large.|$|E
6000|$|... "No paper-knife. And it's no good <b>picking</b> on <b>me.</b> I'm the star, not the {{assistant}} stage manager. If you're going <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> on anybody, pick on him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I had it {{engraved}} in script type on {{a visiting}} card {{and looked at}} it daily, maybe I would be able to remember it," [...] answered Tom, mournfully.

50|$|After the {{collapse}} of his marriage, Cohl moved to London <b>to</b> work for <b>Pick</b> <b>Me</b> Up, a humor magazine that specialized in French artists (he left his long-standing second job as a philatelist at this time). He returned to Paris in June 1896 and married Suzanne Delpy, the daughter of one of André Gill's followers. Their son André Jean was born on November 8, 1899. By this time, Cohl had moved away from caricature, sending humorous drawings to bicycle magazines, family magazines, and children's magazines. He also wrote articles on French history, stamps, and fishing. In July 1898 he started contributing to L'Illustré National. This would be the origin of Cohl's comic strips. At the same time, Cohl's art moved from scene-setting to story-telling, and from the Gill fantoche style to Impressionism. Other interests during this period included puzzles, toys (he invented a few new ones), and drawings of figures made from wax matches. In the political arena, he submitted anti-Dreyfus illustrations to La Libre Parole Illustrée.|$|R
