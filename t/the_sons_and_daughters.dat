Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin.

Knapp established the Powder Point School for Boys, a preparatory school, and converted Ezra Weston’s farm into athletic fields and the outbuildings into classrooms and gymnasiums. The King Caesar House was designated as the headmaster's house. The Powder Point School for Boys ceased operation in 1926 and the Knapp family sold the property in 1937.|$|E

500|$|In 1910, the Humphrey Bill, to {{appropriate}} money for monuments to mark the Trail, passed the House of Representatives and {{was introduced in the}} Senate, with a proviso that no money would be spent unless the Secretary of War could certify that the work would not require any further appropriations. Ezra Meeker set out that year on another two-year-long expedition, with the emphasis this time on locating and marking where the Trail had been, rather than on building monuments. [...] Sometimes the ruts in the ground from the emigrants' [...] wagons still existed and made it obvious, but other times he had to rely on the memories of old settlers. He journeyed to Texas, but had no success in interesting people in his project there. His tour was ended in 1912 in Denver when a flood struck the city, resulting in damage to his books. Nevertheless, according to Green, Meeker's two trips resulted in the placement of 150 monuments. A version of the Humphrey Bill passed the Senate in 1913, but died when the House of Representatives took no action. Despite this failure, groups began marking western trails: <b>the</b> <b>Sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daughters</b> of the American Revolution put up plaques along the Cowlitz Trail in 1916.|$|E

500|$|The Stanley Cup (...) is the {{championship}} trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. It {{is the oldest}} existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) considers it {{to be one of}} the [...] "most important championships available to the sport". Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with <b>the</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947.|$|E

2500|$|From {{this same}} evidence, {{something}} {{can be seen}} of Saint Patrick's mission. He writes that he [...] "baptised thousands of people". He ordained priests to lead the new Christian communities. He converted wealthy women, some of whom became nuns {{in the face of}} family opposition. He also dealt with the sons of kings, converting them too. The Confessio is generally vague about the details of his work in Ireland, though giving some specific instances. This is partly because, as he says at points, he was writing for a local audience of Christians who knew him and his work. There are several mentions of travelling around the island, and of sometimes difficult interactions with the chiefly elite. He does claim of the Irish: Never before did they know of God except to serve idols and unclean things. But now, they have become the people of the Lord, and are called children of God. <b>The</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> {{of the leaders of the}} Irish are seen to be monks and virgins of Christ!Saint Patrick's position as a foreigner in Ireland was not an easy one. His refusal to accept gifts from kings placed him outside the normal ties of kinship, fosterage and affinity. Legally he was without protection, and he says that he was on one occasion beaten, robbed of all he had, and put in chains, perhaps awaiting execution. Patrick says that he was also [...] "many years later" [...] a captive for 60 days, without giving details.|$|E
