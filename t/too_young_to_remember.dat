The village is likely named after Saint Margaret's Bay (Peggy being the nickname for Margaret), which Samuel de Champlain named after his mother Marguerite.

5000|$|Nate first meets Robert and James Ford at Llanview Hospital {{after the}} {{incident}} about the stolen money.

James was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> even <b>remember</b> Inez, though Robert was not. Robert feels that Inez abandoned both him and James with their deranged father, Eddie Ford. Inez also reveals that she was pregnant with Nate when she was still with Eddie, which means Eddie was Nate's father, too. This makes James and Robert his brothers. Inez left because {{she did not want to}} bring another child into the horrible life Eddie has given both James and Robert. This is the reason for the abandonment. Inez later tried talking to Robert, but he refused and forbade her from seeing James, wanting to keep her family away from [...] "his". Even though James knows the truth, he accepts Inez and Nate into his life, unlike Robert, though Robert also forbade James from seeing Nate and Inez. Nate tries to connect with his brothers but although James wants to, Ford is adamantly against it.|$|R

But who shall say? These things are beyond me, and the Swift One knew no more about them than did I.|$|E
