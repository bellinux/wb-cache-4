My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done my best <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began I {{have not been able to}} keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E

500|$|Breaking Benjamin's lyrical content {{evolved as}} a product of Burnley's sobriety, the front man noting that the lyricism in Dear Agony is more thought out. Rito Asilo of the Inquirer writes that Burnley [...] "owes the {{improved}} clarity and coherence in Breaking Benjamin's music to sobriety." [...] Burnley has said that before sobriety, anything that made sense thematically was a coincidence, and that he would take shots if he were dissatisfied with a lyric. Breaking Benjamin's lyrics have been noted for their vague, angst-heavy themes, Burnley saying that [...] "I try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> writing vague so people can draw their own conclusions." ...|$|E

A trainer friend of mine from Vancouver put together a quick little workout program for me. Since the role was for Colossus, I was aiming to bulk up a bit and get stronger.

500|$|Night at the Blood Beast was {{distributed}} by American International Pictures. It was test-screened for audiences in unadvertised sneak previews, in which audiences attending a different film were surprised with {{a screening of}} Blood Beast instead. Coincidentally, Martin Varno attended one of these sneak previews without any advance knowledge of what it was. The screening was also attended by Roger and Gene Corman, who were not pleased by Varno's presence. It {{was the first time}} the screenwriter had seen the completed film, which he did not enjoy, and he said of watching it: [...] "On my left side was sitting Forry Ackerman, and on my right side was sitting Jerry Bixby. And their main job was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> hands held down so I wouldn't cut my throat."

500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He kept telling me <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and he thought I was going to get us killed." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} {{has worked with}} screenwriter David S. Goyer on all his comic-book adaptations. Wally Pfister was the cinematographer for all of Nolan's films from Memento to The Dark Knight Rises. Embarking on his own career as a director, Pfister said: [...] "The greatest lesson I learned from Chris Nolan is <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> humility. He is an absolute gentleman on set and he is wonderful to everyone — from the actors to the entire crew, he treats everyone with respect." [...] Lee Smith has been Nolan's editor since Batman Begins, with Dody Dorn editing Memento and Insomnia. David Julyan composed the music for Nolan's early work, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard provided the music for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Zimmer scored The Dark Knight Rises, and has worked with Nolan on his subsequent films. Zimmer has said his creative relationship with Nolan is highly collaborative, and that he views Nolan as [...] "the co-creator of the score". The {{director has}} worked with sound designer Richard King and sound mixer Ed Novick since The Prestige. Nolan has frequently collaborated with special-effects supervisor Chris Corbould, stunt coordinator Tom Struthers first assistant director Nilo Otero, and visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin. Production designer Nathan Crowley has worked with him since Insomnia (except for Inception). Nolan has called Crowley {{one of his closest}} and most inspiring creative collaborators. Casting director John Papsidera has worked on all of Nolan's films, except Following and Insomnia.|$|E
500|$|Richie Egan is the {{principal}} songwriter but refers to the overall band as Jape. This came about following his first few solo performances when he realised he did not wish people to consider him a singer-songwriter {{but as part of}} a band. Egan has been part of many bands from a young age, and spent his youth experimenting with four-track tape recorders and sounds. He was previously a member of the bands Black Belt Jones and Sir Killalot. After leaving Black Belt Jones he {{went on to become the}} bassist in the instrumental rock band The Redneck Manifesto of which he is still a member. He has occasionally toured as part of David Kitt’s live band, as well as in Conor J. O'Brien's band Villagers as a bass player and with his bandmates in The Redneck Manifesto. By 2003 Egan had developed Jape after spending a week at the family home of fellow Redneck, Niall Byrne, in Avoca, County Wicklow. [...] "I’ve been playing in bands since I was really young but I’ve always been messing around on the side with four-track tape recorders, experimenting with sounds". [...] "The chance to turn this “messing around” into something concrete came about when he was given the opportunity to decamp to Avoca, where fellow Redneck, Niall’s family own a house. Richie used it as a studio for a week." [...] "I listen to a lot of different styles of music, so I try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> finger in as many pies as possible. It keeps me interested," [...] he laughs." ...|$|E
500|$|A big storyline {{occurred}} {{for the character}} in 2008, when Phoebe is killed after the car her boyfriend Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder) was driving crashes. Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was so tiny and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, I had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> emotions in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and maybe I am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on Kurt's storyline as he faced being {{perceived}} primarily as gay both when auditioning and when running for class president. VanDerWerff {{said it was}} [...] "the most consistent" [...] storyline, and Canning called it [...] "the most familiar story", but also described Kurt as [...] "by far the most interesting and most layered" [...] character, his stories [...] "delivering the most emotional connections", and this episode's installments [...] "entertaining territory". Kubicek stated that there were [...] "tons" [...] of wonderful [...] "Kurt moments" [...] in the episode. Benigno called Kurt learning to embrace his gayness yet again on the show [...] "kind of awkward", and Hyman asked [...] "Was this Kurt Accepts He's Special 3.0 or 4.0? I can't keep track." [...] Votta summed up Kurt's audition quandary: [...] "Kurt is fighting typecasting, and while the ninjitsu, fingerless gloves and climbing routine {{might have been an}} attempt to butch it up, instead Kurt played right into expectations with the over-the-top Funny Girl piece." [...] His attempt to rescue the situation by reauditioning via performing a Romeo and Juliet scene with Rachel evoked laughter from the three directors and Rachel herself, but as Votta points out, Kurt was [...] "not actually being bad as Romeo". Jayma Mays, who plays Emma, one of the directors in that scene, stated in an interview that she thought Kurt was [...] "good". Kurt finding himself in competition with Blaine was also touched on, but several reviewers were unhappy with the revelation that Blaine was not a senior like Kurt, as had been implied in the previous season. VanDerWerff wrote that Blaine [...] "seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over the summer", Votta noted [...] "the continuity-bending plot point that he's somehow a Junior and not a Senior like his boyfriend", and Urban allowed her exasperation to show: [...] "Oh really, Glee? Blaine's a junior? Blaine's younger than Kurt? Fine. FINE." [...] MTV Jim Cantiello went into rhyme to express his dismay: [...] "It's hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> bearings straight / And oh, how it makes my heart ache / Kurt and Blaine were gonna move to New York together / But now they'll have to wait", referring to a scene in the [...] "New York" [...] episode where Kurt discussed the planned move with Rachel.|$|E
