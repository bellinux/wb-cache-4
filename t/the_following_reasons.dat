5|$|The planned coup {{was criticized}} by historians as {{unrealistic}} for <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>reasons.</b> Piłsudski's plan {{was based on}} false assumptions and faulty intelligence, which incorrectly indicated that the Sleževičius government was deeply unpopular, and that the general Lithuanian population was relatively friendly to Poland. No notable ethnic Lithuanian politicians declared support for the plan; the plan relied on support from General Žukauskas, but his support was never confirmed; Narutowicz, who was to head the civilian government, was a Pole; the PMO was weak and incapable of taking control if the coup met any significant resistance; and intervention of the Polish army would have led to bloodshed and undermined {{the idea of a}} voluntary union or alliance with Poland. The only group that supported the coup was the Polish minority in Lithuania, increasingly alienated by Lithuanian government policies. However, according to the Lithuanian census of 1923, the minority constituted 3.2% of the population outside the Vilnius Region. On the ground, the uprising was doomed by poor communication and the overeagerness of some of the PMO activists.|$|E

25|$|Pei Songzhi cast doubts on the Shiyu account. He {{felt that}} it was {{unlikely}} that Yu Song had to recommend Zhong Hui to Sima Shi, because Sima would most probably have already at least heard of Zhong due to <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, Zhong Hui came from an elite family background. Second, he was already famous when he was still a youth. Third, he started serving in the Wei government as soon as he reached the age of adulthood. Pei also believed that it was impossible for anyone to be able to tell, simply by reading a piece of writing, that a person who edited a few words in it is capable of shouldering greater responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{proceeded}} {{to reject the}} {{clear and present danger}} test for <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>reasons.</b> To begin with, the test is linked to the United States' unique culture and constitutional position on freedom of speech, which does not represent the position in most Commonwealth jurisdictions and Singapore. In particular, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution {{is quite different from the}} corresponding provisions in the respective constitutions of Commonwealth jurisdictions. The Court cautioned that the United States approach should not be followed as it could result in possible abuse and negation of the right itself. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the real risk test is already a weighty test which pays the correct attention to the balance between the right to freedom of speech and the possibility of its abuse.|$|E
25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>reasons.</b> It always arises from {{repetition}} of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds {{he has a new}} baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.|$|E

In response, Drew Curtis noted <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>reasons</b> for the redesign: [...] "Websites have to evolve over time. Otherwise {{you end up with}} a layout anachronism like the Drudge Report. The old design was put into place years ago, over time changes were nailed on to the design like loose shingles on a leaky roof. It was time to reformat and remove a bunch of the clutter while trying to keep the core design intact."
