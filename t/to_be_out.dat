5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Against Osasuna on 17 September 2011, Villa contributed {{two goals}} and forced Rovérsio into scoring an own goal in Barcelona's 8–0 {{win over the}} team from Pamplona. He then broke his tibia in a Club World Cup match in Yokohama against Al Sadd. Doctors said he was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of action {{for up to six}} months, but this {{eventually}} led to him missing the entire 2011–12 season with both Barcelona and the Spanish football team at Euro 2012.|$|E

A ball must completely cross a boundary line <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E

5|$|The game {{marked the}} first time in team history that the Bears have allowed 21 points or more in their first seven games, and the first time since 1969 that Chicago has allowed at least 40 points in two {{consecutive}} away games.

5000|$|Unlike croquet, both balls must <b>be</b> staked <b>out</b> in {{the same}} turn in order to {{outright}} win the game. By necessity, this requires the first ball <b>to</b> <b>be</b> staked <b>out</b> on a roquet shot and the second ball <b>to</b> <b>be</b> staked <b>out</b> on the ensuing continuation shot. Thus, unlike croquet, one side cannot defensively [...] "stake-out" [...] an opponent's rover in roque.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} praised by critics for its visuals, but {{was criticized for}} its poor game {{controls}} and short length. Meanwhile, the soundtrack polarized players and critics alike, with those defending it saying the music was catchy and well produced; while detractors found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of place for a racing game. Sonic R is the only original Sonic game to be released on the Sega Saturn; Sonic 3D Blast is a port of the Genesis title, and Sonic Jam is a compilation of the first four Sonic games.|$|E
5|$|As Emily's winds eased over land, various {{assessment}} teams left Fort Bragg, North Carolina, {{to determine}} the extent of damage. FEMA informed the North Carolina congressional delegation about the storm's threat to their constituents. The agency later received compliments for their timely preparations for storm-related operations. All airports on the Outer Banks were reopened by September1. In response to the extensive scale of the power outages, power companies flew a helicopter over the region to assess the damage. The power was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> for two weeks. Six emergency vehicles were sent to Dare County to provide drinking water.|$|E
5|$|At both Portsmouth and Cirencester, Hammond {{excelled at}} sports {{including}} cricket (playing for the Portsmouth Grammar School second eleven), football and fives. At Cirencester, he played football {{for the school}} first eleven in his first term. He quickly reached the school cricket first eleven, where he outperformed the other players and became captain in his second season; his headmaster, quickly spotting his potential, encouraged him. His first century was scored in a match against a parents' team from the school. In an inter-house match, he scored 365 not out, albeit against very weak bowling. These achievements brought him some local acclaim. Hammond enjoyed less success in the classroom; his marks were usually low, and he preferred <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> playing cricket.|$|E

5|$|Coulson joined newly {{promoted}} League Two club York City on {{a two-year}} contract on 29 June 2012. He scored on his debut with a long-range strike away to League One team Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup first round to give York a 1–0 lead, with the match finishing 1–1 after extra time. Coulson missed York's first penalty {{in the ensuing}} penalty shoot-out, which the team lost 4–2. He then played in York's first Football League fixture since their promotion, a 3–1 defeat at home to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012. After sustaining a cruciate ligament injury during York's away match against Accrington on 23 October 2012, Coulson was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> {{for the rest of}} 2012–13. However, he made his return as a 73rd-minute substitute in York's 0–0 draw away to Bristol Rovers on 30 March 2013. He finished the season with 21 appearances and five goals.|$|E
5|$|Davies and Caldwell {{began the}} 2012–13 season as first choice until an ankle injury {{sustained}} by Davies during a League Cup match at Coventry City gave Pablo an early opportunity to impress. He kept his place after Davies returned to fitness, but chipped a {{bone in his}} foot in the defeat to Barnsley and was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> for a month. Further injuries, the return to fitness of Caldwell, {{and the emergence of}} young left-back Mitch Hancox, which allowed Paul Robinson to partner Davies in the centre, meant that Pablo played only twice more, and he was released {{at the end of his}} contract.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{took the}} new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball. He persevered through the pain and removed Washbrook in his fourth over. Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32/2. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later. England were 46/4 and Australia were firmly in control. Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes. After the tea break, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball. Compton edged Johnston <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> for 53. One run later, Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134/6 with their skipper dismissed for 44. Johnson then removed Evans for nine, before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Johnston removed both. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9/207.|$|E

5|$|On October15, the {{governor}} of the United States Virgin Islands announced the final preparations for Hurricane Omar as he signed a State of Emergency declaration for the territory. Public schools would be closed on October16. All non-essential workers would be dismissed at 10 a.m. local time. At 6 p.m. curfew was put in place for the same day. Only those with valid passes would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> after the curfew was put in place. That same day, a Hurricane Warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane-force winds and torrential rains from Omar. The American Red Cross planned to open shelters throughout the islands before the hurricane struck. Sandbags were also being distributed in St. Croix. A large oil refinery, which produces , was shut down and only necessary workers remained at the refinery.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{suffered}} a knee cartilage injury in mid-October, after a successful operation {{he was expected}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> for a month. This meant he {{would be likely to}} miss crucial Champions League ties against Manchester United and Aalborg. He returned earlier than expected and was back in training on 9 November, having missed seven games. Samaras returned to action on 12 November, coming on as a substitute in a 3–0 win over Kilmarnock. On 25 November he started against Aalborg but did not play well and missed several chances as Celtic lost 2–1. This loss consigned Celtic to a bottom place finish in their group.|$|E
5|$|The loan {{was twice}} {{extended}} {{for a further}} month, and on 11 November 2002 Gill left Birmingham permanently, signing for Northampton {{until the end of}} the season. His season proceeded successfully– a new two-year contract had been discussed, and he finished as runner-up for the club's Player of the Year award– until with two games remaining he damaged his anterior cruciate ligament and was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> for several months. Northampton were prepared to give him a six-month contract, albeit on reduced wages, to allow him time to recover and prove his fitness. Birmingham City allowed him to use their facilities for his rehabilitation, and he recovered sufficiently to play a couple of reserve games for Northampton, but by that time new manager Colin Calderwood had other players in Gill's position and he was not offered another contract.|$|E
