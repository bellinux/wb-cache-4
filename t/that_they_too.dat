5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>too</b> enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> <b>too,</b> may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> <b>too,</b> had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|When {{the grade}} of Knight Commander was {{established}} in 1815 the regulations specified <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>too</b> should have a banner and stall plate affixed in the chapel. This was never implemented (despite some of the KCBs paying the appropriate fees) primarily {{due to lack of}} space, although the 1847 statutes allow all three classes to request the erection of a plate in the chapel bearing the member's name, date of nomination, and (for the two higher classes) optionally the coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|From {{at least}} {{the time of the}} Pyramid Texts, kings hoped that after their deaths they could emulate Osiris's {{restoration}} to life and his rule over the realm of the dead. By the early Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE), non-royal Egyptians believed <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> <b>too,</b> could overcome death as Osiris had, by worshipping him and receiving the funerary rites that were partly based on his myth. Osiris thus became Egypt's most important afterlife deity. The myth also influenced the notion, which grew prominent in the New Kingdom, that only virtuous people could reach the afterlife. As the assembled deities judged Osiris and Horus to be in the right, undoing the injustice of Osiris's death, so a deceased soul had to be judged righteous in order for his or her death to be undone. As ruler of the land of the dead and as a god connected with maat, Osiris became the judge in this posthumous trial, offering life after death to those who followed his example. New Kingdom funerary texts such as the Amduat and the Book of Gates liken Ra himself to a deceased soul. In them, he travels through the Duat and unites with Osiris to be reborn at dawn. Thus, Osiris was not only believed to enable rebirth for the dead; he renewed the sun, the source of life and maat, and thus renewed the world itself.|$|E
5|$|In Shanghai {{during the}} 1930s, Sing {{and his friend}} Bone attempt to join the Deadly Axe Gang, which ruthlessly {{controls}} the city {{under the leadership of}} Brother Sum. Sing seeks to restore his confidence after being humiliated as a young boy while trying to protect a mute girl from bullies, due to the failure of the Buddhist Palm method he had learned from a pamphlet he bought from a beggar. Sing and Bone attempt to intimidate the residents of Pig Sty Alley but are chased off by its Landlady. Hearing of this, Sum orders the capture of Sing and Bone, while sending the Gang to reassert its authority {{in the wake of the}} humiliation. Three of the tenants, Coolie, Tailor, and Donut, reveal themselves to be martial arts masters, defeating more than fifty of the Gang. Fearing retribution, the Landlady evicts the three, but they encounter a pair of hired assassins who fight using a magical guqin that launches invisible blades. Coolie is beheaded, and Tailor and Donut are mortally wounded before the Landlady and her husband the Landlord reveal <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>too</b> are martial arts masters, having gone into self-exile after the death of their son. The two defeat the assassins but Tailor and Donut die from their injuries. The Landlords temporarily evacuate the other tenants for their safety.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{business}} industry for the Nanyang-Chinese seemed extremely prosperous, {{most of the}} Chinese immigrants strove to acquaint themselves with the shopkeepers and attempted to learn and eventually master trade in the hopes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>too</b> would eventually gain entry to business in the Nanyang. This allowed for the continuation of business-creation by the Chinese arriving in the region.|$|E

Two of the Journal of Calendar Reform articles (1938 and 1943) thought that six-day as well as five-day weeks were organized into 30-day months. A couple of modern sources state that five-day weeks plus {{the first two years}} of six-day weeks were organized into 30-day months.|$|E
25|$|The Assumption is {{important}} to many Catholic and Orthodox Christians as the Virgin Mary's heavenly birthday (the day that Mary was received into Heaven).

25|$|In the 1850s, {{as large}} {{plantation}} owners outcompeted smaller farmers, more slaves were owned by fewer planters. Yet poor whites and small farmers generally accepted {{the political leadership}} of the planter elite. Several factors helped explain why slavery was not under serious threat of internal collapse from any move for democratic change initiated from the South. First, given the opening of new territories in the West for white settlement, many non-slaveowners also perceived a possibility <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> <b>too,</b> might own slaves {{at some point in}} their life.|$|E
