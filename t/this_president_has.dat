His prosecutors, Holder said, had “constructed a case that uses materials and evidence that does not derive from the techniques that were controversial,” which would “maximize our chances for success.” It was a driving concern to Holder that the case not rest on torture. “It’s a statement about what this Administration is about,” he said. “It’s a statement about this Attorney General.

5000|$|On 16 September, the {{collapse}} of the BYuT/NU-NS coalition was officially announced. Yulia Tymoshenko unleashed one of her harshest attacks on Yushchenko yet, accusing the President of destroying the gains of the Orange Revolution, sinking hopes of rebuilding the coalition. [...] "Since 2004, <b>this</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> managed to destroy everything: people's faith in the ideals of the revolution and faith in the president himself - only 5 percent still support him," [...] she told reporters after a cabinet meeting. [...] "Unfortunately, this president will leave a legacy of shattered remnants of the 'orange' promises and democratic coalitions, of his own team and even of his friends and his own political standing." [...] Tymoshenko also blamed Yushchenko for [...] "everything bad that will happen in relations between Ukraine and Russia" [...] calling for Ukraine to pursue a more [...] "balanced" [...] policy towards Russia. Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko and the Party of Regions of trying to create a twoparty system in parliament. The two blocs joined forces in drafting and registering a new law in parliament on 17 September that would introduce a two-round election system for parliament which would likely lead to BYuT and Regions being the only parties in parliament after the next election. Viktor Yanukovich said his party did not want to initiate early elections and added [...] "The Constitution must be changed so as to provide efficient operation of authorities." ...|$|E

If the second house also approves the charges made by special majority again, the President stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated their office from the date when such a resolution stands passed.

5000|$|Rumours that then-President Thabo Mbeki was a philandererwere {{controversially}} {{brought to}} light by a comment Du Preez made on a national radio show in 2001.

The contents of this tape persuaded Nixon's own lawyers, Fred Buzhardt and James St. Clair, that “the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers—for more than two years.” The tape, which Barber Conable referred to as a “smoking gun,” proved that Nixon had been involved in the cover-up from the beginning.|$|R

The second line of enquiry that runs through this article deals with the conflicts that arose when the coca union mutated into a governing political party. Now that the coca growers' leader, Evo Morales, is President of the Republic he is obliged by the international community {{to reduce the amount of}} land under coca cultivation. To do <b>this</b> <b>President</b> Morales <b>has</b> had to rhetorically pull coca leaf apart from Andean tradition.

25|$|As a {{transitional}} measure, {{for the first}} three years after the election of the first President of Ireland a bill to amend the Constitution could be passed by the Oireachtas as an ordinary act. An amendment bill before the election of the first President (on 25 June 1938) would have required a referendum. To prevent the Oireachtas abusing <b>this</b> provision, the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> the power to refer such a bill to the people. The First and Second Amendments were adopted in <b>this</b> way; <b>President</b> Douglas Hyde chose to sign each into law without referendum. The three-year limit was entrenched to prevent it being extended without referendum. Since 25 June 1941, the third anniversary of President Hyde's election, every amendment has had to follow the pattern of passage through the Oireachtas followed by a referendum.|$|R
5000|$|Under certain circumstances, the President {{may also}} {{theoretically}} {{be forced to}} dismiss the Chairman and the whole government under pressure of the State Duma.

5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution.

However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council <b>President</b> may <b>have</b> prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission <b>President</b> would <b>have</b> power, it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|R
