50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ovens</b> <b>and</b> Murray Football Netball League (O&MFNL) is an Australian rules {{football}} and Netball competition containing ten clubs based in north-eastern Victoria, the southern Riverina region of New South Wales <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ovens</b> <b>and</b> Murray area. <b>The</b> {{name comes from}} <b>the</b> <b>Ovens</b> River, <b>the</b> river {{in the part of}} north-eastern Victoria covered by the league, and the Murray River, which separates Victoria and New South Wales.|$|R

25|$|This {{region is}} the most {{suitable}} to taste empanadas, particularly those stuffed with meat and offering different types of tempting varieties such as the meat empanada, salteña also filled with potatoes, or the empanada tucumana, which is stuffed with matambre and cut with a knife, or empanadas made with cheese. Empanadas are individual sized and closed savoury pastries which may be fried or baked in <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> are generally eaten with the hands.|$|E
25|$|The Persians {{introduced}} a clay oven called a tanur (similar to the Indian tandoor), which had an {{opening at the}} bottom for the fire, and through which the bread was placed to be baked on the inner wall of the upper chamber from the heat of <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> ashes after the flames had died down.

25|$|The {{layout of}} the house {{remained}} {{much the same as}} the previous series, although the kitchen moved {{to the other side of}} the main living area. One big theme in the house was annoyance; the kitchen appliances were scattered around the house, with <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> heat proof surface in the bedroom and the fridge in the garden. As further annoyance, the bathtub was placed in an open space right next to the main living room. Where the oven was in the bedroom was approximately where the kitchen area was located in Big Brother 7.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|E
25|$|The form of home {{automation}} called assistive domotics focuses on {{making it possible}} for elderly and disabled people to live independently. Home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as {{home automation}} for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users. For example, automated prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre-recorded audio messages; an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the door.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} Australian rules {{football}} clubs in Wangaratta, the Wangaratta Football Club, the Wangaratta Rovers Football Club (both competing in <b>the</b> <b>Ovens</b> <b>and</b> Murray Football League), and the North Wangaratta Football Club, which competes in <b>the</b> <b>Ovens</b> <b>and</b> King Football League.

25|$|Another Shabbat dish is calf's foot jelly, called p'tsha or šaltiena in Lithuania and galarita, galer, galleh, or fisnoge in Poland. Beef or calf {{bones are}} put up to boil with water, seasonings, garlic and onions {{for a long}} time. It is then allowed to cool. The broth then jells into a {{semi-solid}} mass, which is served in cubes. Drelies, a similar dish originating in south Russia and Galicia is mixed with soft-boiled eggs and vinegar when removed from <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> served hot.

25|$|Yorishiro are, however, most {{numerous}} in people's homes. During the New Year's holidays people decorate their entrances with kadomatsu, {{which are}} the yorishiro of the new year's kami. Kamifuda, pieces of paper representing the kami, are hung above the door. There are kami who dwell in the toilet (benjō-gami) and in the well (suijin). The kamado-gami lives in <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> its function {{is to protect the}} house from fires. Other common yorishiro are the small altar called kamidana and the butsudan, which is an altar for the dead. (Butsudan were originally meant just for Buddhist worship, but now often contain also spirit tablets called ihai, which are yorishiro used to recall the spirits of one's dead ancestors). In shops one often sees clay cats with a raised paw called maneki-neko or rake-like bamboo objects called kumade supposed to attract good business.|$|E
25|$|Coordinated {{words are}} {{normally}} written separately (with a comma). If {{the meaning of}} the result is {{different from that of the}} two words together, but both elements take suffixes, they are written with a hyphen (e.g. süt-főz ‘cook’, consisting of words referring to cooking in <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> cooking in water, sütnek-főznek ‘they cook’). A hyphen is needed in cases when a phrase is only used with certain suffixes. Connections of words which are completely fused and thus take suffixes only at the end of the second element are written as one word (e.g. búbánat ‘sorrow and grief’, búbánatos ‘stricken with sorrow and grief’). However, there are phrases that only take suffixes at the end but their elements are still connected with a hyphen, as when words are contrasted (e.g. édes-bús ‘bittersweet’). Certain phrases can be suffixed either at the end of both elements or only at the end of the second element (e.g. hírnév ‘fame’: hírneve or híre-neve ‘his/her/its fame’).|$|E

25|$|The {{somewhat}} scanty biblical details {{concerning the}} shewbread are complemented by further information given by Josephus (a contemporary of Herod's temple), and, over the several centuries after the Temple's destruction, by classical rabbinical literature. According to Josephus, the cakes were unleavened and were baked on the Friday before the Sabbath, since the biblical regulations forbade work {{of any kind}} during the Sabbath. The Mishnah argues that the loaves were kneaded separately, but baked in pairs; the Mishnah also states that the loaves were moulded into shape by three different moulds (made from gold, according to Maimonides, who lived {{more than a thousand}} years after the burning of Jerusalem), with one being used while the loaves were just dough, another while the bread was being baked in <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> a third after baking, to protect the shape. The Mishnah describes the loaves as being 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, with rims/horns that were 7 Etzba long; Maimonides gives the same figures but with Tefah as the unit rather than Etzba.|$|E
25|$|Uneven heating in microwaved {{food can}} be {{partly due to}} the uneven {{distribution}} of microwave energy inside <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> {{partly due to the}} different rates of energy absorption {{in different parts of the}} food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.|$|E
500|$|The death-lay's {{version of}} the bishop's death was {{different}} from the vita. The bishop's killer was called Lalli. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake from <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man’s hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head. When Lalli’s mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted to take it off, but with it came his scalp. Lalli then died a painful death.
