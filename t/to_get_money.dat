5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>money,</b> stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E

However, they failed to realize Andy was under some tarps in the pit, and he is injured when mounds of dirt fall on him. He is taken to the hospital, where Ann is {{assigned}} as his nurse. An angry Ron (Nick Offerman) tells Leslie the town is now open to a large potential lawsuit from Andy, and he sends her to visit him along with their city attorney Scott (H. Jon Benjamin). Meanwhile, Andy is excited to be near Ann and insists {{it will lead to}} them getting back together, but Ann tells him she is very happy dating Mark, who unlike Andy has a job, apartment and future. A disheartened Andy decides he has <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>money</b> to impress Ann. When Leslie visits, he regretfully tells her he and his attorney Wendell Adams (Chris Tallman) are going to sue Pawnee.|$|E

5|$|Sawyer is in {{bed with}} a young woman, Jessica (Kristin Richardson). After he {{declares}} his love for her, she realizes he is late for a meeting. As he rushes to leave, his briefcase falls open, revealing thousands of dollars in cash he claims she was not supposed to have seen. Sawyer then informs her that he is meeting someone <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>money</b> for an investment that will triple his cash in two weeks, and Jessica tells him that she will get additional money from her husband, David (Michael DeLuise), so that she and Sawyer can split the profit. Later, Sawyer is revealed to be a con artist in debt with a loan shark, Kilo (Billy Mayo), who demands his money back, plus fifty percent, by the next day. Sawyer goes to Jessica's house to finalize the deal, but reconsiders upon seeing a small boy (Jim Woitas) emerge from another room. He suddenly calls off the con, drops his briefcase of money, and rushes out of their house.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} plot to {{discredit}} both Dart {{and the government of}} Texas, Edwards persuaded some abolitionists in Cincinnati to give him money with which he would supposedly liberate the slaves on his plantation in Texas, which he no longer owned. Edwards also tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>money</b> from the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in New York, but its leader, Lewis Tappan, did not trust him and no money was forthcoming from that source. Edwards then went to England, bearing forged letters of introduction from, among others, Daniel Webster and the American Secretary of State, John Forsyth. One of these letters was to Lord Spencer, who was so impressed he gave Edwards £250 as a loan. While in England, Edwards defrauded a company in Liverpool of about $20,000, and then used part of the funds to repay Lord Spencer. The Republic of Texas ambassador in London warned the English government against Edwards. Tappan also sent warnings, so Edwards was unable to acquire more money in England and had returned to the United States by June 1841.|$|E
5|$|During 1794, Southey {{began to}} plan with Coleridge and others about a {{political}} system that they would start in America called Pantisocracy. He needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>money</b> for the project and he contacted Richard Cruttwell on 19 July 1794 to publish Joan of Arc for that end. After notifying Bedford about the plan, Bedford advised Southey to contact William Nicol, a London publisher, to publish the work and raise more money. Southey did find a publisher, Joseph Cottle, to print his poem. A notification for the publication of Joan of Arc was included in a publication of Southey's poems later in 1794, but the edition was stopped from being printed since it lacked the minimum of 50subscribers {{to pay for the}} cost. The poem was finally published by Cottle in 1796 (see 1796 in poetry) after changes to the text including a section added by Coleridge. The second edition would later be printed without Coleridge's lines and they were instead published on their own. For the second edition, Southey revised many lines and added more research to the work. It was printed in May 1798. Later editions were published in 1806, 1812, and 1837, with the final one further toning down Southey's republican sentiment.|$|E

5|$|Lords {{was born}} Nora Louise Kuzma in Steubenville, Ohio. Her parents {{divorced}} {{when she was}} 7-years-old due to her father's abusive behavior, and she moved {{with her mother and}} three sisters to her great-grandmother's house. When she was 10, she was raped by a sixteen-year-old acquaintance. At the age of 12, Kuzma moved with her mother and sisters to Lawndale, California, along with her mother's boyfriend Roger, who was a cocaine dealer. She began attending Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California. At 14, she became pregnant by her high school boyfriend. Searching for a job in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>money</b> for an abortion, Kuzma was introduced to Roger's friend Lynn for whom she started working as a babysitter. Lynn offered to help her solve her job problems by getting her a fake driver's license ID. Her new ID, with the name of Kristie Elizabeth Nussman, stated she was 22 rather than 15. She ran away from home and ended up on the streets of Hollywood where she landed a job as a nude model. After appearing in a nude centerfold in Penthouse magazine (she was only 15 when the photos were taken), Kuzma became nationally known as Traci Lords. From there she appeared in numerous adult films and magazines until authorities discovered she had been a minor and started an extensive investigation of all her co-workers.|$|E
5|$|The game's second case, Turnabout Airlines, {{takes place}} in the present, and has Edgeworth {{becoming}} involved with the smuggling ring during a trip aboard an airliner. An Interpol agent investigating the smuggling is murdered during the trip, and Edgeworth and a flight attendant become the main suspects. Another prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, works with Interpol to expose the smuggling ring; she and Edgeworth discover the murderer to be another flight attendant, who is working with the smuggling ring. In the third case, The Kidnapped Turnabout, Edgeworth is called by Ernest Amano, whose son Lance has been kidnapped and is held at an amusement park. While attempting to exchange the ransom money, Edgeworth is also kidnapped, but is freed by Kay, who calls herself the true Yatagarasu. They release Lance, and find the dead body of Oliver Deacon, who Lance identifies as one of the kidnappers. As Edgeworth investigates the mystery, he meets Interpol agents Shi-Long Lang and Shih-na, who believe that Amano's business group is involved with the smuggling ring; the ring's counterfeit money has ruined the economy of their home country Zheng Fa, so they seek {{to bring an end to}} the ring. Edgeworth learns that the kidnapping was a ploy by Lance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>money</b> from his father, and that Lance had killed Deacon after the latter tried to back out of the plan. Evidence is found tying Amano to the smuggling ring, and Lang brings Amano in for questioning.|$|E

25|$|Many {{role-playing}} games allow {{players to}} play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may make it easier <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>money,</b> there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players {{to live with the}} consequences of their actions. Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player's avatar. An example of this would be in Baldur's Gate, where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded.|$|E

The Bureau of Indian Affairs said the tribe's school wasn't eligible, based on the authorizing statute for the program. The tribe, and Abramoff, its lobbyist, then began working with Burns. Abramoff's lobbying team had strong connections with Burns's staff. Among their ranks was Shawn Vasell, an Appropriations aide who shuttled back and forth between jobs on Burns's staff and Abramoff's shop. Ryan Thomas, another Burns appropriations staffer, and Burns's chief of staff, Will M. Brooke, were treated to a trip to the 2001 Super Bowl in Florida on a corporate jet leased by Abramoff's team.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Riis {{had to be}} {{master of}} all trades: pastor, administrator, bursar, accountant, carpenter, {{architect}} and a public relations officer between the Mission and the traditional rulers. As more missionaries were recruited for the mission, the burden of administrator increased. Riis and another Basel missionary, Simon Suss was forced by the situation to trade and barter in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>money</b> to buy food and other needs of his expanding mission staff and local workers. The missionaries faced many difficulties {{and one of the}} many charges leveled against them by detractors was that they had become commercial traders instead of church missionaries. Riis and his men started evangelizing to the rural people around Akropong, so the Basel Mission became colloquially known as “rural or bush” church. Riis wanted to tackle paganism inland and to learn the Akan language spoken more widely in the Gold Coast. Riis as a disciplinarian dismissed an Americo-Liberian missionary, George Thompson who failed in his mission at Osu in 1845.|$|E
