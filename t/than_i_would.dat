500|$|The city of Dallas {{received}} the building well, {{and a local}} television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially {{opened to the public}} in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: [...] "It's perhaps stronger <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have liked; it's got more strength than finesse." [...] He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back.

Epiphany (in its current release), for some strange reason, doesn't like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won't work {{on a lot of}} sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won't be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser)." [...] Wallen concluded positively about the browser, [...] "Although Epiphany hasn't fully replaced Chrome and Firefox as my one-stop-shop browser, I now use it much more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have previously.

[...] However, he did compliment the episode's gross-out scares, noting that the beginning was [...] "a pretty great cold open". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, was extremely critical of the episode.

Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four.

500|$|The {{severity}} of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This {{appears to have been}} a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the [...] "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. O. O. Howard, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, [...] "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act."

[...] Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, [...] "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina."

[...] When informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire, Whedon thought that it was a joke, stating [...] "Didn't I just leave this party?" [...] in reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [...] In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the [...] "Business School" [...] episode and his former TV show were very similar because [...] "Buffy [...] was sad and depressing but... it was funny. Especially when people died. And {{a lot of people do}} die in [...]" [...] But upon completing the episode, Whedon stated [...] "That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened.

[...] "I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it...But way more input was asked for <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have ever anticipated."

500|$|In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) {{approached}} Gardner {{and asked}} him to revive Ian Fleming's James Bond series of novels. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels, and the novelizations of two Bond films. Gardner stated that he wanted [...] "to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s", although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years. With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam's, the Gardner novels showed {{an increase in the number}} of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing [...] "pants", rather than trousers, in The Man from Barbarossa. James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were [...] "dogged by silliness", giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where [...] "Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher". Whilst Gardner's Bond novels received a mixed reaction from the critics, they were popular and a number appeared in The New York Times Best Seller list, bringing the author commercial success. Gardner had an ambivalent view on being the Bond author, once saying that [...] "I'm very grateful to have been selected to keep Bond alive. But I'd much rather be remembered for my own work <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> for Bond", while saying on another occasion that [...] "I remain proud that my contribution to the Bond saga played a great part in its development". In the mid-1990s, after discovering he had esophageal cancer, Gardner officially retired from writing Bond novels and Glidrose Publications quickly chose Raymond Benson to continue the literary stories of James Bond.|$|E
