25|$|Minimum {{wages are}} used widely in {{developing}} countries to protect vulnerable workers, reduce wage inequality, and lift <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> out of poverty. The political popularity of minimum wages stems {{in part from the}} fact that the policy offers a means for redistributing income without having to increase government spending or establish formal transfer mechanisms. The challenge to policymakers is to find that wage level that is considered fair given workers' needs and the cost of living, but does not harm employment or a country's global competitiveness.|$|E
25|$|The New Deal {{programs}} {{to relieve the}} Depression are generally regarded as a mixed success in ending unemployment. At the time many New Deal programs - especially CCC - were popular.

Economic progress for minorities, however, was hindered by discrimination, an issue often avoided by Roosevelt's administration.|$|E
25|$|Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson, Joseph Hickey, and James Henslin have {{proposed}} class systems with six distinct social classes.

It {{is based on an}} original panel dataset containing information related to remittances in about 80 developing countries and to the number of workers being paid less than 2 dollars per day as well. Even after factoring in the endogeneity of remittance inflows the results suggest that remittances lead to a decrease in <b>the</b> prevalence of <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> in receiving economies. This effect is stronger in a contex of high macroeconomic volatility but is mitigated by the unpredictability of remittances : remittances are more effective to decreasing <b>the</b> share of <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> when they are easily predictable. Moreover, domestic finance and remittances appear as substitutes : remittances are less efficient in reducing <b>the</b> prevalence of <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> whenever finance is available.

25|$|Planning and {{architecture}} {{went through a}} paradigm shift {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. The industrialised cities of the 19th century had grown at a tremendous rate, with the pace and style of building largely dictated by private business concerns. The evils of urban life for <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The laissez-faire style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the Victorian era, was starting to give way to a New Liberalism that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age, by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to providing some individuals with income and employment, street newspapers are intended to give homeless participants responsibility and independence, {{and to create a}} tight-knit homeless community. Many offer additional programs to vendors, such as job training, housing placement assistance, and referral to other direct services. Others operate as a program of a larger social services organization—for instance, Chicago's StreetWise can refer vendors to providers of [...] "drug and alcohol treatment, high school equivalency classes, career counseling, and permanent housing". Most are engaged in some form of organizing and advocacy regarding homelessness and poverty, and many function as [...] "watchdogs" [...] for the local homeless communities.

500|$|Although {{the modern}} street {{newspaper}} {{began with the}} 1989 publication of Street News in New York City, and the Street Sheet in San Francisco, 1989, newspapers sold by the poor and homeless to generate income and to bring attention to social problems {{date back to the}} late 19th century; journalism scholar Norma Fay Green has cited The War Cry, created by the Salvation Army in London in 1879, as an early form of [...] "dissident, underground, alternative publication".

Most street papers published before 1970, such as The Catholic Worker (founded in 1933), were affiliated with religious organizations. Like workers' papers and other forms of alternative media in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, early street newspapers were often created because the founders believed mainstream news did not cover issues that were relevant to ordinary people.|$|E
