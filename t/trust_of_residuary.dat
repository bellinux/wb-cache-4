50|$|If the {{deceased}} beneficiary {{was intended to}} inherit part or all <b>of</b> the <b>residuary</b> estate, then {{that portion of the}} estate would pass by intestate succession, as though the testator had left no will.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{proposes a}} novel method {{to enhance the}} {{emission}} characteristics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). It is extremely possible for CNTs to adsorb moisture and other contaminants during the fabrication processes, leading to the degraded field emission characteristics. In this work, CNT emitters are activated with commonly used heating process and supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO 2) fluids technology for removing adsorbed residue moisture. Experimental results have demonstrated that the electrical stability and field emission enhancement of CNT emitters are effectively achieved by the SCCO 2 fluids treatment compared to the heating process, due to the minimization <b>of</b> <b>residuary</b> moisture in CNTs.

40|$|In {{scientific}} literature, the <b>trust</b> <b>of</b> key stakeholders {{is considered}} to be the base for the survival of organizations. In the context of the relation between corporate reputation and the <b>trust</b> <b>of</b> stakeholders, scientists agree on evident importance of corporate reputation for the development <b>of</b> stakeholder <b>trust</b> in the organization; however, {{there is a lack of}} recommendations suggesting how an organization should develop the <b>trust</b> <b>of</b> key stakeholders using corporate reputation.

We provide guidelines for the analysis and modeling <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships. We review operations on trust relationships and relative types <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships in our previous work. We provide a set of definitions for the properties of direction and symmetry <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships. In order to analyze and model the scope and diversity <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationship, we define trust scope label. We provide some example scenarios to illustrate the proposed definitions about properties <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationship. All the definitions about the properties <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships are elements of the taxonomy framework <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships. We discuss the lifecycle <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships that includes the analysis and modeling <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships, trust relationships at runtime, and change management <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relationships.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that an {{artificial}} neural network is able to produce results of sufficient accuracy to be useful for preliminary prediction of vessel resistance, with the major benefits of: being relatively simple to set up; being easily retrained with new data; and that Froude number may be easily included as an independent variable. In this work the Neural Network is fitted directly to the original tank test data, rather than to a set of smoothed curves varying in the Froude number axis. In addition, different network architectures have been investigated, with networks containing two hidden layers being seen to perform well. A procedure for the optimisation of design parameters using a Genetic Algorithm has also been evaluated. The Genetic Algorithm uses the approximation provided by the Neural Network response surfaces for its objective function. This {{has been found}} to be effective and of acceptable performance.
