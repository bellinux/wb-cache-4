40|$|AbstractIt's {{important}} for <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical industrial park to calculate <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park as chemical industrial parks developed fast {{in recent decades}} in our country. This paper defined <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> capacity <b>of</b> chemical industrial park and improved the calculation methods which had been presented. <b>The</b> <b>safety</b> capacity <b>of</b> chemical industrial park could be calculated by using <b>the</b> indictors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> capacity (individual risk, social risk and potential risk), in the basic information of the park, such as the production scale of enterprises in the park, layout and the population distribution and so on. The new method presented the concepts of hazardous chemicals equivalent to research {{the impact of the}} hazardous chemicals species to <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> capacity. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> population distribution will also be considered when calculating <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> capacity. Besides, <b>the</b> domino effect should be discussed to fix <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical industrial park when the park is at full load condition. Then, <b>the</b> real <b>safety</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park could be calculated. Finally, the analysis process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appropriate <b>safety</b> capacity is illustrated with an application example in a certain chemical industrial park...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of leadership for effective safety management {{has been the}} focus of research attention in industry for a few years. However, safety leadership in relation to safety climate has rarely been examined. This study has investigated <b>the</b> relationship between <b>safety</b> leadership and <b>safety</b> climate in <b>the</b> context of coal mine. Self-administered questionnaires that included a safety leadership scale and a safety climate scale were used to collect data in three coal mines in China. The number of returned valid questionnaires was 450, and the response rate was 88. 2 %. Exploratory factor analysis identified three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> leadership and four dimensions <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> climate. <b>The</b> structural equation modeling results suggest that <b>the</b> active management <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> leadership positively affects <b>safety</b> training <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> climate, <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> motivation <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> leadership positively affects <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> commitment and <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> climate, and <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> monitor <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> leadership positively affects <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> awareness <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> climate. <b>The</b> study findings also reveal positive associations among <b>safety</b> climate. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> the statistical analysis indicated that coal mine leaders would do well to develop a strategy to change their leadership styles by which they improve <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> climates...|$|R
