5|$|Turner Catledge, the top {{editor at}} The New York Times from 1952 to 1968, wanted {{to hide the}} {{ownership}} influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he removed the publisher's name from the memos it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.|$|E
5|$|San Martín <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he joined}} forces with Bolívar {{he would be able}} to defeat the remnant royalist forces in Peru. Both liberators would meet in Quito, so San Martín {{appointed}} Torre Tagle to manage the government during his absence. Bolivar was unable to meet San Martín at the arranged date, so San Martín returned to Lima, but still left Tagle in government. Bolívar moved from Quito to Guayaquil, which secured its independence. There were discussions on the future of the region: some factions wanted to join Colombia, others to join Peru, and others to become a new nation. Bolívar ended the discussion by annexing Guayaquil into Colombia. There was Peruvian pressure on San Martín to do a similar thing, to annex Guayaquil to Peru.|$|E
5|$|The third voyage sailed in January 1774 and her {{purpose was}} to {{evacuate}} the Falklands entirely as Britain was faced with political difficulties from the American Colonies, the French and the Spanish. The government <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> British ships and troops were engaged in America, Spain might seize the Falklands, capturing the small garrison at Port Egmont and maybe killing some of them - this, it was feared, would trigger an outcry which might topple the government. Endeavour left England in January 1774, and sailed from the Falklands with all the British inhabitants on 23 April, leaving a flag and a plaque.|$|E

5|$|At 3pm, the Cabildo {{began its}} routine work, but was {{interrupted}} by 600armed men named the Infernal Legion, who occupied the Plaza de la Victoria and loudly demanded the convening of an open cabildo and the resignation of Viceroy Cisneros. They carried a portrait of FerdinandVII and the lapels of their jackets bore a white ribbon that symbolized criollo–Spanish unity. Domingo French, the mail carrier of the city, and Antonio Beruti, {{an employee of the}} treasury, led the rioters. It was rumored that Cisneros had been killed, and that Saavedra would take control of the government. Saavedra was at the barracks at that moment, concerned about the demonstration. He thought the violence should be stopped and that radical measures such as the assassination of Cisneros should be prevented, but he also thought that the troops would mutiny if the demonstrations were suppressed. The people in the Plaza did not believe that Cisneros would allow the open cabildo the next day. Leiva left the Cabildo, and Belgrano, who was representing the crowd, requested a definitive commitment. Leiva explained that everything would go ahead as planned, but the Cabildo needed time to prepare. He asked Belgrano to help the Cabildo with the work, as his intervention would be seen by the crowd as a guarantee that their demands would not be ignored. The crowd left the main hall but stayed in the Plaza. Belgrano protested about the guest list, which consisted of the wealthiest citizens, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the poor people were left outside there would be further unrest. The members of the Cabildo tried to convince him to give his support, but he left.|$|E

60|$|All this while, {{so great}} was our haste and so {{occupied}} were {{each of us}} with our own <b>thoughts</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> my memory serves me, we scarcely interchanged a word. Down the snow slopes we marched swiftly and without hesitation, for here the road was marked for us by means of pillars of rock set opposite to one another at intervals. These pillars we observed with satisfaction, for {{they told us that}} we were still upon a highway which led to the Promised Land.|$|R
25|$|It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a ghost finds {{someone in}} the street and follows them home, they and their family will have bad luck for the next year.

25|$|Some rabbis of the Middle Ages {{argued that}} after eating solid dairy {{products}} such as cheese, the hands should be washed. Shabbatai ben Meir even argues that this is necessary if utensils such as forks were used and the cheese never touched by hands. Other rabbis of that time, like Joseph Caro, <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{it was possible to}} visually verify that hands were clean, then they need not be washed; Tzvi Hirsch Spira argued that washing the hands should also be practiced for milk.|$|E
25|$|Sophie Germain <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the {{geometry}} method, which {{at that time}} referred to all of pure mathematics, could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study. So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father's library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek so she could read works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed Traité d'Arithmétique by Étienne Bézout and Le Calcul Différentiel by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited her in her house, encouraging her in her studies.|$|E

25|$|Wellington {{believed}} that the Spanish besiegers were lax in allowing the French to successfully forage for food. The British commander <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the wheat fields had been burned and the gardens ruined that Pamplona would have fallen three weeks earlier. In fact, Cassan's ability to hold out into the autumn forced Wellington to keep Hill's corps at the Roncevaux Pass where it endured constant rain and snow that put many soldiers in the hospital. More significantly, Wellington refused to order his army to move into France until Pamplona had fallen. By this measure, Cassan performed a good service to his emperor.|$|E
25|$|The legend {{may result}} {{from the fact that}} the daddy long-legs spider preys upon deadly venomous spiders, such as the redback, a member of the black widow genus Latrodectus. To the extent that such entomological {{information}} was known to the general public, it was perhaps <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the daddy long-legs spider could kill a spider capable of delivering fatal bites to humans, then it must be more venomous, and the uncate fangs were regarded as prohibiting it from killing people. In reality, it is able to cast lengths of silk onto its prey, incapacitating them from a safe distance.|$|E
25|$|In September 1962, analysts {{from the}} Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) noticed that Cuban surface-to-air missile sites were {{arranged}} in a pattern {{similar to those used}} by the Soviet Union to protect its ICBM bases, leading DIA to lobby for the resumption of U-2 flights over the island. Although in the past the flights had been conducted by the CIA, pressure from the Defense Department made the authority be transferred to the Air Force. Following the loss of a CIA U-2 over the Soviet Union in May 1960, it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> another U-2 were shot down, an Air Force aircraft arguably being used for a legitimate military purpose would be easier to explain than a CIA flight.|$|E

60|$|I was {{astonished}} at the sincerity and temper of this truly pious Papist, {{as much as}} I was oppressed {{by the power of}} his reasoning; and it presently occurred to my <b>thoughts,</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> such a temper was universal, we might be all Catholic Christians, whatever church or particular profession we were joined to, or joined in; that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right principles; and, in a word, as he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the like charity would make us all Catholics, as I told him, I believed had all the members of his church the like moderation they would soon be all Protestants; and there we left that part, for we never disputed at all.|$|R
25|$|Feynman {{was fond}} of saying that all of quantum {{mechanics}} can be gleaned from carefully thinking through {{the implications of this}} single experiment.

25|$|Burke was {{a leading}} sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, {{in some cases it}} might be desirable, he insisted a {{democratic}} government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities, who needed the protection of the upper classes.|$|E
25|$|At 16:00, the CVR {{showed that}} Captain Tsu left the cockpit; five seconds later, the CVR stopped recording. Tests {{indicated}} that a click would be heard on the CVR recording if the CVR circuit breaker had tripped normally, but not {{if it had been}} pulled out manually. As there was no click, it is likely that Captain Tsu pulled out the CVR circuit breaker before leaving the cockpit. The NTSC and NTSB investigators <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Captain Tsu was responsible for the crash, he must have made up some excuse to get the First Officer to leave the flightdeck prior to disabling the FDR (which would have immediately triggered a Master Caution on both pilots' control panels), so his actions would not be noticed. Several minutes later, as recorded by Indonesian ground radar, the aircraft entered a rapid descent, disintegrated, and crashed into the Musi River.|$|E
25|$|During the 292-day Richmond–Petersburg Campaign (Siege of Petersburg) Union General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant had {{to conduct}} a {{campaign}} of trench warfare and attrition in which the Union forces tried to wear down the less numerous Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, destroy or cut off sources of supply and supply lines to Petersburg and Richmond and extend the defensive lines which the outnumbered and declining Confederate force had to defend to the breaking point. After the Battle of Hatcher's Run on February 57, 1865 extended the armies' lines another , Lee had few reserves after manning the lengthened Confederate defenses. Lee knew he must soon move part or all of his army from the Richmond and Petersburg lines, obtain food and supplies at Danville, Virginia or possibly Lynchburg, Virginia and join General Joseph E. Johnston's force opposing Major General William T. Sherman's army in North Carolina. Lee <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Confederates could quickly defeat Sherman, they might turn back to oppose Grant before he could combine his forces with Sherman's.|$|E

60|$|My second <b>thought</b> was <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> Mrs. Thompson {{kept her}} word, {{we might as}} well go home at once, without bothering about the Soudan.

60|$|I {{no sooner}} saw her, {{but it came}} into my <b>thoughts,</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> she was {{anything}} of a sea-boat, she would do our business to a tittle; and, as we had always resolved to get another ship, but had been disappointed, this would answer our end exactly; accordingly I went with my chief mate, in our shallop, on board my old acquaintance the Dutch captain, and inquiring there, was informed {{that it was a}} prize taken, and that in all probability the captain that took her would be glad to part with her; and the captain promised me to go on board the ship that brought her in, and inquire about it, and let me know.|$|R

25|$|The Fourth, Reserve and Third armies, were to {{be ready}} by 12 October, the Fourth Army to attack towards Le Transloy, Beaulencourt, the ridge beyond the Thilloy–Warlencourt valley to Loupart Wood (about a mile east of Irles). Before the main attack, the Fourth Army was to advance north-eastwards, to capture a spur west of Le Transloy and Beaulencourt and north {{to the edge of}} the Thilloy–Warlencourt valley. Haig <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> there was normal autumn weather, the {{objectives}} could be achieved but some restrictions on artillery ammunition consumption were imposed and more aircraft were requested from England. An attack on 1 October, was to advance the left flank, capture Eaucourt and part of the Flers line (also known as the Le Sars line) up to Le Sars. The Reserve Army was to advance towards Puisieux, as the right flank met the attacks from the south bank at Miraumont, enveloping German troops in the upper Ancre valley. The Third Army was to provide a flank guard north of the Reserve Army, by occupying a spur south of Gommecourt. Operations {{were to be}}gin by 12 October, after the Fourth Army had attacked towards Le Transloy and Beaulencourt and the French Sixth Army had attacked Sailly-Saillisel. The French Tenth Army south of the Somme was to attack on 10 October, north of Chaulnes.|$|E
25|$|The {{main story}} {{leading up to}} the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was the health of the England vice-captain Denis Compton. His famously damaged knee had swollen up after making another century – 115 vs an Australian XI – and hourly bulletins were posted by the MCC manager Brigadier Michael Green expressing optimistically that he would play in order to help draw a large crowd for the Test, though doubts where express by those who had seen him. In the end he was unfit to play and was {{replaced}} by the Welsh amateur batsmen Gilbert Parkhouse who had made 58 in the Australian XI game, adding 130 with the luckless Compton. The reserve wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre was also dropped from his batting role and the teenaged Brian Close was brought in as the best of a bad bunch, having hit 105 not out against long hops and full tosses served up in a minor game. Brown <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> nothing else as an all-rounder he could help take some of the strain off the other bowlers and so Close became the youngest Englishman to play Australia in a Test. Australia made only one change, dropping Jack Moroney for having made a pair in the First Test. His successor was chosen in the Australian XI game and opener Ken Archer (12th man at Brisbane) was given his Baggy Green ahead of the middle order batsman Jim Burke (who was made 12th man), although he had only made 81 to Burke's 128. Lindsay Hassett won the toss and batted first on a yellow, matted wicket made for batting.|$|E
