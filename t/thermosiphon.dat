30|$|These results present {{settlement}} hazard {{induced by}} climate warming alone. Practically, some remedial measures {{could be applied}} to the Qinghai-Tibet highway/railway, including embankments, paving <b>thermosiphons</b> and ventiducts, and crushed-rock structure embankments. These measures effectively accommodate the impact of climate warming on the stability of an embankment (Lai et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2005; Ma et al. 2012). Ma et al. (2013) indicate that crushed-rock embankments can cause natural permafrost table uplift of approximately 3.0 and 2.7  m in cold and warm permafrost regions, and that general embankments are also helpful to uplift the permafrost table, but with a relative small effect. To estimate the realistic onset timing of settlement hazard that combines the thermal role and remedial effect, we assume that climate warming needs to first offset the natural permafrost table uplift caused by remedial measures and then further yield warming-induced settlement. This is a fair assumption because settlement does not occur in the initial stage due to the natural permafrost table uplift occurring in an ice-free embankment. In our calculations, we used the largest natural permafrost table uplift of 3.0  m from Ma et al. (2013), which means that the estimated timings are the latest onset limit.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The {{problem of}} heat {{transfer}} due to free convection in a channel formed by two parallel, isoflux, vertical plates is of considerable importance in electronic cooling applications, <b>thermosiphons,</b> the optimum spacing of plates or components, industrial stacks, heat exchangers, {{nuclear power plants}} and combustion involving vertical walls. Although in each implementation other physical considerations are necessary, fully developed flow with symmetric isoflux boundary condition offers a fundamental heat transfer problem. Thus, here, the fully developed laminar natural convective flow of a viscous fluid in a channel formed by heated infinitely long vertical plates is investigated. Using boundary layer approximations, the basic governing equations of continuity, momentum and energy are combined into a single equation and solved analytically for a symmetric uniform heat flux boundary condition to find the velocity and temperature profiles and heat transfer coefficients for the flow. The closed-form solutions that are presented are strightforward and simple compared to previous solutions existing in the literature. For Rayleigh numbers sufficiently small to ensure a fully developed flow, {{it is found that}} the local Nusselt number based on local wall to bulk temperature difference is 4. 118.

The solar water heating system investigated work on the <b>thermosiphoning</b> effect or natural convection. An extensive literature study has been undertaken to investigate this phenomena. The three partial differential equations (governing equations) are non-dimensionalized and a similarity solution is applied to obtain two coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations. These equations are then solved in MATLAB to obtain the velocity and temperature profiles. Two scenarios were considered, a vertical wall with a constant wall temperature and a vertical wall with a constant heat flux. LP SWH systems use vacuum tubes to absorb solar radiation and transfer it to the water, {{which is similar to}} the vertical wall with a constant heat flux. A simulation model has been developed for a LP SWH system which is able to simulate the system performance for a given geographical location, where the user can specify the system component attributes. Experiments on the system were conducted to validate the simulation model. The simulation model accompanies a 6 -Step Design Guide developed to assist the user to design a system able to satisfy the consumer's hot water demand. The 6 -Step Design Guide developed can be used in future design considerations for LP SWH systems in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, systems {{based on}} {{convective}} boiling flows {{are found in}} a wide variety of industrial applications, such as boiling water reactors, boilers, <b>thermosiphons,</b> heat exchangers, condenser, chemical reactors and some other chemical process units. Such systems take advantage of the high heat transfer rates that a boiling fluid can reach at moderate temperature differences. However, those systems are unfortunately susceptible to thermally induced two-phase flow instabilities, such as Density Wave Oscillations. Thereby, the aim of present research is to perform an experimental investigation on Density Wave Oscillations, focusing on the analysis of the operational parameter effect in the system stability and characteristics of the oscillations. As a result of this investigation, the Ishii-Zuber plane is found to be appropriate to represent the system stability and that the Guido?s criteria cannot be used to estimate the instability threshold. Moreover, the oscillation amplitude monotonically increases by increasing the heat flux until it reaches an asymptote and the period is found to decrease when the amplitude is increased. Finally, a new dimensionless correlation based on amplitude ratio, is proposed as a result of the observed trends. It is found to be very useful, not only correlates well the collected data at the onset of Density Wave Oscillation, but also predicts the maximum amplitude for the given sets of operating conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{indirect}} type {{natural convection}} solar dryer with integrated collector-storage solar and biomass backup heaters has been designed, constructed and evaluated. The major {{components of the}} dryer are biomass burner (with a rectangular duct and flue gas chimney), collector-storage thermal mass and drying chamber (with a conventional solar chimney). The thermal mass {{was placed in the}} top part of the biomass burner enclosure. The dryer was fabricated using simple materials, tools and skills, and it was tested in three modes of operation (solar, biomass and solar-biomass) by drying twelve batches of fresh pineapple (Ananas comosus), with each batch weighing about 20 kg. Meteorological conditions were monitored during the dehydration process. Moisture and vitamin C contents were determined in both fresh and dried samples. Results show that the thermal mass was capable of storing part of the absorbed solar energy and heat from the burner. It was possible to dry a batch of pineapples using solar energy only on clear days. Drying proceeded successfully even under unfavorable weather conditions in the solar-biomass mode of operation. In this operational mode, the dryer reduced the moisture content of pineapple slices from about 669 to 11 % (db) and yielded a nutritious dried product. The average values of the final-day moisture-pickup efficiency were 15, 11 and 13 % in the solar, biomass and solar-biomass modes of operation respectively. It appears that the solar dryer is suitable for preservation of pineapples and other fresh foods.

50|$|Fowler {{patented}} the <b>thermosiphon</b> in 1828 (British patent number 5711). It was {{the first}} convective heating system.

50|$|Without proper cooling, {{a modern}} {{processor}} chip can rapidly reach temperatures that {{cause it to}} malfunction.

50|$|Early cars, motor {{vehicles}} and engine-powered farm & industrial equipment used <b>thermosiphon</b> circulation to move cooling water between their cylinder block and radiator. They depended on forward {{movement of the}} car and fans to move enough air through the radiator to provide the temperature differential that caused the <b>thermosiphon</b> circulation. As engine power increased, increased flow was required and so engine-driven pumps were added to assist circulation. More compact engines then used smaller radiators and required more convoluted flow patterns, so the circulation became entirely dependent on the pump and might even be reversed against the natural circulation. An engine cooled only by <b>thermosiphon</b> is susceptible to overheating during prolonged periods of idling or very slow travel when airflow through the radiator is limited, unless one or more fans are able to move enough air to provide adequate cooling. They are also very sensitive to low coolant level, i.e., losing only a small amount of coolant stops the circulation; a pump driven system is much more robust and can typically handle a lower coolant level.|$|E
50|$|Heating at {{this time}} was by means of {{coal-fired}} stoves. In large houses these would {{be placed in a}} basement, allowing <b>thermosiphon</b> circulation throughout the house. Nearly a century after Fowler, British practice for typical small houses in the post-World War I period developed the back boiler, where a living room fireplace would also have a simple tank boiler built into it. Large diameter pipes from this boiler circulated through a coil heat exchanger in an indirect hot water storage cylinder upstairs. This hot water supplied both bathroom, increasingly fitted upstairs in houses of this period, and the kitchen or scullery downstairs. The height difference between boiler and storage allowed <b>thermosiphon</b> circulation in this simple large bore primary circuit. By the 1960s, the space heating circulation system was assisted by an electric pump. Switching from coal heating to gas boilers also drove a switch to reliable pumped circulation in the 1970s.
