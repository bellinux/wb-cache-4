These entities include private and public players with various classifications, typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and light government regulation. The item traded may be a <b>tangible</b> <b>product</b> such as apples or a service such as repair services, legal counsel, or entertainment.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of modern furniture design. The ubiquitous Cantilever chair and the Wassily Chair designed by Marcel Breuer are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer Mart Stam over the rights to the cantilever chair patent. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus's 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, thus leading to the patent dispute.) The single most profitable <b>tangible</b> <b>product</b> of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.|$|E
2500|$|By 1922, McQueen {{seemed to}} be {{established}} as the principal, and the school was prospering with its highest enrolments ever seen, and he obviously thought it time to introduce changes in line with his own philosophy. The first <b>tangible</b> <b>product</b> of this philosophy was {{the institution of the}} school's own Intermediate Leaving Certificate which more accurately represented what his school stood for. He did not think that the State's Intermediate Certificate did so, concentrating as it did on exams only. As McQueen said: ...|$|E

2500|$|Facing {{copyright}} {{problems and}} realising that the Air Ministry's [...] "Clause 12" [...] {{in the original}} film contract would restrict the studio, Walt Disney, who had a personal interest in The Gremlins, reluctantly began to [...] "wind down" [...] the project. By August 1943, Disney had even reconsidered an animated [...] "short" [...] based on The Gremlins and indicated to Dahl by correspondence that further work would not continue. After a year of story conferences and related research, Dahl realised that his book {{would be the only}} <b>tangible</b> <b>product</b> emanating from the aborted film.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, {{contracts}} are oral or written, but written contracts have typically been preferred in common law legal systems; [...] in 1677 England passed the Statute of Frauds which influenced similar statute of frauds {{laws in the}} United States and other countries such as Australia. In general, the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the United States requires a written contract for <b>tangible</b> <b>product</b> sales in excess of $500, and real estate {{contracts are}} required to be written. If the contract is not {{required by law to}} be written, an oral contract is valid and therefore legally binding. The United Kingdom has since replaced the original Statute of Frauds, but written contracts are still required for various circumstances such as land (through the Law of Property Act 1925).|$|E
2500|$|The term {{hardware}} in {{open source}} hardware has been historically used {{in opposition to}} the term software of open source software. That is, to refer to the electronic hardware on which the software runs (see previous section). However, as more and more non-electronic hardware products are made open source (for example , [...] or [...] ), this term tends to be used back in its broader sense of [...] "physical product." [...] Indeed, the field of open source hardware has been shown to go beyond electronic hardware and to cover a larger range of product categories such as machine tools, vehicles and medical equipment. In that sense, hardware refers to any form of <b>tangible</b> <b>product,</b> may it be electronic hardware, mechanical hardware, textile or even construction hardware. The Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition 1.0 defines hardware as [...] "tangible artifacts — machines, devices, or other physical things." ...|$|E

2500|$|The main {{conceptual}} objection is, {{that the}} distinctions between productive and unproductive labor offered by various Marxists are essentially arbitrary, and without a genuine, scientifically sound foundation. In a complex division of labor, specialist productive work relies on a network of indispensable managerial, facilitary and technical support services, without which it could not take place at all. Marx himself never said that managerial functions were wholly [...] "unproductive", but rather that they combined productive and unproductive tasks. He {{pointed out that there}} were continually disputes about whether labour was productive or not, depending on who could make money from it – and that in turn depended on how the accounting was done as well as on property rights. Whether workers physically and directly produce something tangible or not, they are all necessary, or at least most of them are (as Marx acknowledges with his concept of the [...] "collective worker" [...] or, in German, Gesamtarbeiter). It is therefore impossible to attribute the creation of new value only to workers who directly produce a <b>tangible</b> <b>product.</b> Marxists often assume in their social accounts that the total payment of unproductive labor is made from a redistribution of part of the current surplus value produced by productive labor, but there is no proof of that assumption whatsoever, and indeed some Marxists have argued that the [...] "overhead expense" [...] of unproductive labor represents an outlay of circulating constant capital. David Ramsay Steele has defended the productive economic role of financial markets.|$|E
50|$|In both cases, {{it is all}} {{but certain}} {{there was never any}} <b>tangible</b> <b>product</b> created.|$|E
5000|$|Intangibility: Service is {{produced}} instead of <b>tangible</b> <b>product.</b> Therefore, service innovations {{can be easily}} copied by competitors.|$|E
50|$|The {{measurement}} for {{the level of}} informatization is an ongoing area of development. Among the issues are the ambiguity {{of the definition of}} “information” and whether this entity can be quantifiable in contrast to the <b>tangible</b> <b>products</b> of industrialization.|$|R
30|$|The {{economic}} indicators also have low weights {{in the measurement}} system of the sector’s competitiveness. These results are typical in services industries where the added value in the value chain is intangible compared to the <b>tangible</b> <b>products</b> produced by manufacturing industries.|$|R
5000|$|Warranties {{provided}} {{in the sale of}} goods (<b>tangible</b> <b>products)</b> vary according to jurisdiction, but commonly new goods are sold with implied warranty that the goods are as advertised. Used products, however, may be sold [...] "as is" [...] with no warranties.|$|R
50|$|Product Oriented PSS: This is a PSS where {{ownership}} of the <b>tangible</b> <b>product</b> is transferred to the consumer, but additional services, such as maintenance contracts, are provided.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} efforts are based on concept brands: the {{consumer}} is buying an association with women's health or environmental concerns {{as much as she}} or he is buying a <b>tangible</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... „Service is {{an action}} or an {{activity}} {{which can be}} offered by a party to another party, which is basically intangible and can not affect any ownership. Service {{may be related to}} <b>tangible</b> <b>product</b> or intangible product“.|$|E
50|$|As {{a useful}} {{activity}} {{of a particular}} kind, human labour can have a useful effect in producing particular <b>tangible</b> <b>products</b> which are used by others, or by the producers themselves. In this sense, labour is an activity which creates use-values, i.e. <b>tangible</b> <b>products,</b> results or effects {{which can be used}} or consumed. The creation of use-values is highlighted, when goods and services of poor quality are created, which are not supplied on time and mainly useless to the consumer. Labour must be applied to produce usable products, regardless of how much they are sold for, otherwise there are no use-values. If labour produces useless products or results, it is simply a waste of labour-time.|$|R
50|$|Work {{teams are}} {{responsible}} for the actual act of creating <b>tangible</b> <b>products</b> and services (Devine, 2002). The actual workers on an assembly line would be an example of a production team, whereas waiters and waitresses at a diner would be an example of a service team.|$|R
50|$|A {{product manager}} {{considers}} numerous {{factors such as}} intended demographic, the products offered by the competition, and how well the product fits with the company's business model. Generally, a product manager manages one or more <b>tangible</b> <b>products.</b> However, the term {{may be used to}} describe a person who manages intangible products, such as music, information, and services.|$|R

We describe the software architecture and demonstrate the system using an example multimodal dialogue. ...|$|R
50|$|Certain {{theoretical}} works, {{combined with}} empirical studies, suggest that advertising information is more useful for experience goods (experiential services) than for search goods (<b>tangible</b> <b>products).</b> Research studies {{also suggest that}} consumers {{who are involved in}} the purchase decision are more likely to actively seek out product information and actively process advertising messages while low-involvement consumers are more likely to respond at an emotional level.|$|R
5000|$|Software {{manufacturing}} is {{the process}} of producing software in ways similar to the manufacturing of tangible goods. In this way of conducting business, each copy of the software is priced and sold as though it was a <b>tangible</b> <b>product.</b> The sales process usually is conducted by per copy or per desktop software licensing.|$|E
50|$|A product can be {{classified}} as tangible or intangible. A <b>tangible</b> <b>product</b> is a physical object that can be perceived by touch such as a building, vehicle, gadget, or clothing. An intangible product is a product {{that can only be}} perceived indirectly such as an insurance policy. Services can be broadly classified under intangible products which can be durable or non durable.|$|E

50|$|Currently, Asiola {{operates}} on a rewards-based crowdfunding model, where funds are raised {{for a project}} by supporters who invest in an idea that inspires them by pledging a contribution {{in return for a}} reward. These can be <b>tangible</b> <b>products</b> or items, or intangible rewards like services or, in the case of community-driven campaigns, a sense of being part of something worthwhile. There are two types of campaigns: all-or-nothing and unconditional.|$|R
5000|$|The {{corollary}} of {{the enormous}} increase in physical productivity (output of goods) is that a larger and larger component of the social product, valued in money prices, consists of the production and consumption of services. This leads to a redefinition of wealth: not just a stock of assets, but also the ability to consume services enhancing {{the quality of life}} (note: many activities called [...] "services" [...] supply <b>tangible</b> <b>products).</b>|$|R

However, what changes is the mechanical systems thinking that is converted to include human interaction. This is because human interaction and communication cannot be accomplished industrially and with tangibles only. And that is where we have the biggest gap in our advanced societies based on tangible needs.” [26] [...]...|$|R
