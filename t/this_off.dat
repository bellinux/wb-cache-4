He decides to perform a test to see if the wolf and his pet dog are one and the same; he tosses a stick for the wolf to fetch, only to receive a giant bone instead. The boy shrugs <b>this</b> <b>off</b> and assumes that it is the same dog.|$|E
5|$|When Sabrina {{reached her}} teenage years, Day was persuaded by Edgeworth that his ideal wife {{experiment}} had failed {{and he should}} send her away, as it was inappropriate for Day {{to live with her}} unchaperoned. He then arranged for Sabrina to undergo experimental vocational and residential changes—first attending a boarding school, then becoming an apprentice to a dressmaker family, and eventually being employed as Day's housekeeper. Having seen changes in Sabrina, Day proposed marriage, though he soon called <b>this</b> <b>off</b> when she did not follow his strict instructions; he again sent her away, this time to a boarding house, where she later found work as a lady's companion.|$|E
5|$|Momolu Massaquoi {{sought to}} give his {{favourite}} child, and only daughter, the very best education. She went with him to Hamburg in 1922, where she lived at the consulate at 22 Johnsallee. Receiving her primary school education at St. Anschar Höhere Mädchenschule, Massaquoi quickly mastered German. On {{the recommendation of the}} consulate's housekeeper, Gertrude von Bobers, to whom she became very attached, in 1932 she spent some time in Geneva, Switzerland, where she learnt French at the École Supérieure et Secondaire. The same year, she returned to Hamburg, attending the Helen Lange Schule, where she received her school leaving certificate in 1935. She then started to study medicine at the University of Hamburg but broke <b>this</b> <b>off</b> when she left Germany.|$|E

To head <b>this</b> <b>off,</b> the Caledonian built its own Dolphinton branch from Carstairs; it opened in 1867. Dolphinton had a population of 260 and two railways, and traffic was correspondingly meagre, and the line closed in 1945 (passengers) and 1950 (goods).|$|E

25|$|The {{armament}} of both vessel types {{varied between}} larger weapons such as bombards {{and the smaller}} swivel guns. For logistical purposes it became convenient for those with larger shore establishments to standardize upon a given size of cannon. Traditionally the English in the North and the Venetians in the Mediterranean are seen as some the earliest to move in this direction. The improving sail rigs of northern vessels also allowed them to navigate in the coastal waters of the Mediterranean to a much larger degree than before. Aside from warships the decrease {{in the cost of}} gunpowder weapons also led to the arming of merchants. The larger vessels of the north continued to mature while the galley retained its defining characteristics. Attempts were made to stave <b>this</b> <b>off</b> such as the addition of fighting castles in the bow, but such additions to counter the threats brought by larger sailing vessels often offset the advantages of galley.|$|E
25|$|Lamphere {{represented}} an unresolved danger to Gunness; now Asle Helgelien was making inquiries that {{could very well}} send her to the gallows. She told a lawyer in La Porte, M.E. Leliter, that she feared for her life and that of her children. Ray Lamphere, she said, had threatened to kill her and burn her house down. She wanted to make out a will, in case Lamphere went through with his threats. Leliter complied and drew up her will. She left her entire estate to her children and then departed Leliter's offices. She {{went to one of}} the La Porte banks holding the mortgage for her property and paid <b>this</b> <b>off.</b> She did not go to the police to tell them about Lamphere's allegedly life-threatening conduct. The reason for this, most later concluded, was that there had been no threats; she was merely setting the stage for her own arson.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay <b>this</b> <b>off</b> if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E

Stanley's voiceover was recorded [...] "on a lunch break" [...] sometime after the fourth season episode [...] "Local Ad" [...] because he had [...] "got a big kick out of seeing himself" [...] in Michael's commercial. Helene's scenes were filmed sometime when Michael was dating her during the early part of the sixth season.|$|E

Critics have highlighted the similarities of [...] "Halo" [...] to Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] (2007); Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that [...] "Halo" [...] has the same [...] "icy synths, drivetime rock dynamic, and a similar repetitive chorus". This view was echoed by Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News and Brent DiCrescenzo of Timeout, who viewed [...] "Halo" [...] as a [...] "Bette Midler–level hymn from , lift savior theme". Nick Levine of Digital Spy described [...] "Halo" [...] as a [...] "muscular hybrid" [...] of [...] "Umbrella" [...] and Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love". David Balls of the same website wrote, [...] "Halo' is a contemporary power ballad in the 'Bleeding Love' mould ... Could Lewis have pulled <b>this</b> <b>off</b> better?
