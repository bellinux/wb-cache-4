40|$|In this study, the {{essential}} oil components of aerial parts of four <b>Teucrium</b> (T. <b>chamaedrys</b> L. subsp. tauricolum Rech. f., T. parviflorum Schreb., T. polium L. and T. orientale L. var. orientale) taxa were investigated by GC and GC-MS. Thirty three, thirty two, thirty five and twenty eight components were detected representing 93. 08 %, 89. 10 %, 92. 20 % and 89. 14 % of the oil, respectively. Germacrene D (20. 17 %), caryophyllene oxide (17. 05 %), -pinene (13. 45 %); -pinene (23. 62 %), β-caryophyllene (15. 90 %), -pinene (14. 65 %); -pinene (20. 38 %), p-cymene (16. 54 %), -pinene (16. 51 %), caryophyllene oxide (5. 92 %) and germacrene D (19. 45 %), β-caryophyllene (18. 95 %), -pinene (12. 56 %) were determined the main compounds of T. chamaedrys subsp. tauricolum; T. parviflorum; T. polium and T. orientale var. orientale, respectively.

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition and antioxidant activity of different extracts (diethyl ether, ethyl acetate and n-butanol) obtained from <b>Teucrium</b> species (T. <b>chamaedrys,</b> T. montanum, T. polium) were investigated in this work. Phytochemical {{screening of the}} plant extracts proved the presence of flavonoids: luteolin, apigenin and/or diosmetin. The {{chemical composition}} of extracts was evaluated by HPLC and spectrophotometry. Antioxidant activities of the extracts were evaluated using three complementary in vitro assays: inhibition of DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical, inhibition of hydroxyl radicals and protection of beta-carotene-linoleic acid model system. In the first two assays, strong inhibitory activity was shown by T. montanum and T. chamaedrys extracts. In the beta-carotene-linoleic acid model system, extracts from T. polium showed remarkable activity. These findings demonstrated that Teucrium species possess free radical and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity as well as antioxidant activity in vitro. U radu je opisan kemijski sastav i antioksidativno djelovanje različitih ekstrakata (dietil-eter, etil-acetat, n-butanol) iz <b>Teucrium</b> vrsta (T. <b>chamaedrys,</b> T. montanum, T. polium). Fitokemijska istraživanja ekstrakata HPLC metodom i spketrofotometrijom pokazala su prisutnost flavonoida luteolina, apigenina i/ili diosmetina. Antioksidativni učinci ekstrakata praćeni su in vitro pomoću tri komplementarne metode koje se temelje na inhibiciji DPPH (1, 1 -difenil- 2 -pikrilhidrazil) radikala, inhibiciji hidroksil radikala ili na zaštiti sustava -karoten-linoleinska kiselina. U prva dva modela dokazan je snažni inhibitorni učinak ekstrakata vrsta T. montanum, T. chamaedrys, dok su u trećem modelu ekstrakti iz T. polium pokazala značajni učinak.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Lamiaceae medicinal plants growing wild in Croatia. Using Ellman’s colorimetric assay all tested ethanolic extracts and their hydroxycinnamic acid constituents demonstrated in vitro AChE inhibitory properties in a dose dependent manner. The extracts of Mentha x piperita, M. longifolia, Salvia officinalis, Satureja montana, <b>Teucrium</b> arduini, T. <b>chamaedrys,</b> T. montanum, T. polium and Thymus vulgaris at 1 mg/mL showed strong inhibitory activity against AChE. The antioxidant {{potential of the}} investigated Lamiaceae species was assessed by DPPH• scavenging activity and total antioxidant capacity assays, in comparison with hydroxycinnamic acids and trolox. The extracts differed greatly in their total hydroxycinnamic derivatives content, determined spectrophotometrically. Rosmarinic acid {{was found to be}} the predominant constituent in most of the investigated medicinal plants (by RP-HPLC) and had a substantial influence on their AChE inhibitory and antioxidant properties, with the exception of Teucrium species. These findings indicate that Lamiaceae species are a rich source of various natural AChE inhibitors and antioxidants that could be useful in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s and other related diseases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contains}} first systematical {{revision of}} the results on traditional use of wild medicinal and aromatic herbs on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) – west of Balkan Peninsula; Southeast of Europe. There have been detected 227 plants belonging to 71 different plant families, which are being used with ethno therapeutic purpose. Results were obtained by method of open ethno botanical interview which comprised 150 persons, whose average age was 63. Medicinal plants in ethno therapy are being used either in fresh, raw or dried condition. Different herbal parts, depending on period of vegetation season, sometimes even in winter, are basis for preparation of infusions (59 %), decoct (19 %), tinctures (4 %). Especially original are balms known as Bosnian »mehlems«, which are fresh cuted herbal parts mixed with lukewarm resin, raw cow butter or honey. In ethno therapy are mostly being used aerial plant organs. Majority of herbs is being used for treatment of illnesses of respiratory (22 %), gastrointestinal (19 %) and urinary and genital system (9 %), for treatment of skin conditions (11 %), {{as well as for}} nervous system and heart diseases (16 %). The most original plants on the field of ethno pharmacology, comparing with ethno therapy practice of other regions, are as follows: Ballota nigra, Aesculus hippocastanum, Calluna vulgaris, Centaurea cyanus, Euphrasia rostkoviana, Geranium robertianum, Gentiana asclepiadea, Helichrysum italicum, Lycopodium clavatum, Marrubium vulgare, Nepeta cataria, Populus tremula, Ruta graveolens, Tamus communis, <b>Teucrium</b> montanum, T. <b>chamaedrys,</b> and endemic plants Gentiana lutea subsp. symphyandra, Teucrium arduini, Micromeria thymifolia, Satureja montana, S. subspicata, Rhamnus fallax and Viola elegantula. There haven’t been noticed significant differences in the frequencies of medicinal plants use among different ethnical groups. But, it has been perceived that longer ethno therapeutic tradition possess inhabitants of sub- and Mediterranean areas, as well as inhabitants of the mountain areas of B&H, regardless their ethnicity...|$|R
