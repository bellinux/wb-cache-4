5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were {{not that of}} the party of Lincoln, but those of <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age.</b> The feud continued on and off through 1911, {{a year in which}} there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E
5|$|Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> of Paleontology (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, he had taken no creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, {{and was a}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> New York {{literary}} {{scene for}} the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was careful to avoid the city's rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a public figure with a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.|$|E

5|$|The Bone Wars, {{also known}} as the Great Dinosaur Rush, was a period of intense and ruthlessly {{competitive}} fossil hunting and discovery during <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age</b> of American history, marked by a heated rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope (of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia) and Othniel Charles Marsh (of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale). Each of the two paleontologists used underhanded methods to try to outdo the other in the field, resorting to bribery, theft, and the destruction of bones. Each scientist also sought to ruin his rival's reputation and cut off his funding, using attacks in scientific publications.|$|E
5|$|As {{the postwar}} years yielded to <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age,</b> Troy's {{prosperity}} continued. The wealth created by its industries built {{some of the}} city's most notable Victorian buildings. Frederick Clarke Withers designed First Street's Rice Building in 1871, a five-story flatiron-shaped building representative of his Victorian Gothic style. The Cannon Building got a contemporary mansard roof after two fires. Cummings' 1870 Congregation Berith Sholom Temple on Third Street is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States, the oldest Reform synagogue in New York, {{and one of the}} most significant religious buildings in the district from this period. In 1875, George B. Post won a competition to build a new home for the Troy Savings Bank, with an upstairs auditorium. While his building was in the Renaissance Revival style of the time, its forms and decorations anticipated his later work in the Beaux-Arts vein.|$|E
5|$|Grant was {{president}} during <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age,</b> {{a time of}} massive industrial wealth, railroad speculation, and extravagance that fueled unethical behavior and influence in government offices. Although Grant was not personally involved in scandal, multiple corruption charges swept through his administration, clouding Grant's historical reputation. Grant was greatly trusting of men involved in speculation, particularly wealthy Gilded Age tycoons, loyally defending his corrupt cabinet or appointees whom he believed were innocent. Grant's failure was in his poor selection of cabinet officers and how he responded to their downfalls. Grant did not stop the guilty parties prosecutions, but was often insistent about having them prosecuted. His political enemies, outraged over the scandals, were eager to discredit Reconstruction, and the moral integrity of his administration. No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock, who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed federal investigations. Historians debate how effective he was at halting corruption.|$|E

50|$|Increased {{mechanization}} {{of industry}} is a major mark of <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age's</b> search for cheaper ways to create more product. Frederick Winslow Taylor observed that worker efficiency in steel could be improved {{through the use of}} very close observations with a stop watch to eliminate wasted effort. Mechanization made some factories an assemblage of unskilled laborers performing simple and repetitive tasks under the direction of skilled foremen and engineers. Machine shops grew rapidly, and they comprised highly skilled workers and engineers. Both the number of unskilled and skilled workers increased, as their wage rates grew.|$|R

A lingering gastrointestinal problem led to his early retirement and death.|$|R
5000|$|Some historians see the populists as forward-looking liberal reformers. Others {{view them}} as reactionaries trying to {{recapture}} an idyllic and utopian past. For some they were radicals out to restructure American life, and for others they were economically hard-pressed agrarians seeking government relief. Much recent scholarship emphasizes Populism's debt to early American republicanism. Clanton (1991) stresses that Populism was [...] "the last significant expression of an old radical tradition that derived from Enlightenment sources that had been filtered through a political tradition that bore the distinct imprint of Jeffersonian, Jacksonian, and Lincolnian democracy." [...] This tradition emphasized human rights over the cash nexus of <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> <b>Age's</b> dominant ideology.|$|R
