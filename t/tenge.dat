40|$|Electron {{paramagnetic}} resonance (EPR) spectroscopy {{is routinely}} {{used to study}} the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids, to obtain information about their functions. A prerequisite for most EPR studies of nucleic acids is the incorporation of paramagnetic centers called “spin labels” at specific positions and this technique is known as site-directed spin-labeling (SDSL). This doctoral dissertation describes the development of two new methods of site-directed spin-labeling of RNA, {{the first of which}} focuses on utilizing noncovalent interactions between an RNA aptamer and a ligand connected to a paramagnetic spin label. The malachite green (MG) aptamer is known to bind to dyestuffs MG and tetramethylrosamine (TMR). In this study, spin-labeled derivatives of MG and TMR were prepared and their binding affinity to the aptamer was investigated by using EPR spectroscopy. A pyrrolidine-based nitroxide derivative of TMR was found to bind completely to the aptamer at 25 ˚C with a dissociation constant (KD) of 66 nM, as determined by fluorescence titration studies. This spin-labeling approach is the first example of noncovalent and site-directed spin-labeling that involves a native (unmodified) RNA. Pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) was used to measure a distance of 3. 3 nm between the spin-labeled ligand and an isoindoline-based spin label that was covalently attached to the aptamer. In a related study, the noncovalent binding of a new class of benzimidazole-fused isoindoline nitroxides to bind to abasic sites in duplex DNA and RNA was explored. Five spin-labeled nitroxides were screened using an in-house devised “combinatorial approach”, out of which binding affinity of two spin labels were studied in detail. A post-synthetic spin-labeling approach was also developed, where a nucleophilic 2 ′-amino group in RNA was reacted with two aromatic isoindoline nitroxides having an isothiocyanate modification, thereby forming a thiourea bond upon conjugation to RNA. The isothiocyanate spin-labels were found to have a minor effect on RNA duplex stability. Furthermore, they showed limited mobility after incorporation into RNA, as judged by continuous wave EPR, which enhances their usefulness for distance measurement studies using pulsed-EPR techniques. A tetraethyl isoindoline derivative was found to be substantially resistant towards reduction by ascorbic acid, which makes this label a promising candidate to perform in-cell distance measurements using PELDOR. Rafeindasegullitrófsgreiningu (e. electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy) er beitt reglubundið í rannsóknum á byggingu og hreyfingu kjarnsýra, til að varpa ljósi á starfsemi þeirra og hlutverk. EPR rannsóknir á kjarnsýrum krefjast innleiðingar meðseglandi kjarna (spunamerkja) á ákveðinn stað, en sú aðferð kallast staðbundin spunamerking (e. sitedirected spin-labeling, SDSL). Þessi doktorsritgerð lýsir þróun tveggja nýrra aðferða til staðbundinnar spunamerkingar á ríbósakjarnsýrum (e. ribonucleic acid, RNA). Fyrri aðferðin byggir á myndun ósamgildra tengja milli RNA aptamers og tengils sem ber spunamerki. Malachite green (MG) aptamerinn er þekktur fyrir að bindast litarefnunum MG og tetrametýlrósamíni (TMR). Smíðaðar voru spunamerktar afleiður af MG og TMR og bindisækni þeirra í aptamerinn rannsökuð með EPR. Flúrljómunarmælingar við 25 °C sýndu að TMR-afleitt pyrrólidín nítroxíð bast að fullu við aptamerinn, með klofningsfastann (KD) 66 nM. Þessi spunamerkingaraðferð er fyrsta dæmið um staðbundna spunamerkingu á óbreyttu RNA. PELDOR (e. pulsed electron-electron double resonance) var notað til þess að mæla 3, 3 nm fjarlægð á milli spuna-merkta tengilsins og ísóindólín-afleidds spunamerks, sem bundið var samgildum tengjum við aptamerinn. Í tengdri rannsókn var bindisækni bensímídasól- ísóindólín nítroxíða í basalaust kirni í tvístrendu DNA og RNA rannsökuð. <b>Tenging</b> fimm nítroxíða var rannsökuð með skimun á bindisækni þeirra í blöndu af DNA og RNA tvístrendingum. Bindisækni tveggja þeirra var svo rannsökuð nánar. Einnig var þróuð aðferð til að spunamerkja RNA eftir smíði þess (e. post-synthetic spin labeling), þar sem kjarnsækinn 2 ‘-amínó hópur á RNA var hvarfaður við tvö arómatísk ísóindólín nítroxíð sem innihéldu ísóþíósýanat virknihóp og mynda því þíóúrea tengi við RNA. Þessi nýju spunamerki hafa lítil áhrif á stöðugleika RNA tvístrendinga. Ennfremur sýndi EPR greining að þessi spunamerki höfðu takmarkaðan hreyfanleika eftir innleiðingu í RNA, sem eykur notagildi þeirra til fjarlægðamælinga með PELDOR. Tetraetýlísóindólínafleiðan var fremur stöðug í viðurvist askorbínsýru sem lofar góðu fyrir notkun þess sem spunarmerkis með EPR mælingum í frumum...|$|R

500|$|The Tenjho <b>Tenge</b> manga is {{described}} by Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD as an [...] "...engaging mix of action and comedy together while wrapping it all up in a large plot that's fairly dark and really violent at times". Its creator, Oh! great, is known to flavor his works with wanton sex and violence. Oh! great uses sex as {{an important aspect of}} the storyline by using it as a powerful motivator both negatively and positively. He often has his characters contemplate the significance and importance of fighting as well as the meaning of strength. This conscious deliberation of subjective reasoning and objective truth between characters is the most imperative aspect of story and is considered to be rare in manga. Dani Moure of AnimeOnDVD said readers may find that Oh! great's narrative is occasionally hard to follow and at times the plot moves slowly. Oh! great is known for his characters to have unrealistic body proportions, and Tenjho <b>Tenge</b> is no different. The majority of the female characters have [...] "...ultra large breasts..." [...] and the males characters are extraordinarily muscular, but this facilitates the characters personalities to come through in their distinctive features.
