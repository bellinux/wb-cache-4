5|$|The new Indian River Inlet Bridge {{opened to}} {{southbound}} traffic on January 20, 2012. Delaware Governor Jack Markell, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, and DelDOT Secretary Shailen Bhatt rode {{in the first}} car across the bridge. On January 30, 2012, one northbound lane of the new bridge opened. On May 6, 2012, the Indian River Inlet Bridge was officially dedicated in a public ceremony in which visitors were able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> the bridge. All remaining lanes of the four-lane bridge {{as well as its}} pedestrian and bicycle walkway opened that day.|$|E

25|$|Narrow lanes {{cost less}} {{to build and}} maintain, but also reduce the {{capacity}} of a road to convey traffic. On rural roads, narrow lanes are likely to experience higher rates of run-off-road and head-on collisions. Wider roads increase the time needed <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across,</b> and increase stormwater runoff.|$|E
25|$|The first non-Indigenous person <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> Australia {{from the}} west to the east coast, Henri Gilbert, crossed the Nullarbor Plain on foot, with no support team or stock, {{in the middle of}} summer. His walk across Australia, from Fremantle to Brisbane, was {{achieved}} between August 1897 and December 1898.|$|E
25|$|After the dam's {{reconstruction}} in 1926, {{workers and}} local people were permitted <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> {{the top of}} the dam as a means of getting to work and school. For security reasons, the Montana Power Company closed the dam to such foot traffic during World War II and never allowed it to resume afterward.|$|E

25|$|The public {{used to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> the top of Holter Dam (which {{provided}} {{easy access}} to both sides of the river), but the dam was closed to the public after the September 11 attacks. Holter Dam {{was one of the last}} two such PPL dams to be closed. In 2014, PPL sold Holter Dam and their other Montana dams to NorthWestern Corporation.|$|E

The lawn is off-limits during Michaelmas and Hilary terms but is accessible during Trinity term for sitting on (at any time) and croquet (on Fridays and Sundays only). Senior fellows of the College are granted the privilege of being able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> the lawn all year round.|$|E
25|$|An early {{problem for}} the escapees was that most were unable to find {{the way into the}} railway station, until {{daylight}} revealed it was in a recess of the side wall to an underground pedestrian tunnel. Consequently, many of them missed their night time trains, and decided either <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> country or wait on the platform in daylight. Another unanticipated problem was that this was the coldest March for thirty years, with snow up to five feet deep, so the escapees had no option but to leave the cover of woods and fields and stay on the roads.|$|E

50|$|Kelvyn Charles Yong-Hyeon Linton and {{his father}} Christopher Neil Linton <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> Tasmania, in 2015 {{to raise funds for}} mood disorders. They backpacked the entire coastal route, {{although}} they did accept some offers of food and hospitality along the way. Kelvyn was 14 years old at the time, making him the youngest person <b>to</b> have <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> Tasmania, at that time. This was also the first father-son team to complete the journey. His father went on <b>to</b> complete a <b>walk</b> around the perimeter of Tasmania, becoming the first person to do so.|$|R
25|$|While in England, Fletcher {{served as}} {{adjutant}} to the Royal Military Artificers in Portsmouth until December 1798 {{when he was}} sent to Constantinople (now Istanbul) to act as an advisor to the Ottoman Government. Intending to travel through Hanover, Fletcher set sail from England but his ship was wrecked near the mouth of the river Elbe and Fletcher was forced <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> two miles of ice before reaching land. After three months travelling through Austria and Ottoman territories in the Balkans, Fletcher finally arrived in Constantinople on 29 March 1799. In June 1799, Fletcher, alongside Ottoman troops, advanced into Syria, forcing Napoleon to forgo his siege of Acre and retreat to Egypt.|$|E
25|$|They {{escape and}} decide to mix with the fishing fleet to avoid being spotted. However, they are intercepted by a {{seemingly}} civilian Russian Aeroflot helicopter, {{which turns out to}} be heavily armed and fires at the ship. Sandy Hook steers into a narrow bay, and the protagonists fire back, eventually destroying the helicopter with a firebomb. They continue to Kapp Dufferin, where they anchor. Tom rows to land to find supplies, but while he is on land, a Soviet helicopter bombs Sandy Hook, killing Lars and Sverre. Tom has <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> Spitsbergen to reach Longyearbyen. After a long march through the wilderness, he reaches a closed mine and rides an aerial tramway for coal to Longyearbyen.|$|E
25|$|As the {{dry season}} takes effect, the islets on the crest become wider and more numerous, and in September to January {{up to half of}} the rocky face of the falls may become dry and the bottom of the First Gorge can be seen along most of its length. At this time it becomes {{possible}} (though not necessarily safe) <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> some stretches of the river at the crest. It is also possible to walk {{to the bottom of the}} First Gorge at the Zimbabwean side. The minimum flow, which occurs in November, is around a tenth of the April figure; this variation in flow is greater than that of other major falls, and causes Victoria Falls' annual average flow rate to be lower than might be expected based on the maximum flow.|$|E
50|$|To prepare, Wallenda {{practiced in}} his home town of Sarasota, Florida in heavy winds, {{including}} during Tropical Storm Andrea. On June 23, he successfully completed the walk without safety devices in approximately 23 minutes, making him the first person <b>to</b> tightrope <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> a Grand Canyon area gorge. At 1500 ft, it was the highest walk of his career. Afterwards, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected.|$|R
50|$|Garfunkel has {{undertaken}} several long walks in his lifetime, writing poetry along the way. In the early 1980s, he <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> Japan {{in a matter}} of weeks. From 1983 <b>to</b> 1997, Garfunkel <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the United States, taking 40 excursions to complete the route from New York City to the Pacific coast of Washington. In May 1998, Garfunkel began an incremented <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> Europe, the last stop of which was Istanbul, in 2015.|$|R

25|$|Biomechatronics mimics how {{the human}} body works. For example, four {{different}} steps must occur {{to be able to}} lift the foot to walk. First, impulses from the motor center of the brain are sent to the foot and leg muscles. Next the nerve cells in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the muscle groups or amount of force required <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> the ground. Different amounts of force are applied {{depending on the type of}} surface being walked across. The leg's muscle spindle nerve cells then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the brain. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to muscles in the leg and foot to set it down.|$|E
25|$|In February 1942, Kwok want to {{establish}} contact with the Australians or Americans in eastern North Borneo but was unable <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> the island jungle more further when he reached Pensiangan where he saw a large presence of Japanese troops. He need {{to establish}} relations with the Allied movements, especially the United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP) {{as it is the}} only sole armed resistance movement in the region at the time which are supplied with firearms. After managed to establishing contact with the American forces in the Philippines with the help of fellow Chinese businessman named Lim Keng Fatt, a Muslim cleric (Imam) named Marajukim from Sulu who is part of the resistance movement in the Philippines approached Kwok in Jesselton where he began to depart to Tawi-Tawi for training. From there, they travel further to Sulu and met Lieutenant Colonel Alejandro Suarez and learned the activities of the resistance movement in the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|By {{assuming}} a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> a room, {{it is generally}} understood {{that the decision to}} do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is that if there is something totally nonphysical causing a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no physical event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe‚Äîthis is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the physical energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against in that it violates a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.|$|E

Noda continues <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> left, and is shown <b>to</b> stylistically <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> {{the face of the}} earth in black animation. In time with the lyric , the video begins to reverse to the point where there were two Nodas, however now the video is in synch with the second. The video now tracks the second as he <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> his left, and performs the song with the other band members. The moment where the first Noda turns into a tree is still visible in the second clip, but from a different angle.|$|R
25|$|The {{northern}} {{section was}} opened in April 1924 by Lord Morris (1859‚Äì1935), {{member of the}} House of Lords and previous premier of Newfoundland. The southern frontage was opened on a Sunday shortly before Easter, 1932 by the High Sheriff of Kent Major Sir John Theodore Prestige. Callender's Cableworks Band (1898‚Äì1961) performed at the ceremony. Before the Bandstand was built, bands such as the 6th Dragoon Guards would give concerts around the flagstaff which is situated just {{to the west of}} the present bandstand. When first built, the Central Bandstand consisted only of what is now the north or seaward side, with stage, turreted side wings and an outdoor area to the north for the audience in deck chairs; the area was available for deck chairs until the 1970s. Visiting bands and school bands played there. For example, the Royal Warwickshire Band visited in 1925. In those days a red carpet would be laid for the conductor <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> from the Connaught Hotel which was and is, as of 2013, directly opposite the Bandstand. The Reverend Daubeney at Herne used to arrange for his sermons to finish in time to allow the congregation to catch the bus to Herne Bay for the evening Bandstand concert. This venue was so popular in 1927 that queues could stretch as far as the Pier, and crowds were often turned away.|$|E
25|$|That night, Matamoros {{was flooded}} with 15,000 spring {{tourists}} from the U.S. on the city's main tourist street, √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. The sidewalks, street, and night clubs were packed with foreign tourists looking to enjoy cheap alcohol and enjoy Mexico's lax drinking laws. When they got to Matamoros, Kilroy and his friends {{decided to go to}} the bar with the shortest waiting line. They ended up at Los Sombreros, a bar with rock music and bright neon. After a few drinks, Kilroy and his friends left Los Sombreros and wandered to London Pub, which rebranded itself as Hardrock Caf√© for spring break. This bar was louder and wilder than Los Sombreros, and Kilroy and his friends stood at the bar while other tourists threw beer from the balcony. Kilroy met with a few girls at the bar and was not seen by his friends for a while. Around 2:00a.m. CT, Bill suggested the group head back to South Padre Island. As his friends stepped out of London Pub, they saw Kilroy leaning against a car and talking to a girl from Miss Tanline. Across √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n street, thousands of tourists were leaving the bars and heading to Brownsville, but others moved in different directions. The large crowd of people made it difficult for Kilroy and his friends <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> the border uninterrupted and in a group.|$|E

50|$|London's lack of {{bridges and}} rolling marshy {{landscape}} {{to the south}} and east were perfect for access by boat and the Thames was the main thoroughfare for all kinds of traffic. In the 15th and 16th centuries the narrow spans of the Old London Bridge restricted the flow of the slow moving and meandering river Thames allowing it to freeze during the winter months complete with frost fair so that Londoners were able <b>to</b> simply <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> the frozen river.|$|R
