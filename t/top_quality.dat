Normandy {{is home to a}} large population of apple trees; apples are often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and chicory. Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well. The produce of these northern regions is also considered some {{of the best in the}} country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's galettes, called jalet, which is where this dish originated.|$|E

Middlesbrough finished the 1976–77 campaign in 12th place and Charlton left the club at the end of the season on the belief that four years was an optimum time with one group of players and that he had reached his peak with them – he later regretted his decision and stated that he could have led the club to a league title if he had stayed and signed two more <b>top</b> <b>quality</b> players. He applied for the job of England manager after Don Revie quit the role and after Brian Clough was ruled out by the Football Association but did not receive a reply to his application, and he vowed never to apply for another job again and instead wait until he was approached.|$|E

5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are <b>top</b> <b>quality,</b> unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, though {{the show was}} still popular, it became {{increasingly}} more difficult for Rickard to bring in <b>top</b> <b>quality</b> wrestlers from overseas. The World Wrestling Federation's national expansion under Vince McMahon in the US resulted in {{the decline of the}} National Wrestling Alliance and made the top American stars less available to travel outside the US. Rickard and World Championship Wrestling had also long shared the transportation costs of bringing in foreign wrestlers into the Pacific, however, the close of WCW in 1978 resulted in Rickard taking on the full cost himself. Even local stars such as Peter Maivia and Siva Afi, despite their popularity in New Zealand, left the country to compete in the US.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} techniques allow <b>top</b> <b>quality</b> female livestock to have {{a greater}} influence on the genetic advancement of a herd or flock {{in much the same way}} that artificial insemination has allowed greater use of superior sires. ET also allows the continued use of animals such as competition mares to continue training and showing, while producing foals. The general epidemiological aspects of embryo transfer indicates that the transfer of embryos provides the opportunity to introduce genetic material into populations of livestock while greatly reducing the risk for transmission of infectious diseases. Recent developments in the sexing of embryos before transfer and implanting has great potential in the dairy and other livestock industries.|$|E
25|$|The federal government's goal of commercializing {{the bison}} {{throughout}} Canada undermined {{the need to}} provide inexpensive bison meat to the local population in northern Canada. With new agreements with meatpackers in the south, combined with their prior commitment to the Hudson's Bay Company and Indian Affairs, over nine hundred bison were slaughtered. Through the agreement, the packing companies received <b>top</b> <b>quality</b> bison meat for low prices, while northern Canada got tough meat that was sold at higher prices. CWS biologists feared that there was no scientific legitimacy to the slaughtering of the nine hundred bison, many which did not have tuberculosis. In the winter of 1957- 1958, the testing and slaughtering program of the bison was established. The conservation and commodification of bison are fundamentally contradictory goals.|$|E

25|$|In {{place of}} Riesling, the easier {{cultivated}} Müller-Thurgau grape (14.7%) and other Riesling crossings like Kerner (4.6%) were planted {{in large quantities}} on the sites that were not suitable for Riesling, and which in many cases had been previously used for other agricultural purposes. A negative consequence of these large-scale plantings is that the wine produced from these sites are typically of a lower quality than Riesling wines {{which in turn has}} a depressing economic effect on the prices of all Mosel wines. While consumers have benefited with <b>top</b> <b>quality</b> Riesling wines being underpriced in comparison with some of the world's other great wines from places like Bordeaux, Burgundy and California, the economic hardship created by the prices has caused some of the smaller Mosel vineyards to go out of business.|$|E

WCS grew gradually, and in 1982 it leased a larger building from the county on Franwall Avenue in Silver Spring which allowed it to add a middle school and offer instruction through the eighth grade.

However, he again missed pre-season training the following summer and was dropped after proving to be unfit during the opening game of the 1962–63 season.

Arrogate's victory in the Dubai World Cup over Gun Runner had been ranked as the best performance of the year up to that point, but Arrogate had suffered two losses after returning to the United States. By contrast, Gun Runner had won three straight Grade I races and appeared to be getting stronger.
