5|$|During {{the closing}} credits, it is {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> is successfully continuing with its operations despite {{the death of}} its Chairman—as Skarssen had predicted to Salinger before he was killed. However, with the new and more aggressive chairman, it is hinted that the IBBC's increased expansion and aggression will ultimately lead to its downfall, {{as shown by the}} last panel, revealing the beginnings of a United States Senate investigation, headed by Whitman.|$|E
5|$|One of the court's {{most crucial}} {{decisions}} during Owsley's tenure {{was in the}} case of Commonwealth of Kentucky v. James Morrison, which held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of the United States did {{not have the right to}} establish branches in Kentucky. The Supreme Court of the United States later overturned this ruling.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators {{took over}} the Tilipuchuri tavern facing the square in {{preparation}} for the robbery. A witness, David Sagirashvili, later stated that he had been walking in Yerevan Square when a friend named Bachua Kupriashvili, who later {{turned out to be one}} of the robbers, invited him into a tavern and asked him to stay. Once inside the tavern, Sagirashvili realized that armed men were stopping people from leaving. When they received a signal <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> stagecoach was nearing the square, the armed men quickly left the building with pistols drawn.|$|E
2500|$|The {{suggestion}} in the Disciplinary Committee's {{final report}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> procedures in handling the loans had been bypassed by Chiang {{had in fact}} been brought up by the Committee itself. Counsel for the Law Society had not submitted that Chiang had influenced <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> in any way. In addition, <b>the</b> Committee found <b>that</b> it was [...] "highly likely" [...] <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> procedures had been flouted. This, according to Judicial Commissioner Menon, was significant because it went beyond the Law Society's submission that it was merely [...] "possible" [...] <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> procedures had been flouted.|$|R

5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|Before 1902, Manchester United {{were known}} as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their {{football}} matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories. Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman John Henry Davies decided in 1909 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> Street ground was not fit {{for a team that}} had recently won the First Division and FA Cup, so he donated funds {{for the construction of a}} new stadium. Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on a patch of land adjacent to the Bridgewater Canal, just off the north end of the Warwick Road in Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|In a 16 December statement, three Stabæk Fotball {{officials}} said that they suspected that Ulrichen's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center, and that the use as a football venue was a decoy to get a free lot worth up to NOK200 million plus grants worth NOK50 million. The book value of the venue was NOK303 million {{at the end of}} 2010, although a statement from the district court stated that the value of the venue was significantly lower than <b>that.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bank</b> DnB NOR held at the time a mortgage with security in the property worth NOK260 million, while Ulrichsen through his investment company held a mortgage worth NOK60.1 million.|$|E

5|$|Jonas Skarssen, the {{chairman}} of the IBBC, reveals to his senior men White and Wexler <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> had Calvini killed so that they could deal with his sons to buy missile guidance systems in which the bank has invested. Since the bank knows that Salinger and Whitman are close to finding their assassin, they send a hit team to kill him at a meeting between him and his handler, Wexler. Wexler leaves and is arrested by Ornelas. As Salinger speaks to the assassin, a spectacular gunfight at the Guggenheim erupts when a number of gunmen attempt to kill them with automatic weapons. They escape, but the assassin is mortally wounded.|$|E
5|$|Numerous senior central {{bankers and}} finance ministers issued public warnings, the first being Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy {{chairman}} at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Park Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, {{president of the}} Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009–11 period were not intense enough to count as competitive devaluation, but that a genuine currency war is now a real possibility. Japan's economy minister Akira Amari has said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken the yen.|$|E
5|$|Bullion {{deposits}} {{continued to}} decline, and in 1797, silver dollar production reached {{the lowest point}} since 1794 with a mintage of just 7,776 pieces. During this time, silver deposits declined {{to such an extent}} that Thomas Jefferson personally deposited 300 Spanish dollars in June 1797. In April 1797, an agreement was reached between the Mint and the Bank of the United States. The Bank agreed to supply the Mint with foreign silver on the condition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> would receive their deposits back in silver dollars. The Mint was closed between August and November 1797 due to the annual yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia; that year's epidemic took the life of the Mint's treasurer, Dr. Nicholas Way. In November 1797, the Bank deposited approximately $30,000 worth of French silver. In early 1798, the reverse was changed from the small, perched eagle to a heraldic eagle similar to that depicted on the Great Seal of the United States. The agreement reached with the Bank of the United States along with other bullion depositors (including Boudinot) led to an increase in the number of silver dollars coined; mintage for both the small and heraldic eagle types totalled 327,536. Mintage numbers for the dollar remained high through 1799, with 423,515 struck that year.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 January 2017, Andy Haldane, chief {{economist}} {{and the executive}} director of monetary analysis and statistics at <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of England, admitted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> forecasts (predicting an economic downturn should the referendum favour Brexit) had proved inaccurate given the subsequent strong market performance. He stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> models [...] "were rather narrow and fragile and ill-equipped to making sense of behaviours that were deeply irrational" [...] and said that his [...] "profession is to some degree in crisis" [...] due to this and the unforeseen 20072008 crisis.|$|R

5|$|The bank's {{expansion}} strategy hit {{trouble with}} {{the stock market crash}} of 1987 and involvement in the financial scandal surrounding the collapse of Blue Arrow. The Department of Trade and Industry report on the affair was critical of the bank's management and resulted in the resignation of several members of the board, including then chairman Lord Boardman. Later, the bank would divest its overseas subsidiaries. The North American operations were sold to Fleet Bank and Hong Kong Bank of Canada, and the Australian and New Zealand branches were sold to Salomon Smith Barney and the National Australia Bank. Thereafter the bank concentrated on its core domestic business as the restyled NatWest Group, reflecting its modern positioning as a portfolio of businesses. In 1993, the NatWest Tower was devastated by a Provisional IRA bomb and the bank vacated the building and later sold it. Then, in 1997, NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm formed in 1992, revealed that a £50m loss had been discovered, revised to £90.5m after further investigations. Investor and shareholder confidence was so badly shaken <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of England had to instruct the board of directors to resist calls for the resignation of its most senior executives in an effort to draw a line under the affair. The bank's internal controls and risk management were severely criticised in 2000 and its aggressive push into investment banking questioned, after a lengthy investigation by the Securities and Futures Authority. The bank's move into complicated derivative products that it did not fully understand seemed to indicate poor management. By the end of 1997 parts of NatWest Markets had been sold, others becoming Greenwich NatWest in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E

25|$|Another {{expressed}} concern was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> might lobby <b>the</b> IFC to weaken its standards {{on which the}} Principles are based. <b>The</b> <b>banks</b> point out <b>that</b> IFC revised and strengthened its policies in 2006 and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> correspondingly strengthened <b>the</b> Equator Principles in the same year. Other criticisms include alleged lack of enforcement and accountability, free-riders, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scope of the principles is limited to project finance only. Several banks have sought to address these concerns by publishing summaries of their Equator Principles screening, including the number of projects they turned down for noncompliance.|$|R
