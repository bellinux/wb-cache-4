5|$|In 2007, {{analysis}} of an audio tape {{recording of the}} shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag, that thirteen shots were fired, even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds. Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible. The presence of more than eight shots on the tape was corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen, Denmark, and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Some other acoustic experts, however, have stated that no more than eight shots were recorded on <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The most damning {{evidence}} presented at Bittaker's trial was a 17-minute section of <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> the pair had created of Shirley Lynette Ledford's abuse and torment. <b>The</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape,</b> {{which had been}} found inside Bittaker's van and which Norris had earlier testified Bittaker had repeatedly played as he drove in the weeks prior to his arrest—adding that Bittaker considered the contents to be [...] "real funny"— was presented in evidence on January 29, with Stephen Kay forewarning the jury: [...] "For {{those of you who}} do not know what hell is like, you will find out." [...] (Judge Fredericks had earlier denied motions by the defense to omit the tape recording from admission as evidence.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the release}} of <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{chancellor}} Harvey Perlman stated that the university would consider {{how to respond to}} the matter, and subsequently decided to move on from the incident. [...] Tom Osborne, former coach and athletic director at Nebraska, then announced that he had heard the tape in 2012 (about a year earlier) and talked to Pelini about it but did not tell Perlman about it.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{observers}} {{and members of}} the media believed that Pelini would have a difficult time winning back fan support. Pelini believed that he had built up enough [...] "points" [...] for at least partial forgiveness for his statements from the fans. He said he enjoys his job at Nebraska and has had great support; in fact he turned down job offers from other schools. [...] Sports media reactions to <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> have ranged from calls for Pelini to be fired to the view that what Pelini said was nothing more than what other coaches have likely said in the past.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2005, a profanity-laced {{audio file}} was posted on Barstool Sports, {{containing}} a voice mail message from John Dennis threatening rival sports radio personality Ryen Russillo (then of 1510 The Zone, later the co-host of SVP & Russillo on ESPN Radio with Scott Van Pelt {{and then of}} Russillo and Kannell on ESPN Radio with Danny Kannell) [...] In <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape,</b> Dennis accuses Russillo of being a drunk and hitting on his daughter. [...] After the incident, the New England Patriots had Russillo removed from WBCN's post-game show with Gary Tanguay & Company. At the time WBCN, which was owned by CBS, held broadcast rights to Patriot games. [...] Dennis denied any responsibility for the Patriots' decision.|$|E

2500|$|In {{one of two}} {{instances}} {{throughout the}} trial when prosecutor Stephen Kay was reduced to tears, {{he walked out of}} the courtroom during the recess following the hearing of the recording of Shirley Ledford's rape, abuse and torture. Weeping openly, Kay stated to the reporters gathered outside the courtroom: [...] "Everybody who has heard that tape has had it affect their lives. I just picture those girls... how alone they were when they died." [...] When questioned by reporters as to whether <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> should have been introduced into evidence, given the obvious psychological and emotional trauma caused to many in the courtroom through the contents being broadcast, Kay simply stated: [...] "You're darn right it [...] should have been. The jury needs to know what these guys did." ...|$|E
