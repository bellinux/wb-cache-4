60|$|What a noble letter it is! In {{it every}} reader {{sees himself as}} in a glass. As for me, without my I's, I should be as poorly off as the great mole of Hadrian, which, being the biggest, must be also, by parity of reason, the blindest in the world. When I was in college, I confess I always liked those {{passages}} best in the choruses of the Greek drama which were well sprinkled with ai ai, they were so grandly simple. The force of great men is generally {{to be found in}} their intense individuality,--in other words, it is all in their I. The merit of <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> <b>will</b> be similar.|$|E
6000|$|You have {{attacked}} me because I ventured to disapprove of Mr. Godwin's Works: I notice your attack because it affords {{me an opportunity}} of expressing more fully my sentiments respecting those principles.--I must not however wholly pass over the former part of your letter. The sentence [...] "implicating them with party and calumniating opinions," [...] is so inaccurately worded, that I must [...] "guess" [...] at your meaning. In my first essay I stated that literary works were generally reviewed by personal friends or private enemies of the Authors. This I [...] "know" [...] to be fact; and does the spirit of meekness forbid us to tell the truth? The passage in my Review of Mr. Burke's late pamphlet, you have wilfully misquoted: [...] "with respect to the work in question," [...] is an addition of your own. That work in question I myself considered as mere declamation; and [...] "therefore" [...] deemed it wofully inferior to the former production of the venerable Fanatic.--In what manner I could add to my numerous [...] "ideal" [...] trophies by quoting a beautiful passage from the pages which I was reviewing, I am ignorant. Perhaps the spirit of vanity lurked {{in the use of}} the word [...] ""I""--"ere [...] "I" [...] begin the task of blame." [...] It is pleasant to observe with what absurd anxiety this little monosyllable is avoided. Sometimes [...] "the present writer" [...] appears as its substitute: sometimes the modest author adopts the style of royalty, swelling and multiplying himself into [...] "We"; and sometimes to escape the egotistic phrases of [...] "in my opinion," [...] or, [...] "as I think," [...] he utters dogmas, and positively asserts--"exempli gratia": [...] ""It is" [...] a work, which, etc." [...] You deem me inconsistent, because, having written in praise of the metaphysician, I afterwards appear to condemn the essay on political justice. Would an eulogist of medical men be inconsistent, if he should write against vendors of (what he deemed) poisons? Without even the formality of a [...] "since" [...] or a [...] "for" [...] or a [...] "because," [...] you make an unqualified assertion, that <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> <b>will</b> be allowed by all, except the prejudiced, to be a deep, metaphysical work, though abstruse, etc. etc. Caius Gracchus must have been little accustomed to abstruse disquisitions, if he deem Mr. Godwin's work abstruse:--A chief (and certainly not a small) merit is its perspicuous and [...] "popular" [...] language. My chapter on modern patriotism is that which has irritated you. You condemn me as prejudiced--O this enlightened age! when it can be seriously charged against an essayist, that he is prejudiced in favour of gratitude, conjugal fidelity, filial affection, and the belief of God and a hereafter!! ...|$|E

40|$|This Essay {{proposes to}} use the {{theoretical}} framework of Critical Race Theory and Marxism to chart a way forward {{and away from the}} Tea Party's racist dream and toward revolution. <b>This</b> <b>Essay</b> <b>will</b> show how the ruling class uses race and immigration status to isolate, alienate, dehumanize, and divide poor and working class people.
