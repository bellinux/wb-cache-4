5|$|Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and the Gilded Age of Paleontology (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, he had <b>taken</b> <b>no</b> creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E
5|$|Of the 62 players {{drafted by}} the Angels, 28 have been pitchers, {{the most of any}} position; 18 of these were right-handed, while 10 were left-handed. Twelve outfielders, seven shortstops, four third basemen, and four first basemen were also <b>taken.</b> <b>No</b> second basemen have been selected. Thirteen of the players came from high schools or {{universities}} in the state of California, while Florida follows with six players. Four players have been selected from both Illinois and Georgia. All players selected have been from the United States. The franchise has made five selections in the same draft three times, in 1986, 2009, and 2010.|$|E

5|$|By 1955, Phoenix's Jewish {{population}} {{had grown to}} over 3,000 families, and the city still had two Jewish congregations, Beth Israel and Beth El. That year, {{with the support of}} Krohn, Albert Plotkin joined Beth Israel as rabbi. Born in 1920 and raised in South Bend, Indiana, his parents were immigrants from Russia. After getting an undergraduate degree from the University of Notre Dame, he entered Hebrew Union College in 1943 – on academic probation, because he had <b>taken</b> <b>no</b> Hebrew at Notre Dame. He was ordained by Hebrew Union College in 1948, graduating with a Master of Hebrew Letters. Plotkin had started his rabbinic career as assistant rabbi of Temple De Hirsch in Seattle, his first pulpit after ordination. There he met his future wife Sylvia Pincus, whose family were long-time members of Temple De Hirsch. They married a year later, and shortly after moved to Spokane, Washington, where Plotkin became senior rabbi at Temple Emanuel.|$|E
5|$|Taft sent {{a special}} message to Congress {{on the need}} for a revamped {{antitrust}} statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester, but had <b>taken</b> <b>no</b> action (a decision Taft had supported), the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination. Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years, and until he was under challenge, to reverse a decision he had supported.|$|E

5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Andrew T. Wood, {{a lawyer}} from Mount Sterling, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and state attorney general. Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's voters would {{decide whether to}} ratify a proposed new constitution for the state in 1891. The divided Democrats had <b>taken</b> <b>no</b> stand on the document {{as part of their}} convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. About six weeks before the election, Brown, sensing strong public support for the new constitution, finally came out in favor of it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction.|$|E
5|$|When Edward {{found out}} about Harclay's treason, he issued an order for the earl's arrest. As Harclay {{attempted}} to garner support for his cause, the king began to fortify the northern castles. The stalemate lasted until 25 February, when Sir Anthony Lucy arrested the earl at Carlisle Castle. Lucy, who acted with only a small force, was clearly trusted by Harclay, so the arrest must have been conducted as a surprise manoeuvre. The enmity between Lucy and Harclay could stem from a dispute over the honour of Papcastle. In 1322, Harclay had also briefly disseised Lucy of his lands after the 1322 rebellion, even though Lucy had <b>taken</b> <b>no</b> part in that event.|$|E
5|$|Although Suffolk was {{receiving}} minimal financial {{benefit from the}} new regime, he still took conspicuous part in all the major state ceremonies. Such events ranged from the 1465 royal wedding to tournaments such as that between Lord Scales and the Bastard of Burgundy in 1467. By this time the king's relations with the powerful Earl of Warwick had soured {{to the point that}} the discontented earl was fomenting rebellion against Edward. Suffolk remained loyal to his brother-in-law, and appears to have <b>taken</b> <b>no</b> part in the Neville/Woodville feud that occupied much of the second half of the decade. Suffolk particularly helped the king crush the Lincolnshire Rebellion in 1469 and participated at the Battle of Empingham early the following year. Edward was subsequently forced into exile however, and Suffolk appears not to have been trusted by the resurgent Lancastrian government, possibly because he refused to come to London to meet the chancellor, even if he appears to have come rapidly to terms with the new government personally. His wife kept in touch with her exiled brothers in Burgundy. When Edward IV returned to England in March 1471, de la Pole joined him on that campaign, in which Edward regained his throne. Thus Suffolk also took part in the battles of Barnet (at which Warwick was killed) and Tewkesbury (at which the House of York finally crushed the remnants of the Lancastrian army).|$|E

5|$|The ICJ {{delivered}} its {{judgment on}} 23 May 2008. It held that although Pedra Branca {{had originally been}} under the sovereignty of Johor, the conduct of Singapore and its predecessors à titre de souverain (with {{the title of a}} sovereign) and the failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to such conduct showed that by 1980, when the dispute between the parties arose, sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore. The relevant conduct on the part of Singapore and its predecessors included investigating marine accidents {{in the vicinity of the}} island, planning land reclamation works, installing naval communications equipment, and requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits. In contrast, Johor and its successors had <b>taken</b> <b>no</b> action with respect to the island from June 1850 for a century or more. In 1953 the Acting Secretary of the State of Johor had stated that Johor did not claim ownership of Pedra Branca. All visits made to the island had been with Singapore's express permission, and maps published by Malaysia in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that it recognised Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca.|$|E
