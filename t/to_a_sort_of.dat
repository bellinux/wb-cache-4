The party remained almost completely separated from the English-speaking workers movement, however, and longing for leaders who could traverse the seemingly insurmountable language barrier which limited the organization <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> Teutonic ghetto.|$|E
25|$|The Accounts, {{even more}} than other {{criminal}} biographies, had the purpose of teaching readers about the wages of sin and often follow a similar pattern that can be called a 'Sinner to saint' type of biography. They {{took the form of}} inverted parabolas, recounting the protagonist's descent from immorality to criminality, from minor delinquencies and skipping church to a life of crime. The condemned, brought in front of the Ordinary, confesses in detail his wrongdoings, repents and welcomes death hoping for salvation after having set an example for the audience. Accepting the judgment of the jury, coming to terms with their guilt and confessing their crimes led the criminals <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> reintegration into society, working as a repayment of their debts to the community and a preparation for salvation.|$|E

MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software. In April 2004 Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum. Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006. Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product.

25|$|In the pre-Spanish past, {{there may}} never have existed a unified concept of the afterlife. Among the Pokoman Maya of the Verapaz, Xbalanque was to {{accompany}} the dead king, which suggests a descent into the underworld (called xibalba 'place of fright') like that described in the Popol Vuh Twin myth. The Yucatec Maya had a double concept of the afterlife: Evildoers descended into an underworld (metnal) to be tormented there (a view still held by the 20th-century Lacandons), while others, such as those led by the goddess Ixtab, went <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> paradise. The ancestors of Maya kings (Palenque tomb of Pakal, Berlin pot) are shown sprouting from the earth like fruit trees which, together, constitute a blissful orchard. The so-called 'Flower Mountain' has more specifically been interpreted as a reference to an aquatic and solar paradise. To judge by the marine faunal remains found in Classic tombs and by the accompanying aquatic imagery, this sea paradise {{may have been the}} Maya variant of the rain god's paradise (Tlalocan) in Central Mexican religion.|$|E
25|$|The Progressive {{movement}} {{emerged in}} the 1890s and included intellectual reformers typified by sociologist Lester Frank Ward and economist Richard T. Ely. They transformed Victorian liberalism, retaining its commitment to civil liberties and individual rights while casting off its advocacy of laissez-faire economics. Ward helped define {{what would become the}} modern welfare state after 1933. These often supported the growing working-class labor unions, and sometimes even the socialists to their left. The Social Gospel movement was a Protestant intellectual movement that helped shape liberalism especially from the 1890s to the 1920s. It applied Christian ethics to social problems, especially issues of social justice such as economic inequality, poverty, alcoholism, crime, racial tensions, slums, unclean environment, child labor, inadequate labor unions, poor schools, and the danger of war. Lyndon B. Johnson's parents were active in the Social Gospel and he had a lifetime commitment to it, for he sought to transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the Great Society and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> Christian internationalism and nation building. In philosophy and education John Dewey was highly influential.|$|E

Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "proto-down" [...] not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur Sinosauropteryx: decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appearing more like fur than feathers in life (although not in their microscopic structure).

500|$|Although he {{normally}} hates clip shows, David Mirkin {{liked this}} episode {{because of the}} singing and dancing and called the clips [...] "truly wonderful".

The only one missing really is [...] "Dr Zaius" [...] from [...] "A Fish Called Selma". In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner wrote, [...] "when songs spring up one at a time, you might notice a clever line or two, or {{the way that they}} serve the same kind of plot-advancing or energy-generating purposes they do in Singin' in the Rain or Cats, but piled together in , they amount <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> Simpsonian side project: Springfield: The Musical. And ... it's a very impressive side project at that." [...] The episode was nominated for a 1998 Emmy Award, in the [...] "Music Direction" [...] category. [...] A review of The Simpsons season 9 DVD release in the Daily Post noted that it includes [...] "super illustrated colour commentaries" [...] on [...] "All Singing, All Dancing" [...] and [...] "Lost Our Lisa".

2500|$|Biographer Randall Woods {{argues that}} Social Gospel themes Johnson learned from {{childhood}} {{allowed him to}} transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the Great Society and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> Christian internationalism and nation building. For example, in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church issued in 1940, adding [...] "It {{would be very hard}} for me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal." ...|$|E

Oh, make no mistake, the creator is too acquainted with failure, doubt, and nothingness {{to think that he}} might be a kind of pure form on the face of earth. He can be no angel, for an angel is the very symbol of perfection, and perfection implies a finite state. Nothing is ever finished for the creator." ...|$|E

Still he fought bravely with his difficulties, and even when his large salary was placed under trustees, he went on with his historic subjects". [...] His venture was ill-timed, hitting a period of agricultural depression. [...] A series of twelve dividends to his creditors, between 1871 and September 1876, paid off at least 7s 7d in the pound - dividends number 1, 7 & 8 seem not to appear in the London Gazette search results.|$|E

2500|$|Most Overwatch {{pornography}} is only several seconds long and intended to loop indefinitely. Since the game's official release, various creators have experimented with {{longer and more}} elaborate story content. Though the characters each have a personal backstory, {{there is still a}} lot not known about them. According to Kotakus Grayson, [...] "by design, they can’t be fully fleshed out. There has to be room for player identity." [...] Most short character clips take known character traits <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "logical conclusion", such as showing former pro gamer D.Va masturbating while streaming. The superpowers and symbols of agency of the female characters are usually not integral to these fanworks, though Emily Gaudette of Inverse noted that Tracer is an exception to this rule, stating that this character [...] "has achieved something not many other female characters in porn have: a unique personality that only adds to her sex appeal."
