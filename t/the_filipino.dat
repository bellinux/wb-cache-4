5|$|Bahay Tsinoy, one of Manila's most {{prominent}} museums, documents the Chinese lives and {{contributions in the}} history of the Philippines. The Intramuros Light and Sound Museum chronicles the Filipinos desire for freedom during the revolution under Rizal's leadership and other revolutionary leaders.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Filipinos</b> were {{considered}} a mongrel race, {{the result of}} Asian and Hispanic mixing that produced a primitive people of low intelligence. People of Japanese origin were regarded as a pure race and better organized, despite being described as [...] "paganistic barbarians". Armed with this logic, Republicans decided to assimilate the Japanese first and then <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos.</b> <b>The</b> logic of the campaign was that, after the Japanese had been assimilated, <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos,</b> with their limited mental capacity, would be too weak to oppose the movement. If they concentrated on trying to assimilate <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> first, it was likely that they would turn to the Japanese to arrange resistance to the campaign. Even if <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> were broken, <b>the</b> Republicans {{would still have to}} challenge the Japanese who had organized <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{introduced}} to <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> by an American named Elwood S. Brown, the then Physical Director of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). It became a popular game held in backyards and at beaches in the islands. At first, <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> invented their own rules for the game. US soldiers who {{were assigned to the}} different islands of the Philippine during the period also helped in the widespread introduction of volleyball to <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos.</b> These American military servicemen encouraged <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> to join them in playing during their time-off from military duties. Early {{in the history of the}} game of volleyball in <b>the</b> Philippines, <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> used trees as makeshift net holders (the net was hung between the two chosen trees).|$|R
50|$|On December 19, the 11th {{captured}} Montalban, while Sargent's squadron {{made for}} San Mateo, approaching <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> in rain and mist. <b>The</b> <b>Filipinos</b> forced Lawton's troops to scramble for {{cover in the}} rice fields.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> Premier League (FPL) was {{established}} as the top-flight {{competition in the}} Philippines. It featured eight clubs from the National Capital Region. The PFF also planned a Visayas and Mindanao FPL tournament in 2009, which never materialized. The first and only champion of the league, which was cancelled at the season's conclusion, was the Philippine Army.|$|E
5|$|Luna {{resigned}} on 1 March, {{mainly in}} resentment for the rearmament of the Kawit Battalion as the Presidential Guard. Aguinaldo hesitantly accepted the resignation. As a result, Luna was {{absent from the}} field for three weeks, during which <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> forces suffered several defeats and setbacks. One such defeat {{would be at the}} Battle of Marilao River on 27 March. Receiving the depressing reports from the field through his La Independencia correspondents, Luna went to Aguinaldo and asked to be reinstated with more powers over all the military heads, and Aguinaldo promoted him to Lieutenant General and agreed making him Commander-in-Chief of all <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> forces in Central Luzon (Bulacan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Zambales).|$|E
5|$|Other {{elements}} of <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> value system are {{optimism about the}} future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery.|$|E
50|$|American losses totaled {{as many as}} 20 {{dead and}} wounded. There was also one American {{prisoner}} of war. <b>The</b> <b>Filipinos,</b> however, suffered only 1 kill and 3 wounded, making this battle a one-sided victory for <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> during <b>the</b> war.|$|R
50|$|More {{than once}} the Spanish made forays to burn nearby houses to deprive <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> of much needed cover. <b>The</b> <b>Filipinos</b> {{attempted}} to smoke them out by setting fires beside the church wall {{but this was}} repulsed and their timber captured.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the close}} {{geographical}} location, Malaysia {{is home to}} one of <b>the</b> largest <b>Filipino</b> community in <b>the</b> world which estimate to be around 245,000 and 637,000 individuals. The presence of <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> in Malaysia has been continuous since antiquity. <b>The</b> <b>Filipinos</b> are mainly concentrated in the eastern shores in Sabah where the influence is evident, spurning ghettos in the state such as in Pulau Gaya. Another sizable community also resides in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan region. <b>The</b> <b>Filipinos</b> in Malaysia are represented in all walks of life, beginning from the refugees from the south to professionals.|$|R
5|$|Raven and Larsen ceased {{performing}} as M2M in 2002, and both {{went on to}} pursue solo careers; Larsen is known for performing a country music version of the song during solo performances. <b>The</b> <b>Filipino</b> acoustic pop duo Krissy & Ericka covered the song on their 2009 self-titled album.|$|E
5|$|Whitaker studies {{yoga and}} has a black belt in kenpō. He also trains in <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> martial art of Arnis, under Dan Inosanto. Inosanto {{is best known for}} having been a student of the late Bruce Lee and has trained actors such as Denzel Washington and Brandon Lee.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} United Farm Workers, Itliong {{assisted}} retired Filipino farmworkers in Delano, {{and was a}} delegate at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. Together with Vera Cruz, Itliong worked towards building a retirement facility for UFW workers, known as Agbayani Village. Although {{no longer in the}} United Farm Workers, Itliong continued to support others in the organized labor movement, such as helping others plan a strike against Safeway supermarkets in 1974. Itliong also served as President of <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> American Political Association, a bipartisan lobbying organization. He died in 1977 at the age of 63 in Delano of Lou Gehrig's disease.|$|E
50|$|While {{both sides}} {{suffered}} losses, <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> suffered far greater casualties. The Americans lost 50 to 60 killed {{and more than}} 200 wounded. <b>The</b> <b>Filipinos</b> suffered <b>the</b> loss of more than of 500 killed, wounded, or captured. <b>The</b> comparatively high <b>Filipino</b> casualty figures are due largely to the Americans use of artillery, warships and firearms.|$|R
50|$|While Gen. Lawton {{consolidated}} {{his forces}} in Santa Cruz, {{he planned to}} push on to Pagsanjan where he figured <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> had retreated. After capturing Pagsanjan on April 11, he again defeated <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> in a stiff engagement at the Battle of Paete.|$|R
50|$|Maj. William P. Rogers, CO of the 3rd Battalion, 20th US Infantry Regiment, {{came upon}} <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> in Cainta, about 1,000 strong, and {{forced them to}} retreat. He burned the town. Two Americans were killed and 14 wounded, while <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> {{suffered}} about 100 killed and wounded.|$|R
5|$|Agoncillo's {{legacy is}} remembered through {{the visual arts}} as well. In 1996, Filipino National Artist Napoleon Abueva created the {{concrete}} and marble sculpture Three Women Weaving <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> Flag at the UP Diliman to commemorate Agoncillo {{and the other two}} women who assisted her in their important task. Renowned Filipino painter Fernando Amorsolo painted the historical sewing and is nationally known as The Making of the Philippine flag.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s and {{increased}} prosperity on the mainland, Chinese domestic workers were dominant. Until the 1990s, workers then came {{primarily from the}} Philippines; the percentage is now shifting from Philippine workers to Indonesian and other nationalities. During the 1990s Indonesia and Thailand followed <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> model of labour export to deal with domestic economic crises, and Hong Kong families began hiring workers from those countries as well. The Indonesians provided competition, since those workers were often prepared to accept half the minimum wage.|$|E
5|$|Filipino cuisine {{has evolved}} over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic, Chinese, American, and other Asian {{influences}} that have been adapted to local ingredients and <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the paellas and cocidos created for fiestas.|$|E

50|$|Apolinar Velez y. Ramos (January 23, 1865 - October 21, 1939) was the Mayor of Cagayan de Misamis From 1928 to 1931 {{and also}} the Governor of the Misamis Province from 1906 to 1909. He led <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> during <b>the</b> Battle of Makahambus that {{resulted}} in the victory of <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos.</b>|$|R
5|$|From mid-1942 through mid-1944, <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> guerrilla {{resistance}} {{had been}} supplied and encouraged by U.S. Navy submarines {{and a few}} parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and {{take control of the}} rural areas, jungles and mountains – thus, the Japanese Empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific, US forces {{continued}} to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands, and decisively defeated Japanese {{forces in the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea. These defeats led to {{the resignation of the}} Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces invaded <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.|$|E
5|$|Philippine mythology {{has been}} handed down {{primarily}} through the traditional oral folk literature of <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> people. While each unique ethnic group {{has its own}} stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the aswang, the manananggal, the diwata/engkanto, and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling, Lam-Ang, and the Sarimanok.|$|E
5000|$|Filipino forces laid {{an ambush}} along a narrow path. They were poorly armed, with daggers, machetes, and spears and few firearms. The American force {{learned of the}} ambush from a pro-American local, Captain Francisco Acala, the last Spanish Mayor of Jagna. He led the Americans {{to the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos.</b> In a {{surprise}} attack, <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> found themselves trapped in their own trenches. All but seven were killed, a total 406, including the commander, Captain Gregorio [...] "Guyo" [...] Casenas. Americans casualties were three killed and ten wounded, which came toward the end when <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> launched a counter-attack.|$|R

50|$|On 7 May 1899, Laguna de Bay {{and another}} gunboat bombarded Sexmoan and routed <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> there. Later that day, the gunboats fought at Gaugua, where they bombarded <b>Filipino</b> {{positions}} in <b>the</b> town and sent men ashore {{to fight on}} the ground. Again <b>the</b> <b>Filipinos</b> retreated and set several buildings on fire as they went.|$|R
5|$|Terang Boelan is {{considered}} lost, as are most domestic productions from the era. <b>The</b> <b>Filipino</b> film historian and director Nick Deocampo noted that productions made with nitrate film– such as Terang Boelan– burned easily and were thus easily lost, but suggested that {{copies of the}} film may have survived until the 1970s. In a 1991 publication Said, Heider, and the American translator John H. McGlynn expressed hope that {{a copy of the}} film might be lying around in someone's attic or closet in Indonesia or the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The War Brides Act of 1945, and {{subsequent}} Alien Fiancées and Fiancés Act of 1946, continued to apply {{until the end}} of 1953, allowing veterans of the Regiment, and other Filipino American veterans, to return to the Philippines to bring back fiancées, wives, and children. In the years following the war, some sixteen thousand Filipinas entered the United States as war brides. These new Filipino American families formed a second generation of Filipino Americans, significantly expanding <b>the</b> <b>Filipino</b> American community.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} Buddhist and Taoist temples {{in the city}} serving the Chinese Filipino community. Quiapo {{is home to a}} sizable Muslim {{population}} which worships at Masjid Al-Dahab.
