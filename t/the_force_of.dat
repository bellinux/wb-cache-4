5|$|A ring could {{possibly}} exist in Himalia's orbit. One {{possible explanation is}} that a small moon had crashed into Himalia and <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the impact caused material to blast off Himalia.|$|E

5|$|Diverging {{winds aloft}} ahead of these troughs cause {{atmospheric}} lift within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> gravity.|$|E

5|$|Large {{sections}} of the hull plating seem to have fallen off well before the wreck hit the bottom. One such section, {{thought to have been}} from the galleys, separated from the stern in one piece and landed nearby. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the water tore up the poop deck and folded it back on itself. The center propeller is totally buried, while <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the impact caused the two wing propellers and shafts to be bent upwards by an angle of about 20°.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} {{is often}} found in car accident victims because of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the crash.|$|E
5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the drop. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in {{the lower part of the}} purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E

5|$|After the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the US Army's 2nd Infantry Division {{was moved}} to defend the Naktong River line. The division, which was untried in combat, was struck with a strong attack by several {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division's line. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half, and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to Yongsan, promoting a fight there.|$|E
5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{fitted with a}} shallow anti-torpedo bulge {{integral}} to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship. However, later testing proved {{that it was not}} deep enough to accomplish its task as it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the explosion.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} IOC session in August 1972 in Munich {{at which the}} Rhodesians were excluded, the IOC elected Killanin as Brundage's successor, to take office after the Games. Brundage cast a blank ballot in the vote which {{selected}} the Irishman, considering him an intellectual lightweight without <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> character needed to hold the Olympic movement together.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Sauðafell (Orrustan á Sauðafelli) {{occurred}} in 1550, when <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Catholic Bishop Jón Arason clashed with <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Daði Guðmundsson of Snóksdalur.|$|R

5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen {{opened fire on}} the dazed band members, who had all been knocked down into the field {{below the level of}} the road from <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the blast. The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate witnesses to the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three of the musicians were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> gravity is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E

50|$|More {{recently}} Barrett formed <b>The</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>of</b> Evil (now defunct) {{with former}} members of Jeffries Fan Club, The Scholars and Lone Raspberry. <b>The</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>of</b> Evil sounded similar to Barrett's main band, although lyrically they were much more pessimistic. <b>The</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>of</b> Evil ceased touring and playing in early 2005, and several members went on to play with Reel Big Fish.|$|R
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar limit, and nuclear {{reactions}} did not take place, the pressure exerted by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> gravity, and it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|E
5|$|If the {{variance}} in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift ({{the variance}} effective population size), genetic drift is a less powerful force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> genetic drift is substantially weakened.|$|E
5|$|In Bucharest, the {{earthquake}} had an estimated intensity of VIII–IX on the Mercalli scale. It toppled church steeples and caused Cotroceni Monastery to collapse. Numerous fires broke out, mainly from overturned stoves. In Bulgaria, {{the cities of}} Ruse, Varna and Vidin were almost completely destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> {{the earthquake}} cracked walls {{as far north as}} Moscow.|$|E

5|$|In the winter, melting snow seeps into {{cracks and}} joints and freezes at night. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the {{expanding}} ice helps to erode {{the rock of}} the Claron Formation. Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon. Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes that divide the Pink Member of the Claron Formation.|$|E
5|$|Later test {{explosions of}} nuclear weapons with houses and other test {{structures}} nearby confirmed the 5 psi overpressure threshold.
