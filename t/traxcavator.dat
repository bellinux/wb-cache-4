50|$|The Caterpillar D4 {{was used}} as the base tractor for the Trackson built loader that was known as the T4 or <b>Traxcavator</b> shovel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Traxcavator</b> was a namebrand of the Trackson Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The word [...] "Traxcavator" [...] {{came from}} {{combining}} [...] "tractor" [...] and [...] "excavator".|$|E
5000|$|In 1948, {{collaboration}} between Caterpillar engineers and Trackson engineer saw {{the development of}} the HT4 Trackson hydraulic shovel. This was an all-new hydraulic shovel-loader design, integrated with the current model D4 tractor. The HT4 sold alongside the cable Traxacavators, until 1952, when the cable <b>Traxcavator</b> line ceased production.|$|E
50|$|In December 1951 the Caterpillar Company {{purchased}} the Trackson Company, and the cable <b>Traxcavators</b> and the HT4, became Caterpillar <b>Traxcavators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In late 1952, the all-new No.6 Caterpillar Shovel was {{announced}} by Caterpillar, and cable <b>Traxcavator</b> production ceased. The Caterpillar HT4 and No.6 Shovel {{were the only}} hydraulic Traxcavators available from Caterpillar until the all-new 933, 955 and 977 made their appearance in early 1955. The name [...] "Traxcavator" [...] was a registered Caterpillar brand name for many years, but has developed into common usage to describe any tracked shovel/loader.|$|E
