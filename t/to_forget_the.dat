5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity is {{beautiful}} and true. Living under time's influence is a problem. Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in between life and death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns {{originated}} during development of XIII-2, while the development team was brainstorming ideas for possible continuations {{of the story}} and universe of the games, though there was no solid decision to make a second sequel to XIII at the time. Development of Lightning Returns started in May 2012, soon after the release of Requiem of the Goddess, the final story-based DLC episode for XIII-2. According to Motomu Toriyama, he had wanted to tell more stories about Lightning, and the DLC had not provided a satisfactory ending for her. The game was designed in a shorter time than the other games in the series; Yoshinori Kitase explained that this was because the team did not want players <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> story of the previous games, and the team needed to work especially hard as a result. Another reason was that the team wished to bring the XIII series to a close before the release of the next generation of gaming hardware. The title was also chosen to be the last original Final Fantasy game on seventh generation consoles, and next-gen versions of the game were not considered. Developer tri-Ace, who had previously worked with the team on XIII-2, returned to help with the graphics.|$|E

25|$|The novelty and {{inventiveness}} of {{the last}} years of the century are best seen in the anonymous La Mariane du Filomene (1596) which mixes the frame-tale, amorous sentiment, dreams, and pastoral elements {{to tell the story of}} a man wandering through the Parisian countryside trying <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> woman who betrayed him.|$|E

25|$|In quatrain two, {{the speaker}} implores {{the young man}} <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> hand that wrote the sonnet if the mere thought of the speaker would cause him to mourn. This is {{particularly}} ironic considering that there are lines in other sonnets (e.g., Sonnet 18, Sonnet 55, Sonnet 65 and Sonnet 81) that speak of immortality through poetic verse, thus negating the possibility that one can be forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{original}} town of Canudos has been {{covered by the}} reservoir of the Cocorobó Dam, built by the military regime in the 1960s, the Canudos State Park, established in 1986, preserves many of the important sites {{and serves as a}} monument to the war.

25|$|Andrei had two brothers. The {{younger brother}} Nicolae Folberth, {{worked for the}} Ford Factory in Romania and for just {{the simple fact of}} being German nationality, was {{deported}} by the Romanian authorities, after the Second World War to Russia, as a so-called compensation for the war damages. After spending 5 years (1945-1950) in several labor camps in the region of Donbas, he returned to Romania trying <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> big injustice. Getting his old job back, he was also part of the football team of the Factory. Weakened after the labor years, he died on the football field after he was severely faulted.|$|E

In the first book, Neville Longbottom tends <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> password and must wait near the painting until other Gryffindors arrive to open the way.|$|E
25|$|February Shadows can be {{categorized}} as a psychological novel. The entire narration is told through first person stream of consciousness, and the plot builds through the unearthing of new memories as they emerge in Hilde's mind. The story is told in a mix {{of past and present}} and the narration switches fluidly {{back and forth between the}} two. The manner of the flashbacks and the inner comments Hilde makes about each informs the reader that she wishes to repress the horrific memories of 2 February 1945. Hilde constantly reminds herself <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> past as if her survival and sanity depended on doing so.|$|E
25|$|Lost Souls {{tells the}} story of The Inspector, a disgraced former police officer who has never been able <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> last case on which he worked; the {{disappearance}} of an eleven-year-old girl named Amy Haven from the town of Dowerton, Dorset. The Inspector was convinced a vagrant named Mr. Bones had killed Amy, but was unable to prove it, and so planted evidence. However, the local newspaper discovered his ruse, and the case against Bones fell apart. He was released, and Amy's trail went cold. Her parents subsequently blamed The Inspector for the police's failure to find her, and he was fired. Now, on the fifth anniversary of her disappearance, he has come to the abandoned ruins of Dowerton train station and hotel after local children reported seeing Amy in the vicinity.|$|E

25|$|After {{recovering}} from a related infection, Orelli married and had a family of six children. During World War II, despite his aversion to Nazi Germany and fascism, {{he was forced to}} work as an artillery director in Italy. At war's end, he returned to work as a mechanic, retiring in 1960. In his later years, he was active in urging others not <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> lessons learned after the first World War, and in 2003 he was made a Grand Officer in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. He died in January 2005, a month after having turned 110 and achieving supercentenarian status. At the time of his death, he was Italy's oldest survivor of the First World War, the last remaining trench infantryman and the last survivor from Italy's entry into the war.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Manga Bookshelf's writers, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network {{compared}} Watanuki's {{development in}} the series with Subaru's due to how both characters start behaving like close people to them. Matthew Alexander also compared Watanuki's new characterization with Yuko's as it shows him maturing by his no longer throwing angry tantrums and by his unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> witch. Carlo Santos praised Watanuki's role as the shop's new owner due to how he manages to replace Yuko by taking on some of her traits such a calmer demeanor as well as wearing multiple outfits. Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin liked Watanuki's calm demeanor when dealing with clients which helped to build an appealing atmosphere. Todd Haberkorn's work as Watanuki's English voice actor has been criticized by Santos for making the character sound annoying rather than funny.|$|E

The Doctor reveals that the sudden interest in the moon will reinvigorate Earth's space program, and Lundvik will {{get the opportunity to}} realise her dream. The Doctor returns Courtney and Clara to their rightful time; Clara angrily accosts the Doctor for forcing her to make the decision on the fate of humanity, while the Doctor asserts he cannot be allowed to make those choices himself. Clara tells the Doctor she does not want to see him again, and takes comfort with Danny Pink, though Danny sees she is still not ready <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> Doctor. Clara returns to her flat that evening and looks reflectively at the moon.|$|E
