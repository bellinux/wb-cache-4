5|$|The final victim, {{killed on}} 31 October 1828, was Margaret Docherty, a middle-aged Irish woman. Burke lured {{her into the}} Broggan lodging house by {{claiming}} {{that his mother was}} also a Docherty from the same area of Ireland, and the pair began drinking. At one point Burke left Docherty in the company of Helen McDougal while he went out, ostensibly to buy more whisky, but actually to get Hare. Two other lodgers—Ann and James Gray—were an inconvenience to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare's lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret Hare had joined in. At around 9:00pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children, and saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows {{at some point in the}} evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
500|$|A curtain sack, {{commonly}} found on beds of the period, {{hangs in the}} central axis between Gabriel and the attendant angel. [...] A sideboard beside the bed contains two types of candles and a flask of water standing in bright light falling from {{the window to the}} left. The floor is multi-colored tile-work, similar to van der Weyden's Columba altarpiece; Memling truncates the ceiling rafters in the mid-ground, at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> with the floor extending into the foreground. Blum describes the effect as acting [...] "like an open stage for the holy figures".|$|E
500|$|Dream Days at the Hotel Existence's cover art was {{designed}} by Aaron Hayward & David Homer of Debaser, a New South Wales-based design organisation. The recipient of the 2007 ARIA Award for [...] "Best Cover Art", the album art features {{a photograph of a}} road leading into the Australian outback horizon. In the centre, placed in the sky in relation to the background, there is a window with a crimson curtain. Within this window is a hotel room, as per the name of the album, in which a man with no head in a suit is seated at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> while watching the television.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there is}} no title track for <b>the</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Century album, the album's title comes from a famous couplet in this song: [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventies/It's <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century.".

60|$|He paused. Mrs. Gould's face, {{very white}} within {{the shadow of}} the hood, bent over him with an invincible and dreary sadness.

60|$|But {{all night}} long the heroes of the past flocked about me. I had been reading a lot of history, and I knew them all the minute my eyes fell upon them. Charlemagne and Canute sat on <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> while Alfred the Great climbed {{up one of the}} posts until he was stopped by Hannibal's legs, who had them twisted about the post to keep himself steady. When I got up in the morning I went down-stairs into the little parlor, and there was the maid down on her knees {{cleaning}} the hearth.|$|E
60|$|About {{the middle}} of the night Liza woke; her mouth was hot and dry, and a sharp, cutting pain passed through her head as she moved. Her mother had evidently roused herself, for she was lying in bed by her side, {{partially}} undressed, with all the bedclothes rolled round her. Liza shivered in the cold night, and taking off some of her things--her boots, her skirt, and jacket--got right into bed; she tried to get some of the blanket from her mother, but as she pulled Mrs. Kemp gave a growl in her sleep and drew the clothes more tightly round her. So Liza put over herself her skirt and a shawl, which was lying over <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and tried to go to sleep.|$|E

6000|$|Indeed {{this was}} by no means the first time that his brain had become a {{whirring}} torment in his skull. Previous experiences had led to the most careful provision for exactly such states. Over <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> hung a light, warm pyjama suit of llama-wool, and at the feet of it were two tall boots of the same material that buckled to the middle of his calf. So protected, Mr. Britling proceeded to make himself tea. A Primus stove stood ready inside the fender of his fireplace, and on it was a brightly polished brass kettle filled with water; a little table carried a tea-caddy, a tea-pot, a lemon and a glass. Mr. Britling lit the stove and then strolled to his desk. He was going to write certain [...] "Plain Words about Ireland." [...] He lit his study lamp and meditated beside it until a sound of water boiling called him to his tea-making.|$|E
60|$|So we {{were left}} together, this murderous renegade and I--he sitting at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> {{sharpening}} his knife upon his boot {{in the light of}} the single smoky little oil-lamp. As to me, I only wonder now, as I look back upon it, that I did not go mad with vexation and self-reproach as I lay helplessly upon the couch, unable to utter a word or move a finger, with the knowledge that my fifty gallant lads were so close to me, and yet with no means of letting them know the straits to which I was reduced. It was no new thing for me to be a prisoner; but to be taken by these renegades, and to be led into their Abbey in the midst of their jeers, befooled and out-witted by their insolent leaders--that was indeed more than I could endure. The knife of the butcher beside me would cut less deeply than that.|$|E
60|$|It was {{two nights}} {{later that the}} usher, having walked down between the two rows of beds in the dormitory, and seeing that all the boys were quiet, and {{apparently}} asleep, proceeded to his own bed, which {{was at the end}} of the room, and partly screened off from the rest by a curtain. No sooner did he disappear behind this than half a dozen heads were raised. An oil lamp burned at the end of the room, affording light for the usher to undress; and enabling him, as he lay in bed, to command a general, if somewhat faint view of the dormitory. Five minutes after Mr. Purfleet had disappeared behind the curtain, the watching eyes saw the clothes at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> pulled down, and caught a partial view of Mr. Purfleet as he climbed in. A second later there was a yell of terror, and the usher leapt from the bed. Instantly, the dormitory was in an uproar.|$|E

6000|$|... "'My lord, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over our trouble'--he was with us in Egypt--'I {{have been thinking}} {{so much that it}} has got a hold of my sleep. To-night as you said you did not want me any more and I was tired, I went to bed early and had a dream. I dreamed that we were once more in the shrubbery, as happened some years ago, and that the little African gent who shot like a book, was showing us the traces of those two black men, just as he did when they tried to steal her ladyship. Then in my dream I seemed to go back to bed and that beastly snake which we found lying under the parcel in the road seemed to follow me. When I had got to sleep again, all in the dream, there it was standing on its tail at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> hissing till it woke me. Then it spoke in good English and not in African as might have been expected.|$|E
60|$|The {{second day}} {{did not differ}} very much from the first day, except that her bed had become very important, and the world outside, {{when she tried to}} think of it, {{appeared}} distinctly further off. The glassy, cool, translucent wave was almost visible before her, curling up at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and as it was refreshingly cool she tried to keep her mind fixed upon it. Helen was here, and Helen was there all day long; sometimes she said that it was lunchtime, and sometimes that it was teatime; but by the next day all landmarks were obliterated, and the outer world was so far away that the different sounds, such as the sounds of people moving overhead, could only be ascribed to their cause by a great effort of memory. The recollection of what she had felt, or of what she had been doing and thinking three days before, had faded entirely. On the other hand, every object in the room, and the bed itself, and her own body with its various limbs and their different sensations were more and more important each day. She was completely cut off, and unable to communicate {{with the rest of the}} world, isolated alone with her body.|$|E
60|$|Lady Lundie was in bed. The {{visible part}} of her ladyship was {{perfectly}} attired, {{with a view to}} the occasion. A fillet of superb white lace encircled her head. She wore an adorable invalid jacket of white cambric, trimmed with lace and pink ribbons. The rest was--bed-clothes. On a table at her side stood the Red Lavender Draught--in color soothing to the eye; in flavor not unpleasant to the taste. A book of devotional character was near it. The domestic ledgers, and the kitchen report for the day, were ranged modestly behind the devout book. (Not even her ladyship's nerves, observe, were permitted to interfere with her ladyship's duty.) A fan, a smelling-bottle, and a handkerchief lay within reach on the counterpane. The spacious room was partially darkened. One of the lower windows was open, affording her ladyship the necessary cubic supply of air. The late Sir Thomas looked at his widow, in effigy, from the wall opposite <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Not a chair was out of its place; not a vestige of wearing apparel dared to show itself outside the sacred limits of the wardrobe and the drawers. The sparkling treasures of the toilet-table glittered in the dim distance, The jugs and basins were of a rare and creamy white; spotless and beautiful to see. Look where you might, you saw a perfect room. Then look at the bed--and you saw a perfect woman, and completed the picture.|$|E
