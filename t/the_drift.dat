5|$|The Runcorn area drains {{into the}} River Mersey {{to the north}} and the River Weaver to the south. The bedrock of the western and northeastern parts of the town is made up of rock from the Sherwood {{sandstone}} group; in the other areas the bedrock is from the Mercia mudstone group. In places there are prominent outcrops of sandstone, particularly at Runcorn Hill and Halton Hill. Elsewhere the bedrock is covered by drift. At the northwestern periphery of the town <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> consists of recently blown sand. Farther to the east and bordering the River Mersey is recent alluvium. Elsewhere <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> consists of till.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{we attempt}} to clarify the nature of <b>the</b> <b>drifting</b> field based on <b>the</b> <b>drifting</b> and {{standing}} field model. Particularly, we concentrate on the characteristic feature, predominance of sectorial harmonics in <b>the</b> <b>drifting</b> field.|$|R

5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that reverses <b>the</b> <b>drift.</b> This process repeats as <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> continues in the other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing <b>the</b> <b>drift.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal balls formed in situ. They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed in situ, stating that <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates <b>the</b> <b>drifting</b> {{problem in}} Progressive Fine Granularity Scalable (PFGS) video coding, which {{arises from the}} fact that high quality {{references}} are used to predict the enhancement layer. Due to the unique property of the PFGS scheme, this paper first analyzes the occurrence and propagation of <b>the</b> <b>drifting</b> errors in details. As a result, an iterative model is established to simulate <b>the</b> <b>drifting</b> errors at <b>the</b> encoder. With <b>the</b> proposed <b>drifting</b> model, a decision-making mechanism can help the PFGS scheme to choose the coding mode of each macroblock in the enhancement layer. The experimental results show that the PFGS scheme incorporating the proposed technique can effectively reduce <b>the</b> <b>drifting</b> errors at low bit rates. Meanwhile, the PFGS scheme also improves the coding efficiency up to 1. 8 dB compared with the FGS scheme at moderate or high bit rates...|$|R
50|$|For his June 1949 {{debut at}} the Grand Ole Opry, Williams formed {{the most famous}} version of <b>the</b> <b>Drifting</b> Cowboys: Bob McNett (guitar), Hillous Butrum (bass), Jerry Rivers (fiddle) and Don Helms (steel guitar). Until 1950, Williams' songs were {{recorded}} with session musicians, with the label crediting the backing to <b>the</b> <b>Drifting</b> Cowboys Band. In 1950, McNett and Butrum left the band, being replaced by Sammy Pruett and Cedric Rainwater. In 1951, before undergoing back surgery and not knowing how long he {{would be unable to}} tour, Williams disbanded the group. During 1952 he was not backed by <b>the</b> <b>Drifting</b> Cowboys. After his death, the band was used for a short time by Ray Price. Band members would later tour as <b>the</b> <b>Drifting</b> Cowboys for several years.|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. <b>The</b> <b>drift</b> angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E

40|$|A {{benchmark}} calculation comparing kinetic modeling with IMPGYRO and multi-fluid modeling with SOLPS for tungsten impurities {{has been}} performed. In both cases, impurity densities are relatively {{large in the}} top SOL region mainly due {{to the effect of}} the thermal force. In the outer divertor region, however, a significant difference has been observed, which could be explained by the effect of <b>the</b> <b>drifts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>drifts</b> are switched off in SOLPS in this study, while they are naturally taken into account in IMPGYRO. <b>The</b> <b>drifts</b> prevent impurities from being transported toward the outer divertor region...|$|R

5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These rankings are due to its small and severely fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E

Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans.

5|$|The Allied {{air forces}} carried out several bombing raids on Mimoyecques between November 1943 and June 1944 but caused little damage. The bombing {{disrupted}} the construction {{project and the}} initial raids of 5 and 8 November 1943 caused work to be delayed for about a month. The Germans subsequently decided to abandon the western site, where work had not progressed very far, and concentrated on the eastern site. On 6 July 1944 the Royal Air Force began bombing the site with ground-penetrating Tallboy bombs. One Tallboy hit the concrete slab on top of Drift IV, collapsing <b>the</b> <b>drift.</b> Three others penetrated the tunnels below and substantially damaged the facility, causing several of the galleries to collapse in places.|$|E

The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the operating handle, and <b>the</b> <b>drift</b> angle set by a small locking screw.|$|E
