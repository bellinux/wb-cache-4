Fernández won an appeal and was declared eligible for his senior year, ending Cincinnati's pursuit. As a senior, Fernández pitched to a 13–1 win–loss record with a 2.35 earned run average (ERA) and 134 strikeouts. He also threw two no-hitters.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to analyse what strategies are pursued in order to protect self-esteem when it is threatened by a negative self-evaluation of school competence. Participants were 838 secondary-school students from the seventh to <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>grades.</b> Data were collected using Harter’s Self-Perception Pro le for Adolescents, together with a Scale of Attitudes towards School. Our results show that there are signi cant differences between the self-esteem enjoyed by successful and unsuccessful students in the seventh grade; such differences disappear in <b>the</b> eighth and <b>ninth</b> <b>grades.</b> They also reveal success-related differences in domain-speci c self-evaluation. We also found that students with low levels of academic achievement attribute less importance to school-related areas and reveal less favourable attitudes towards school. We discuss these results in terms of Harter’s self-esteem model and Robinson and Tayler’s self-esteem protection model...|$|R
