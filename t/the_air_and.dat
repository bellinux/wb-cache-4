After Glennon was sacked at the 50-yard line, however, the drive sputtered and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball.|$|E

The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
5|$|Curtiss {{refused to}} pay license fees to the Wrights and sold an {{airplane}} equipped with ailerons to the Aeronautic Society of New York in 1909. The Wrights filed a lawsuit, beginning a years-long legal conflict. They also sued foreign aviators who flew at U.S. exhibitions, including the leading French aviator Louis Paulhan. The Curtiss people derisively suggested that if someone jumped in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> waved his arms, the Wrights would sue.|$|E

5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Light {{became famous}} among {{aviation}} enthusiasts {{due to his}} 1934 around-the-world flight. To celebrate his marriage to Meader, he wished to approximate the same, and Meader was happy to comply. During the planning of the trip, many points on Earth had not been captured on film from <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> the American Geographical Society promoted these photographic flights, as {{they were trying to}} build an aerial collection. Light's idea was to travel across areas South America and Africa never been aerially photographed.|$|E

5|$|Females of many spider species, {{including}} P. labiata, emit volatile pheromones into <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> these generally attract males from a distance.

5|$|Frigatebirds {{remain in}} <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> do not {{settle on the}} ocean.
