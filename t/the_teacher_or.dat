Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E

Whenever a student loses a house point, their house jewels (ruby for Gryffindors, emeralds for Slytherin, sapphires for Ravenclaw, and topazes for Hufflepuff) are {{taken away from}} a glass hourglass located in every classroom.

25|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} can arise when the professional responsibilities {{of a teacher}} are affected, or appear to be affected, by a special personal relationship with a student. These can include showing favoritism towards a student sexually involved with <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> <b>or</b> hostility towards a student due to a past relationship. If a teacher is sexually involved with a student, colleagues may feel pressured to give preferential treatment to the student, such as better marks, extensions on essays, extra help, or academic opportunities. When there are multiple relationships between several staff and students, the possibilities for conflict {{of interest}} are enormous. Even {{if there is no}} favoritism or hostility, it can be perceived by others to be exhibited.|$|E

25|$|As {{in other}} Buddhist traditions, an {{attitude}} of reverence for <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> <b>or</b> guru, is also highly prized. At {{the beginning of a}} public teaching, a lama will do prostrations to the throne on which he will teach due to its symbolism, or to an image of the Buddha behind that throne, then students will do prostrations to the lama after he is seated. Merit accrues when one's interactions with the teacher are imbued with such reverence in the form of guru devotion, a code of practices governing them that derives from Indian sources. By such things as avoiding disturbance to the peace of mind of one's teacher, and wholeheartedly following his prescriptions, much merit accrues and this can significantly help improve one's practice.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of the use}} of and {{research}} on interactive writing takes place in the field of second language learning, whether students are learning English or another world language (Chinese, French, Spanish, etc.). Dialogue journals are reported as valuable instructional tools in language classes with children and adolescents, with university students, and with adults in adult education programs. The writing can take place between students and <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>or</b> between language learners and native language speakers. The purposes might be overall language acquisition, development of writing abilities, extension of learning of the language beyond time in class, promotion of ability to transition to academic writing in university classes, and easing of the trauma of transition to life in the United States.|$|E

Absent students can use your podcasts to see class lectures, daily activities, homework assignments, handouts, and more. A review of literature that reports the use of audio podcasts in K-12 and higher education found that individuals (1) use existing podcasts and/or (2) create their own podcasts. Students can create their own podcast to share their learning experiences with each other and also with other students from other schools.|$|E
