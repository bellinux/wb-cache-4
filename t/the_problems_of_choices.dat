As <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> such <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> land use and technology would depend upon the local characteristic of the ecosystem we propose {{to take up a}} case study through developing a model of analysis at the watershed level economies in the Himalayan mountains. The issue <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> which is involved in the analysis of the particular case study, is supposed to yield valuable analytical and policy insights, which can be generalized for rural situations with similar geomorphic, eco-regional and agro-climatic conditions. This work develops a quantitative optimization framework of analysis using the mathematical tool of linear programming for structuring and articulating <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> <b>The</b> modeling framework essentially focuses on optimal use of land and energy resources in two alternate exercises of net revenue maximization and cost minimization.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> {{how often}} to {{disperse}} in a randomly fluctuating environ-ment {{has long been}} investigated, primarily using patch models with uniform dispersal.

Ezoe (1998) and Levin and Muller-Landau (2000) approached this problem using models that were essentially deterministic, and used calculus to find optimal dispersal parameters. Here we follow Hiebeler (2004) and use a stochastic spatial model to study the competition of different dispersal strate-gies. Most work on such systems is done by simulation or nonrigorous methods such as pair approximation. Here, we use machinery developed by Cox, Dur-rett, and Perkins (2011) to rigorously and explicitly compute evolutionarily stable strategies. ...|$|R
