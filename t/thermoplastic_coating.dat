Each facemask is coated with Polyarmor G17, a powder coating that is resistant to impact and corrosion. The Polyarmor is a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>coating</b> used on a number of surfaces. While some organizations purchase new face masks every season, others have their equipment reconditioned.|$|E
50|$|The {{coatings}} on metals tend to {{fall into}} two categories: thermoplastic or thermoset. A <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>coating</b> does not chemically react when the substrate undergoes drying after the coating process. The drying of thermoplastic coatings is accomplished by evaporation or by applying heat to fuse the material to the metal. Metals with thermoplastic coatings are not resistant to high heat or aggressive solvents. The coating on the metal can re-melt with exposure to heat or strong solvents from the screen-printing process. A thermoset coating cures by a chemical reaction called polymerization and/or crosslinking. The coating is cured by baking the coated metals at high temperatures {{for long periods of}} time. Thermoset coatings tend to be resistant to heat and remelting, and they generally provide excellent solvent and scuff resistance.|$|E

The textile preforms include both woven and knitted structures which will be thermoformed into a finished part. In order {{to determine if the}} matrix resin is properly adhering to the fibers or if voids are being formed in the coating process, the tensile strength and modulus of these samples will be tested. The matrix uniformity of matrix distribution in these samples is also being determined using an image analyzer...|$|E

In this novel, continuous coating process, the fiber tow bundle is first spread cover a series of convex rollers and then evenly coated with a fine powder of thermoplastic matrix polymer. Next, the fiber is heated internally by passing direct current through the powder coated fiber. The direct current is controlled to allow the carbon fiber temperature to slightly exceed the flow temperature of the matrix polymer. Analysis of the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>coated</b> carbon fiber tows produced using this continuous process indicates that 30 to 70 vol pct fiber prepregs can be obtained...|$|R

[...] in the coating paint increases the coating plasticity, improving the anti-settling, anti-pollution, anti-tarnish. Thermoplastic marking paint is most commonly produced in yellow and white. The white marking paint mainly contains titanium white, zinc oxide, lithopone, while the yellow paint is mainly heat-yellowing lead.|$|R
30|$|Laser capture microdissection is {{a useful}} method to isolate cells using a laser pulse [27]. Microscopy is used to verify the {{position}} of cells of interest, and then a <b>thermoplastic</b> polymer <b>coating</b> {{is placed on the}} tissue over a glass slide. The polymer is melted and then the polymer-cell composition is removed from the tissue. Although specific cells in a tissue are captured, there are some limitations. Contrary to FACS and MACS, LCM is a low-throughput technology. Additionally, LCM relies heavily on cell identification. LCM needs an expert pathologist or cytologist, limiting its extensive application. However, the main advantages of LCM are that it allows researchers to study single-cells within their niche or microenvironment and preserves their spatial location. A cell’s niche is relevant when studying cells with functional diversity linked to spatial location such as brain cells.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{presented}} to achieve both high strength and high fracture toughness of fibre composites {{by means of a}} microductile interlayer between fibre and matrix. Experiments conducted on epoxy matrix composites reinforced with unidirectional Kevlar and carbon fibres (KFRP and CFRP) with a thin layer of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>coating,</b> e. g. polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL), on the fibre show promising results for transverse fracture toughness without any significant loss in strength properties. Variation of fracture toughness with temperature is a direct manifestation of the dependence of the interface properties on the parameter studied. Interlaminar fracture toughness determined in mode I and mixed mode I/II delamination is also shown to be encouraging. Surface analysis of the fibre and composite interfaces confirms the distinctive failure mechanisms between the composites with and without the PVAL coating. A micromechanics analysis of the total fracture toughness arising from major failure mechanisms gives good agreement with experimental results. Characterization of the interface properties, including interfacial fracture toughness, residual clamping stress and coefficient of friction, using a fibre pull-out model based on a shear-lag analysis is discussed and applied to evaluate experimental data obtained in these composites...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of (woven carbon fiber / vinyl ester matrix) composites can be greatly improved if the interphase between the reinforcing high-strength low-weight fiber and the thermoset resin is made more compliant. In {{order to improve}} the adhesion of the vinyl ester matrix to the carbon fiber, a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>coating</b> such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) {{can be used as}} an intermediate between the matrix and the fiber. The extent of mutual diffusion at the (sizing material / polymer matrix) interphase plays a critical role in determining the mechanical {{properties of}} the composite. In this research, the molecular interdiffusion across a poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)) /vinyl ester monomer (PVP/VE) interface is being investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. The ATR method which can be used to characterize the transport phenomena, offers several advantages, such as the ability to monitor the diffusion in situ or to observe chemical reactions. In order to separate the effects of the vinyl ester monomer diffusion and the crosslinking reaction, ATR experiments were carried out at temperatures below the normal curing temperature. Diffusion coefficients were determined by following variations in infrared bands as a function of time...|$|E
40|$|Thermoset and {{thermoplastic}} {{polymeric materials}} {{are used as}} coatings on the bore of downhole tubulars such as water injectors in the oil industry. Previous work has indicated that such coatings can fail by impact damage and by abrasion from the wire used to lower inspection tools down the tubular. The wire is commonly called "slickline" {{and the type of}} wear is called "wireline wear". However, the different wear mechanisms of thermoset and thermoplastic polymeric coatings under wireline wear conditions have not been clarified. Filler materials such as calcium silicate, calcium fluoride and alumina are often added to polymeric coatings to enhance the mechanical properties of the matrix materials; nevertheless, fillers can improve the wear resistance or exacerbate the wear rate of polymeric coatings depending on the characteristics of the filler material such as its shape, concentration, and the boundary condition between the filler and the matrix material. In this study, two types of thermoset polymeric coatings, a modified novolac containing calcium silicate fillers and a modified epoxy containing alumina as the filler, and one type of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>coating,</b> a fluoropolymer with 2 % calcium fluoride filler, were selected for wear tests. The disc specimen in a pin-on-disc (POD) apparatus was modified to enable embedding a circular loop of wire into its surface. That arrangement was used to study the effect of normal force and sliding distance on wireline wear of the three polymeric coatings. Detailed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on the wear tracks produced to investigate the wear mechanisms. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to X-ray map the wear scars so as to quantify the amount and size distribution of filler present in the wear scar compared to that in the bulk material and thus elucidate the role of fillers in the wear mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of washing on the inductive {{elements of the}} energy harvester integrated into clothing is under investigation. For the experiment were prepared single-layer and five-layer coils. Coils differ from each other of insulating layers and type of waterproof isolation (lamination, different coatings). After the application of protective coatings and test for water resistance electrical conductivity loss of 15 % for one-layer inductive element with coating Nr. 1 and loss of 12 % for one-layer inductive element with coating Nr. 2 was found. After preliminary washing test five-layers inductive element showed electrical conductivity loss of up to 3 %. Some inductive element has shown destruction of the structure and coating. The preliminary washing test {{results showed that the}} structure of the coils with <b>thermoplastic</b> adhesive <b>coating</b> has not destruction. Also hasn’t destruction coil with lamination.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} performed to examine the application of displacement controlled Ultrasonic Plastic Welding (UPW) {{in the creation of}} joints between aluminium or steel and carbon fiber reinforced polyamide 6 (CFR-PA 6). This is known as a fast welding technique in which in the order of seconds a joint can be created by means of fusion bonding of thermoplastics. This study has been focused on an assessment of the power and displacement feedback obtained during welding, the electro-insulating behavior of the created joints and their single lap shear strength & fracture. Both non-hybrid and hybrid joints have been welded. For hybrid welds, both steel and aluminium were used as metallic substrate. For aluminium substrates, the effect of not applying a coating has been evaluated as well. The absence of a coating was found to result in no bond between the applied thermoplastic and pretreated metallic surface. With the applied welding settings, hybrid welds with coated metallic substrates showed to dissipate the same amount of energy as non-hybrid welds, in the order of 700 Joules on average, at a welding time in the order of 0. 5 seconds. The obtained power and displacement feedback during welding showed to be affected by both material choice and the type of adherend in contact with the sonotrode during welding. Welding resulted in an electro-insulating thermoplastic adhesive layer between both adherends for hybrid welds. Welding grit blasted and coated aluminium samples resulted in an average single lap shear strength (SLSS) of 11 MPa. This was 16. 5 MPa with a coefficient of variation of 2. 2 % for welding with a grit blasted, nitric acid etched and coated aluminium surface. This strength is up to 80 % of a tested adhesive reference. Hybrid welds with coated grit blasted steel and the used welding settings proved to result in an average SLSS of 8 MPa. For hybrid welded samples generally adhesive peel fracture on the metallic surface occurred. The findings support the application of displacement controlled ultrasonic plastic welding in the creation of hybrid joints between CFR-PA 6 and <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>coated</b> metals like aluminium or steel.

40|$|WSU Vancouver Honors Thesis. Additive manufacturing, {{also called}} 3 D printing, is a {{technology}} undergoing development which holds {{the potential for}} rapid and cheap production of complicated and exotic parts. Particularly, it is an excellent method of manufacturing when one wishes to minimize material wastage, {{and it can be}} used to produce geometries that would otherwise be difficult or impossible with conventional manufacturing techniques. One of the newest 3 D printing technologies for thermoplastics is high speed sintering (HSS), which uses infrared light to sinter layers of <b>thermoplastic</b> powder <b>coated</b> in radiation-absorbent material with an ink-jet printer head. HSS is promising in that it has material requirements similar to that of selective laser sintering (SLS). Selective laser sintering is well established for many thermoplastics but is extremely expensive. Mostthermoplastics have not been applied to HSS due to a lack of understanding of the science behind HSS. This research aims to investigate the relationship between ink-jet printed thermoplastic powders and infrared light in order to test the versatility of HSS. Three thermoplastic powders, including Nylon 12, Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and Polyether ketone (PEEK), were used for the experiments. PMMA and PEEK samples of one layer were printed well below their recommended processing temperatures by existing publications; however, they were successfully sintered, indicating the viability of PMMA and PEEK with HSS...|$|R
40|$|Sea {{water is}} often re-injected into oil wells through {{injector}} tubulars {{in order to}} stabilise the reservoir pressure. Injector tubulars are made from expensive chromium alloys due to the corrosiveness of sea water. However, to minimise cost, the tubulars {{can be made from}} inexpensive carbon steel and protected internally with cheap polymeric coatings to prevent the tubulars from corroding. However, in service it has been found that the polymeric coatings can be damaged by tools used during work-over and/or inspection of the oil well, which are lowered by wireline. This paper presents the results of the wireline wear study performed on various thermoplastic and thermosetting polymeric coatings, undertaken to understand the effect of wireline asperities on the tribological performance of filled and unfilled coatings. A pin-on-wire (POW) test setup, which utilizes a modified pin-on-disc rig, has been used {{for the purpose of this}} study. A true tribo-couple was used consisting of a 3. 2 mm diameter “slickline” wire embedded in an aluminium disc to form a circular loop of radius 80 mm. The test conditions (sliding speed of 2. 2 m/s and a load of 150 N) were chosen to simulate typical downhole wireline operating conditions. The results show that the unfilled <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>coating</b> can have the highest wear resistance while the filled thermoplastics have the worst wear resistance. The performance of coatings was found to be linked to the chemical and physical nature of the matrix material (either thermoplastic or thermosetting). The influence of filler concentration, shape, type and sizes on the wear rate and wear mechanism of the filled coatings was also investigated. The results show that filler shape, size and type have a significant effect on wear resistance of the coatings. Factors such as filler pull-out, filler fracture and poor abrasion resistance of the filler were found to be responsible for the poor wear resistance of some of the filled coatings because of the inadequacy of fillers to act as load bearing elements. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the worn sample surfaces show either plastic deformation/cutting or formation of short fragile tendrils. Some desirable tribological and mechanical properties of the coatings’ microstructural compositions are identified that give good resistance to wireline wear. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{films are}} an {{inevitable}} {{aspect of the}} modem societies. This is especially so in the food containment industry. These days most of the packaging films that {{are available in the}} market are made from polyolefmic materials. Although these materials perform superior package functions, they are riot biodegradable. This is a cause of concern for the environment. Unlike polyolefinic packaging, packaging made from regenerated cellulose films are biodegradable because of their cellulosic source. However, modification of these films to deliver suitable packaging functions could compromise the biodegradability of these films. The application of an impemieable <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>coating,.</b> of colorants and the use ofplasticizers are among the modifications that interfer~with the biodegradability of the regenerated cellulose packaging. The influence of several factors on the biodegradation behaviour of different types of coated and uncoated cellophane films was studied in this research. Two general approaches were undertaken for this study. Firstly, the influence of a specific colour reducing bacterium, Shewanella strain JI 8 143, on coated regenerated cellulose films, in the presence {{and in the absence of}} colorant materials, was investigated. Secondly, microorgamsms that are capable of degrading various coated and uncoated regenerated cellulose films were enriched from landfill soil inocula. Degradation behaviour of each film was then studied using the cultivated culture. Several. analytical techniques were used to establish the changes that were induced into the treated regenerated cellulose. films. Techniques such as UV spectrophotometry, FTIR spectrop 40 tometry, contact angle measurement, SEM analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and gas chromatography were used. A number of molecular biology approaches such as the polymerase chain reaction (peR) procedure and restriction enzyme digestion were undertaken to an~lyse the community profile ofthe enriched culture. Evidence is given to show that the nitrocellulose coating underwent denitrification when treated with Shewqnella 118 143 culture in the presence of azo dye. However, poly(vinylidene chloride) coating incubated with Shewanella 118 143 culture did not undergo any significant chemical changes either in theÃ‚Â· presence or in the absence of azo dye. The enrichment study, based on the biodegradation of various regenerated cellulose films, indicated that the biodegradation rate of cellulosic films was greater under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. The enrichment provides a number of cÃ‚Â·ultures that are capable of utilising cellophane films as a carbon source, under anaerobic conditions. Activities of both bacteria and methanogenic archaea were observed in all of the enriched cultures. Profiling bacterial community ofthe enriched cultures gave general information concerning the way these enriched cultures are related. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of wearable textile antennas after 20 reference washing cycles was evaluated {{by measuring the}} reflection coefficient of different antenna prototypes. The prototypes’ conductive parts were screen-printed on several textile substrates using two different silver-based conductive inks. The necessity of coating the antennas with a <b>thermoplastic</b> polyurethane (TPU) <b>coating</b> was investigated by comparing coated with uncoated antennas. It is shown that covering the antennas with the TPU layer not only protects the screen-printed conductive area but also prevents delamination of the multilayered textile fabric substrates, making the antennas washable for up to 20 cycles. Furthermore, it is proven that coating is not necessary for maintaining antenna operation and this up to 20 washing cycles. However, connector detachment caused by friction during the washing process was the main problem of antenna performance degradation. Hence, other flexible, durable methods should be developed for establishing a stable electrical connection...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify agronomic efficiency relative index, ammonia volatilization, and CO 2 emissions from conventional, stabilized and controlled release N fertilizers in corn summer crop. The experiment was carried out in a corn crop area located in Lavras, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, without irrigation. All treatments were applied in topdressing at rate of 150 kg ha- 1 N. N-NH 3 losses from N fertilizers were: Granular urea (39 % of the applied N) = prilled urea (38 %) > urea coated with 16 % S 0 (32 %) = blend of urea + 7. 9 % S 0 + polymers + conventional urea (32 %) > prilled urea incorporated at 0. 02 m depth (24 %) > urea + 530 mg kg- 1 of NBPT (8 %) = Hydrolyzed leather (9 %) > urea + thermoplastic resin (3 %) = ammonium sulfate (1 %) = ammonium nitrate (0. 7 %). <b>Thermoplastic</b> resin <b>coated</b> urea, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate presented low values of cumulative CO 2 emissions in corn crop.

40|$|A {{technique}} for the fabrication of piezoelectric actuators that generate acceptably large forces and deflections at relatively low applied voltages involves the stacking and diffusion bonding of multiple thin piezoelectric layers coated with film electrodes. The present technique stands {{in contrast to}} an older technique in which the layers are bonded chemically, by use of urethane or epoxy agents. The older chemical-bonding technique entails several disadvantages, including the following: It is difficult to apply the bonding agents to the piezoelectric layers. It is difficult to position the layers accurately and without making mistakes. There {{is a problem of}} disposal of hazardous urethane and epoxy wastes. The urethane and epoxy agents are nonpiezoelectric materials. As such, they contribute to the thickness of a piezoelectric laminate without contributing to its performance; conversely, for a given total thickness, the performance of the laminate is below that of a unitary piezoelectric plate of the same thickness. The figure depicts some aspects of the fabrication of a laminated piezoelectric actuator by the present diffusion- bonding technique. First, stock sheets of the piezoelectric material are inspected and tested. Next, the hole pattern shown in the figure is punched into the sheets. Alternatively, if the piezoelectric material is not a polymer, then the holes are punched in thermoplastic films. Then both faces of each punched piezoelectric sheet or <b>thermoplastic</b> film are <b>coated</b> with a silver-ink electrode material by use of a silkscreen printer. The electrode and hole patterns are designed for minimal complexity and minimal waste of material. After a final electrical test, all the coated piezoelectric layers (or piezoelectric layers and <b>coated</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> films) are stacked in an alignment jig, which, in turn, is placed in a curved press for the diffusion-bonding process. In this process, the stack is pressed and heated at a specified curing temperature and pressure for a specified curing time. The pressure, temperature, and time depend on the piezoelectric material selected. At the end of the diffusion-bonding process, the resulting laminated piezoelectric actuator is tested to verify the adequacy of the mechanical output as a function of an applied DC voltage...|$|R

In general, polyol derived from petroleum based product. As the limiting amount of polyol derived from petroleum and the demand of polyol is increasing, effort is needed to find out alternative raw materials in particular potential feedstock comes from agricultural waste. However, there are limited studies focused {{on the use of}} rice straw as material for synthesis of biopolyol. Rice straw is very potential raw material for synthesis of biopolyol as it contains lignocellulose hence through liquefaction process will produce biopolyol. Response surface method was performed to determine the optimal operating condition for the liquefaction process of rice straw indicated by high content of hydroxyl group. The effect of key independent variables of liquefaction temperature, reaction time, concentration of biomass and catalyst on the hydroxyl value of product was quantified. The liquefaction process was performed in a batch reactor equipped with thermometer and reflux condenser using glycerol as a solvent and reactant. A central composite design with four independent variables and one response function was applied to determine the influence of independent variables. The concentration of biomass and acid catalyst has significant effect on the hydroxyl value of biopolyol product. The hydroxyl value is a linear function of biomass and catalyst concentration. The optimal operating condition was achieved at a temperature of 60 oC, reaction time of 60 minutes, 3 % of biomass concentration and 0. 5 % of acid catalyst concentration.

The development of robust and efficient sample preparation techniques is crucial to improve detection sensitivity and workflow. Immunomagnetic separation using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is attractive, as it can efficiently capture target cells. For food safety applications, a platform is needed to rapidly process large sample volumes, allowing capture and release of target bacteria conjugated to immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs). Herein, we demonstrate a method for magnetic capture and release of bacteria-IMNPs complex based on a 3 D magnetic trap integrated on a polymeric microfluidic device.

A novel and never before used pretreatment system, based on a low speed cold spray of fine copper powders, applied a thin conductive film on the plastic substrate, which made the ESD possible. The focus of {{first part of the}} paper is on analyzing the influence of both electrical and aerodynamic process parameters on ESD process. Differences in behavior of the powders used were evident. Design of experiments (DOE) was used to plan experimental trials and related ANOVA tables were made and used as support instruments to interpret the experimental findings, process modeling, and to the understand physical phenomena involved in the deposition process. As a result, several process maps were produced in which consistent trends of coating thickness and average roughness vs. operative parameters are reported. Careful qualification of the polymeric films was also carried out using the most relevant performance indicators. The second part of the paper focuses on assessing the influence of exposure time on coating thickness and average roughness of the polymeric films, that is, once the electrical and aerodynamic parameters had been optimized.

40|$|International audienceHealth {{regulations}} {{are becoming increasingly}} restrictive which leads to develop solvent free laminating processes. Hot melt adhesives represent an interesting solution to bond two pre-printed substrates of polymer for packaging applications for example, but their high viscosities require extruding the polymer formulation through important die gaps (between 0. 5 mm and 1 mm) in order to limit the extrusion pressure. Thus, delivering a final very thin layer of hot melt (a few μm) between the polymer substrates requires applying very high draw ratios between the die and the contact point on the substrate. These high draw ratios would result in marked thickness and width instabilities (called draw resonance) when using usual stretching distances as in cast film (a few cm) or in <b>coating</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> layers on a metal or paper substrate (more than 10 cm). Surprisingly, reducing drastically the stretching distance (around 1 mm) and applying a differential pressure {{between the two sides}} of the melt allow postponing the instability occurrence. Nevertheless the processing window is narrow and the objective of the present paper is to describe the cotformatating process developed at Bostik Company, to characterize the drawing instabilities and to investigate the influence of different processing parameters. In addition, a numerical model explaining these surprising stabilizing conditions is proposed. This model results in the definition of a high speed coating processing window...|$|R
