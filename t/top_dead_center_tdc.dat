2500|$|A {{peripheral}} {{intake port}} gives the highest mean effective pressure, however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, {{because it helps}} to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the intake ducts which cause [...] "misfirings", caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite. Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range, but PP was linked also to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to {{the addition of a}} fresh air supply to the exhaust port, and proved also that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a small loss of power at top rpm. David W. Garside, the developer of the Norton rotary engine, who proposed that earlier opening of the intake port before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (<b>TDC),</b> and longer intake ducts, improved low rpm torque and elasticity of Wankel engines. That is also described in Kenichi Yamamoto's books. Elasticity is also improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine. Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system. Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean effective pressure, more severely in peripheral intake port engines. The Mazda RX-8 Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs, and there has been specific study of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{gasoline}} and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition (spark plugs). An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (<b>TDC)</b> and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or oxidize), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. [...] Engines have glow plugs and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature. Diesel engines are lean burn engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. [...] They thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, [...] "due {{to the absence of}} throttling , and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of >20% lower fuel use and (given differences in energy content between fuel types) >15% lower energy use. Gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engine, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.|$|E

It presents the experimental results {{on the effect of}} start of injection on combustion, performance and emissions of a direct-injection spark-ignition engine powered by syngas of H 2 /CO composition. The engine was operated with wide open throttle at minimum advance to achieve maximum brake torque. Two different start of injections were selected to represent before and after inlet valve closing and the excess air ratio (λ) was set at 2. 3. The engine operation at start of injection[*]=[*] 120 ° before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> was found to be best for combustion and performance at speed up to 2100 [*]r/min. At engine speed higher than 2100 [*]r/min, this start of injection does not permit maximum performance due to injection duration limitation. Hence, early injection at start of injection[*]=[*] 180 ° before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> was adopted at higher speed with better combustion and performance. Therefore, best performance of syngas in direct-injection spark-ignition engine could be attained by setting start of injection at 120 ° before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> for lower speeds and at 180 ° before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> for speed greater than 2100 [*]r/min.

50|$|During {{the exhaust}} stroke, {{scavenging}} occurred {{as the air}} moving past the cylinder exterior lowered the pressure inside due to the direct exposure of the exhaust port to the slipstream. The piston continued its exhaust stroke until <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (<b>TDC)</b> was reached, but the valve remained open. The piston began to move down on its intake stroke with the valve still open, pulling new air into the cylinder. It remained open until it was {{two-thirds of the way}} down, at which point the valve closed and the remainder of the intake stroke greatly reduced the air pressure. When the piston uncovered the transfer ports again, the low pressure in the cylinder drew in the balance of the charge.|$|E

In the six cylinder engine, one piston reaches <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> every 360°/6 = 60°. The three cylinder WHE-DR engine only has a piston reach TDC every 120°, so its admission valve must be open over a much larger angle to ensure the engine is self-starting. If the valve is open for 130° of crankshaft rotation, the cutoff value would be about 64%.|$|R

Traditional flywheel magnetos (using contact-breaker points, but no external coil) worked equally well in reverse because the cam controlling the points is symmetrical, breaking contact before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (<b>TDC)</b> equally well whether running forwards or backwards.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a spark ignition engine is investigated under different values of ignition advance. A two-zone burnt/unburned model with the fuel burning rate described by a Wiebe function is used for modeling in-cylinder combustion, and then experiments are carried out to validate the calculated data. By varying the ignition timing, the results of some characteristics such as power, torque, thermal efficiency, pressure, and heat release are obtained and compared. The results show that optimal power and torque are achieved at 31 °CA before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center,</b> and performance is decreased if this ignition timing is changed.

50|$|The {{need for}} {{advancing}} {{the timing of}} the spark is because fuel does not completely burn the instant the spark fires, the combustion gases take a period of time to expand, and the angular or rotational speed of the engine can lengthen or shorten the time frame in which the burning and expansion should occur. In a vast majority of cases, the angle will be described as a certain angle advanced before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (BTDC). Advancing the spark BTDC means that the spark is energized prior {{to the point where the}} combustion chamber reaches its minimum size, since the purpose of the power stroke in the engine is to force the combustion chamber to expand. Sparks occurring after <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (ATDC) are usually counter-productive (producing wasted spark, back-fire, engine knock, etc.) unless there is need for a supplemental or continuing spark prior to the exhaust stroke.|$|R
