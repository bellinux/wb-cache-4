50|$|A morse <b>taper</b> <b>reamer</b> is used {{manually}} {{to finish}} morse taper sleeves. These sleeves are a tool {{used to hold}} machine cutting tools or holders in the spindles of machines such as a drill or milling machine. The reamer shown is a finishing reamer. A roughing reamer would have serrations along the flutes {{to break up the}} thicker chips produced by the heavier cutting action used for it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taper</b> pin <b>reamers</b> are {{designed}} to prepare the hole for taper pins. Metric <b>taper</b> <b>reamers</b> are designated by the small diameter. For example, a 2 mm <b>taper</b> pin <b>reamer</b> has a 1.9 mm small end (2 mm nominal size) and a 2.86 mm large end.|$|R
50|$|The tang is not {{engineered}} to withstand twisting forces which are sufficient {{to cause the}} taper to slip, and will frequently break off in this situation. This will allow the tool to spin in the female taper, {{which is likely to}} damage it. Morse <b>taper</b> <b>reamers</b> are available to alleviate minor damage.|$|R
50|$|The optimum {{number of}} lobes is five. Their number should be prime, {{to avoid the}} usual {{harmonic}} effects between lobes. As is already widely recognised with <b>tapered</b> <b>reamers,</b> five has better stability than three in imperfectly circular holes. More lobes than this, such as seven, would reduce the spacing for clearance between the lobes. A patent has been applied for about a thread with such an optimised pentalobular form.|$|R
30|$|The {{medullary}} canal was reamed using <b>tapered</b> <b>reamers</b> of progressively increasing size {{until the}} planned size was achieved and until {{resistance of the}} reamer against the femur cortex was felt. The depth of the reamer {{was determined by the}} Steinmann pin, which should correspond to the notch on the reamer. Then a Wagner Cone Prosthesis uncemented stem was inserted by guiding it with its appropriate device, aiming to obtain about 10 – 20 ° of anteversion.|$|R
50|$|A {{precision}} <b>tapered</b> <b>reamer</b> {{is used to}} make a {{tapered hole}} to later receive a tapered pin.A taper pin is a self tightening device due to the shallow angle of the taper. They may be driven into the tapered hole such that removal can only be done with a hammer and punch. They are sized by a number sequence (for example, a No.4 reamer would use No.4 taper pins).Such precision joints are used in aircraft assembly and are frequently used to join the two or more wing sections used in a sailplane. These may be re-reamed one or more times during the aircraft's useful life, with an appropriately oversized pin replacing the previous pin.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>tapered</b> <b>reamer</b> may be {{used for}} {{cleaning}} burrs from a drilled hole, or to enlarge a hole. The body of the tool tapers to a point. This type of reamer consists of a body which, typically, is up to 1/2 inch in diameter, with a rod cross piece at the large end acting to form a handle. It is especially useful for working softer metals such as aluminum, copper, and mild steel. Another name for it is [...] "maintenance reamer", referring to its use in the miscellaneous deburring and enlarging tasks often found in MRO work. A similar tool can be seen on select Swiss Army knives, such as the electrician model, to be used on conduit.|$|R
50|$|The spiral may be {{clockwise}} or counter-clockwise {{depending on}} usage. For example, a <b>tapered</b> hand <b>reamer</b> with a clockwise spiral {{will tend to}} self feed as it is used, possibly leading to a wedging action and consequent breakage. A counter-clockwise spiral is therefore preferred even though the reamer is still turned in the clockwise direction.|$|R
50|$|Edward Greenwood Wrigley {{established}} a tool making business at 232 Aston Road, Birmingham in 1898. He expanded in 1902 by moving some operations to Foundry Lane, Soho, Birmingham. They manufactured high-speed twist drills {{and made a}} specialty of milling cutters, <b>taper</b> and adjustable <b>reamers</b> and gear cutters.|$|R
