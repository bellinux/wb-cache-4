2500|$|The focus then {{shifted to}} the overall race battle, with five riders– Henao, Nairo Quintana (...) , Henao's team-mate Richie Porte, 's Alberto Contador and Simon Špilak of – heading into the stage {{separated}} by only ten seconds. Špilak set the <b>target</b> <b>time</b> for the four riders behind him to chase, recording the third-fastest time at that point with a 35' 53" [...] for the course. Contador was much slower than his rival, taking the course in a steady manner, and crossed the finish line nineteen seconds in arrears of Špilak. The rain was not making for easy riding; at the intermediate time-check, Quintana was coping best with the conditions, pulling ten seconds on Porte and seventeen on Henao. Porte eventually displaced Špilak from third place, going eight seconds quicker than him, but his chances for the overall slipped away, as Quintana took twenty-three seconds out of him, recording a time of 35' 22". Henao tried his best {{to hold on to}} the win, but crossed the line forty seconds down on Quintana, giving Quintana his first World Tour win. Porte moved ahead of his team-mate for second place, while Henao placed third by one solitary second ahead of Špilak.|$|E

Bewley's team-mate Stuart O'Grady comfortably took the fastest time several minutes later, recording a time of 57' 54" [...] for the course. Cyril Lemoine (...) took nearly a minute off O'Grady's time to take top spot for a period, before [...] rider Alexander Kristoff repeated the feat on Lemoine's time, taking the fastest time with 55' 58".
