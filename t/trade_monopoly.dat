5|$|Danzig had {{remained}} practically autonomous and adamant about protecting its status and foreign <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly.</b> The Karnkowski Statutes of 1570 gave Polish kings the control over maritime commerce, {{but not even}} Stephen Báthory, who resorted to an armed intervention against the city, was able to enforce them. Other Polish cities held steady and prosperous through {{the first half of}} the 17th century. War disasters in the middle of that century devastated the urban classes.|$|E
5|$|Lazica {{had been}} a Byzantine client state since 522, when its king, Tzath I, had {{rejected}} Persian hegemony. However, during the rule of Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527–565), a series of heavy-handed Byzantine measures made them unpopular. In particular, {{the establishment of a}} <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> by the magister militum (general) John Tzibus, which was regulated from the newly constructed fortress of Petra, drove Gubazes to seek once again the protection of the Persian shah, Khosrau I (r. 531–579).|$|E
5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E

5|$|Riel was {{the eldest}} of eleven {{children}} in a locally well-respected family. His father, who was of Franco-Ojibwa Métis descent, had gained prominence in this community by organizing a group that supported Guillaume Sayer, a Métis imprisoned for challenging the HBC's historical <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly.</b> Sayer's eventual release due to agitations by Louis Sr.'s group effectively ended the monopoly, and the name Riel was therefore {{well known in the}} Red River area. His mother was the daughter of Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière and Marie-Anne Gaboury, one of the earliest white families to settle in the Red River Settlement in 1812. The Riels were noted for their devout Catholicism and strong family ties.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1820s, a fur trading route {{developed}} between the Red River Colony (in modern Manitoba) and the trading posts in Minnesota, first primarily at Mendota and later at Saint Paul. The system of ox cart trails {{came to be}} known as the Red River Trails and was used principally by the Métis as a way to avoid the fur <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> of the Hudson's Bay Company (which had absorbed the North West Company). Though this cross-border trade was entirely illegal and violated the policies of the Hudson's Bay Company, enforcement against the trade by American and British authorities was virtually non-existent. The trail system would reach its peak usage in the mid-19th century. The Hudson's Bay Company continued to expand its presence north of the U.S. border establishing new posts such as Fort Alexander and Rat Portage.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were {{integrated}} into a regional trade network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours, and involved the exchange of Manche produce such as cacao, annatto and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> was maintained by force {{on the part of}} the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the Manche Ch'ol remained subservient to them. After the Manche towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland Manche settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancuén River drainage traded via land and riverine routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpetén) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with Cobán and Cahabón).|$|E

50|$|Denmark {{tried to}} solve the problem by giving the Faroes to Christoffer Gabel (and later on his son, Frederick) as a {{personal}} feudal estate. However, the Gabel rule was harsh and repressive, breeding much resentment in the Faroese. This caused Denmark, in 1708, to entrust the islands and <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly</b> once more to the central government. However, they too struggled to keep the economy going, and many merchants were trading at a loss. Finally, on 1 January 1856 the <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly</b> was abolished.|$|R
5|$|The intellectuals of the viceroyalty {{received}} and secretly distributed {{a copy of}} the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, promulgated by the French Revolution in 1789. Meanwhile, Belgrano returned from his studies in Europe, and was appointed as Perpetual Secretary of the new Consulate of Commerce of Buenos Aires. Belgrano and Castelli shared similar ideas about the Spanish <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> and the rights of the natives. Belgrano attempted to appoint Castelli as interim Secretary of the Consulate as his assistant, but faced strong opposition from the peninsular merchants, who delayed the appointment until 1796. Belgrano became ill during his stay in Europe, which forced him to take extended leaves from work, and wanted Castelli to be his successor if he resigned.|$|E
5|$|The first {{conflict}} between the French and the Natchez took place in 1716, when the Governor of Louisiana, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, passed through Natchez territory and neglected to renew the alliance with the Natchez by smoking the peace calumet. The Natchez reacted to this slight by killing four French traders. Cadillac sent his lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to punish the Natchez. He deceived the Natchez leaders by inviting them to attend a parley, where he ambushed and captured them, and forced the Natchez to exchange their leaders for the culprits who had attacked the French. A number of random Natchez from the pro-British villages were executed. This caused French–Natchez relations to further deteriorate. As part {{of the terms of}} the peace accord following this First Natchez War, the Natchez promised to supply labor and materials {{for the construction of a}} fort for the French. The fort was named Fort Rosalie, and it was aimed at protecting the French <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> in the region from British incursions.|$|E
5|$|Various Chinese dialect groups {{began to}} compete for {{commercial}} interests in the 1850s and 1860s. This led to communal violence. Abu Bakar and the Kapitan Cina in Johor (who were mainly migrants from Chaozhou) tried to assimilate Chinese entrepreneurs of non-Teochew origin. Abu Bakar gave official recognition {{and support for the}} Johor branch of the Ngee Ann Kongsi, which was seen as a secret society in Singapore at that time. As Johor prospered from the large revenues generated from the gambier and pepper plantations managed by the Kapitan Cina, Abu Bakar gave generous provisions to the Kapitan Cina in recognition for their contributions to the state; among his beneficiaries was a long-time family friend, Tan Hiok Nee, who was given a seat in the state council. The plantations operated relatively independently of the state government, and Abu Bakar was worried by the possible danger to the plantations {{in the event of an}} economic crisis. Shortly after a financial crisis broke out in Singapore in 1864, Abu Bakar imposed new regulations on these plantations, as many of them were owned by Chinese businessmen from Singapore. The Kapitan Cina and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce were particularly disturbed by the new regulations, and accused Abu Bakar of attempting to impose a <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> over Johor. The British government pressured Abu Bakar to retract the regulations, which he did in January 1866. In addition, the Kapitan Cina also faced considerable difficulties in securing new agreements with Abu Bakar. The crisis was only resolved in 1866 after Abu Bakar designated five new ports for the registration of cargo, and the British softened their animosity against Abu Bakar.|$|E
50|$|After Köppen, others {{took over}} the <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly,</b> though the economy {{suffered}} {{as a result of}} the war between Denmark and Sweden. During this period of the monopoly most Faroese goods (wool products, fish, meat) were taken to the Netherlands, where they were sold at pre-determined prices. The guidelines of the trading agreement, however, were often ignored or corrupted. This caused delays and shortages in the supply of Faroese goods and a reduction in quality. With the <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly</b> nearing collapse smuggling and piracy were rife.|$|R

25|$|The <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> in the Faroe Islands was {{abolished}} in 1856, {{after which}} the area developed as a modern fishing nation with its own fishing fleet. The national awakening from 1888 initially arose from a struggle to maintain the Faroese language and was thus culturally oriented, but after 1906 it became more political with the foundation of political parties of the Faroe Islands.|$|E

25|$|Cuba {{failed to}} prosper before the 1760s, due to Spanish trade regulations. Spain {{had set up}} a <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> in the Caribbean, and their primary {{objective}} was to protect this, which they did by barring the islands from trading with any foreign ships. The resultant stagnation of economic growth was particularly pronounced in Cuba because of its great strategic importance in the Caribbean, and the stranglehold that Spain kept on it as a result.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1718, a <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> {{was granted}} to John Law and his Company of the West (which {{was to become}} the Company of the Indies in 1719).

Construction began on the first Fort de Chartres (in present-day Illinois) in 1718 and was completed in 1720.|$|E
25|$|Albuquerque thus {{failed to}} stop the spice trade through the Red Sea and to {{establish}} a <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> for the Europe-India spice trade.

Although firms must obtain approval to trade, this has been given very liberally and there are now approximately 200, 000 firms eligible to engage in foreign trade. A small set of products including grains and mineral oil, accounting for 11 percent of 1992 imports, is reserved for state <b>trading</b> <b>monopolies,</b> while another 7 percent was reserved for 60 - 100 designated firms per commodity.

During the 3rd century BC, Carthage made Iberia the new base for its empire and its campaigns against the Roman Republic. Although they had little influence in the hinterland behind the coastal mountains, the Carthaginians occupied most of Andalusia, expanding along the northern Mediterranean coast and establishing a new capital at Cartagena.|$|E
25|$|Organized {{development}} of the Mississippi valley began with a grant of a <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> in 1712 to Antoine Crozat, {{with the goal of}} finding and mining precious stones, gold and silver. However, Crozat's venture failed by 1717 due to Spanish interference, and he relinquished his charter. The next company to be granted a <b>trade</b> <b>monopoly</b> for the region was led by John Law, a Scottish financier. In 1717, Law convinced Louis XIV to provide the Company of the West a 25-year monopoly of trade and ownership of all mines, while promising to settle 6,000 whites and 3,000 black slaves and build churches throughout the region. The company founded New Orleans as the capital of Louisiana in 1718, and merged with other companies in 1719 to form the Company of the Indies. In spite of a financial crisis and the ouster of Law in 1720, the Company of the Indies established a capital of the Illinois Country (upper Louisiana) at Fort de Chartres, 15 miles north of Kaskaskia on the east bank of the Mississippi. Another early settlement near present-day St. Louis, Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, was built in 1732 across from the Kaskaskia village as a convenient port for salt and ore mined on the western side of the Mississippi.|$|E
