5|$|The first {{deceased}} {{artist to}} top the UK Albums Chart was Otis Redding, {{who died in}} a plane crash on 10 December 1967. On 20 May 1968, Redding's sixth studio album, The Dock of the Bay, was released in the UK – three weeks later, it became his first and only UK number-one album. Since Redding, 11 further artists have posthumously topped the albums chart, of which three have done so more than twice. The first of these was American singer Eva Cassidy; after dying in 1996, three posthumous releases from Cassidy reached number one in consecutive years, 2001–03. The second musician to achieve this feat was American entertainer Elvis Presley. Following his death from a heart attack in August 1977, Presley's compilation album 40 Greatest climbed to number one within three weeks. Subsequent compilations ELV1S (2002), The King (2007), If I Can Dream (2015) and <b>The</b> <b>Wonder</b> <b>of</b> You (2016) also topped the chart. With If I Can Dream, Presley achieved his fourth posthumous number one, more than any other artist.|$|E

A week later, Dark Angel made her debut for World Wonder Ring Stardom, during which she affiliated herself with Io Shirai's Planet stable. In a six-woman tag team match, which celebrated Dark Angel's ten-year anniversary in professional wrestling, she, Shirai and Arisa Hoshiki defeated Eri Susa, Hiroyo Matsumoto and Miho Wakizawa. On July 13, Stardom announced Dark Angel as a participant in the 5★Star GP2012 tournament, which ran from August 19 to September 30. After wins over Saki Kashima, Kairi Hojo and Kyoko Kimura and a loss against Miho Wakizawa, Dark Angel headed to final day of the tournament {{at the top of her}} round-robin block, however, a loss to Natsuki☆Taiyo meant that she missed advancing to the finals of the tournament. In Dark Angel's final match of the tour on October 3, she and Io Shirai wrestled Miho Wakizawa and Nanae Takahashi to a twenty-minute time limit draw. Dark Angel was scheduled to return to Stardom on March 3, 2013, but due to a visa issue, she had to postpone her return until March 10, when she, Io Shirai and Yuzuki Aikawa defeated Act Yasukawa, Natsuki☆Taiyo and Yoshiko in a six-woman tag team main event. On March 24, Dark Angel entered a four-woman tournament to determine the number one contender to the World of Stardom Championship.

On November 4 at Stardom's 100th event, Dark Angel lost <b>the</b> <b>Wonder</b> <b>of</b> Stardom Championship to Act Yasukawa in her fourth title defense.|$|E

But these stories of despair are balanced by others that describe the joy of a slower life ("Take Its Own Time"), of hope triumphing over cynicism ("Where the Smoke Blows") and <b>the</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>of</b> the universe ("Terminal Star").|$|E
25|$|Franciscan {{spirituality is}} {{characterized}} by a life of poverty, love of nature, and charitable deeds towards those in need.

Franciscan prayer recognizes God's presence in <b>the</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>of</b> creation, as expressed in St. Francis' Canticle of the Sun. Franciscan spirituality is focused on walking in Christ's footsteps and sharing one's experience of God.|$|E
