5|$|The demons {{attempt to}} destroy the Ray Line {{underneath}} Filgaia. It was the last resort of the Guardians to connect their remaining strength together and maintain the planet. These plans are temporarily thwarted at the last moment, with Zeikfried being thrown through a dimensional rift in space when the three confront him. Finding himself transported to the underwater wreckage of the Photosphere, Zeikfred is met by a deformed visage of Mother, who devours him. However, the remaining Demons find another way to disrupt the Ray line by creating their own <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> designed to destroy rather than create life and using the Elw teleportation system distribute it all over Filgaia, throwing {{the forces of nature}} into chaos. It is also revealed that one of the Quarter Knights was not originally a demon, but Jack's lost love Elmina, which fueled his lust for vengeance.|$|E

25|$|The {{fruit is}} a {{leathery}} capsule, broadly oval in shape. These contain five spaces that split open outwards {{from the base}} of the style when the fruit is ripe by April. Each space contains two shiny black seeds that are shaped like a slightly curved <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> of 6×3mm, and are partly covered by a conspicuous scarlet aril, both of which starkly contrast with the horny white inside of the fruit (or mericarp). Aborted seeds are greyish. The embryo is green. Ixerba has fifty chromosomes (2n = 50).|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of rock tumbling: barrel (rotary) tumbling, and {{vibratory}} tumbling. Rotary tumbling is more common, simpler, quieter and less expensive than vibratory tumblers. There are two differentiating factors, however, that may lead one to use a vibratory tumbler. First, vibratory tumbler retain the overall shape of the rough rock, whereas rotary tumblers tend to make rocks round. Thus, {{it is important to}} use vibratory tumbler to make faceted shapes and <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> forms. Second, vibratory tumblers tend to process much faster than rotary tumblers, generally reducing the process time to half.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{institution}} of federal regulations limiting media cross-ownership after Murdoch's purchase of WNEW-TV (now WNYW-TV) and four other stations from Metromedia to launch the Fox Broadcasting Company, Murdoch was forced to sell the paper for $37.6 million in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow, a real-estate magnate with no news experience. When Kalikow declared bankruptcy in 1993, the paper was temporarily managed by Steven Hoffenberg, a financier who later pleaded guilty to securities fraud; and, for two weeks, by Abe Hirschfeld, who made his fortune building parking garages. After a staff revolt against the Hoffenberg-Hirschfeld partnership—which included publication of an issue whose front page featured the iconic masthead photo of founder Alexander Hamilton with a single <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> running down his cheek—Post was again purchased in 1993 by Murdoch's News Corporation. This came about after numerous political officials, including Democratic governor of New York Mario Cuomo, persuaded the Federal Communications Commission to grant Murdoch a permanent waiver from the cross-ownership rules that had forced him to sell the paper five years earlier. Without that FCC ruling, the paper would have shut down. Under Murdoch's renewed direction, the paper continued its conservative editorial viewpoint.|$|E
500|$|Making {{his way to}} {{the city}} of Adlehyde, Rudy meets Cecilia, a magician-in-training and {{successor}} to the Adlehyde royal family, and Jack, a headstrong treasure hunter. The trio teams up {{for the first time to}} help a local engineer named Emma, who is researching ancient technology in a nearby tomb and believes a remnant of the Demon Wars may be inside, but came across the monsters inside the tomb. Upon discovering the object, a deactivated robotic creature called a [...] "golem", the three adventurers escort Emma and their discovery back to Adlehyde to exhibit it at the town's Ruin Festival. [...] During the event, where several other golem creatures are on display, a small army of demons led by Belselk of the Quarter Knights proceed to burn the town, steal the golems, and mortally wound Cecilia's father, the king. In order to spare the remaining people of Adlehyde, Cecilia gives Belselk her family heirloom, a pendant called the <b>Tear</b> <b>Drop</b> that has magical properties which the demons believe can be used as a catalyst for reviving their leader. Gurdijeff: With the <b>Tear</b> <b>Drop,</b> it is possible. The demons, however, are trying to use it to revive their master, the Mother. (Wild Arms) [...] When the invaders recall from the town, Rudy and his friends make a pact to stop the Knights from taking control of Filgaia, and to restore balance to the weakening elemental forces of the world that have been in decline since the demons' initial invasion.|$|E

500|$|Realizing {{that the}} only way to defeat the demons is to confront them in their stronghold, the Photosphere, Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia gather the {{necessary}} materials to enter the tomb of the last remaining golem, the Earth Golem, Asgard. Convincing him to aid them in their struggle, [...] Asgard neutralizes the protective seal around the Photosphere, granting Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia access. With the aid of a blue-hooded figure, the heroes are able to re-acquire Cecilia's <b>Tear</b> <b>Drop,</b> previously acting as the power source to the entire fortress, and confront a weakened Mother directly, destroying her body just as the Photosphere sinks into the ocean. Thinking the worst to be over, the trio depart for Adlehyde when they are confronted by the Quarter Knights, who inform them of their plan to take over Filgaia in their maniacal leader's absence, and the blue-hooded character who assisted them was Ziekfried, the leader of the Quarter Knights who betrayed Mother.|$|E
500|$|Bus. US10 started {{northwest}} of downtown {{at the intersection}} of Telegraph Road and Dixie Highway in Waterford Township before crossing into the City of Pontiac. From there, the highway followed Dixie Highway southeasterly bordered by residential neighborhoods to the north and rail yards to the south of the four-lane street. From the intersection with Woodcalm Street southward, the eastbound direction branched off to follow Cass Avenue two blocks to the south of Oakland Avenue. At the northern end of downtown, Bus. US10 merged onto a loop formed by Wide Track Drive around the downtown core southward to Woodward Avenue. The loop is shaped like an upside-down <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> that is about four blocks wide at the northern end tapering to a single intersection at the south. Wide Track Drive also carried the two directions of Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) around downtown Pontiac between Woodward Avenue and Perry Street. The two directions of BL I-75/Bus. US10 intersected M-59 {{on opposite sides of the}} central business district at Huron Street. The business loop continued southward along Wide Track Drive to the intersection that marked the northern end of Woodward Avenue. From there, BL I-75/Bus. US10 followed Woodward south past the hospital and out of the City of Pontiac. South of the city limits, the roadway was bordered by residential subdivisions. At Square Lake Road, Bus US10 turned westward, BL I-75 turned eastward and M-1 continued south on Woodward Avenue. Bus. US10 followed Square Lake Road for about [...] before terminating at an intersection with US10 (Telegraph Road).|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes, stone [...] "preforms" [...] are used. [...] This {{refers to}} cutting shapes from the rough rock, before tumbling. This gives {{more control over}} the final piece, so shapes such as a <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> can be produced. The {{technique}} is still limited to rounded shapes. [...] Preforms may use less time with the coarsest step, or skip it altogether.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} had {{provisions for}} a wireless radio.

The generator was directly driven by a pulley on the engine and mounted {{on the left side}} with a <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> shaped fairing covering it. With the generator removed, a flat panel would be fitted instead.|$|E

2500|$|Galanthus {{is derived}} from the Greek γάλα (gala), meaning [...] "milk" [...] and ἄνθος (anthos) meaning [...] "flower", {{alluding}} to the colour of the flowers. The epithet nivalis {{is derived from}} the Latin, meaning [...] "of the snow". The word [...] "Snowdrop" [...] may be derived from the German Schneetropfen (Snow-drop), the <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> shaped pearl earrings popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Other, earlier, common names include Candlemas bells, Fair maids of February and White ladies (see Symbols).|$|E
2500|$|The model {{developed}} {{to explain the}} observations was that AM Canum Venaticorum is a binary system consisting {{of a pair of}} white dwarfs in a close orbit. The primary is a more massive white dwarf composed of carbon/oxygen, whereas the secondary is a less massive white dwarf made of helium, with no hydrogen but traces of heavier elements. (In some AM Canum Venaticorum-type [...] variables, the secondary can be a semi-degenerate object such as Subdwarf B star instead of a helium white dwarf.) Gravitational wave radiation is causing a loss of angular momentum in the orbit, leading to the transfer of helium from the secondary to the primary as the two draw closer. This transfer is occurring because the secondary is overflowing its Roche lobe—a <b>tear</b> <b>drop</b> shaped lobe created by the gravitational interaction between the two stars.|$|E
