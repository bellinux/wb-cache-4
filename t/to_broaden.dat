The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.|$|E

30|$|Thus, {{solid-state}} {{synthesis of}} AuNP dimers cross-linked with NDT molecules occurred directly on a glass surface coated by amine terminated molecules. These dimers have interparticle spacing {{determined by the}} length of NDT molecule. The orientation of the dimers on a glass surface is different. Major numbers of dimers are parallel {{to the surface of}} glass plane, while others have tilted orientation. This morphology of chemically attached dimers led <b>to</b> <b>broadening</b> of UV-visible absorption spectra and appearing of features in spectra of polarization difference ρ(λ) under different angles of incident light. The growing number of AuNP dimers leads <b>to</b> <b>broadening</b> of LSPR band due to dominating influence of interparticle plasmon coupling that caused by decreasing of interparticle distance.|$|R

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured.

It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players, crafting open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches <b>to</b> <b>broaden</b> the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.|$|E
