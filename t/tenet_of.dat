5|$|Allied {{planners}} began formulating {{their plans}} for the future direction of the fighting in the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands.

5|$|There is no ethical {{cohesion}} {{within the}} New Age phenomenon, although Hanegraaff {{argued that the}} central ethical <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential. Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic good and evil, negative events that happen are interpreted not {{as the result of}} evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.|$|E

5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|Hansell {{played a}} key and largely unsung role in the {{strategic}} planning of air operations by the United States. This included drafting both the strategic air war plans (AWPD-1 and AWPD-42) and the plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive in Europe; obtaining a base {{of operations for the}} B-29 Superfortress in the Mariana Islands; and devising the command structure of the Twentieth Air Force, the first global strategic air force and forerunner of the Strategic Air Command. He made precision air attack, as both the most humane and effective means of achieving military success, a lifelong personal crusade that eventually became the key <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> American airpower employment.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{foreign policy}} is officially based on the {{principle}} of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their political system. The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with other countries in the region.

A strong <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a lot}} {{of tension}} between Duyet and Minh Mạng. Although Gia Long had enlisted European support to claim the throne and allowed missionaries to {{function}} in Vietnam in gratitude to Pigneau, he ran a classical Confucian administration. He also expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestral worship, a basic <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> Vietnamese culture; Crown Prince Cảnh had been converted by Pigneau and subsequently refused to bow down to his ancestors, instead desecrating a shrine with feces.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long tolerated the Catholic {{faith of}} his French allies and {{permitted}} unimpeded missionary activities {{out of respect}} to his benefactors. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At {{the time of his}} death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina. However, he expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestor worship, a basic <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> Vietnamese culture. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among ladies of the court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Other Marxists, such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner, {{have argued}} that Childe's archaeological work should not {{correctly}} be considered Marxist because he failed {{to take into account}} the existence of class struggle as an instrument of social change, something which was a core <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor he considered in his archaeological work, Childe did accept that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, and that most of his contemporaries were producing studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe also diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. Furthermore, he denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and did not consider humanity's development into pure communism to be inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct instead.|$|E

5|$|Madeline Sylvia Royals {{was born}} on 8 January 1910 in Blackpool, Lancashire. Little is known of her early life, which coincided with Britain's {{involvement}} in the First World War, although she appears {{to have had a}} strained relationship with her parents. Her father, Willie Royals, was an insurance agent, while her mother, Marion Neruda Shaw, was a tailor's daughter from Oldham. Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later. In early life, Madeline was afflicted with polio, resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. Bedridden for the course of the illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, H.Rider Haggard and E.T.A. Hoffman. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the texts of the Old Testament, and was convinced that they contained secret messages, a theme that became a central <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> her later Luciferian beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Birth of {{children}} from alien parentage became a problem {{nearing the end of}} the 19th century in controlling population. Gibraltar held the <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> British law, jus soli, making children of aliens born in Gibraltar British by birth, and therefore they became an irremovable liability to the colony. Residents with temporary work permits could have children in Gibraltar and upset the system of exclusion. Therefore, the British administration devised unique methods to circumvent the <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> Jus Soli.|$|E
