5000|$|At {{the bottom}} and middle end of <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>Council</b> Tax is a {{progressive}} tax based {{on the value of}} the property; the higher the value of the property, the higher the amount of tax levied irrespective of the amount of inhabitants at the property (except the reduction allowed for single tenancy). However, there is only one band for properties valued (in 1991) above £320,000 and so the tax stops increasing after this point. Therefore, the tax has been criticised for being disproportionate, with those in more expensive houses not paying as much as those in smaller houses as a proportion {{of the value of the}} house and has therefore been called a [...] "new poll tax for the poor".|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study’s {{purpose was}} to {{critically}} analyse {{the ways in which}} South Africa has been represented through a range of texts created by <b>the</b> International <b>Marketing</b> <b>Council.</b> These texts included a Website, a Passport and a television Advertisement. The study focused on how the campaign constructs South African identities through a choice of specific images. The use of particular South African images and identities lead to the creation of an image and an identity for the country, which resulted in South Africa being commoditised. The campaign thus tries to promote South Africa {{as if it were a}} product that could be advertised and sold to a public. The intension of <b>the</b> International <b>Marketing</b> <b>Council’s</b> campaign is to build a positive image for South Africa. The study found that the campaign operates through the use of positive messages built on positive themes and hence creates a positive image for South Africa as a place of hope where there is a possibility of a better life for all...|$|R
