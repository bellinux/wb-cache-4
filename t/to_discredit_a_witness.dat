500|$|In November 1967, Gittings and Kameny worked {{together}} as co-counsel in hearings {{held by the}} Department of Defense <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> <b>an</b> expert <b>witness</b> named Dr. Charles Socarides, who testified that homosexuals could be converted to heterosexuality, and to call in question the policy held by the Department of Defense that homosexual employees could be fired for being named as homosexuals. [...] "Publicity was the objective", Gittings recalled many years later. Kameny and Gittings dressed conservatively, but wore buttons that said [...] "Gay is Good" [...] and [...] "Pray for Sodomy." [...] "We held press conferences {{for the benefit of}} sharp-eyed reporters. When we first went into a hearing room, we made certain to shake hands with all ... participants so (they) could not avoid reading our buttons. Although neither was an attorney, {{at the end of their}} cross-examination, the Department of Defense removed Socarides from their lists of expert witnesses.|$|R
5000|$|Again in 1960, when Anna Anderson {{took her}} {{case to the}} Hamburg Courts, Boodts decided {{to make her own}} claims public. In an {{interview}} with United Press International, Boodts insisted that she had seen [...] "her sister Anastasia" [...] executed at Yekaterinberg, and had now come forward in <b>an</b> effort <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> the [...] "impostor" [...] in Germany. She further stated that she was considering legal action of her own against Anderson, and was willing to [...] "step into the Hamburg Courts to unmask her". [...] Boodts, at that time was very aware that her benefactor, Prince Sigismund of Prussia, was also a firm supporter of Anderson's claims. Indeed, some of Anderson's strongest opponents (including Lord Mountbatten) cited Prince Sigismund's support of Boodts <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> him as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> in the Anderson case. [...] For her own part, Anderson herself once admitted, in a taped interview with journalist Alexis Milukoff, that there was a possibility that Boodts may indeed be her [...] "sister". [...] The two women, however, never met.|$|R

5000|$|In sum “Facts Counts” {{identifies}} {{a handful}} of trivial errors in a 112,000 word text, supplies many similar errors of its own, adds blatant falsehoods, misrepresents differences of opinion as matters of fact, and indulges in numerous ad hominem assaults on its author including the claim that he is “sloppy in the extreme” and that his work is characterized by inaccuracies, distortions, and manipulations of fact - including false statements, mischaracterizations of professors’ views, broad claims unsupported by facts and selective omissions of information that does not fit his argument.” On examination, none of these charges is sustained. Simply stated, “Facts Count” is an intellectually sleazy and inept attempt <b>to</b> <b>discredit</b> <b>a</b> book whose opinions the authors dislike.|$|R
