5|$|The {{game has}} local two-player {{multiplayer}} with a divided iPad screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete. Players spin a wheel {{at the beginning}} of their turn to determine how many hazards they get to place via drag and drop. A few of the items are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or in-app purchases. Gasketball uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot, who provides a <b>tutorial</b> and resets the ball. It was released as free-to-play with the <b>tutorial</b> unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.|$|E
5|$|A demo for the game, {{featuring}} a <b>tutorial</b> {{and a third}} of the first mission, was released on August 2, 1999. Nine days later, System Shock 2 was shipped to retailers. An enhancement patch was released a month later and added significant features, such as co-operative multiplayer and control over weapon degradation and enemy respawn rates. A port was planned for the Dreamcast but was canceled.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} nature of collaboration in writing center <b>tutorials.</b> A case study examined fifteen <b>tutorials</b> between graduate tutors and undergraduate students to try {{to determine how much}} collaboration occurs in <b>tutorials.</b> Information about their perspectives of and satisfaction with these <b>tutorials</b> was gathered from the participating tutors and students and compared to the data gathered from the <b>tutorials.</b> The data from the <b>tutorials</b> showed that the tutors were not as highly collaborative as they believed themselves to be. Focus groups and interviews revealed these beliefs and perceptions and also showed that these tutors, all of whom received almost identical training, each held different definitions of collaboration and how it should be practiced in writing center <b>tutorials.</b> Surveys of the students who participated in the <b>tutorials</b> showed that they perceived their <b>tutorials</b> as being collaborative. These surveys also showed that the students were satisfied with the help they received. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{software}} {{has become}} essential in engineering/technical graphics classes, {{the need to}} find efficient ways of teaching the software has become important. One method used for software instruction has been software <b>tutorials.</b> Although <b>tutorials</b> are frequently available from software manufacturers, they do not always {{meet the needs of}} a particular course or adhere to good pedagogical practices; therefore, instructors often resort to creating <b>tutorials</b> to use in their courses. Since students are frequently asked to complete <b>tutorials</b> outside of class, <b>tutorials</b> need to be efficient and effective as teaching tools. This requires the creator of the <b>tutorials</b> to take in to consideration several issues, in particular student learning styles and background experiences. As <b>tutorials</b> are increasing delivered over the Internet, additional issues become important in construction of <b>tutorials</b> delivered this way. This paper will discuss issues and some appropriate practices when creating software <b>tutorials</b> that are delivered through the web. The paper will also discuss some of the lessons learned by the author when she created two web-based <b>tutorials</b> for AutoCAD Release 14 and 2000 i...|$|R
5|$|In 1936 Madgwick was {{a visiting}} Harbison-Higginbotham Scholar at the University of Melbourne. The same year, Madgwick took an {{appointment}} {{as a senior}} lecturer in economic history at the University of Sydney. In this capacity, Madgwick frequently worked with the university's department of <b>tutorial</b> classes and helped found the Sydney University Lecturers' Association. In 1937, he accepted appointment as Secretary of the Sydney University Extension Board (SUEB), which focused on adult education in surrounding communities, including lectures, <b>tutorial</b> classes, and study circles. Madgwick held the position until 1940, often travelling to rural communities in the Northern Rivers and New England areas of New South Wales to present lectures. Many of the lectures {{took place at the}} New England University College (later to become the University of New England) campus in Armidale.|$|E
5|$|Like {{traditional}} role-playing games, Kingdom Hearts {{features an}} experience point system that determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player characters gain experience and grow stronger, {{gaining access to}} new abilities. Unlike other games of its type, Kingdom Hearts allows a degree of character development customization through a short <b>tutorial</b> found {{at the beginning of}} the game. The <b>tutorial</b> allows the player to select from one of three main attributes―strength, defense, or magic―for Sora to excel in and one to lack in. By choosing certain options, the player may manipulate how Sora learns abilities, grows statistically, and gains levels. Donald, Goofy, and any other additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic, while Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Campaign of William Wallace {{acts as a}} <b>tutorial</b> campaign, {{much like}} the {{original}} Age of Empires game, and emphasises on how to move units, collect and gather resources, obtain and store holy relics and defeat the enemy, which in this Campaign is presented as the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, commanded by the evil, torturous but skilled commander Edward Longshanks.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: This {{research}} users inferential statistical {{tests to}} explore the statistical significance of observed relationships between the frequencies of elements of online <b>tutorials</b> found within the academic literature, and the frequencies of those same elements as found in online <b>tutorials</b> produced by New Zealand and Australian university libraries. Frequencies were also compared between Australian and New Zealand <b>tutorials,</b> and also between two types of <b>tutorials.</b> Method: Elements of online <b>tutorials</b> were located in articles from highly ranked journals, and other germane sources. A content analysis of a sample of online <b>tutorials</b> was carried out, using the elements identified as criteria. Findings and conclusion: No statistically {{significant differences were found}} between the frequencies of elements in the literature and elements in the online <b>tutorials,</b> despite descriptive statistics indicating otherwise. A slight positive correlation was found between the frequencies of elements in <b>tutorials</b> produced in the two different countries. However, the small size of the literature sample severely restricts the conclusiveness of these results...|$|R
5|$|The {{game has}} no pause feature or motion controls, {{and there is}} no formal <b>tutorial.</b> Hidden between the puzzles are a few ciphers—incomprehensible text to be decoded through {{substitution}} cipher and other methods. The endless mode unlocks when the 100 puzzles are complete, and features a series of randomly generated levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} {{emphasized}} gameplay for the player to learn without <b>tutorial</b> and storytelling {{that did not}} interrupt the play experience. Compared to the previous game, the developers wanted Lara Croft Go puzzles to have fewer elements and be completely visible without scrolling, such that the player could see puzzles in their entirety and focus instead on solving for the correct sequence. The camera also follows Croft rather than remaining stationary.|$|E
5|$|While FireRed and LeafGreen are remakes of Red and Green (Pokémon Green {{was only}} {{released}} in Japan, whereas the American version was Blue), they contain usability enhancements {{such as a}} contextual <b>tutorial</b> feature which allows players to look up data {{at any point in}} the game. Additionally, when continuing a saved game, players are shown the last four actions they performed, allowing them to remember what they were doing.|$|E

5|$|A {{demonstration}} of the game was released on 26 June 2002, featuring <b>tutorial</b> missions and a full single-player mission. The game was released on 19 August in North America and on 30 August in Europe. The Creative Assembly released a patch on 5 November 2002, which was targeted to fix the several bugs that were still present in the game. A new historical battle based on the Battle of Stamford Bridge was later released by The Creative Assembly, made available through Wargamer.|$|E
5|$|An initial demo of {{the game}} was made {{available}} in August 2007 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. This demo included cutscenes to introduce the player to Rapture, the game's <b>tutorial</b> section, and its first levels; the demo also included weapons, plasmids, and tonics {{that would otherwise be}} introduced later in the full title, as to give the player more of the features that would be found in the published game. The Xbox demo was the fastest demo at that time to reach one million downloads on the Xbox Live service. The full game was released for these platforms on August 21, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} <b>tutorial</b> {{teaching}} for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E
40|$|<b>Tutorials</b> {{can help}} users {{learn how to}} use library {{technology}} or explore unique A/V collections independently, but their success rests in design, organization, and implementation. This presentation breaks <b>tutorials</b> into their constituent parts and offers advice and strategies for implementing the best possible design for libraries. After creating dozens of YouTube <b>tutorials</b> at Winona State University, Stewart Van Cleve offers advice on: selecting which <b>tutorials</b> to make; designing title cards; integrating live links into YouTube Videos; closed captioning; selecting the right recording and video production equipment; integrating social media; digitizing historic audiovisual material and uploading it; understanding YouTube formatting and analytics; and incorporating <b>tutorials</b> into your library 2 ̆ 7 s existing web landscape. In addition, the presentation explores unsuccessful <b>tutorials</b> and potential reasons for their unpopularity, giving participants the opportunity to avoid similar mistakes and ensure that their foray into <b>tutorials</b> is as smooth and impactful as possible...|$|R
50|$|SOPHIA.org {{has more}} than 34,000 free, short-form <b>tutorials</b> {{developed}} by over 6,000 teachers including 50 developed by Bill Nye The Science Guy and <b>tutorials</b> developed by physicians at the Mayo Clinic.

50|$|Throughout the game, {{there are}} other short Kung Fu <b>tutorials</b> with Po. However, these <b>tutorials</b> are {{different}} from the first, because in the <b>tutorials,</b> there is usually a minion of Shen or the Komodo dragons for Po to fight to show an example for the player.|$|R
5|$|Combat in {{the game}} is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of {{missions}} beginning after an opening <b>tutorial.</b> The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat. In ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via the pause menu {{in order to use}} their different weapons. The characters use physical attacks using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical attacks are used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies. The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.|$|E
5|$|During these missions, {{objectives}} and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects and environments in the game. The <b>tutorial</b> system used to demonstrate routine gameplay {{elements such as}} object interaction and movement is disguised as the first level of Gravity Bone. Here, the player is tasked with the delivery of a contaminated drink to an unspecified non-player character. After the first level is completed, the player {{is sent to the}} second level of the game, which follows the pattern of the first; the player is assigned a set of actions and goals involving platforming sequences.|$|E
5|$|Kalata and Snelgrove {{thought that}} Puzzle de Call {{featured}} interesting ideas, {{but that there}} was not anything special about it. They enjoyed how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting. Famitsu writers thought that Card Summoner rules were very complex, but noted that the <b>tutorial</b> made it easy to learn.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of implementing online video-based <b>tutorials</b> to enhance student learning. Initially, these <b>tutorials</b> were developed using a software product, Camtasia, to mitigate learning differences between traditional-based classrooms versus online classes. Because online students often did not receive the same hands-on and visual learning modality that was available to students on traditional classroom settings, <b>tutorials</b> were assumed {{to level the playing field}} between these two groups. However, after two years of developing and integrating these <b>tutorials</b> into online classes, it was found that only a small minority of students were using them. Other issues were that <b>tutorials</b> took a long time to develop, and many lecturers felt they were ineffective. This case describes the reasons the <b>tutorials</b> were developed, the integration process, issues raised, and implications for future development...|$|R
5|$|Music, both sacral and secular, kept {{developing}} {{during the}} Baroque period. High quality church pipe organs {{were built in}} churches from the 17th century; a fine specimen has been preserved in Leżajsk. Sigismund III supported an internationally renowned ensemble of sixty musicians. Working with that orchestra were Adam Jarzębski and his contemporary Marcin Mielczewski, chief composers of the courts of Sigismund III and Władysław IV. Jan Aleksander Gorczyn, a royal secretary, published in 1647 a popular music <b>tutorial</b> for beginners.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, {{the game}} {{received}} update 1.2 that added cloud saving, survival mode, Russian language support and Piper, a character from Fallout 4 available only for iOS version through lunchboxes. The update added a statistics page, ability to skip <b>tutorial</b> {{and a new}} gameplay feature where dwellers can loot equipment from dead raiders. Later in October, the game received a Halloween-themed update that added room decorations and outfits. The update removed the limit introduced in the previous update on number of dwellers that {{can be sent to}} explore the Wasteland.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} {{gameplay}} and system mechanics. Maxwell McGee of GameSpot credited {{the ability to}} adjust team sizes, adding that the trade-off between strength and versatility helped to accommodate a wider skill range of players. Neidel Crisan of 1UP praised the <b>tutorial</b> system for teaching beginner players about the fundamentals of the fighting game genre. Daniel Maniago of G4 complimented the custom assists, anti-infinite system, and online play, praising Reverge Labs for utilizing feedback from the fighting game community during development.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} evaluation of video <b>tutorials</b> used in a graduate level online statistics course. The evaluation focused on attitudes toward the <b>tutorials</b> and differences in academic performance between online sections that used the <b>tutorials</b> and those that did not. Attitude results were based on 78 students who completed an online survey and indicated positive perceptions of the <b>tutorials.</b> The quantitative findings were supported by narrative comments that suggested the <b>tutorials</b> were an effective component of the course. However, comparisons of sections with and without access to the <b>tutorials</b> showed {{no statistically significant difference}} with respect to academic performance. These results suggest that video presentations used as supplemental materials may provide instructional designers with a tool to create online courses that are as effective as traditional face-to-face courses...|$|R
