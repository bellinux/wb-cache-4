40|$|AbstractFriction-spinning is an {{innovative}} incremental forming process that permits the defined adjustment of material properties {{in a particularly}} precise manner. The process is characterised {{by the use of}} process elements from both metal spinning and friction welding. As the workpieces are being processed, friction sub-processes are employed to achieve self-induced heat generation. Compared with conventional spinning processes, this in-process heat treatment permits the extension of existing forming limits and allows more complex geometries to be achieved, together with defined, favourable part properties. The process thus holds a high potential for the manufacture of functionally graded workpieces, such as complex hollow parts made from <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets.</b> In order to achieve functional gradation, i. e. to influence the material properties (strength or grain size) in a defined manner, it is essential to be able to set specific temperature profiles. It would be possible to influence these profiles by selecting appropriate process parameters like the feed rate, relative motion and the coefficient of friction. The process characteristics of friction-spinning make it eminently suited to tube processing. A further approach to the manufacture of parts with functionally graded areas is the use of sheet metal blanks as another semi-finished product. The paper will present the corresponding results of basic research into the manufacture of sheet metal parts with the aid of friction-spinning. Here, the influence of significant process parameters, forming strategies and tool systems on both the course and the outcome of the friction-spinning process will be shown. In addition, the differences and correlations that exist between <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheet</b> processing will be described and discussed on the basis of parts made of <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets.</b> These parts are manufactured by the friction-spinning process employing different process strategies and tool setups...|$|R

Therefore, proteins having different side chains and structures with varying binding affinities towards metal ions can certainly be manifested in generating myriad supramolecular structures. In order to demonstrate this, we have chosen several beta-sheet lectins, such as, Horse gram lectin (DBL), Pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA), Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Allium sativum agglutinin also known as garlic lectin (ASA) and Concanavalin A (Con A) lectin, in conjunction with Zn 2 + and Cu 2 + as biologically important ions and showed that these form nanostructures, such as, open-, rolled-and stacked <b>sheets,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes.</b> The Zn 2 + induces mainly the sheets in the lectins studied so far though {{some of these are}} thin and others are thick, while some are folded and others are not.

The <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets</b> are formed from strands 7. 2 nm wide that are composed of annular subunits. The wide tubes appear to be formed by the rolling of a sheet into a cylinder in which the 7. 2 -nm strands are inclined with a pitch of 26 - 33 degrees and have a left-handed orientation. In addition to the strong reflections corresponding to the 7. 2 -nm spacings generated by the strands, optical diffraction patterns also showed weak reflections that could be indexed on a lattice corresponding to real-space lattice constants of 7. 6 nm and 5. 3 nm, with an included angle of 71 degrees.

40|$|The Burgers vortex (Burgers 1948) is {{described}} by an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in which the effects of uniform axisymmetric stretching are in equilibrium with viscous diffusion. Burgers introduced this vortex as ‘a mathematical model illustrating the theory of turbulence’, and he noted particularly that the vortex had the property {{that the rate of}} viscous dissipation per unit length of vortex was independent of viscosity in the limit of vanishing viscosity (i. e. high Reynolds number). This is of course an attractive feature in the light of Kolmogorov’s theory of turbulence, in which the rate of dissipation of energy per unit volume E and the kinematic viscosity U are regarded as independent variables. The idea that the small-scale structures of turbulence might be repre-sentable in terms of a random distribution of vortex sheets or tubes was taken up by Townsend (1951). Townsend showed that a random distribu-tion of vortex sheets would give rise to an energy spectrum proportional to k- 2 (multiplied by an exponential viscous cut-off factor) this power-law reflecting the fact that on any straight line through the field of turbulence, intersecting a finite number of vortex sheets, there will be (in the limit of vanishing viscosiby) a finite number of discontinuities of velocity per unit length. A random distribution of vortex tubes gave rise to a power-law k-’ (again modified by an exponential cut-off), this slower fall-off with k being associated with the more singular behaviour in physical space associated with a line vortex. The Kolmogorov spectrum k- 5 / 3 lies tantalisingly between k- l and k- 2, suggesting that the typical (or generic) structures in x-space which may be responsible for such a spectrum should involve some compromise between <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets,</b> for example spiral structures (Lundgren 1982, Gilbert 1988), these possibly arising through the interaction of <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheet...</b>|$|R
