5|$|United faced Liverpool {{at home in}} the {{following}} round, where the visitors took the lead from a Michael Owen header inside three minutes. In spite of creating plenty of goalscoring chances, the team failed to equalise until the 86th minute, when Yorke scored off a Beckham free kick. In the second minute of stoppage time, Ole Gunnar Solskjær hit a shot that sent Liverpool goalkeeper David James <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> give United the win.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make it 5–5. Giggs was next {{up and he}} was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|Van Nistelrooy {{took the}} first penalty for Manchester United, {{in front of the}} United fans, and sent Lehmann <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> give United the early advantage. Lauren then {{converted}} the next penalty for Arsenal, before Scholes stepped up to take United's second, only to see it saved by Lehmann, diving low to his right. The next six penalties were all scored – Ljungberg, Van Persie and Cole for Arsenal, Ronaldo, Rooney and Keane for Manchester United – leaving Vieira with the opportunity to win the FA Cup for his team. Although Carroll guessed the correct way to dive, Vieira's kick was just out of his reach, giving Arsenal their 10th FA Cup.|$|E

25|$|The letters also stigmatise Pitt's actions {{towards a}} peace with France as appeasing the French nation, which was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> act in Burke's view. Burke was {{confident}} that the war against France was waged against what Revolutionary France represented, and that the English were not fighting against the French nation but against the revolutionaries that were spreading an ideology. In the third letter, Burke mentions that the French had a fleet that could have sent troops into Ireland and aid the Irish in rebelling against Britain. The French, {{at the same time}} that they stated that they wanted to continue negotiating peace were sending troops to invade. As such, Burke hints at a possible impeachment of Pitt for seeking peace with France.|$|E
25|$|Rutten found {{a measure}} of {{redemption}} after the upset loss by choking out expert grappler and King of Pancrase Tournament Finalist Manabu Yamada in his next fight, on January 26, 1995. Rutten {{was taken to the}} ground, but he clamped an arm triangle choke from half guard and exerted such a pressure that Yamada, refusing to tap out, was choked out and remained unconscious with his eyes wide open after the hold. Thanks to this performance against the tournament finalist, Rutten received a rematch and a title shot against tournament winner and then current King of Pancrase Ken Shamrock for the King of Pancrase title on March 10. The match was very anticipated, but it ended early when Shamrock executed a kneebar and forced Rutten to submit. According to the Dutch, the loss was due to his training partner Funaki teaching him <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> escape a kneebar, which made Rutten spin in the opposite direction giving a tighter hold for Shamrock. After this failure, Rutten focused on grappling even harder and started training 2 to 3 times a day solely on submissions.|$|E

25|$|Reverse swing {{tends to}} be {{stronger}} than normal swing, and to occur late in the ball's trajectory. This gives it a very different character from normal swing, and because batsmen experience it less often, they generally find {{it much more difficult}} to defend against. It is also possible for a ball to swing normally in its early flight, and then to alter its swing as it approaches the batsman. This can be done in two ways one for the ball to reverse its direction of swing, giving it an 'S' trajectory: the other is for it to adopt a more pronounced swing in the same direction in which the swing is already curving; either alteration can be devastating for the batsman. In the first instance, he is already committed to playing the swing one way, which will be <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> address swing which is suddenly coming from the opposite direction: in the second instance, his stance will be one which is appropriate for the degree, or extent, of the expected swing, and which could suddenly leave him vulnerable to LBW, being caught behind, or bowled. Two consecutive deliveries from Wasim Akram, one of each type, were considered to be the turning point of the 1992 World Cup Final.|$|E
25|$|By March 2011, {{the market}} share of OS X in North America had {{increased}} to slightly over 14%. Whether {{the size of the}} Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published {{in the first quarter of}} 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, with 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.|$|E

[...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald however was more critical of the episode, explaining that [...] "Carell is a fearless actor, but he can't stop a train wreck. The B-story is better, as Jim decides to prank Pam by coaching Andy on just <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> woo the receptionist.

500|$|The Simpsons {{takes place}} in the fictional American town of Springfield in an unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state. The show is {{intentionally}} evasive in regard to Springfield's location.

Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up. The name [...] "Springfield" [...] is a common one in America and appears in 22 states. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series Father Knows Best.

500|$|The most {{controversial}} {{decision of the}} match came in the 73rd minute as {{it led to the}} opening goal. Touré's clearance presented United the chance to break in numbers and Rooney, at the heart of their attack, reached the penalty area only to go down under Campbell's challenge. Riley awarded United a penalty, despite Campbell seeming to withdraw from the tackle and Rooney [...] "...already heading for the turf as the defender pulled his foot away," [...] wrote Kevin McCarra in his match report for The Guardian. Van Nistelrooy converted his penalty kick, sending Lehmann <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> give United the lead. Arsenal responded hastily, but looked more susceptible to United's counter-attacks. Cole's sliding tackle on Cristiano Ronaldo near the penalty area was deemed acceptable by Riley, as he waved away appeals for another penalty. The defender came close to equalising minutes before the end, but for his shot to go wide. In stoppage time, United added their second goal of the match as substitutes Louis Saha and Alan Smith combined to set up Rooney, who finished a counter-attacking move with a tap-in past Lehmann.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study on a hypocrite's failure in {{reaching}} his aim as seen through the major characters of Moliere's Tartuffe.
