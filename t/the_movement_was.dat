5|$|Christians {{from many}} traditions were critical, saying <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> hyper-emotional, misused Scripture and lost focus on Christ by overemphasizing the Holy Spirit. Within {{a short time}} ministers were warning their congregations {{to stay away from}} the Azusa Street Mission. Some called the police and tried to get the {{building}} shut down.|$|E

5|$|The Chartists {{were active}} {{for the next}} eight months but the poor {{attendance}} at a second meeting, held on the moor {{at the same time}} as a racing fixture on 25 May 1839, signalled the end of the movement.

5|$|After the Japanese {{occupation}} of Sarawak ended in 1945, the last Rajah of Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke, decided to cede {{the state as}} part of the British crown colony. This proposal had met with fierce opposition from the Sarawakians which later developed into the anti-cession movement of Sarawak. Rosli Dhobi was a Sarawak nationalist from Sibu {{and a member of the}} Malay Youth Movement (Gerakan Pemuda Melayu) where the main objective of <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> to achieve Sarawak independence from the British rule. At the age of 17, he assassinated Sir Duncan George Stewart, the second governor of colonial Sarawak on 3 December 1949. He and three of his friends (Awang Ramli Amit, Bujang Suntong, and Morshidi Sidek) were then sentenced to death by hanging and were buried at the Kuching Central Prison on 2 March 1950.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Philippine Sakdalista <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> {{founded by}} <b>the</b> writer Benigno Ramos in 1930. The name of <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> derived from <b>the</b> Tagalog word [...] "Sakdal", which means, [...] "to accuse". <b>The</b> <b>movement’s</b> {{platform}} <b>was</b> centered upon immediate independence, estate redistribution, taxation reductions, and greater governmental transparency. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> lasted until 1935, when the Sakdalista leaders organized an active uprising that quickly failed, causing {{the party to}} dissolve. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have had 20,000 formal members that influenced {{hundreds of thousands of}} Filipinos in the early 1930s.|$|R

5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|All three {{leaders were}} the descendents of Hova {{who had been}} {{politically}} prominent in the former Merina royal court. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> pacifist, and while it sought independence for Madagascar, it embraced the French vision of the island {{as part of the}} global Francophone economic and cultural community. Their platform garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly. The Malagasy deputies submitted a bill to liberate Madagascar from French rule, but French deputies rejected it.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> particularly strong following {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E

5|$|During {{his tenure}} at Beth Israel, Plotkin was heavily {{involved}} in Phoenix's Jewish and non-Jewish communities. He was a strong Zionist at Hebrew Union College, {{at a time when}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> unpopular there, and was later a staunch supporter of Israel. He was an advocate for civil rights, and a supporter of the arts. He founded the Jewish Studies program at Arizona State University and taught there, and volunteered for 25 years as a chaplain at Phoenix Veterans Hospital. In 1972, the National Conference of Christians and Jews awarded him the National Award for Brotherhood.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, Britain intervened and {{returned}} {{control of the}} Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its incorporation into the global, and particularly European, economic pattern of growth. The beneficiaries of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a new layer within the Arab elite. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration and {{the revival of the}} Hebrew language and culture. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> publicly supported by Great Britain during World War I with the Balfour Declaration of 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the {{nationalist}} McGill français movement demanded that McGill become francophone, pro-nationalist, and pro-worker. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> led by Stanley Gray, {{a political science}} professor (and possibly unaware of government plans after the recent (1968) legislation founding the Université du Québec) A demonstration was held of 10,000 trade unionists, leftist activists, CEGEP students, and even some McGill students, at the university's Roddick Gates on March 28, 1969. Protesters saw English as the privileged language of commerce. McGill, where Francophones comprised only three percent of the students, could be seen as the force maintaining economic control by Anglophones of a predominantly French-speaking province. However, the majority of students and faculty opposed such a position.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1950s, {{development}} of highways and new housing led to movement of middle class to suburbs in West Omaha. Some of <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> designated as white flight from racial unrest in the 1960s. Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents {{who were more}} established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are gated communities or have become edge cities. Recently, Omahans have made strides to revitalize the downtown and Midtown areas with the re{{development of}} the Old Market, Turner Park, Gifford Park, and the designation of the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District.|$|E
