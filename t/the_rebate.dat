40|$|In this essay, {{written for}} a {{symposium}} on the centennial {{anniversary of the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Standard Oil decision, I reexamine the costjustification question.

In the second part, I review the evidence of claimed efficiencies passed on to the railroads. I conclude that there is evidence that Standard Oil passed along significant cost savings to the railroads and that these savings could have justified a portion of <b>the</b> <b>rebates</b> and drawbacks. However, I conclude that {{there is little or no}} evidence that <b>the</b> <b>rebates</b> were proportional to the magnitude of the savings-which is the critical question. Moreover, elements in the structure and timing of <b>the</b> <b>rebates</b> and drawbacks seem more consistent with a story of exclusion than with cost justification...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the Chinese {{government}} has frequently changed the value added tax (VAT) refund levels offered to exporters. Indeed, China’s VAT {{system is not}} neutral, in particular because the exporters may not receive complete refund of the domestic VAT paid on their inputs. This paper investigates how changes in <b>the</b> VAT <b>rebates</b> affect export performance in China. Our empirical analysis relies on export volume data at the HS 6 product level over the 2003 - 12 period. To address potential endogeneity, we exploit an eligibility rule that disqualifies processingtrade with supplied materials from <b>the</b> <b>rebates.</b> We find that the adjustments to <b>the</b> VAT <b>rebates</b> have significant repercussions on the exported volume: a one percentage point increase in <b>the</b> VAT <b>rebate</b> {{can lead to a}} 7 % increase in export volumes. This magnitude allows to better understand the strong resistance of China’s exports amid the global recession...|$|R

25|$|Commodore {{sold the}} C64 {{not only through}} its network of {{authorized}} dealers, but also through department stores, discount stores, toy stores and college bookstores. The C64 had a built-in RF modulator and thus could be plugged into any television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the Atari 2600. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 can also output a composite video signal (avoiding the RF modulator) that can be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's NTSC output capability also includes separate luminance/chroma signal output equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) S-Video, for connection to the Commodore 1702 monitor, providing even better video quality than a composite signal. Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered {{to have been a}} major catalyst in the North American video game crash of 1983. In January 1983, Commodore offered a $100 rebate in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone that traded in another video game console or computer. To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a Timex Sinclair 1000 for as little as $10 with purchase of a C64, so the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect <b>the</b> <b>rebate,</b> and pocket the difference; Timex Corporation departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a price war with the major home computer manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to the exit from the field of Texas Instruments and other smaller competitors.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses tax <b>rebate</b> {{payments}} from <b>the</b> 2008 economic stimulus {{to estimate the}} effect of a one-time change in income on three measures of subjective well-being: life satisfaction, health satisfaction, and affect. The income effect is identified by exploiting the plausibly exogenous variation in the payment schedule of <b>the</b> <b>rebates.</b> Using both ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares estimators, I find that <b>the</b> <b>rebates</b> had a large and positive impact on affect, which is explained by a reduction in feelings of stress and worry. For life satisfaction and health satisfaction, there is weaker evidence of a positive impact. Overall, the results show that a temporary increase in liquidity may enhance emotional well-being and that this effect is relatively stronger for low-income respondents...|$|R
40|$|Several {{incentive}} {{systems are}} examined that provide rebates on vehicles with higher-than-average fuel efficiency and levy fees on vehicles with less efficiency. <b>The</b> <b>rebates</b> and fees {{are applied to}} new vehicles {{at the time of}} purchase, and the rates are set such that the total outlay for <b>rebates</b> equals <b>the</b> revenues from fees. We find that moderately-sized rebates and fees result in a substantial increase in average fuel efficiency. Most of the effect is due to manufacturers' incorporating more fuel-efficiency technologies into the vehicles that they offer, since <b>the</b> <b>rebates</b> and fees effectively lower the price to manufacturers of these technologies. Consumer surplus is found to rise, and the profits of domestic manufacturers are estimated to drop only slightly under most systems and actually to rise under one system. ...|$|R

500|$|Income earned {{and saved}} {{would not be}} taxed until spent under the proposal. [...] Households at the extreme high end of {{consumption}} often finance their purchases out of savings, not income. Economist Laurence Kotlikoff states that the FairTax could make the tax system much more progressive and generationally equitable, and argues that taxing consumption is effectively the same as taxing wages plus taxing wealth. [...] A household of three persons (this example will use two adults plus one child; <b>the</b> <b>rebate</b> does not consider marital status) spending $30,000 a year on taxable items would devote about 3.4% of total spending (/$30,000 spending) to the FairTax after <b>the</b> <b>rebate.</b> The same household spending $125,000 on taxable items would spend around 18.3% (/$125,000 spending) on the FairTax. [...] At higher spending levels, <b>the</b> <b>rebate</b> has less impact and the rate approaches 23% of total spending. [...] Thus, according to economist Laurence Kotlikoff, the effective tax rate is progressive on consumption.|$|E
500|$|A household's {{effective}} {{tax rate}} on consumption would vary with the annual expenditures on taxable items and the fixed monthly tax rebate. <b>The</b> <b>rebate</b> would have the greatest effect at low spending levels, where they could lower a household's effective rate to zero or below. The lowest {{effective tax rate}} under the FairTax could be negative due to <b>the</b> <b>rebate</b> for households with annual spending amounts below poverty level spending for a specified household size. At higher spending levels, <b>the</b> <b>rebate</b> has less impact, and a household's effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending. A person spending at the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 0%, whereas someone spending at four times the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 17.2%. Buying or otherwise receiving items and services not subject to federal taxation (such as a used home or car) can contribute towards a lower effective tax rate. The total amount of spending {{and the proportion of}} spending allocated to taxable items would determine a household's effective tax rate on consumption. [...] If a rate is calculated on income, instead of the tax base, the percentage could exceed the statutory tax rate in a given year.|$|E
500|$|As {{defined in}} the {{proposed}} legislation, the tax rate is 23% for the first year. [...] This percentage {{is based on the}} total amount paid including the tax ($23 out of every $100 spent in total). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. sales tax ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total). The rate would automatically adjust annually based on federal receipts in the previous fiscal year. With <b>the</b> <b>rebate</b> taken into consideration, the FairTax would be progressive on consumption, but would also be regressive on income at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income). [...] Opponents argue this would accordingly decrease the tax burden on high-income earners and increase it on the middle class. Supporters contend that the plan would effectively tax wealth, increase purchasing power and decrease tax burdens by broadening the tax base.|$|E
