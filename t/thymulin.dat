40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} evidences suggest that thymic endocrine function is modulated by the neuroendocrine network {{and in particular}} by growth hormone. The plasma of <b>thymulin</b> has been found reduced in congenital hypopituitarism and increased in acromegalic conditions {{when compared with the}} values observed in age-matched controls. In the present paper we have investigated in congenital GH-deficient children the effect of one year therapy with GH on the plasma level of <b>thymulin,</b> IGF- 1 and plasma zinc; this last parameter has been checked because zinc is required for <b>thymulin</b> activity and modulates IGF- 1 production. The basal <b>thymulin</b> and IGF- 1 values are lower in GH deficient children than age-matched controls whereas zinc levels show a slight reduction.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Thymulin</b> is a neuroendocrine hormone with immunoregulatory actions. Originally {{known as}} ‘serum thymic factor ’ (FTS), <b>thymulin</b> binds to a carrier protein and zinc (Zn 2 +) to exert its {{biologic}} properties. <b>Thymulin,</b> albeit an es-sential hormone for the T lymphocyte differentiation and the normalization of {{the ratio of}} T-helper cells to suppressor cells, accumulating evidence suggests its involvement in inflammations of various etiologies. Recently, <b>thymulin</b> {{has been shown to}} have anti-nociceptive effects in hyperalgesia and in pain of neurogenic origin, ostensibly through action on sen-sory afferents and the release of anti-inflammatory mediators. Given its anti-inflammatory potential, <b>thymulin</b> downregu-lates the release of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, upregulates anti-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL) - 10, and exerts molecular control via the regulation of transcription factors and mediators. Recent evidence tends to indicate that <b>thymulin</b> can be a therapeutic agent in many inflammatory diseases and in pathological conditions affecting the peripheral and/or the central nervous system. This review discusses current concepts in the anti-inflammatory actions of <b>thymulin</b> and correlates this activity with an emerging theme for therapeutic treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{immunomodulatory}} {{activity of}} <b>thymulin</b> and related analogues in vivo {{is not well}} characterized in the CNS. We have previously provided evidence for an anti-inflammatory potential of <b>thymulin</b> in downregulating proinflammatory cytokines in a NF-B-dependent mechanism in vitro. Furthermore, we have shown that intracerebroventricular (ICV) treatment with <b>thymulin</b> in the hippocampus (HC) reduced the nuclear localization and activation of NF-B, an effect mediated by the IB-α/pIB- α pathway in vivo. ICV stereotaxic injection of endotoxin (ET) differentially upregulated the nuclear translocation /expression of NF-B 1 (p 50), NF-B 2 (p 52), RelA (p 65), RelB (p 68) and c-Rel (p 75) in the HC. Pretreatment with <b>thymulin</b> followed by ET exposure reduced the nuclear translocation of NF-B subunits. The anti-inflammatory effect of <b>thymulin</b> seems to be mediated via the IB- pathway since <b>thymulin</b> downregulated ET-induced phosphorylation of IB-. Stereotaxic pretreatment with synthetic peptide analogue of <b>thymulin</b> (PAT) reduced the nuclear translocation of NF-B subunits, an effect mediated by downregulating the phosphorylation of IB-.

40|$|The thymus {{produces}} humoral {{factors that}} induce proliferation and differentiation of T-cells, which {{are responsible for}} cell-mediated immunity. Recent data in animals suggest that such thymic hormone activity is modulated by the neuroendocrine network and, in particular, by thyroid hormones, but no information is presently available in humans. To study this question, we measured the circulating thymic factor called <b>thymulin</b> (Zn-FTS) in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid patients. <b>Thymulin</b> levels were higher in hyperthyroid patients than in normal subjects, whereas hypothyroid patients had lower <b>thymulin</b> levels than normal subjects. A significant correlation was found between circulating <b>thymulin</b> and serum T 4 and T 3 levels. <b>Thymulin</b> changes could be reversed by appropriate treatment in both groups of patients.

40|$|Abnormalities in {{the immune}} system and zi nc {{homeostasis}} in patients with P-thalassemia major (TM) have been reported. Since zinc ion is essential for the efficiency of {{the immune system}} and is required to induce biological activity to <b>thymulin</b> (Zn-FTS), a biochemically defined thymic hormone, we investigated the plasma levels of zinc and both active <b>thymulin</b> (Zn-FTS) and total zinc saturable <b>thymulin</b> (Zn-FTS+FTS) in 18 patients with TM aged between 2 and 31 years and 22 normal controls of the same age, Inhibitory molecules anti-thymulin and the distribution of lymphocyte subsets were also analyzed. Patients with TM presented significantly lowered plasma zinc and <b>thymulin</b> levels when compared to normal subjects, The significant enhancement of the active form of the hormone after zinc addition in vitro suggests that low <b>thymulin</b> values found in TM are due not to a thymic failure in synthesizing and secreting the thymic hormone, but a defect in zinc saturation of the hormone.

The rosette inhibition assay by Dardenne and Bach (1975) is the only method available to evaluate the biologically active form of this hormone (<b>thymulin</b> or Zn-facteur thymique serique, Zn-FTS), as immunoassays cannot discriminate between <b>thymulin</b> and the inactive form of the hormone not containing Zn (FTS).

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Thymulin</b> (or FTS-Zn) a {{well-defined}} thymic hormone was studied in fifteen female patients hospitalized for anorexia nervosa. The circulating hormone was measured {{together with the}} plasma levels of thyroid hormones, cortisol and zinc. <b>Thymulin</b> activity determined by the rosette assay was significantly reduced in the anorexia nervosa patients compared to sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects. The patients were characterized by very depressed plasma levels of tniodothyronine (T 3) but exhibited normal concentrations of thyroxine (T 4), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), cortisol and zinc. The distribution of their peripheral lymphocyte cells into several subsets was not affected. The observed decrease of <b>thymulin</b> activity in this illness might be the consequence of thymic atrophy secondary to malnutrition and/or hormonal disturbances.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relevance}} of zinc in resistance to infections by virus, fungi and bacteria is recognized {{because of its}} pivotal role in {{the efficiency of the}} entire immune system, in particular in conferring biological activity to a thymic hormone called <b>thymulin,</b> which has differentiation properties on T-cell lines. In infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the zinc-bound form of <b>thymulin</b> (active <b>thymulin,</b> ZnFTS) is strongly reduced in stage IV of the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification) with concomitant decrements in CD 4 � cell count and zincemia values. The zinc-unbound form of <b>thymulin</b> (inactive <b>thymulin,</b> FTS) is, in contrast, very high. The in vitro addition of zinc to plasma samples induces a recovery of the <b>thymulin</b> active form, suggesting low zinc bioavailability as the cause of impaired thymic functions with consequent CD 4 � depletion. An analysis of risk factors for the incidence of recidivism opportunistic infections shows CD 4 � depletion and zinc deficiency to have significant scores. Supplementation with zinc for 1 mo (45 mg Zn 2 � /d) associated with zidovudine (AZT) therapy in stage IV induces recovery of active zinc-bound <b>thymulin,</b> of zincemia, of CD 4 � cells with concomitant reduction (50 %) of recidivism opportunistic infections compared with the AZT-treated group. Complete disappearance of recidivism by Candida aesophagea or Pneumocystis carinii is observed after supplementation with zinc.

40|$|Decreased natural killer (NK) {{activity}} {{as well as}} interleukin 2 (IL- 2) are risk factors for the progression of cervical carcinoma. NK activity and IL- 2 may be thymus controlled. Plasma levels of active <b>thymulin,</b> a zinc-dependent thymic hormone (ZnFTS), are reduced in cancer because of the low peripheral zinc bioavailability. Zinc and <b>thymulin</b> are relevant for normal immune functions. α 2 -Macroglobulin is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) against invasive tumour proliferation. Because α 2 -macroglobulin has a binding affinity (Kd) for zinc that is higher than does <b>thymulin,</b> it may {{play a key role}} in immune efficiency in cancer. Plasma samples of 22 patients (age range 35 – 60 years) with locally advanced squamous cervical carcinoma and with FIGO stage Ib 2 –IIb were examined. They showed reduced active <b>thymulin,</b> decreased NK activity and IL- 2 production, increased soluble IL- 2 receptor (sIL- 2 R) and augmented α 2 -macroglobulin in the circulation, whereas plasma zinc levels were within the normal range for age. Significant positive correlations were found between zinc or active <b>thymulin</b> and α 2 -macroglobulin (r = 0. 75, P< 0. 01, r = 0. 78, P< 0. 01, respectively) in cancer patients. In vitro zinc increases IL- 2 production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of cancer patients. These data suggest that an increase in α 2 -macroglobulin, which competes with <b>thymulin</b> for zinc binding, may be involved in causing a <b>thymulin</b> deficit with a consequent decrease of IL- 2 and NK cytotoxicity.

Plasma from 80 participants at the 12 month visit, and 40 of these same participants, randomly selected, at the baseline visit were assessed for zinc-bound active <b>thymulin</b> levels using a modification of the rosette inhibition assay. <b>Thymulin</b> activity was directly associated with CD 4 + cell count (β = 0. 127, p = 0. 002) and inversely associated with cocaine use (β = − 0. 908, p = 0. 026; R 2 = 0. 188, p = 0. 019) independent of HIV viral load, age, gender and antiretroviral use. An increase in <b>thymulin</b> activity was 1. 4 times more likely when CD 4 + cell count increased (OR = 1. 402, 95 %CI: 1. 006 – 1. 956), independent of change in viral load, antiretroviral use, and age. Participants who used cocaine consistently, were 7. 6 times less likely to have an increase in <b>thymulin</b> activity (OR = 0. 133, 95 %CI: 0. 017 – 1. 061). There was a direct correlation between change in plasma zinc and change in zinc-bound active <b>thymulin</b> (r = 0. 243, p = 0. 13).

The aim of the present work was to study the immunomodulatory mechanisms of <b>thymulin</b> 5 cH in a granuloma experimental model, by subcutaneous inoculation of BCG in mice, focusing the B- 1 cells and zinc involvement in this process. Three groups of male Balb/c SPF mice (group A treated with <b>thymulin</b> 5 cH, group B treated with <b>thymulin</b> 5 cH incubated in Chelex Ã‚Â® - a zinc chelant - and group C, control, treated with vehicle) were inoculated with BCG in the left footpad and subcutaneous granuloma and spleen were harvested for histomorphometry analysis, after 7, 14 and 21 days.

Positive cells for CD 11 b (activated phagocytes, B- 1 cells), CD 19 (B- 1 and B- 2 cells), CD 23 (negative B- 1 cells, positive B 2 cells) and CD 5 (B- 1 a cells) were analyzed in a FACS Calibur (BD) device. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal - Wallis / Dunn for nonparametric evaluations and ANOVA / Tuckey-Krammer for the parametric ones. The XÃ‚Â² method was used to evaluate the cell count in flow cytometry. P values Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Mice treated with <b>thymulin</b> 5 cH presented higher macrophage activity and increase in the follicular area were seen in spleen after 7 days.

Treatments consisted of no shipping (as unstressed controls), shipping (as stressed controls) or shipping plus two doses of <b>thymulin.</b> The shipping procedure was conducted for two consecutive days. The responses were measured in three ways. First, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMN) to respond to four different doses of the mitogen, Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), was measured. Second, antibody response to a standard antigen dose over a three week period following the stress was examined. Third, the plasma cortisol concentrations in stressed versus unstressed and in <b>thymulin</b> treated lambs were compared. There were no differences between any of the four treatment groups (p> 0. 44) with respect to the animals' lymphocyte proliferative ability. Although there were no detectable differences, caution should be used in interpreting these results, because of technical difficulties encountered with a key reagent in the assay. Antibody titers were measured at weekly intervals for each of three consecutive weeks following the stressing procedure. These results also showed no treatment effect between any of the four groups (p> 0. 39). A comparison of cortisol levels in the four groups revealed that shipping stress increased plasma cortisol concentrations, and <b>thymulin</b> treatment at either dose and on both days of shipment inhibited (p< 0. 0001 and p< 0. 047, for day one and two, respectively) that stress-induced increase in cortisol. Interestingly, these results indicate that treatment with <b>thymulin</b> was effective in negating the stress-associated increase in plasma cortisol levels in the lambs.

40|$|The nuclear factor- k B (NF- k B) is {{one member}} of a ubiquitously {{expressed}} family of Rel-related transcription factors that serve as critical regulators of proinflammatory genes. The immunomodulatory potential of <b>thymulin</b> {{and its effect on}} NF- k B in vivo, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS), is not well characterized. In this study, the role of endotoxin (ET) in regulating NF- k B was unraveled in various compartments of the CNS. Stereotaxic localization reverberated specific intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ET into the CNS, with or without pretreatment with ICV <b>thymulin.</b> Treatment with ET upregulated the expression and nuclear trans-localization of NF- k B 1 (p 50), NF- k B 2 (p 52), RelA (p 65), RelB (p 68) and c-Rel (p 75) in the hippocampus (HC), an effect abrogated by ICV pretreatment with <b>thymulin.</b> <b>Thymulin</b> modulated the phosphorylation of I k B- a in the HC by upregulating the cytosolic accumulation of I k B- a and downregulating its phosphorylation (pI k B- a). Further analysis of the DNA-binding activity revealed an upregulated activity in the HC relative to saline-constitutive expression of the RelA (p 65) subunit. ET did not induce the DNA-binding activity of NF- k B in the diencephalon (DE) or substantia nigra (SN) at various time points, when compared with baseline levels of expression. Intraperitoneal (IP) injections of ET in vivo upregulated the expression of NF- k B subunits in the liver and reduced the cytosolic accumulation of I k B- a by inducing pI k B- a. Furthermore, IP pretreatment with <b>thymulin</b> followed by ICV injection of ET attenuated/reduced the DNA-binding activity of NF- k B in the HC. These results indicate that ICV injection of ET regulates the nu clear translocation/activation of NF- k Bwithin specific compartments in the brain. <b>Thymulin</b> attenuated ET-induced response, with particular involvement of I k B- a. The in vivomolecular regulation of <b>thymulin</b> via the NF- k B pathway is critical to understanding the anti-inflammatory role of this nonapeptide and unraveling pathways associated with neuroimmune interactions mediating proinflammatory signals in the CNS. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thymulin</b> is a well-characterized {{thymic hormone}} that exists as a nonapeptide coupled to equimolar amounts of Zn 2 +. <b>Thymulin</b> {{is known to}} have {{multiple}} biological roles, including T cell differentiation, immune regulation, and analgesic functions. It has been shown that <b>thymulin</b> is produced by the reticulo-epithelial cells of the thymus, and it circulates in the blood from the moment of birth, maintain its serum level until puberty diminishing thereafter in life. To study the localization of this hormone, we prepared polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the commercial peptide and utilized immunocytochemical techniques for visualization. The results indicate that <b>thymulin</b> stains the thymic reticular cells, the outer layers of Hassall's corpuscles and a large round cellular type, which is keratin-negative and does not show affinity for the common leukocyte antigen (CD- 45). In mice, this thymulin-positive cell remains in the thymus throughout life and even appears in relatively increased numbers in old involuted thymi. It also appears in thymus-dependent areas of the spleen and lymph nodes, demonstrating {{that at least one of}} the thymus cells containing this peptide can be found in peripheral lymphoid tissue...|$|E
40|$|Protein-energy {{malnutrition}} (PEM) {{leads to}} an immune deficiency, which is now well documented. Some investigators {{have suggested that the}} associated zinc deficiency is important in thymic involution and changes in cellular immunity. To evaluate the respective roles of nutritional deficiency, infection, and zinc in the alteration of thymic function, we measured the amounts of <b>thymulin</b> (facteur thymique sérique, or FTS) and of Zn in the thymus glands of 58 Senegalese children who died in various stages of malnutrition. In the severe forms (marasmus, kwashiorkor, and marasmic kwashiorkor) the thymus was tiny and contained very little <b>thymulin.</b> The Zn content of the thymus was high whatever the nutritional state of the subject and was related significantly only to the presence of infections. In Senegalese children thymic atrophy and depleted <b>thymulin</b> content are associated with severe PEM but not systemic infection or depleted thymic Zn content. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>thymulin</b> (a thymic hormone) {{is dependent on}} the presence of zinc in the molecule. We assayed serum <b>thymulin</b> activity in three models of mildly zinc-deficient (ZD) human subjects before and after zinc supplementation: (a) two human volunteers in whom a specific and mild zinc deficiency was induced by dietary means; (b) six mildly ZD adult sickle cell anemia (SCA) subjects; and (c) six mildly ZD adult non-SCA subjects. Their plasma zinc levels were normal and they showed no overt clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. The diagnosis of mild zinc deficiency was based on the assay of zinc in lymphocytes, granulocytes, and platelets. Serum <b>thymulin</b> activity was decreased as a result of mild zinc deficiency and was corrected by in vivo and in vitro zinc supplementation, suggesting that this parameter was a sensitive indicator of zinc deficiency in humans. An increase in T 101 -, sIg-cells, decrease in T 4 +/T 8 + ratio, and decreased IL 2 activity were observed in the experimental human model during the zinc depletion phase, all of which were corrected after repletion with zinc. Similar changes in lymphocyte subpopulation, correctable with zinc supplementation, were also observed in mildly ZD SCA subjects. Inasmuch as <b>thymulin</b> is known to induce intra- and extrathymic T cell differentiation, our studies provide a possible mechanism for the role of zinc on T cell functions...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{containing}} the serum thymic factor (FTS), {{as measured by}} indirect immunofluorescence, were studied in mice either FTS depleted by injection of anti-FTS monoclonal antibodies or immunization against FTS coupled to bovine serum albumin (FTS-BSA), or FTS enriched by multiple injections of synthetic <b>thymulin</b> (FTS-Zn). Injections of <b>thymulin</b> did not significantly depress FTS secretion. Conversely, long term elimination of FTS from peripheral blood caused a great increase in the thymic intracellular content of FTS, {{as evidenced by the}} higher number of FTS containing cells observed with immunofluorescence. These data could provide the first evidence of a feed-back control of thymic endocrine function...|$|E
40|$|The {{secretory}} {{evolution of}} the thymic hormones (<b>thymulin,</b> thymosin alpha 1 and thymopoietin) in cultured thymic reticuloepithelial cells (TREC) was studied by immunocytochemical techniques using monoclonal anti-thymulin or anti-thymosin alpha 1 and polyclonal anti-thymopoietin antibodies (Ab). The culture of TREC was performed with a medium where L-valine was replaced by D-valine, thus ensuring rapid and selective development of these cells. The number of <b>thymulin,</b> thymosin alpha 1 or thymopoietin-containing cells increased progressively from Day 6 to Day 12 of the culture. The localization of the three thymic hormones within the TREC also varied according {{to the age of}} the culture. By light microscopy the staining of the three hormones was localized in some cytoplasmic granules {{at the beginning of the}} culture and at Day 90, while at Day 12 it was throughout the cytoplasm. In electron microscopy these localizations corresponded respectively to vacuoles of different sizes and to cytosol. All these results show that the synthesis and excretion of <b>thymulin,</b> thymosin alpha 1 and thymopoietin evolve during the development of TREC in culture...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of several agents applied in vivo, namely, a synthetic inhibitor of the NF-κB cascade, fat-soluble antioxidants, and the thymic peptide <b>thymulin.</b> Cytokine response in LPS-treated mice was analysed in tandem with the following parameters: the synthesis of inducible forms of the heat shock proteins HSP 72 and HSP 90 α; activity of the NF-κB and SAPK/JNK signalling pathways; and TLR 4 expression. Inflammation-bearing Balb/c male mice were pretreated with an inhibitor of IKK-α/β kinases (IKK Inhibitor XII); with thymulin; with dietary coenzyme Q 9, α-tocopherol, and β-carotene; or with combinations of the inhibitor and peptide or antioxidants. Comparable anti-inflammatory effects were observed in inflammation-bearing mice treated separately with <b>thymulin</b> or with dietary antioxidants administered daily for two weeks before LPS treatment. When LPS-injected mice were treated with the inhibitor and antioxidants together, neither plasma cytokines, signal proteins, nor heat shock proteins recovered more efficiently than when mice were treated with these agents separately. In contrast to antioxidant diet, the <b>thymulin</b> was shown to increase the effect of IKK Inhibitor XII in preventing IKK activation in LPS-treated mice...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{it was found}} that <b>thymulin</b> 5 cH (thymic hormone) can modulate immune processes in several diseases. Additionally, the Antimonium crudum has used in dogs bearing leishmaniosis, according to the similia principle. We studied the inflammatory and immune modulation by <b>thymulin</b> 5 CH and Antimonium crudum 30 CH treatment in mice experimentally inoculated with Leishmania (L.) amazonensis. Male adult Balb/c mice were inoculated with Leishmania (2 x 105 promastigotes) into the footpad to induce inflammatory response and peritoneum and spleen cells were evaluated by flow cytometry after 60 days. Animals were divided in 3 groups (n= 10) : <b>thymulin</b> 5 cH, Antimonium crudum 30 cH and vehicle /control. Treatment was made in blind, daily, in water/alcohol 30 % diluted 1 : 2500 in drinking water, during all experimental period. CD 11 b (activated phagocytes and B 1 cells), CD 19 (B 1 cells and B 2), CD 4 and CD 8 (effective T lymphocytes) markers were used to identify immune cells subsets in peritoneal washing fluid and spleen cell suspension. Mice treated with <b>thymulin</b> 5 cH presented increase in peritoneal and spleen B 1 stem cells (X 2 = 0. 0001) and higher CD 8 +/CD 4 + ratio in spleen, regarding to the control. Also, Antimonium crudum 30 CH induced a mild increase in B 1 cells in peritoneum and spleen (both X 2, p= 0. 0001). Further histological analysis of the primary lesion will be done in the next step, to elucidate the impact of these findings in the disease evolution. The results show that both treatments stimulate B 1 stem cell proliferation and suggest the cooperation of T spleen lymphocytes in the process...|$|E
