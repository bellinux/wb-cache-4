5|$|An urban {{veterinarian}} named Sathyajith {{arrives in}} the village <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> {{falls in love with}} Mayil. Mayil, believing that Sathyajith is the man for her, falls in love with him, to the point of refusing an opportunity to attend a teacher-training course in Madras to remain with him. Despite loving Sathyajith, she does not allow him to exploit her sexually, which disappoints him. Never intending a serious relationship with Mayil, he proceeds to his native place to get married to another woman. When Mayil begs Sathyajith not to leave her, he says he befriended her for pleasure—not marriage.|$|E

5|$|From the outset, West Germany and the Allies {{rejected}} East Germany's legitimacy. The {{creation of}} East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet fait accompli, without a freely or fairly elected government. West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as applying equally to East and West German citizens. An East German who escaped or was {{released to the}} West was automatically granted West German rights including residence, the right <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> EEC freedom of movement; West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive {{to move to the}} West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E

Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear {{that they did not have}} an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E

By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 Jews had been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, but which decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E

Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including Oaklea Blue Ace, Glen Iris Boomerang and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of Butler, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.|$|E
