5|$|The Mahanoy Creek {{watershed}} is 66 percent forested land, 21 percent agricultural land, 9 percent barren mined land, and 4 percent developed land. However, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Mahanoy Creek is 50 percent forested land, 44 percent mined land, 5 percent developed land, {{and less}} than 1 percent agricultural land. There are six boroughs in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the watershed. There are a total of 28 municipalities in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek is biologically degraded, with the only exceptions being several headwater streams. However, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the watershed}} is less severely degraded than the lower reaches.|$|E
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the main sequence {{in the region of}} class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars {{in this part of the}} instability strip that intersects <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E

5|$|In {{the medieval}} period some {{religious}} institutions displayed ancient Greek coins {{of the island}} of Rhodes as specimens of the Thirty Pieces of Silver. The obverses of these coins showed a facing head of the sun god Helios, with rays projecting around <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, 4.55% of the bacteroides in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Buffalo Creek came from humans, 11.13% came from bovines, 34.74% came from pigs, and 49.58% came from other sources, such as horses. In {{the lower part of}} the creek, 1.78% came from humans, 3.78% came from bovines, 15.53% came from birds, 23.38% came from pigs, and 55.53% came from other sources, such as horses.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E

5|$|The Danville and Pottsville Railroad had a {{terminus}} in Girardville, {{a community}} of Mahanoy Creek, by 1834. The Mahanoy Creek Navigation Company formed on March 22, 1827. The Mahanoy Creek Canal ran from the Susquehanna River to the coal mines in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Mahanoy Creek. A canal running from Chester County and Lancaster County to Pittsburgh with a course going through Mahanoy Creek was planned by 1832.|$|E

5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, {{and part of}} Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro, {{and reached}} the Copa Libertadores quarter-finals and the semi-finals of Copa Mercosur, but had a bad season in the {{national}} league, the Copa João Havelange. The following year, despite a good performance in the Brasileirão with a squad that included Marques, Guilherme and Gilberto Silva, the team again was eliminated in the competition's semi-finals, eventually finishing in fourth place. Atlético then finished in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the national league table in the following two seasons, but in 2004 it barely escaped relegation. In 2005 the club was demoted to the Série B, the second level of the Brasileirão.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the waters}} of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100feet (335m).

5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins {{to pass through the}} lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E

40|$|Three most {{promising}} protection methods of pine pulp wood stacks against {{the attacks of}} Tomicus piniperda were compared. The methods were the covering of stacks by fibreglass-strengthened paper or twofold achrylene netting, removing <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> stacks, and enhanced planning of {{the placement of the}} timber store using ARC/INFO GIS-software. T. piniperda was observed to strongly prefer <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stacks: 90 % of the beetles occurred within 0. 5 meters of the top of the stacks. Covering of the stacks decreased the attack density of T. piniperda, and the protection effect of covering was 80 %. Due to long transport distances and fragmentation of forest landscape the relocation of timber store was found to be an unsuitable method in the practical level. Also, taking into account the costs of the method, removing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> stacks was considered to be the optimal solution...|$|R
