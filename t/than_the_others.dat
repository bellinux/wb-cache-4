5|$|Market Street is {{a unique}} set in the Modular Buildings series in that it has fewer than 2000 pieces and is {{recommended}} for builders 10 years and up rather than the usual 16. One of the reasons this set was smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> {{was to provide a}} lower cost entry point into the Modular Houses series.|$|E

5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three {{subspecies}}, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> and within this form {{there is a tendency}} for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen has six segments, {{the first}} five of which bear pleopods, {{although}} these may be absent or vestigial in females. The fourth pleopod is longer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> in males and has a specialized reproductory function.|$|E
5|$|Type C is the {{smallest}} type and lives in larger groups <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Its eye patch is distinctively slanted forwards, rather than parallel to the body axis. Like type B, it is primarily white and medium gray, with a dark gray dorsal cape and yellow-tinged patches. Its only observed prey is the Antarctic cod.|$|E

5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his remains to be transported back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|As {{the maids}} of honour are {{reflected}} in each other, so too do {{the king and queen}} have their doubles within the painting, in the dimly lit forms of the chaperone and guard, the two who serve and care for their daughter. The positioning of these figures sets up a pattern, one man, a couple, one man, a couple, and while the outer figures are nearer the viewer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> they all occupy the same horizontal band on the picture's surface.|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} {{to the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although {{only a few of}} those who have spinal fusion experience good results. There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E

60|$|If {{the witness}} affirmed {{that he had}} thrown any other series of numbers, supposing {{him to be a}} person of veracity, and {{tolerable}} accuracy, and to profess that he took particular notice, we should believe him. But the ten sixes are exactly as likely to have been really thrown as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> series. If, therefore, this assertion is less credible <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>the</b> reason must be, not that it is less likely <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> to be made truly, but that it is more likely <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> to be made falsely.|$|R

Of the six scheduled bouts on the undercard, two received more promotion <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> The first was a singles match, in which The Rock defeated Triple H by disqualification. The other was an eight-man elimination tag team match, which featured The Union's (Mankind, Ken Shamrock, Test, and the Big Show) victory over the Corporate Ministry (Viscera, the Big Boss Man, and the Acolytes (Bradshaw and Faarooq)).|$|E
5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be more important <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the Etna-class {{protected}} cruisers was based on that of Sir W G Armstrong Mitchell & Co.'s Elswick Works' earlier Giovanni Bausan, {{which was the first}} modern protected cruiser constructed for the Italian Navy. She proved successful enough that the Italians negotiated for a license to build copies in Italian shipyards. George Rendel and Carlo Vigna designed the ships. The first three ships varied somewhat in their displacement and engine power, and the last ship, Ettore Fieramosca, was slightly longer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} of a similar design to other local power {{stations}} at Carville and Lemington, and was a large triple-gabled brick building. However Dunston A was built several years after the other local stations, and so because of advances in power station design, was larger {{and was able to}} produce more electricity <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> The station was originally equipped with two turbo-alternators rated at 7.2megawatts (MW), made by AEG of Germany, and two turbo alternators rated at 6.25MW and 13.2MW, made by Brown Boveri of Switzerland, for a total generating capacity of 33.85MW. The turbo alternators were supplied with steam from 24coal burning Babcock & Wilcox marine water-tube boilers.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the writing}} process, several cast members would give {{suggestion}} notes to the writers {{on how to}} improve some scenes. The writers were frequently annoyed with Armitage, who gave out more notes than any other cast members, however the writers also liked some of his ideas and included them in the scripts.

5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> {{to indicate the}} entrance to the main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E
5|$|Embers of the badnjak may be {{used for}} divination in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and {{livestock}} sorts grown by the family are taken out from the ognjište and placed on the česnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> should be the most productive in the coming year. The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may be spread over the fields and mixed with fodder. Some of the ash may be set aside to be taken with water as a remedy for headache. There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.|$|E

Quicker <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> to understand that something is wrong, he confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt. In The Bronze, he meets Anya failing as a stand-up comic, and Willow and Xander (with a bloody chest wound), who warn him of their attacker.
