5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it {{out of the water and}} returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E

Hrungnir goes in, demands a drink, and becomes drunk and belligerent, stating that he will remove Valhalla and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{the land of the}} jötunn, Jötunheimr, among various other things. Eventually, the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor, who arrives. Hrungnir states that Thor is under their protection, and subsequently he can't be harmed while in Valhalla. After an exchange of words, Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel at the location of Griotunagardar, resulting in Hrungnir's death.|$|E

She tells her captors that they are headed to Mount Seleya in order to mislead them from their true destination.|$|E
5|$|Notions {{associated}} with the zduhać, vetrovnjak, and dragon man, respectively, are not identical. The dragon man fought against female demons called ala, which led hail clouds over fields to destroy crops, and consumed the fertility of the fields. The zduhaći (plural) of an area usually fought together against the attacking zduhaći of another area who were bringing a storm and hail clouds above their fields. The victorious zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes, and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their own region. The vetrovnjak, recorded in parts of western Serbia, fought against a bringer of bad weather imagined as a black bird. The zduhaći are recorded in Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, part of Bosnia, and the Sandžak region of south-western Serbia. The dragon men are recorded in eastern Serbia, Banat, western Bulgaria, and Macedonia.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the early}} 20thcentury, the Serbian badnjak {{tradition}} {{has also been}} celebrated more publicly. Before World War I, soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia developed the custom of laying a badnjak on a fire in their barracks. In the succeeding Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the military badnjak ceremony was further elaborated and standardized in army service regulations, but the tradition ended at the outbreak of World War II. Since the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve in which the badnjak plays a central role. Parishioners festively cut the sapling {{to be used as}} the badnjak and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their church, where it is consecrated by a priest before it is ceremonially placed on a fire built in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an oblique, isometric format and is set inside a haunted castle. As Sir Arthur Pendragon, the player's main objective is to collect sixteen pieces of a key before midnight, which when all connected will form {{the shape of a}} pentacle. The pieces of the pentacle are guarded by various magical creatures, some of which can be defeated by casting spells, others requiring accurately timed attacks and nimble dodging. Once a piece is obtained, the player must <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a specific chamber within the castle. Once all pentacles have been placed in their chambers, the player can establish the whereabouts of the Staff of Karnath, which must be destroyed before midnight.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock {{the gate to}} the final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or walk over lava. To use the power of a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a level and then <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular level usually requires the player to use the talisman from the next level, except for the Primagen key from the last level, which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with a little help from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E
