500|$|All of Bundy's known {{victims were}} white females, most of middle-class backgrounds. Almost all {{were between the}} ages of 15 and 25 and most were college students. He {{apparently}} never approached anyone he might have met before. (In their last conversation before his execution, Bundy told Kloepfer he had purposely stayed away from her [...] "when he felt the power of his sickness building in him.") Rule noted that most of the identified victims had long straight hair, parted in the middle—like Stephanie Brooks, the woman who rejected him, and to whom he later became engaged and then rejected in return. Rule speculated that Bundy's animosity toward his first girlfriend triggered his protracted rampage and caused him to target victims who resembled her. Bundy dismissed this hypothesis: [...] "hey ... just fit the general criteria of being young and attractive", he told Hugh Aynesworth. [...] "Too many people have bought <b>this</b> <b>crap</b> that all the girls were similar ... almost everything was dissimilar ... physically, they were almost all different." [...] He did concede that youth and beauty were [...] "absolutely indispensable criteria" [...] in his choice of victims.|$|E
500|$|The {{release date}} of the album was delayed several times. The album was {{originally}} set for a release on February 4, 2003 in Europe and Japan, and on February 24 in the US and Canada. After the prolongation of the release date for territories outside Japan and Europe, drummer Charlie Benante posted an explanation on the band's official website: [...] "I {{hate to tell you}} this but... the record got pushed back to April 15. It's only been 73 years since Vol. 8 , what's another week or two? The record company needed the extra time to put more time into the promotion. One day all <b>this</b> <b>crap</b> will be over, you'll be rocking out to some killer shit." [...] It was later announced that the release date for Europe would be also pushed back to March 3, 2003, eventually setting it on May 6. The problems occurred after a breakdown in negotiations between Beyond Records and Sanctuary Records over a buy-out of the band's contract. According to Blabbermouth, Beyond Records {{was in the process of}} selling their entire catalog to Sanctuary, but the arrangement have fallen through. However, the problems were resolved and the record was successfully distributed through Sanctuary in North America and Nuclear Blast in Europe.|$|E

[...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now."

[...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage."

I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E
