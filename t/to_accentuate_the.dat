5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; {{the number is}} imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (piperatoria); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. Many pieces are gilded in parts <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} has {{a total of}} 927 windows and they are painted in the colours of the rainbow. Some may notice that the coloured windows on the first four stories have the same vibrant intensity, while the upper windows gradually intensify <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> cantilevered balconies which are interesting architectural features of this historical building.|$|E

25|$|For {{the final}} battle of Kirk and Picard against Soran, McCarthy used staccato music <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> fistfight. For Kirk's death, McCarthy mated lyrical strings with another {{statement}} of the Courage theme, while a shot of Picard standing over Kirk's grave is scored with more pomp. The Courage theme plays again at the film's close.|$|E
25|$|Selah {{is used in}} Iyaric Rastafarian vocabulary. It can {{be heard}} {{at the end of}} spoken-word {{segments}} of some reggae songs. Its usage here, again, is <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> magnitude and importance of what has been said, and often is a sort of substitute for Amen. Notable, according to Rastafarian faith, is also the word's similarity with the incarnated god and savior Selassie (Ethiopia's former emperor Haile Selassie).|$|E

25|$|The {{horseshoe}} arch {{became a}} popular feature in Islamic structures. Some suggest the Muslims acquired {{this from the}} Visigoths in Spain but they may have obtained it from Syria and Persia where the horseshoe arch had been in use by the Byzantines. In Moorish architecture, the curvature of the horseshoe arch is much more accentuated. Furthermore, alternating colours were added <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> effect of its shape. This {{can be seen at}} a large scale in their major work, the Great Mosque of Córdoba.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the bathroom, the walls in the house featured diverse surface treatment. Almost every wall is decorated with hand painted and stenciled art recreating geometric patterns and classic motifs: garlands, pilasters, columns and linear designs <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> corners. All floors are of wooden planks made out of tabloncillo (sideroxylon portoricense), with {{the exception}} of the gallery's floor, which consist of hydraulic cement tiles, result of an early twentieth century intervention. The ceiling also consists of wooden planks, mostly decorated with hand painted geometric motifs and stenciled designs.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to offering its affiliated member-stores reduced wholesale prices generated from economies of scale, the Co-operative Central Exchange conducted educational activities aimed at making retail stores more successful. These included a training school for store managers, established in 1918, {{and the introduction}} of a simple and efficient system of bookkeeping for cooperative stores developed by H.V. Nurmi. The CCE also campaigned against the practice of stores selling on credit — a risky practice which tended to create cash flow problems and <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> effect of periodic economic downturns.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} other claims of Lower Paleolithic art, namely the [...] "Venus of Tan-Tan" [...] (before 300 kya) [...] and the [...] "Venus of Berekhat Ram" [...] (250 kya).

25|$|A belt {{could also}} be {{fastened}} over a simple tunic-like garment or undergarment, just below the breasts or over the breasts. When the apodesmos was worn under the breasts, it accentuated them. Another word for a breast-band or belt was strophion (Gr: στρόφιον). A further term was kestós (Gr: κεστός, Latin: cestus), used specifically for Aphrodite's charmed girdle in the Iliad, whose power was to make every woman who wore it irresistible to men. In view of its association with the love goddess, this type of garment probably had an erotic connotation because of its effect <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> breast.|$|E
25|$|Priority Ducking is used {{to lower}} {{the level of a}} microphone(s) and/or program {{material}} based on a source signal from another microphone, {{for the duration of the}} signal present at the source microphone. It restores the original level once the source signal has ceased. This is useful when a) program material needs to attenuate in order <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> voice of a narrator, b) one microphone is used by a chairman or master of ceremonies, and needs to have priority over other mics and/or program material, or c) a paging mic must attenuate all other signals.|$|E
25|$|Yellow is {{the code}} for monks, mendicants and women. Minukka (radiant, shining) {{with a warm}} yellow, orange or saffron typifies noble, virtuous {{feminine}} characters such as Sita, Panchali and Mohini. Men who act the roles of women also add a false top knot to their left and decorate it in a style common to the region. Vella Thadi (white beard) represents a divine being, someone with virtuous inner state and consciousness such as Hanuman. Teppu are for special characters found in Hindu mythologies, such as Garuda, Jatayu and Hamsa who act as messengers or carriers, but do not fit the other categories. Face masks and head gear is added <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> inner nature of the characters. The garments colors have a similar community accepted code of silent communication.|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{is now a}} common reality {{in most parts of}} the world, being translated in mass unemployment, collapse of the social system and an impressive number of bankruptcies. The paper focuses on the beginning of the recession in the American real estate sector by analyzing the implications of imperfect information and moral hazard as main factors that contributed to the deterioration of real estate market and also <b>to</b> <b>accentuating</b> <b>the</b> overall poor economic situation. In that context, asymmetric information served the interests of banks and other institutional speculators who made use of it in order to increase their profitability through market manipulation.

25|$|Ceely House {{is one of}} Aylesbury's larger houses. Of medieval origin it was {{the brotherhood}} house of the Fraternity of the Virgin Mary. In the mid-18th century it was {{converted}} to a private house and given a new classical front, by the Aylesbury lawyer Hugh Barker Bell. Constructed of red brick, its main facade is five bays. The centre bay projects slightly <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> main entrance, which is protected by a porch in a loose palladian style of two unfluted Corinthean columns supporting a pediment. The pitched roof is hidden by an unusual parapet masquerading as an undecorated entablature. As {{in the case of}} the Friarage however Ceely House is another example of a much older building with a new front: medieval wall paintings may be found in the upper storeys of the house, which is now part of the Buckinghamshire County Museum.|$|E
25|$|There was {{demonstrable}} {{continuity in}} the south, {{even though the}} Danish settlement represented a watershed in England's artistic tradition. Wars and pillaging removed or destroyed much Anglo-Saxon art, while the settlement introduced new Scandinavian craftsmen and patrons. The result was <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> pre-existing distinction between {{the art of the}} north and that of the south. In the 10th and 11th centuries, the Viking dominated areas were characterised by stone sculpture in which the Anglo-Saxon tradition of cross shafts took on new forms, and a distinctive Anglo-Scandinavian monument, the 'hogback' tomb, was produced. The decorative motifs used on these northern carvings (as on items of personal adornment or everyday use) echo Scandinavian styles. The Wessexan hegemony and the monastic reform movement appear to have been the catalysts for the rebirth of art in southern England {{from the end of the}} 9th century. Here artists responded primarily to continental art; foliage supplanting interlace as the preferred decorative motif. Key early works are the Alfred Jewel, which has fleshy leaves engraved on the back plate; and the stole and maniples of Bishop Frithestan of Winchester, which are ornamented with acanthus leaves, alongside figures that bear the stamp of Byzantine art. The surviving evidence points to Winchester and Canterbury as the leading centres of manuscript art in the second half of the 10th century: they developed colourful paintings with lavish foliate borders, and coloured line drawings.|$|E
500|$|The show's color {{has been}} {{described}} by Karacas as {{a major part of the}} visuals; inspirations included Paul Klee and Katsuhiro Otomo, as well as the concept of fluorescence. The team wanted to create [...] "a bold, fresh look" [...] that reflected the universe, and so they chose to be minimal with their palette to attract attention to the line work. In addition, they eschewed the use of vivid primary colors and instead chose more secondary colors. However, they took <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> scenes with [...] "pop colors" [...] that mimic the glow of neon lighting, and lastly they added vertical reflections to the floors and grunge textures to the backgrounds.|$|E

500|$|Various {{types of}} membranophones, {{traditionally}} associated with solemn occasions, are {{found throughout the}} island.

[...] Only men can play the ampongabe, while women and men may both play the smaller langoroana drum.

The diving figure at right leads to the swimming form of Eakins, who painted himself into the scene and whose leftward movement directs attention back into the painting. Eakins enforces this pyramidal structure by manipulating the focus of the painting: the center area containing the swimmers is extremely precise, while the outer areas are diffuse, with [...] "virtually no moderating zones in between".
