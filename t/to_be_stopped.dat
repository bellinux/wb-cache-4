5|$|However, {{problems}} arose due to {{the inability}} of contemporary naval technology to simultaneously meet the requirements for weight, speed, range and armament. On 8 April 1938 German Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, {{the commander in chief}} of the Kriegsmarine, informed the Oberkommando der Marine (German Naval High Command) that the Type 1937J design work was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped,</b> and that a further eight Type 36 destroyers were to be built instead. Although no ships of the Type 1937J were ever ordered or laid down, they influenced the later project studies: the Type 1938Ac, 1938Ad, and 1938B destroyers.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, D.C., Chris Whitley (Kris Lemche) {{is ordered}} by the conspirators who fund Juma's militia to erase all {{information}} that would incriminate them. Instead, he calls his friend Roger Taylor (Eric Lively), the son of President Elect Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), for help. After Roger hears of the conspiracy, Whitley returns to his home to forward the files, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> by Hodges's men, Halcott and John Quinn (Sebastian Roche) who take the information, kill Whitley and bury the body in concrete.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for crews' wages <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> when a ship was sunk. Famed Labour leader James Larkin {{raised the issue}} of the survivors' treatment in the Dáil Éireann. Citing the crew member who was told by the Labour exchange to 'go and get his record card', which was lost when Irish Oak sank, he suggested that the Dáil Éireann ask the German Consul-General to send a submarine to retrieve it.|$|E
5|$|The main {{cell in the}} {{thunderstorm}} system {{appeared from}} Bureau of Meteorology radar analysis to split into two separate and distinct cells. This development resulted {{in one part of}} the major storm to head north, to Maroochydore, while the other part headed south towards Brisbane. The southern cell struck Brisbane just after 1:00pm, with intense lightning activity and hailstones the size of marbles falling. The storm caused a lengthy delay during the First Test of the series between Australia and the West Indies, when hail forced play <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> at the Brisbane Cricket Ground around 1:15pm.|$|E

5|$|Under Vasey's command, the 7th Division recaptured Kokoda on 2 November. It {{pushed on}} towards {{the north coast}} of Papua, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> by the Japanese short of their {{ultimate}} objective. The division was forced to fight a bloody battle around Buna, and, together with American troops under Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger, ultimately defeated the Japanese and captured Gona. After the campaign, the 7th Division returned to Australia. The men went on leave before reassembling for training on the Atherton Tableland. Vasey went on leave in Melbourne but wound up being admitted to the Heidelberg Military Hospital for treatment for Malaria.|$|E
5|$|A {{consensus}} formed {{within the}} European diplomatic community in Constantinople that {{the persecution of}} the accused Jews had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped.</b> This opinion was held not only by Lord Ponsonby, but also by von Stürmer, whose correspondence revealed {{that he was not}} at all convinced of the innocence of the Jews; by the French ambassador Edouard Pontois, whose government stood by the French consuls who supported blood libels in Rhodes and Damascus; and by the Prussian ambassador Hans von Königsmark. Consequently, the way was open for Lord Ponsonby, by far the most powerful diplomat in Constantinople, to intervene unopposed on behalf the Jews of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise {{medicine in the}} United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E

5|$|Croatian President Franjo Tuđman {{called on}} the public to bring the siege to an end, and the plea {{resulted}} in a large-scale protest against the JNA in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard on 6 May 1991. On 7 May, 80 tanks and tracked vehicles and 23 wheeled vehicles of the JNA 10th Motorised Brigade left barracks in Mostar, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> by civilians ahead of Široki Brijeg, west of Mostar. The convoy remained in place for three days as the crowd demanded that the JNA lift the siege of Kijevo. The protest ended after Alija Izetbegović, the President of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited and addressed the protesters, assuring the crowd that the convoy was heading to Kupres rather than Kijevo. Tuđman and Cardinal Franjo Kuharić sent telegrams to the protesters supporting Izetbegović. The siege of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations a few days later, {{two weeks after the}} blockade had been imposed.|$|E
5|$|If Crash, Coco or Crunch win the race, Velo, {{having lost}} his {{influence}} over his subjects, dejectedly relinquishes his empire to the Bandicoots. Crash considers becoming the next emperor of the galaxy, but decides otherwise and gives control back to Velo {{in exchange for}} sending the Bandicoots back to Earth. If Cortex, N. Gin or Tiny win the race, Velo struggles with Cortex over the possession of his scepter, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> by Tiny. Cortex uses the scepter's power {{in an attempt to}} return to Earth, but the scepter breaks and sends Cortex, N. Gin and Tiny to Terra instead. When they are confronted by the natives (all of which resemble Krunk), Tiny repairs the scepter and is subsequently revered as a king, much to Cortex's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, but God tells her that Satan is the one who is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E

5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views on rail. Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail. However, Republican Djou ran on drastically cutting spending on rail by cutting funding on buying {{cars on the}} rail before its completion, and hiring mainland consultants. Kirk Caldwell also stated that spending on rail should be cut, but instead by shortening the rail to end at Middle Street. Carlisle was the only candidate in full support of funding the rail system and stated that rail {{has gone too far}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped.</b> Kirk Caldwell won the election, and promptly went on to adopt Carlisle's position that rail should be completed.|$|E
5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Conditions were hot and sunny for the Friday practice sessions. Several drivers went off the track due to the track being dusty. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap of the first session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 41.175 seconds, ahead of McLaren teammates Hamilton and Button. Kubica was fourth-fastest; Massa and Vettel were fifth and sixth. Webber, Michael Schumacher, Alonso and Rubens Barrichello rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. Bruno Senna's left-side view mirror became detached from his Hispania F110, which grazed the Brazilian driver's helmet, and was run over by Sébastien Buemi heading into turn 12, which caused the session <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> to allow marshals to clear the track of debris.|$|E

Suite 8 software includes IFF Mode 5, which modernizes the ability to identify the A-10 to friendly units. Additionally, the Pave Penny pods and pylons are being removed as their receive-only capability {{has been replaced by}} the AN/AAQ-28(V)4 LITENING AT targeting pods or Sniper XR targeting pod, which both have laser designators and laser rangefinders.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} {{interview}} was videotaped, {{at the beginning of}} the second interview, Lyons said that he wanted video recording <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped.</b> It has been alleged that the decision to terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview. A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record, including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue. As the interview continued, Lyons was asked if he wanted to make a formal statement, to which he agreed. This statement contains a number of points about the killings that were not known to the public at the time. Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in {{the first interview}} are not included in the statement, although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies.|$|E

As he is dragged through the crowd, Ned notices Arya on the statue, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her location. With Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey and the Small Council looking over him, Ned confesses to treason and swears fealty to Joffrey in front of the crowd. Satisfied, Sansa and Cersei ask Joffrey to spare Ned as Joffrey promised, but Joffrey breaks his promise and orders Ned to be executed. As Sansa watches in horror, Cersei, Varys and the Small Council attempt to intervene, and Arya tries to rescue Ned, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stopped</b> by Yoren, who prevents her from seeing her father's execution. When he sees that Arya has been rescued, Ned accepts his fate and is beheaded by Ser Ilyn Payne.|$|E
