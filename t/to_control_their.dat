5|$|Although a {{small number}} of castles had been built in England during the 1050s, after the conquest the Normans began to build timber motte and bailey and ringwork castles in large numbers <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> newly {{occupied}} territories. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone, with characteristic square keeps that supported both military and political functions. Royal castles were used to control key towns and forests, whilst baronial castles were used by the Norman lords <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> widespread estates; a feudal system called the castle-guard was sometimes used to provide garrisons. Castles and sieges continued to grow in military sophistication during the 12th century, and in the 13th century new defensive town walls were constructed across England.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{have played}} an {{important}} military, economic and social role in Great Britain and Ireland since their introduction following the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Although {{a small number of}} castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans began to build motte and bailey and ringworks castles in large numbers <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone– with characteristic square keeps– that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by the Norman lords <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> widespread estates. David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, under Henry II, castles were established there too.|$|E

5|$|The Glorious First of June {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} the major problems inherent in the French and British navies {{at the start of the}} Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and they failed <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> fleets effectively during the height of the combat.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} {{is usually}} seen singly {{or in small}} groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps. It is often found {{in the company of}} kites and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations. They may also hold their wings outstretched, presumably <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> temperature. They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off.

5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet {{in children and}} young people with epilepsy, as well as six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> seizures, and only one of the trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|All {{elephants}} {{have several}} distinctive features, {{the most notable}} {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E

In partnered stimulation either partner can <b>control</b> <b>their</b> own orgasmic response and timing. With mutual agreement either partner can similarly learn <b>to</b> <b>control</b> or enhance <b>their</b> partner's orgasmic response and timing. Partner stimulation orgasm techniques referred to as expanded orgasm, extended orgasm or orgasm control can be learned and practiced for either partner <b>to</b> refine <b>their</b> <b>control</b> of the orgasmic response of the other. Partners mutually choose which is in control or {{in response to the}} other.|$|R
5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose of the craft to be raised or lowered by motion control, with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time was {{born out of}} Arsenal's frustration after going behind in the match; he did not want either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his comments about the linesman.|$|E
5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison has been successfully used <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E
50|$|This {{currently}} {{has an effect}} on employment. Microsoft reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and Twitter. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many <b>to</b> <b>control</b> various online privacy settings in addition <b>to</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>their</b> online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.|$|R

5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Norwich {{got back}} into the game against Chelsea with a goal from Anthony Pilkington but conceded two late goals to finish 1–3 to the visitors. This was {{followed}} up with a 4–1 away defeat by Arsenal. The home fixture against Cardiff City finished in controversy during when Leroy Fer put the ball {{in the back of the}} net when passing the ball back to goalkeeper David Marshall. This resulted in a melee in which both Norwich and Cardiff were fined £20,000 by the FA for failing <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> players. The game was also notable with Norwich having 31 shots at goal despite the game finishing as a draw.|$|E
5|$|On Election Day, Goldwater {{lost the}} {{election}} to Johnson by {{what was then the}} largest margin in history. Goldwater accumulated 52 electoral votes to Johnson's 486 and 39% of the popular vote (27,178,188) to Johnson's 61% (43,129,566). Goldwater carried six states: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and his home state of Arizona. Goldwater's strong showing in the south is largely due to his support of the white southern view on civil rights: that states should be able <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> own laws without federal intervention.|$|E

5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from {{the lessons of the}} past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E
5|$|Roger's son Robert {{inherited}} {{and improved}} the castle. Robert was a favourite of King John, and hosted him at Warkworth Castle in 1213. The castle {{remained in the}} family line, with periods of guardianship when heirs were too young <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> estates. King EdwardI stayed overnight in 1292 and John de Clavering, descendant of Roger fitz Richard, made the Crown his inheritor. With {{the outbreak of the}} Anglo-Scottish Wars, EdwardII invested in castles including Warkworth where he funded the strengthening of the garrison in 1319. Twice in 1327 the Scots besieged the castle without success.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Ages saw further {{improvements}} in agriculture. Monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers {{for the collection}} of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The manorial system allowed large landowners <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> land and its laborers, {{in the form of}} peasants or serfs. During the medieval period, the Arab world was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents. Besides transporting numerous crops, they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to Europe and developed the beginnings of the plantation system of sugarcane growing through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation.|$|E

Unlike open borders theorists, I answer the first question in the affirmative. However, I answer the second question in the negative. More specifically, I argue that states have a negative duty to exclude prospective immigrants whose departure {{could be expected to}} contribute to severe deprivation in their countries of origin. Countries have a right <b>to</b> unilaterally <b>control</b> <b>their</b> borders, but their exercise of this right is constrained by the demands of morality...|$|R
