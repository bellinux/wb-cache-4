5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{regarded}} as an ideal location for air training {{for a number of}} reasons. It was far from the hostilities, firmly pro-British and had excellent weather throughout the year. The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get going in Canada. The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so {{for the first time in}} November 1940.|$|E

5|$|Saman was {{released}} in 1998 after winning the 1997 Jakarta Art Institute novel writing contest. In 1998, Saman won the Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition. In 2000, it received the Prince Claus Award. By 2005, it had been translated into Dutch and English; the English translation <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write because Utami was concerned that an overexplanation of the novel caused it to lose all of its sensuality. It has also been translated into French, Czech, and Japanese (by two separate translators). , a translation into Korean is underway. By 2004, the book had sold 100,000 copies, a large figure for an Indonesian novel.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> set up, {{so it could}} not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which {{made it hard to}} warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to {{play the}} opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they {{cancelled}} the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club. As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison {{said that he had}} two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead. Lennon, McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows, stars, and a beetle, which still survive. John Lennon was short-sighted, mistaking gloss for emulsion paint, which <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dry in the dark, damp cellar. Cynthia Powell, later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall, which is also still intact.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{music in}} North Georgia, including {{what is now}} Athens, {{was that of the}} Native Americans of the area, principally the Creek and the Cherokee. Athens was officially chartered in 1806, and began growing rapidly near the middle of the 19th century. By the time of the American Civil War in the 1860s, the city was an important part of musical life in Georgia. The war accelerated the development of the city's musical importance, as Athens was largely spared widespread destruction while the larger city of Atlanta <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover. Major touring acts like the Dixie Family and The Slomans visited Athens during the war; the Dixie Family, a prominent touring group, performed disastrously, according to local newspapers, who said that the highlight of the performance came from four local African American musicians, and the Dixie Family had absconded with the concert's proceeds, which had been promised to the local Ladies Aid Society. In the 1870s, the city was almost half African American, and local black-owned industry flourished; among the residents was Bob Cole, born in 1868 to a musically active family. Cole would later become a pioneer in African American theater, known for works like the 1898 musical A Trip to Coontown.|$|E

The actual decision, however, was regarded as having confused the issue somewhat instead. Several state courts have responded by recognizing an opinion privilege in some way in their own jurisprudence.|$|E

25|$|After {{the launch}} on July 28, 1973, and {{entering}} Skylab, the spiders were released by astronaut Owen Garriott {{into a box}} that resembled a window frame. The spiders proceeded to construct their web while a camera took photographs and examined the spiders' behavior in a zero-gravity environment. Both spiders <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> adapt to their weightless existence. However, after a day, Arabella spun the first web in the experimental cage, although it was initially incomplete.|$|E
25|$|By 1961 it {{had become}} evident that the old school {{buildings}} were unsuited to modern educational needs. By good fortune, the opportunity then came to rebuild the School on a 45-acre (182,000 m²) riverside site at Barnes, adjacent to Hammersmith Bridge. This land had previously been the site of reservoirs which were filled in, reputedly with earth excavated during {{the construction of the}} Victoria line. The sports pitches <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> settle, and competitive matches were not played regularly at the Barnes site until summer 1979.|$|E

25|$|The Alfonso XII {{class had}} three masts and two funnels. They were unarmored, but their hulls were built with a French-style {{cellular}} system with 12 watertight bulkheads. The Ferrol-built ships {{were the first}} two steel-hulled cruisers built in that yard. The main guns were built by Hontoria and mounted in sponsons. The torpedo tubes were fixed; one was on each beam, two were forward, and one was aft. The class <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete; the lead unit was delayed for five years by material shortages and took ten years from keel-laying to commissioning.|$|E

In the last decade, Italy {{has become one of the}} world's leading producers of renewable energy, ranking as the world's fourth largest holder of installed solar energy capacity and the sixth largest holder of wind power capacity in 2010. Renewable energies now make up about 12% of the total primary and final energy consumption in Italy, with a future target share set at 17% for the year 2020.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem was}} that the {{experimental}} chamber <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> refit for another shot, longer than the time needed to cool down the lasers. In order to improve utilization of the laser, a second experimental chamber was built behind the original, with optics that combined the ten beamlines into two. Nova had been built up against the older Shiva buildings, with the two experimental chambers back to back and the beamlines extending outward from the center target areas. The Two Beam system was installed by passing the beamguides and related optics through the now unused Shiva experimental area and placing the smaller experimental chamber in Shiva's beam bay.|$|E
