500|$|All of the {{officers}} and troopers of Forbes' column had high praise for Burnham's actions, and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later. One member of the column, Trooper ME Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald in 1944 that once Commandant Piet Raaff took over command from the disgraced Major Forbes it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: [...] "I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> owed our lives on that occasion." [...] For his service in the war, Burnham was presented the British South Africa Company Medal, a gold watch, and a share of a 300-acre (120ha) tract of land in Matabeleland. It was here that Burnham uncovered many artifacts in the huge granite ruins of the ancient civilization of Great Zimbabwe. Matabeleland {{became part of the}} Company domain, which was formally named Rhodesia, after Rhodes, in 1895. Matabeleland and Mashonaland became collectively called Southern Rhodesia.|$|E
500|$|Burnham, Ingram and Gooding each {{received}} the British South Africa Company Medal for their {{service in the}} First Matabele War, and all three subsequently served in the Second Matabele War of 1896–97. All of the officers and troopers of Forbes' column reported high praise for Burnham's actions and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later. One member of the column, Trooper ME Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald on 22 December 1944 that once Commandant Raaff took over command it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: [...] "I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> owed our lives on that occasion." [...] Burnham proceeded to become a key figure {{for a number of}} commanding officers, including Frederick Carrington, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Roberts. Carrington called him [...] "the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa. He was my Chief of Scouts in '96 in Matabeleland and he was the eyes and ears of my force". The US President Theodore Roosevelt described him in 1901 as [...] "a scout and a hunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot, and a fighter... the ideal scout." [...] While fighting with the British Army in the Second Boer War, Burnham was adjudged to have shown exceptional heroism and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order, then Britain's second highest military honour.|$|E
500|$|In May 1796, Bonaparte {{detailed}} Sérurier {{to demonstrate}} with his division at Valenza {{while the rest}} of the army crossed the Po River near Piacenza. After the Battle of Lodi, Bonaparte divided the Army of Italy into a cavalry reserve and four divisions including one under Sérurier. During the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May, his division feinted at the upper Mincio River while other troops made the main thrust against Johann Peter Beaulieu's army at Valeggio sul Mincio. On 1 June, the 4,700-strong division took position on the north side of the fortress of Mantua. On 8 June, Sérurier, artillerist Augustin de Lespinasse and engineer Francois, marquis de Chasseloup-Laubat reconnoitered the fortress. Two days later Bonaparte put Sérurier in charge of the Siege of Mantua with about 8,000 soldiers. Soon after, Bonaparte wrote to the French Directory, [...] "I shall not speak to you of the conduct of the intrepid General Sérurier, whose military reputation is established, and <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> owe, amongst other things since the campaign began, the victory of Mondovi". Because of the approach of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's Austrian army, the siege was raised on 31 July, the heavy cannons were buried and the division withdrew behind the Oglio River. Sérurier then became feverish with malaria, so that Fiorella and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne directed the division during the Battle of Castiglione. The general returned to France to recuperate. On 14 August 1796 Bonaparte wrote a confidential assessment of his generals to the Directory. In it he wrote, [...] "Sérurier, fights like a private, takes nothing on himself, firm; has not a good enough opinion of his troops, is ill".|$|E

500|$|The inquiry {{heard that}} many of the councils were understaffed, underfunded, and poorly managed. The chief {{executive}} of Brent council said its social services department was [...] "seriously defective". The inquiry was told that many cases at Brent social services were closed inappropriately before inspection by the social services inspectorate, that children were being placed unaccompanied in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, and that children in need were turned away. The inquiry heard how Edward Armstrong had previously been ordered not to work with children over his handling of a case in 1993. Haringey and Brent councils diverted £18.7 million and over £26 million, respectively, in the two years 1997/98 and 1998/99, from its social services department into services such as education, for other purposes; both underspent their budgets for children's services, totalling £28m, by more than £10m in 1998–99, causing a deteriorating of child protection services. The inquiry heard how Haringey council failed to assign social workers to 109 children in May 1999, a short period before they took on Climbié's case. Again in January 2002, Haringey council failed to assign social workers to about 50 children. Haringey council wrote a letter to Laming claiming that social workers who gave evidence were being questioned more harshly than other witnesses. Laming condemned the letter, saying [...] "I will not tolerate any covert attempt to influence {{the way in which the}} inquiry is conducted." [...] Mary Richardson, the director of social services at Haringey from 1 April 1998 until 31 March 2000, had been responsible for a restructuring of the department which, according to the union UNISON, had [...] "virtually paralysed" [...] the child protection service. She received contact from twelve senior practitioners and team managers criticising the proposals as [...] "potentially dangerous and detrimental to the people <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> offer a service". Richardson provided no substantive response to the memorandum. She did, however, say in the inquiry that the blame lay on [...] "part of all of the line management responsibility". Gurbux Singh, the former chief executive of Haringey council (before becoming the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality), said that there was nothing he could have done to prevent Climbié's death. Garnham contrasted this with Rossiter's willingness to accept responsibility, saying, [...] "that willingness to acknowledge error is at least at the root, is it not, of progress?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Mantle died on August 13, 1995, at Baylor University Medical Center {{with his}} wife at his side, five months after his mother had died at age 91. The Yankees played Cleveland that day and honored him with a tribute. At Mantle's funeral, Eddie Layton played [...] "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" [...] on the Hammond organ because Mickey had once {{told him it was}} his {{favorite}} song. Roy Clark sang and played [...] "Yesterday, When I Was Young." [...] The team played {{the rest of the season}} with black mourning bands topped by a small number 7 on their left sleeves. Mantle was interred in the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas. In eulogizing Mantle, sportscaster Bob Costas described him as [...] "a fragile hero <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic." [...] Costas added: [...] "In the last year of his life, Mickey Mantle, always so hard on himself, finally came to accept and appreciate the distinction between a role model and a hero. The first, he often was not. The second, he always will be. And, in the end, people got it." [...] Richardson did oblige in reading the poem at Mantle's funeral, something he described as being extremely difficult. The same poem (God's Hall of Fame) which originated from a baseball fan, was recited by Richardson for Roger Maris during Maris' funeral.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (a {{think tank}} founded by [...] "a {{small group of}} visionary Americans {{committed}} to advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East") argued that the U.S.-Israel relationship is [...] "A Strategic Asset for the United States." [...] In discussing their report, Walter B. Slocombe said that while in the popular imagination, the U.S.-Israel relationship is only good for Israel, Israel provides enormous assistance to the United States, including military expertise which has saved American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Robert D. Blackwill countered {{the claim that the}} U.S.-Israel relationship significantly damages the relationship between the United States and the Arab world. [...] He asked rhetorically: [...] "Would Saudi Arabia's policies toward the United States be markedly different in practice if Washington entered into a sustained crisis with Israel over the Palestine issue during which the bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel went into steep, systemic decline? In that instance, would Riyadh lower the price of oil? Would it stop hedging its regional bets concerning U.S. attempts to coerce Iran into freezing its nuclear weapons program? Would it regard U.S. policy toward Afghanistan any less critically? Would it view American democracy promotion in the Middle East more favorably? Would it be more inclined to reform its internal governmental processes to be more in line with U.S. preferences? Walt [...] and I judge the answer to all these questions [...] 'No.'" [...] When asked how this report could so flatly contradict the Walt and Mearsheimer thesis, Slocombe responded, [...] "There is so much error in the world," [...] and added, [...] "I think {{it would be interesting to}} ask them whether they make the same contrary argument about the other countries <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> also provide something like this kind of support. [...] There are obviously differences, but the principle is the same." ...|$|E
