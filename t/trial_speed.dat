2500|$|The Admiralty did {{not specify}} a {{standard}} design for destroyers, laying down broad requirements, including a <b>trial</b> <b>speed</b> of , a [...] "turtleback" [...] forecastle and [...] armament, which was to vary {{depending on whether the}} ship was {{to be used in the}} torpedo boat or gunboat role. As a torpedo boat, the planned armament was a single QF 12 pounder 12 cwt ( [...] calibre) gun on a platform on the ship's conning tower (in practice the platform was also used as the ship's bridge), together with a secondary gun armament of three 6-pounder guns, and two 18 in (450 mm) torpedo tubes.

2500|$|The Gridley-class destroyers were a {{class of}} four 1500-ton destroyers in the United States Navy. They {{were part of a}} series of USN destroyers limited to 1,500 tons {{standard}} displacement by the London Naval Treaty and built in the 1930s. The first two ships were laid down on 3 June 1935 and commissioned in 1937. The second two were laid down in March 1936 and commissioned in 1938. Based on the preceding Mahan-class destroyers with somewhat different machinery, they had the same hull but had only a single stack and mounted sixteen 21 inch (533mm) [...] torpedo tubes, an increase of four. To compensate for the increased torpedo armament weight, the gun armament was slightly reduced from five 5"/38 caliber guns (127mm) to four. [...] made the highest <b>trial</b> <b>speed</b> ever recorded for a United States Navy destroyer, 42.8 knots. All four ships served extensively in World War II, notably in the Solomon Islands and the Battle of the Philippine Sea, with Maury receiving a Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E
