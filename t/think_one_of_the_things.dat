I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic {{within the framework of the}} drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} not made. Instead Hill wrote and {{directed}} a second biopic, Wild Bill (1995). This too had little critical or commercial success. Hill reflected on his career in 1995:I think every director thinks that he hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, `Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.Hill admitted his style of films were becoming less fashionable:I admire a lot of what's going on out there, but the oversize kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with.

40|$|PY: Marilyn Hood, in {{the very}} early 80 s, {{studying}} audiences in Toledo, found that one thing that differentiated people who went to museums from those who didn't (given identical demographic profiles) was that museum goers thought that learning was a pleasurable experience, and they did go to museums to learn. The ones who chose sporting events and zoos over museums thought of learning as laborious, and not a way to spend leisure. We also found at MOMA that most people listed learning as an important goal when visiting. But that doesn't mean that the notion of learning is not pretty vague. I think the paradox here is that even if they say they want to learn, it is in the rather broad sense of being uplifted and inspired. It is not as if they come to museums to work hard at something. DR: I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that has shifted the debate about visitor experience in art museums in recent years is the fact that for museum professionals trained in art history, post-modern scholarship rejects the notion of the "masterpiece " that can transform through its electrifying presence. The individual art object, instead of being seen as a pleasing combination of formal elements is treated as "as an element of discourse " within a variety of social, cultural and political contexts. In contemporary critical thinking, the museum can no longer claim to be a neutra...|$|E

This is pure speculation on my part [...] . I have felt like that makes it more of a challenge for students [...] . One of the kind of go-to things that I would say to my students at Santa Barbara for example is, 'If you are not sure how something sounds, read it out loud. Read it to a friend [...] . Say it verbally, and if it doesn't make sense verbally, then that tells you that you need to rework the structure on paper. ' But if you're entire soundscape is non-standard constructions, then telling people to read something out loud as a checkpoint becomes a much less useful checkpoint because it may sound fine, but it still may not conform to [...] . Standard English written conventions [...] . I haven't found a solution to that frankly [...] . I've been strongly encouraging students to go to the Writing Center [...] . to involve others in the writing process. Have your roommate read it over. Have a friend read it over [...] .
