60|$|The {{problem is}} not a {{difficult}} one. The municipality can be limited just as the monarchy is limited. The Act transferring theatres to local control can be a charter of the liberties of the stage {{as well as an}} Act to reform administration. The power to refuse to grant or renew a licence to a theatre need not be an arbitrary one. The municipality may be required to state the ground of refusal; and certain grounds can be expressly declared as unlawful; so that it shall be possible for the manager to resort to the courts for a mandamus to compel the authority <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>licence.</b> It can be declared unlawful for a licensing authority to demand from the manager any disclosure of the nature of any entertainment he proposes to give, or to prevent its performance, or to refuse to renew his licence on the ground that the tendency of his entertainments is contrary to religion and morals, or that the theatre is an undesirable institution, or that there are already as many theatres as are needed, or that the theatre draws people away from the churches, chapels, mission halls, and the like in its neighborhood. The assumption should be that every citizen has a right to open and conduct a theatre, and therefore has a right to a licence unless he has forfeited that right by allowing his theatre to become a disorderly house, or failing to provide a building which complies with the regulations concerning sanitation and egress in case of fire, or being convicted of an offence against public decency. Also, the licensing powers of the authority should not be delegated to any official or committee; and the manager or lessee of the theatre should have a right to appear in person or by counsel to plead against any motion to refuse to grant or renew his licence. With these safeguards the licensing power could not be stretched to censorship. The manager would enjoy liberty of conscience as far as the local authority is concerned; but on the least attempt on his part to keep a disorderly house under cover of opening a theatre he would risk his licence.|$|E

5000|$|The {{necessary}} royal licence {{to alienate}} (i.e. convey ownership in) the manors, listed in Denys's will for the bequest to Sheen, was not obtained by Denys's feoffees until 1516, {{five years after}} his death, after much legal wrangling between the Court and feoffees. It seems {{that one of the}} manors was found, seemingly Gray's Inn, during the legal process <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>licence</b> for alienation, technically to have escheated to the Crown previous apparently to Deny's ownership, by reason of [...] "the death of Robert de Chiggewell without an heir". This effectively meant that Denys had never himself held good title, and his representatives were therefore legally incapable of dealing in the property concerned. The matter required regularisation, which was achieved. Denys had foreseen the delay experienced by his feoffees in receiving a licence to alienate, and had made in his will specific provisions for the disposition of the income generated pending the transfer to Sheen.|$|E

In deciding whether <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>licence,</b> the Home Office refers to the Act's cost-benefit analysis, which is defined as [...] "the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefit likely to accrue {{as a result of the}} programme to be specified in the licence" [...] (Section 5(4)). A licence should not be granted if there is a [...] "reasonably practicable method not entailing the use of protected animals" [...] (Section 5(5) (a)).

40|$|At common law, a {{right to}} be {{entitled}} to the natural produce of another person's land - profits a prendre, or simply profits - is capable of being a legal right. It is a legal estate: a kind of right which is capable of binding whoever comes upon the land and is operative outside the ambit of contract; it is independent of who are the owners of the servient tenement and the dominant tenement; {{it is a kind of}} right "binding the whole world". The Marine Fish Culture Ordinance, Cap 353, Laws of Hong Kong, confers upon the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation authority <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>licence</b> whereby a party is given the right to culture fish within the provisions of the Ordinance. Culturing fish without the appropriate licence is an offence under the Ordinance. These two kinds of rights differ at least in that one is a right relating or attaching to land and the other is a right given to a person by statute; one is a legal estate and is independent of the person and the other is a personal right which is granted to a specific person. However, the two are interrelated in that both could relate to fish culture and there may be conflict between them at times. This study compares these two kinds of rights and identifies the areas in which one may affect the other. Discussion is included in this paper concerning situations where the two may be in conflict, and suggestions are made to improve this. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Press release: I {{would like}} to update all those who have an {{interest}} on progress in relation to my and my Department’s efforts {{with the assistance of}} the HPRA (Health Products Regulatory Association) on advancing access for patients to cannabis for medical reasons, based on the best scientific advice. While I do not generally comment on individual cases, I {{would like to}} state that I and my Department are doing everything in our power to assist Ms Vera Twomey. I completely understand Vera’s great concern for her daughter, Ava, I have met Vera on four occasions and my Department has been in ongoing contact with her to inform her of the options open to her personally as well as keeping her informed of general developments. I met with Vera last Thursday along with the Chief Medical Officer, senior officials from my Department and from the HPRA, when we provided an update on her own situation and our efforts to address the issue of placing medicinal cannabis on an appropriate regulatory and clinical service basis for the first time in the history of the state. Most recently, I emailed Vera last night and my office was in touch with her to let her know of this contact. On the 3 rd of November, I initiated Ireland’s first ever policy review on the use of cannabis for medical reasons when I asked the HPRA to provide expert advice on the matter. On the 1 st of December, Deputy Gino Kenny’s Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 was debated by the Dail. Despite having some concerns about elements of the Bill, I did not oppose the Bill continuing in the legislative process because my own policy intention was clear from the initiation of the HPRA review and in recognition of the shared aim of many Oireachtas members to see progress for patients who believe cannabis may be a treatment for their conditions. I undertook to provide the HPRA report to the Oireachtas Health Committee to assist in its deliberations and I have done so. Deputy Gino Kenny’s Bill is proceeding to the next stage which is pre-legislative scrutiny at the Committee. I understand a date of 5 th of April has been set for Deputy Gino Kenny to attend the Committee and the 13 th April has been set for Department of Health officials and the HPRA to attend. I have written to the Committee yesterday asking if this matter could be considered as a priority. On foot of the publication of the HPRA report on the 10 th of February and, based on its recommendations, I subsequently announced my intention to establish an access programme for cannabis based treatments for the conditions recommended by the HPRA, This includes: Severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications. Spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions; Intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes; My Department is now progressing the establishment of this access programme as a priority. However, it is important to understand that patients accessing cannabis through this programme will need to be recommended for it by their medical consultant. It is within my power <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>licence</b> for access to cannabis for a named patient once the application is supported by relevant clinicians involved in the patient’s care. One such application has been granted. A second application was received by the Department on the 31 st January, however, this application was not supported by any consultant caring for the patient but the application process remains open and I have asked my officials to treat any and all applications with the utmost priority. As Minister for Health, I cannot grant a licence to an application that is not supported by relevant clinicians treating named patients...|$|E
