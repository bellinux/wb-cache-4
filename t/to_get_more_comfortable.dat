How do I make sure New Orleans is not overrun with Mexican workers". This was {{in response to a question}} from the audience. Some Hispanic groups, including the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, criticized Nagin's statement, although those attending the town hall meeting reportedly applauded - many believing jobs should first go to locals displaced by the hurricane. Nagin went on to say this was the city's biggest economic opportunity and urged New Orleanians <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> working beside someone who did not look like them, as everyone's help was needed. During a subsequent interview on Telemundo with Jose Diaz-Balart, Nagin praised the great work Hispanic workers did in New Orleans and said the city would not have recovered without them.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Martinez convinces {{the flock}} (mainly Max) {{that they should}} visit the Gen-77 kids. They all take a plane to see the kids, but Max decides to fly herself. On the way the plane runs into a trap. Transparent {{floating}} balloons connected {{to the ground with}} razor wire, hit the plane and rip its wings off. As the plane spirals out of control the flock takes action. Max's mom, Jeb, and Dr. Hans can't fly so they try to carry them. Iggy and Nudge get caught in the wire and begin to free fall, Max catches her mother, but Jeb is falling. Gazzy tries to catch him, but is too weak to support the weight, Jeb tells Gazzy [...] "the human race will have to die, to save the planet...just as I will have to die to save you." [...] Jeb lets go. Before he plummets to his death Dylan catches him. Angel, and Gazzy then help stabilize Iggy and Nudge. Everyone lands relatively safe. In the confusion Dr. Hans disappears. Dylan and Max go to look for his body, but do not find him. They stop by a school on the way and snipers shoot at them. Max thinks that they are [...] "whitecoats" [...] but Dylan saw (with his super vision) that they were kids without eyes. They then camp out in a part of a cave where Dylan tells Max about the constellations. Max begins <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with Dylan and eventually falls asleep beside him, with his arm around her shoulder. She notices how well her body fits in with his and calls it a [...] "perfect fit" [...] Angel finds Max and Dylan and they go back to the Gen 77 headquarters where the three of them encounter the [...] "kids without eyes" [...] again. After a brief fight, Max, Dylan, and Angel get {{a closer look at the}} children. In reality, they have eyes all around the middle of their head, giving them 360 degree vision, hence the aim. The Gen-77 kids then tell Max and the others that they are more advanced and that they need to [...] "kill the humans" [...] to make the world better. They then proceed to attack the group again. Max, Dylan, and Angel are able to get away but while they are flying, they notice a familiar face. They land and find Mike, the computer guy, under the hypnotic spell of the Doomsday group. When they get home, Ella and Iggy are under the spell also. Dylan, Max, Angel, Iggy, and Ella go to a rally at Ella's school, where Iggy begins a chant of [...] "kill the humans!" [...] The gang takes Iggy back home, leaving Ella behind. They are able to revert him to normal with a cold shower and some mind control by Angel. They find out from Nudge, Gazzy, and Total that Jeb and Dr. Martinez have disappeared without a trace. They all reluctantly come to the conclusion that they are involved with the Doomsday Group. They make a pact with each other to never again trust a grown-up. The group finds Ella at a campfire, singing a song about saving the earth. They are able to capture her and change her back to normal, but they quickly lose her again. She leaves a note saying that she was meant to have wings.|$|E

5000|$|In 2016, Pitta {{announced}} {{that he was going to}} return to football whenever he was cleared to play. He resumed full practice on September 7, 2016 and played in the season opening game on September 11, 2016 in Baltimore where he had 3 receptions for 39 yards. [...] In Week 2 against the Cleveland Browns, Pitta had a game-high nine catches for 102 yards ‚Äî the second 100-yard game of his career. On Pitta's return, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco said, [...] "If he was coming back, I knew he would be productive. Last year, when he came back for a couple of weeks of practice and they decided to not have him play, he looked good. He looked like himself. I think he's going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> as the year goes on. We just have to keep him healthy." [...] On December 4 against the Miami Dolphins, Pitta scored in a game for the first time since Week 14 of the 2013 season. Pitta finished the game with 9 catches for 90 yards and two touchdown receptions in the 38-6 victory. Pitta had statistically his best season, recording a career-high 86 receptions, most in the league by a tight end, and a career-high 729 yards, although he only caught two touchdown passes. Pitta also recorded his first career fumble during the game against Miami.|$|R

40|$|I {{have found}} through my {{experience}} at The University of Rhode Island that {{two things are}} lacking; attention to the arts, and conversation about mental illness. Books are not only used as an educational tool for literacy among children {{but also as a}} way to introduce challenging topics. Combining my two majors, Art and Psychology, I aimed to create a real life tool that exposes children to the topic of mental health. The targeted age group for this book is between 4 through 6 years. By introducing this conversation to children at an appropriate level of learning, my hope is that future generations will grow to be aware of and sensitive to the multitude of issues involving mental health. The first step during this process was to develop a character that is relatable toa wide audience, but also suffers from Germaphobia, an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I created a 7 -year old boy named Henry. Henry is just like every other child and enjoys common activities such as art, sports, and writing. Yet the activity of ‚Äòcircle time‚Äô, a common practice in elementary schools where children sit on the ground, gives him chronic stress due to his irrational fear of germs. Henry works to overcome this obstacle through family therapy, utilizing breathing techniques, and exposure therapy. I wanted to convey that there are resources available for a child with mental illness and that they are not alone in their fight. Henry also is seen overcoming an obstacle, but not without difficulty. This was included in the story to show that children do have the ability to overcome obstacles of mental health but it is a process that does not include an immediate cure. Images are created by carving into linoleum with a sharp tool of varying widths. The panel then goes through the printing press covered with ink. A large amount of pressure is exerted imprinting the image onto a piece of paper. I chose to work with linoleum due to its ability to produce raw images and significant contrast. I felt that the images would be able to translate content more clearly than alternative media. I also wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> in this medium, as it is related to the art of the illustrated book. To create the book, I used the process of a storyboard. A storyboard deals with space, time, sequence, and narrative. The largest challenge of this project was to take a mature subject and re-imagine it at a new level. I worked to create sentences and compositions that convey the message of a mature concept, but have it be understood by a child. To do this there needed to be continuity in the imagery style, which proved to be difficult stylistically. Also, the syntax of the book needed to be at an elementary level while also effectively telling a story. The purpose of illustration is to build an understanding between words and pictures. The combination of words and images allows for higher levels of comprehension for a child by targeting more of the senses...|$|E
40|$|Acquaintance rape {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} among the student population and it can be seen in their social life, such as at parties and/or in date situations. Compared with stranger rape, the victims of acquaintance rape tend to suffer more from self blame, or even fail to label their experience as rape due to the closeness of the relationship with the offender. As a result, the effort to provide proper information regarding acquaintance rape and to prevent it has been made and there is currently several prevention programs organized at educational institution in North America. Although international students in North America have the same potential of victimization, it is rare for minorities to be involved in the prevention program. Due to their cultural background, international students have the possibility to increase their risk of victimization and may be reluctant to seek help even after being victimized. For example, Japanese people tend to avoid confrontations and use indirect communication in order to keep harmony in interpersonal relationships this communication type may cause them to fail to decline risky invitations for what becomes recognized as acquaintance rape. This project proposes the necessity of a culturally sensitive prevention program for international students in North America in order to obtain proper knowledge about acquaintance rape and its prevention, to train assertive communication skills in English, and <b>to</b> <b>get</b> familiar and <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with connecting with available support systems in North, taking Japanese females as a sample targeted population.
