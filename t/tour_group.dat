5|$|Jurassic Park's lead {{computer}} programmer, Dennis Nedry, {{having been}} bribed by Hammond's corporate rival Lewis Dodgson, deactivates the park's security system {{to gain access}} to the embryo storage room where he steals the valuable fetilized embryos. Nedry stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as Barbasol shaving cream, supplied by Dodgson. Because of Nedry, the power goes out and the tour vehicles become stuck. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the <b>tour</b> <b>group.</b> Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the Tyrannosaurus injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.|$|E

The quota of the Hong Kong <b>Tour</b> <b>Group</b> Scheme of Mainland visitors has been abolished since January 2002. The number of Mainland travel agents authorized to organize such tours has also increased significantly. Nationals from some 170 countries can visit Hong Kong visa free for period from seven days to 180 days. The Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) was introduced on 28 July 2003. The Scheme has been gradually extended and now covers Guangdong province, Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Tianjin and nine cities in Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

They overpowered him and contacted the police, leading to his capture. During interrogation, Sobhraj's accomplices, Barbara and Mary Ellen, quickly buckled and confessed.

25|$|This first plotline is {{interspersed}} with scenes of Richard and Susan, who came on vacation to Morocco {{to get away}} from and mend their own woes. The death of their infant third child, to SIDS, has strained their marriage significantly and they struggle to communicate their frustration, guilt, and blame. When Susan is shot on the tour bus, Richard orders the bus driver to the nearest village, Tazarine. There, a local veterinarian sews up Susan's wound to stem the loss of blood. Richard contacts the US embassy to request an ambulance. The other tourists wait for some time, but they eventually demand to leave, fearing the heat and that they may be the target of further attacks. Richard tells the <b>tour</b> <b>group</b> to wait for the ambulance, which never arrives, and eventually the bus leaves without them. The couple stays behind with the bus's tour guide, Anwar, still waiting for transport to a hospital. Political issues between the US and Morocco prevent quick help, but eventually a helicopter arrives and carries Richard and Susan to a hospital in Casablanca, where she is expected to recover. Richard calls his children's nanny, Amelia, from the hospital, and they agree not to tell the children that Susan has been shot yet. Richard cries as his son tells him about his day at school.|$|E

40|$|The <b>group</b> <b>tour</b> {{market is}} a market that is {{currently}} undergoing some fundamental changes. Many had predicted that this market would die out {{with the rise of}} technology, Internet and changes in consumer behaviour. This study aimed at investigating if <b>group</b> <b>tour</b> operators and Convention and Visitors Bureaus (CVBs) recognized changes in the <b>group</b> <b>tour</b> market and at examining ways that they sought to react to those changes. The study revealed that destinations who have acted upon consumer changes have become successful <b>group</b> <b>tour</b> destinations. <b>Group</b> <b>tour</b> operators also appear {{to be aware of the}} changes in the market and are implementing changes and approaches in their offerings as well. There were several trends that this study discovered. The first is that tour structures are changing such as flexible itineraries and hub and spoke <b>tours.</b> Second, <b>group</b> <b>tour</b> planners have specific information needs and CVBs and suppliers should accommodate those needs. Third, the path to <b>group</b> <b>tour</b> planners leads through consumers. Fourth, there is a focus on emerging markets such as student groups and soft adventure <b>tours.</b> Fifth, <b>group</b> <b>tours</b> expect special accommodations from suppliers such as group rates, motorcoach parking and behind the scenes tours. Finally, CVBs are a key player in the iv <b>group</b> <b>tour</b> market. While the results from this study provided important insights, there is still a need for more research regarding the <b>group</b> <b>tour</b> market and its new customers.

500|$|During the tour, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) argues with Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{about what}} he claims is the northernmost battle of the Civil War: the Battle of Schrute Farms.

After tracking down a historian, Dwight and Oscar learn that the Battle of Schrute Farms did in fact take place. However, the [...] "battle" [...] was really a code term. During the Civil War, Schrute Farms was a safe haven for artists and poets (and, as heavily implied, homosexuals). Oscar finds this fascinating, whereas Dwight leaves in disgust.
