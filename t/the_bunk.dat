5|$|Wiesel was 16 when Buchenwald was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945, {{too late}} for his father, who died after a beating while Wiesel lay silently on <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> above {{for fear of being}} beaten too. He moved to Paris after the war and in 1954 {{completed}} an 862-page manuscript in Yiddish about his experiences, published in Argentina as the 245-page Un di velt hot geshvign ("And the World Remained Silent"). The novelist François Mauriac helped him find a French publisher. Les Éditions de Minuit published 178 pages as La Nuit in 1958, and in 1960 Hill & Wang in New York published a 116-page translation as Night.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
500|$|Begging {{for water}} one night from his bunk, {{where he has}} lain for a week, Chlomo is beaten {{on the head with}} a {{truncheon}} by an SS officer for making too much noise. Eliezer lies in <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> above and does nothing for fear of being beaten too. He hears his father make a rattling noise, [...] "Eliezer." [...] In the morning, 29 January 1945, he finds another man in his father's place. The Kapos had come before dawn and taken Chlomo to the crematorium.|$|E

6000|$|Roberts {{caught his}} eye, and, {{with a nod}} and {{a wave of his}} hand, {{indicated}} <b>the</b> <b>bunks.</b> <b>The</b> fellow rose from the locker, and, amid a breathless silence, climbed into one of them—Jem Dadd’s! ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>bunk</b> {{house is}} a single story {{rectangular}} building with a gable roof.

[...] It has shiplap exterior siding and rough pine interior walls. [...] Windows and doors are simple with no molding. [...] Like the main house, it was placed on a concrete slab when it was moved to its current location in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|The rabbi's wife tries {{in vain to}} {{stop her}} children, aged four and eight, {{fighting}} in her bunk. Her neighbours, kept awake by the din, swear at them. A woman screams because a mouse has run over her face. Bedbugs drop from the higher bunks onto the lower. Another woman screams because the little boy in <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> above her has spilled the jam jar he uses as a chamber pot all over her. Somebody has whooping cough. Another little boy begs his mother not to beat him because in his sleep he wet <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> he shares with her. She does and he squeals. A former night-club dancer tells dirty stories about her ex-colleagues to the refined Orthodox language teacher, who does not know whether to block her ears or to laugh. A spoilt rich wife has hung her clothes on all available nails, leaving no room for anybody else. The passage ends with: [...] "In 24 out of 24 hours there is never a minute's silence ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boyd’s {{original}} ranch covered [...] {{and included}} a main house, bunk house, ice house, barn, hay shed, power house, corrals, feedlots, and a slaughterhouse {{as well as}} pastures and hay fields. [...] However, only main house, bunk house, and ice house have survived into the 21st century. [...] The main ranch house was built by Charles Boyd in 1905. [...] <b>The</b> <b>bunk</b> house was constructed shortly after the main house and an ice house {{was added to the}} ranch complex in 1909. [...] Today, these three building make up the Charles Boyd Homestead historic site just north of the Bend city limits.|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, Eilis Lacey is a {{young woman}} from Enniscorthy, County Wexford, {{a small town in}} {{southeast}} Ireland, where she lives with her mother and sister Rose. She is unable to find employment, other than working weekends at a shop run by the spiteful Miss Kelly, nicknamed [...] "Nettles Kelly", and is not interested in the local young men. Her sister writes to an Irish priest (Father Flood) in Brooklyn who arranges for her to go to the US to find a better future. She leaves but suffers from seasickness on the voyage and ends up being locked out of the toilet by her cabin neighbours. The woman in <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> below her, an experienced traveller, helps her, giving her advice and support.|$|E
60|$|As I {{dragged the}} {{mattress}} out of <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> {{it seemed to}} disintegrate in mid-air, {{at the same time}} bursting into flames. I beat out the burning remnants of straw in <b>the</b> <b>bunk,</b> then made a dash for the deck for fresh air.|$|E
60|$|And Kwaque it was {{who pulled}} Michael through the {{port-hole}} into Dag Daughtry's stateroom {{and waited for}} that worthy to arrive by the roundabout way of the door. After a quick look {{around the room and}} a sniff of <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> and under <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> which informed him that Jerry was not present, Michael turned his attention to Kwaque.|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{is the way}} it was. I {{had just}} got on my shoes and pants and shirt, and had started to get out of <b>the</b> <b>bunk.</b> There I was, {{sitting on the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>bunk,</b> my legs {{dangling}} down, when the locomotives came together. The berths, upper and lower, on the opposite side had already been made up by the porter.|$|E

60|$|Immediately {{after the}} burial, an iron pot of red coals {{was placed in}} <b>the</b> <b>bunk,</b> and in it two handfuls of coffee were roasted.

6000|$|... "D'you reckon you're {{here for}} good, you blamed hibernating deadbeats?" [...] {{he asked the}} {{occupants}} of <b>the</b> <b>bunks.</b> [...] "Turn out and get busy before I put a move on you!" ...|$|R
60|$|I visited {{one or two}} of these, well-ventilated {{places that}} in cold weather are warmed by means of hot-water pipes to a heat of about 70 deg., as the {{clothing}} on <b>the</b> <b>bunks</b> is light.|$|R
60|$|The scuttle was open, and the seamen’s lusty snores {{fell upon}} his ears like sweet music. He backed down the ladder, and groped in the {{darkness}} towards <b>the</b> <b>bunks</b> with outstretched hand. One snore stopped instantly.|$|R
60|$|Jerry, who {{had never}} had malaria, did not understand. But in his heart he knew great trouble in that Skipper was in trouble. Skipper did not {{recognize}} him, even when he sprang into <b>the</b> <b>bunk,</b> walked across Skipper's heaving chest, and licked the acrid sweat of fever from Skipper's face. Instead, Skipper's wildly-thrashing arms brushed him away and flung him violently {{against the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>bunk.</b>|$|E
60|$|A small, dirty {{face with}} matted hair {{protruded}} from <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> above the cook and eyed him sleepily.|$|E

60|$|The little whipper-snapper {{poked his}} nose into the cuddy, {{and pretended to}} be nearly {{overcome}} by the odor of the place, therefore he sent the marines below to overturn everything in <b>the</b> <b>bunks,</b> as if believing we had somebody hidden there.|$|R
5000|$|... "Picture to {{yourself}} a tarpaper shack 79 feet x 24 with no windows, along each side {{there is a}} row of double decker bunks, these are spaced off with 8 × 1 board {{so that there is}} room for two men in each <b>bunk.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bunks</b> are filled with straw and you crawl into them from the foot end. Along the front of <b>the</b> lower <b>bunk</b> a narrow board is placed upon which the men may sit. The place is very meagerly lighted and ventilation by three skylights.... So narrow is the passageway between <b>the</b> <b>bunks</b> that when <b>the</b> men are sitting on the bench there is scarcely room to pass between them. This shack houses 88 men.... At times the place reeks of the foul smell and at night the air is simply fetid. The floor is dirty {{and the end of the}} shack where the men wash ... is caked with black mud. The toilet is thoroughly filthy, unsanitary, and far too small." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Man alive!" [...] {{continued}} Jack Molloy, striking {{his huge}} fist on his thigh with emphasis; [...] "it's {{a wonderful place}} is this Welcome! An' it's a lively place too. Why, a fellow hanged his-self in one o' <b>the</b> <b>bunks</b> overhead not long ago." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon {{this the}} men rushed toward <b>the</b> <b>bunk,</b> Max with the light, which he {{held to the}} man's face.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy kept still. Donkin put {{his hands}} in his pockets, and in one slouching stride came up to <b>the</b> <b>bunk.</b>|$|E
60|$|Father Lucien {{crossed the}} floor and after {{standing}} for a time beside <b>the</b> <b>bunk</b> came back and sat down by the stove.|$|E
50|$|The cage {{had four}} metal bunk beds with three beds each along <b>the</b> sides. <b>The</b> <b>bunks</b> had metal strips {{to support the}} bedding. There was a metal barrel in the center for a fire. Canvas was used to cover the sides in cold weather.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{the inner}} room is now waist high in water. Only Pike is {{standing}} in the cold water, pleading with everyone to do something otherwise he will drown. Hodges is floating in a tank, the rest of the platoon is crammed onto <b>the</b> <b>bunks.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The {{proprietor}} of The Boston Events turned about, {{and began to}} look over the arrangements of the interior; the other ladies went with him, conversing, in low tones. [...] "These must be the places where the men sleep," [...] they said, gazing at <b>the</b> <b>bunks.</b>|$|R
