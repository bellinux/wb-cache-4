Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta <b>turned</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> role.

5|$|Addressing {{the loss}} of Pallister, Ferguson signed Jaap Stam from PSV Eindhoven, {{becoming}} the world's most expensive defender in a £10million deal.

Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E
