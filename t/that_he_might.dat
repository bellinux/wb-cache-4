5|$|Herennianus and Timolaus: the {{two were}} {{mentioned}} in the Augustan History and are not attested in any other source; Herennianus might be a conflation of Hairan and Herodianus while Timolaus is most probably a fabrication, although Dietmar Kienast suggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be Vaballathus.|$|E
5|$|Patton was {{a staunch}} fatalist, and {{believed}} in reincarnation. He believed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{have been a}} military leader killed in action in Napoleon's army in a previous life, or a Roman legionary.|$|E

5|$|During the Vietnam War, Clinton {{received}} educational draft deferments {{while he}} was in England in 1968 and 1969. He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and was aware <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> lose his draft deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{suggested}} to Erwin Schrödinger <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to}} reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, {{which will be the}} number of particles in it.|$|E
5|$|In December 1887, {{on the eve}} of his {{departure}} to tour as a guest conductor through Western Europe, Tchaikovsky stopped in Saint Petersburg and consulted with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov on a detailed program of Russian music <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> lead in Paris. Though this opportunity did not arise, it shows his openness to promoting works by the Belyayev circle as his duty to promote Russian music.|$|E

5|$|Kehoe's {{neighbor}} A. McMullen {{noted that}} Kehoe had stopped {{working on his}} farm altogether {{for most of the}} preceding year, and he thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be planning suicide. Kehoe had given him one of his horses about April 1927, but McMullen returned it for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after moving}} in, Eddy became close to another student, Daniel Spofford. He was 33 {{years old and}} married when he joined her class; he later left {{his wife in the}} hope <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> marry Eddy, but his {{feelings}} were not reciprocated. Spofford and seven other students agreed to form an association that would pay Eddy a certain amount a week if she would preach to them every Sunday. They called themselves the Christian Scientists' Association.|$|E
5|$|Starting with Rashomon, Kurosawa's {{productions}} {{had become}} increasingly large {{in scope and}} so had the director's budgets. Toho, concerned about this development, suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> help finance his own works, therefore making the studio's potential losses smaller, while in turn allowing himself more artistic freedom as co-producer. Kurosawa agreed, and the Kurosawa Production Company was established in April 1959, with Toho as majority shareholder.|$|E

60|$|Yet, {{notwithstanding}} these obstacles, he had, {{during the}} course of a few days, laboured so hard to introduce some degree of discipline into the army, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>might</b> hazard a second attack upon Glasgow with every prospect of success.|$|R
60|$|For {{death was}} very close to Sir Launcelot and there was but one thought in his mind and that thought was to return to Corbin. For even through his clouds of madness, Sir Launcelot wist that there at Corbin a great love awaited him and <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> <b>might</b> reach <b>that</b> place <b>he</b> <b>might</b> there have rest and peace; {{wherefore}} in this time of weakness and of pain, he willed to return to that place once more.|$|R
5|$|Tech kicker Chris Kinzer, who {{kicked the}} game-winning field goal, {{did not go}} on {{to play in the}} National Football League despite {{predictions}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> do so. He attended several NFL teams' tryouts, but a contract to play in the league never materialized. He sold insurance for several years, then reentered school and graduated from Virginia Tech in 1994 with a degree.|$|E
5|$|The attempt {{had great}} {{influence}} on Reagan's popularity; polls indicated {{his approval rating}} to be around 73%. Reagan believed that God had spared his life so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> go on to fulfill a greater purpose and, although not a Catholic, meetings with Mother Teresa, Cardinal Terence Cooke, and fellow shooting survivor Pope John Paul II reinforced his belief. Agent Parr {{came to believe that}} God had directed his life to save Reagan, and became a pastor.|$|E
5|$|The next night, Sasha {{realizes that}} she has {{feelings}} for Tigerstar, and misses a rabbit while being caught up in her thoughts. Turning around she sees that Tigerstar had caught it for her, criticizes her hunting technique, and tells her she needs someone to show her how to hunt properly. When Sasha asks who would teach her, he says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might.</b>|$|E

5|$|A 1788 {{letter in}} the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given. The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall that he could not win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation of Bourbon County, hoping <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to bribe his way free of his guards, Rupert was imprisoned in Linz. Lord Craven, also taken in the battle, {{attempted}} to persuade his captors {{to allow him to}} remain with Rupert, but was refused. Rupert's imprisonment was surrounded by religious overtones. His mother was deeply concerned <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be converted from Calvinism to Catholicism; his captors, encouraged by Emperor Ferdinand III, deployed Jesuit priests in an attempt to convert him. The Emperor went further, proffering the option of freedom, a position as an Imperial general and a small principality if Rupert would convert. Rupert refused.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson {{had focused}} the {{majority}} of his campaign activities on the New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011 that he would no longer campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> run as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering such a move. In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E

5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, {{he had no}} interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he {{would never be able to}} film his stories.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
5|$|At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened {{his room}} and focused the rays of {{sunlight}} coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate. On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15pm, and observed {{for half an hour}} until sunset at 3:53pm.|$|E
