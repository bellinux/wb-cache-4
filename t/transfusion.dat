5|$|Screening of donated blood, blood components, {{and solid}} organ donors, {{as well as}} donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue {{products}} for T. cruzi is mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented. Approximately 300,000 infected people live in the United States, which is likely the result of immigration from Latin American countries, {{and there have been}} 23 cases acquired from kissing bugs in the United States reported between 1955 and 2014. With increased population movements, the possibility of transmission by blood <b>transfusion</b> became more substantial in the United States. <b>Transfusion</b> blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the U.S., thus addressing and minimizing this risk.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reports of {{deterioration}} {{and death}} after platelet (PLT) <b>transfusions</b> {{in patients with}} thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) have led to recommendations {{that they should not}} be given except for life-threatening hemorrhage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Published reports of PLT <b>transfusions</b> in patients with TTP were systematically reviewed and data from the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry, an inception cohort of 382 consecutive patients, 1989 through 2007, were analyzed. RESULTS: A systematic review identified 34 publications describing outcomes of patients with TTP after PLT transfusions: 9 articles attributed complications to PLT <b>transfusions,</b> 4 suggested that they may be safe, and 21 articles did not comment about a relation between PLT <b>transfusions</b> and outcomes. Fifty-four consecutive patients from the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry were prospectively analyzed. ADAMTS 13 activity was less than 10 percent in 47 patients; also included were 7 patients whose activity was not measured but who may have been deficient. Thirty-three (61 %) patients received PLT <b>transfusions.</b> The frequency of death was not different between the two groups (p = 0. 971) : 8 (24 %) patients who received PLT <b>transfusions</b> died (thrombosis, 5; hemorrhage, 1; sepsis, 2) and 5 (24 %) patients who did not receive PLT <b>transfusions</b> died (thrombosis, 4; hemorrhage, 1). The frequency of severe neurologic events was also not different (p = 0. 190) : 17 (52 %) patients who received PLT <b>transfusions</b> (in 5 of these 17 patients, neurologic events only occurred before PLT <b>transfusions)</b> and 7 (33 %) patients who did not receive PLT <b>transfusions.</b> CONCLUSION: Evidence for harm from PLT <b>transfusions</b> in patients with TTP is uncertain...|$|R
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} in about 93% of blood transfusions using infected blood. In developed countries {{the risk of}} acquiring HIV from a blood <b>transfusion</b> is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed; for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008. In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and {{it is estimated that}} up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from <b>transfusion</b> of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections. Although rare because of screening, it is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Transfusion</b> is {{the second}} EP by the Australian rock group Powderfinger. It was {{released}} on 27 September 1993 by Polydor.

5|$|Youngs's {{career was}} {{abruptly}} cut short in 1926, {{when he was}} diagnosed with the kidney disorder that, at the time, was called Bright's disease.

40|$|BackgroundBlood <b>transfusions</b> {{can reduce}} {{mortality}} among children with severe malarial anaemia, {{but there is}} limited evidence quantifying the relationship between paediatric malaria and blood <b>transfusions.</b> This study explores {{the extent to which}} the use of paediatric blood <b>transfusions</b> is affected by the number of paediatric malaria visits and admissions. It assesses whether the scale-up of malaria control interventions in a facility catchment area explains the use of paediatric blood <b>transfusions.</b> MethodsThe study was conducted at a referral hospital for 13 rural health centres in rural Zambia. Data were used from facility and patient records covering all paediatric malaria admissions from 2000 to 2008. An interrupted time series analysis using an autoregression-moving-average model was conducted to assess the relationship between paediatric malaria outpatient visits and admissions and the use of paediatric blood <b>transfusions.</b> Further investigation explored whether the use of paediatric blood <b>transfusions</b> over time was consistent with the roll out of malaria control interventions in the hospital catchment area. ResultsFor each additional paediatric malaria outpatient visit, there were 0. 07 additional paediatric blood <b>transfusions</b> (95...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives Platelet <b>transfusions</b> are {{performed}} almost entirely according to expert experience. This study assessed {{the effectiveness of}} a restrictive guideline to reduce platelet <b>transfusions</b> in preterm infants. Methods A retrospective cohort of preterm infants with a birth weight of 50, 000 /ml were greater in Period 1. Among thrombocytopenic neonates, the percentage of transfused neonates and the number of <b>transfusions</b> were similar in both groups. Conclusion the restrictive guideline for platelet <b>transfusions</b> reduced the platelet count thresholds for neonatal <b>transfusions</b> without increasing the rate of ventricular haemorrhage.

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood <b>transfusion</b> may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|Blood <b>transfusion</b> was {{formerly}} the second-most common {{mode of transmission}} for Chagas disease, but {{the development and implementation}} of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E

5|$|Following their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took {{a holiday}} and planned an autumn tour in America, {{scheduled}} to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen {{were involved in a}} serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood <b>transfusion</b> saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written.|$|E
5|$|HCV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a <b>transfusion</b> {{is less than}} one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It {{is one of five}} known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{transmission}} {{is the most}} common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations. Transmission can occur when: body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, e.g., HIV; blood is exchanged by contaminated <b>transfusion</b> or needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., Epstein–Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; aerosols containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host, e.g., dengue.|$|E
50|$|Blood <b>transfusions</b> {{in those}} without {{symptoms}} {{is not recommended}} until the hemoglobin is below 60 to 80 g/L (6 to 8 g/dL). In those with coronary artery disease who are not actively bleeding <b>transfusions</b> are only recommended when the hemoglobin is below 70 to 80g/L (7 to 8 g/dL). Transfusing earlier does not improve survival. <b>Transfusions</b> otherwise should only be undertaken in cases of cardiovascular instability.|$|R
40|$|Jehovah’s Witnesses are {{considered}} unusual patients {{because of their}} refusal to receive blood <b>transfusions.</b> Some practitioners do not consider the increased risk of death associated with refusal of blood <b>transfusions</b> as a sufficient deterrent.

However, lifesaving <b>transfusions</b> may be needed later on, which raises additional and unique medical and ethical issues...|$|R
5|$|In 1979, Hergé was {{diagnosed}} with osteomyelofibrosis, necessitating a complete blood <b>transfusion.</b> His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them every two weeks, and then every week. On 25 February 1983, Hergé entered cardiac arrest and was hospitalised in intensive care at Brussels' Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc. He died there on 3 March. His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including Libération and Le Monde. In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir. In November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the Hergé Foundation. In 1988, Tintin magazine was discontinued.|$|E

40|$|Blood <b>transfusions</b> {{given to}} {{patients}} before renal transplantation {{are associated with}} improved subsequent graft survival. Non-specific lymphocyte inhibitory activity of plasma is demonstrated in those patients who have received blood <b>transfusions.</b> The activity is directed against the patient's own lymphocytes and is mainly associated with the alpha- 2 macroglobulin fraction of plasma. In an animal model blood <b>transfusions</b> are associated with improved graft survival, and {{the timing of the}} <b>transfusions</b> before transplantation is important. The administration of alpha- 2 macroglobulin is also important in prolonging graft survival. The therapeutic implications of these findings in clinical transplantation are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Why do some {{patients}} show beneficial effects of RBC <b>transfusions</b> while others do not? Friedlander et al. observed that RBC <b>transfusions</b> improved RBC deformability {{in patients with}} sepsis, probably by replacing rigid, endogenous RBCs by less dysfunctional, exogenous RBCs [55]. <b>Transfusions</b> may therefore be deleterious when performed in patients with preserved deformability, vasoreactivity, perfusion, and/or flow but may be favorable when performed in patients in whom these variables are markedly altered.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of therapeutic granulocyte <b>transfusions</b> was studied {{in a controlled}} trial involving 75 granulocytopenic patients with severe infections.
