5|$|The {{blue whale}} is usually {{classified}} {{as one of}} eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, Sibbaldus, {{but this is not}} accepted elsewhere. DNA sequencing analysis indicates that the blue whale is phylogenetically closer to the sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to the humpback whale (Megaptera) and the gray whale (Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis). If further research confirms these relationships, it will be necessary <b>to</b> <b>reclassify</b> the rorquals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision <b>to</b> <b>reclassify</b> 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E

5|$|Scelidosaurus was an ornithischian. It was {{the oldest}} ornithischian known until the {{description}} of Geranosaurus in 1911. During the twentieth century, it has been classified at different times as an ankylosaur or stegosaur. Alfred von Zittel (1902), William Elgin Swinton (1934), and Robert Appleby et al. (1967) identified the genus as a stegosaurian, though this concept then encompassed all armoured forms. In a 1968 paper, Romer argued it was an ankylosaur. In 1977, Richard Thulborn of the University of Queensland attempted <b>to</b> <b>reclassify</b> Scelidosaurus as an ornithopod similar to Tenontosaurus or Iguanodon. Thulborn argued Scelidosaurus was a lightly built bipedal dinosaur adapted for running. Thulborn's 1977 theories on the genus have since been rejected.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus {{was first}} {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 as Agaricus vietus in his Systema Mycologicum. In his 1838 work Epicrisis systematis mycologici, Fries reclassified the species as a Lactarius, giving it its current name. |publisher=CAB International |work=Index Fungorum |accessdate=27 December 2010}} Subsequent attempts <b>to</b> <b>reclassify</b> the {{species have been}} unsuccessful. In his 1871 work Der Führer in die Pilzkunde, Paul Kummer reclassified the species {{as a member of}} Galorrheus, and in Otto Kuntze's 1891 Revisio generum plantarum, the species was placed in the genus Lactifluus. Both Galorrheus vietus and Lactifluus vietus are now considered obligate synonyms (different names for the same species based on one type) of Lactarius vietus. The specific epithet is from the Latin , meaning shrunken. It is commonly known as the grey milkcap.|$|E
5|$|The {{identified}} seven ecotypes inhabit isolated ecological niches. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys on minke whales, {{the second}} on seals and penguins {{and the third}} on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations, as discussed above. The research supported a proposal <b>to</b> <b>reclassify</b> the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients as a distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would mean that each new species becomes subject to separate conservation assessments.|$|E

5|$|A {{long-lived}} system {{developed on}} February28 in the Australian region south of February28, and moved westward. On March7, the JTWC initiated advisories {{on the system}} as Tropical Cyclone 26S, briefly estimating peak 1-minute winds of 65km/h (40mph) the next day. Soon after, the system weakened into a tropical depression, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean late on March8. At that time, it was designated Tropical Disturbance E2. Continuing westward along {{the northern edge of}} a strong ridge, the disturbance failed to intensify due to easterly wind shear. Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories, they noted that a distinct circulation persisted, reaching a location to the north of Mauritius by March16. That day, it turned back to the east with a sporadic area of convection, influenced by the larger Tropical Depression E3. Two days later, the system organized enough for the MFR <b>to</b> <b>reclassify</b> it as a tropical disturbance. The system failed to reorganize much, and dissipated on March20. Another tropical disturbance, named E3, formed on March11 in the eastern portion of the basin. It initially failed to develop more, but after an increase in convection, the system intensified into a tropical depression on March14 while moving generally west-northwestward. On the next day, the system began drifting to the southwest due to weak steering currents. On March16, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 28S, briefly upgrading it to tropical storm status on the next day. On March18, the depression began weakening, dissipating three days later.|$|E

Current studies show that giant viruses can be found worldwide in the soil, water, animals and humans.
