5|$|Among the 15 known {{isotopes}} of mendelevium (mass {{numbers from}} 245 to 260), the most studied is 256Md, which mainly decays through the electron capture (α-radiation is ≈10%) with the half-life of 77 minutes. Another alpha emitter, 258Md, has a half-life of 53 days. Both these isotopes are produced from rare einsteinium (253Es and 255Es respectively), <b>that</b> <b>therefore</b> limits their availability.|$|E
5|$|Other {{relationships}} {{include the}} algorithmic analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, {{the finding that}} traditional batiks from different regions of Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory of perspective, which eventually led to Girard Desargues's projective geometry. A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and <b>that</b> <b>therefore</b> the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{also consider the}} connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and <b>that</b> <b>therefore</b> the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E

5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and <b>that</b> <b>therefore</b> evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E
5|$|B. bufo {{is part of}} {{a species}} complex, a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated. Several modern species are {{believed}} to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad (B. spinosus), the Caucasian toad (B. verrucosissimus) and the Japanese common toad (B. japonicus). The European common toad (Bufobufo) seems to have arisen more recently. It is believed that the range of the ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred {{as a result of the}} development of the Central Asian Deserts during the Middle Miocene. The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear. A serological investigation into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the blood serum proteins of Bufoverrucosissimus and Bufospinosus. It found that the differences between the two were not significant and <b>that</b> <b>therefore</b> the former should be synonymized with the latter.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} {{argument}} in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and <b>that</b> <b>therefore</b> the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E

5|$|In August 1934, the Bassendean Road Board {{applied to}} the Lands Department to change {{the portion of the}} Perth–Guildford road within its {{district}} to Great Eastern Highway. The department refused the request, reasoning that most traffic bound for Midland used The Causeway and travelled {{on the south side of}} the Swan River, and <b>that</b> <b>therefore</b> the Perth–Guildford road should not be part of the main highway. Despite this setback, the Perth Road Board organised a local government conference to consider renaming the road from Perth to Guildford. The issue was considered important, as losing the name to the south side of the river would divert traffic away from the old established centres to the north. The straightening of dangerous bends and the replacement of an old bridge between Bassendean and Guildford were also to be considered. The conference, held on 7 September 1934, was attended by representatives of the Perth, Bayswater, Bassendean, and Guildford road boards, and the Midland Junction Council. Guildford and Midland Junction were still opposed to the renaming, but the others were supportive. Motions that passed included submitting a rename proposal to the state government, urging the government to construct a new bridge at Bassendean, and approaching the government to have the road declared a main road.|$|E
5|$|The {{contention}} that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate {{that a number of}} classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian league, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) thetes, slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is evidence that she is accounted for. That what we now see {{was meant to be a}} generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and <b>that,</b> <b>therefore</b> these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he points out, the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War, is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s {{contention that}} the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.|$|E
