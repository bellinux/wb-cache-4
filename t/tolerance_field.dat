Field's research focuses on mechanisms of acquired immunologic tolerance by studying mouse models of neonatal tolerance and acquired tolerance in the adult. Acquired tolerance in the adult is accomplished using total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and hematopoietic cell transfer to establish donor mixed-chimerism.

40|$|Different {{strategies}} for modelling {{and reducing the}} effect of uncertainties on the dynamic behaviour of coupled structures are discussed in this paper. in assembled structures, each component satisfies specifications about material properties and dimensional tolerances. Variability of design specifications within the <b>tolerance</b> <b>field</b> may affect the dynamic behaviour of the assembled structure more than that of any individual component substructure. Among modelling strategies, non-predictive techniques such as post-processing of data from a set of randomly assembled structures and analysis of sensitivities to uncertain variables are considered. However, {{emphasis is placed on}} a less trivial yet simple strategy {{such as the use of}} design of experiments to fit a regression model. Different reduction strategies are considered according to whether small design changes (even revised tolerance allocation) are still possible or not. In the latter case, selective assembly is extended to problems where the performance requirement is not the clearance between two parts, but a prescribed dynamic behaviour. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: Optically {{reconfigurable}} gate arrays, which consist simply of a holographic memory, a {{laser diode}} ar-ray, and a gate array VLSI, have a perfect parallel programmable capability. Even if a gate array VLSI includes defective areas, the perfect parallel programmable capability allows perfectly avoidance of those defective areas; instead, the remaining area on the gate array is used. Therefore, the architecture enables fabrication of large die VLSI chips and even wafer scale integrations using the latest processes with a high fraction of defects. Moreover, holographic memory is well-known to have high defect-tolerance because each bit of a reconfiguration context {{can be stored in}} the entire holographic memory and the damage of some component rarely affects its diffraction pattern or reconfiguration context. Therefore, the architecture has a high manufacturing-defect tolerance. In this paper, the high manufacturing-defect tolerance of optically programmable architectures is clarified using a single context prototype optically programmable architecture, which combines a liquid crystal spatial light modulator as a holographic memory, a He-Ne laser, and a perfectly parallel optically programmable gate-array VLSI.

40|$|Early {{planting}} {{can contribute}} to increased grain yield of maize (Zea mays L.), but it requires cold tolerance. A limited number of cold-tolerant maize genotypes have been reported. The objectives {{of this study were}} to test a new strategy to improve cold tolerance in maize searching for broad x narrow genetic combinations that may be useful as base populations for breeding programs, to compare genotype performance under cold-controlled and field conditions, and to establish the major genetic effects involved in crosses between cold-tolerant inbred lines and populations. Nine cold-tolerant populations were crossed to five inbred lines and evaluated in a cold chamber and in the field. Most inbred line x population crosses performed better than populations per se or hybrids used as checks, both in the cold chamber and in the field, suggesting that broad x narrow genetic combination could be a suitable start point for further breeding programs for cold tolerance.

40|$|This review {{presents}} {{an overview of}} accomplishments on different aspects of cowpea breeding for drought tolerance. Furthermore it provides options to enhance the genetic potential of the crop by minimizing yield loss due to drought stress. Recent efforts {{have focused on the}} genetic dissection of drought tolerance through identification of markers defining quantitative trait loci (QTL) with effects on specific traits related to drought tolerance. Others have studied the relationship of the drought response and yield components, morphological traits and physiological parameters. To our knowledge, QTLs with effects on drought tolerance have not yet been identified in cowpea. The main reason is that very few researchers are working on drought tolerance in cowpea. Some other reasons might be related to the complex nature of the drought stress response, and partly to the difficulties associated with reliable and reproducible measurements of a single trait linked to specific molecular markers to be used for marker assisted breeding. Despite the fact that extensive research has been conducted on the screening aspects for drought tolerance in cowpea only very few¿like the `wooden box¿ technique¿have been successfully used to select parental genotypes exhibiting different mechanisms of drought <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Field</b> and pot testing of these genotypes demonstrated a close correspondence between drought tolerance at seedling and reproductive stages.
