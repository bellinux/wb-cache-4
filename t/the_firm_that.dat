The Jefferson Works built textile and agricultural machinery for a year before Rogers met the two men who would help transform the company into a major locomotive manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the design}} process, {{it was decided}} that the utmost concern was that the ships could be built quickly and placed into service. The ships were to discard the use of {{broadside}} belt armor below the waterline, the attachment of which was an extremely long process. It was believed that the higher speed of the class——would make up for the vulnerability to torpedo attack and make the armor unnecessary.The initial designs called for three main battery turrets, each mounting a pair of new 42cm guns, though this was later increased to four twin turrets. However, the work that would have been necessary to design and test the new turret clashed with U-boat construction, which had become the priority of the Navy. Krupp, <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>that</b> had been awarded the contract to conduct the testing, informed the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—the Imperial Navy Office) that design work on the new turret would have to wait. Capelle accepted the news without much objection. Nevertheless, the ships were never built. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918, which stated that capital ship construction had ground to a halt, primarily due to the shifting priorities to the U-boat war.|$|E

5|$|The {{color of}} the shellac was matched to closets where the wood had not been darkened by {{exposure}} to light. The mosaic floors were recreated by Italian craftsmen {{at a cost of}} $50 per square foot ($538.12 per square meter). A local firm was found that could reproduce the complicated process of sandblasting and hide glue application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced glass was used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. To recreate the doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>that</b> had created the original oak woodwork—and still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and carbon filament light bulbs were obtained to recreate the original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings.|$|E

Three years prior to bankruptcy, <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> subsequently reorganize are larger and have higher leverage than <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> subsequently liquidate. (This relationship remains constant for all three years studied.) Two years prior to bankruptcy filing, <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> eventually reorganize are more solvent and have higher levels of discretionary accruals than <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> eventually liquidate.

25|$|Den was the {{original}} landlord of The Queen Victoria. He perhaps is best remembered for his stormy love-hate relationship with his alcoholic first wife Angie (Anita Dobson). After nearly 19 years of marriage, he finally handed divorce papers {{to her in the}} 1986 Christmas Day episode that was watched by a record-breaking 30.15 million viewers, {{more than half of the}} UK population at the time. He was also well known for his later involvement with the criminal gang known as <b>The</b> <b>Firm</b> <b>that</b> eventually led to an attempt on his life in 1989. For 14 years, it was believed that the Firm's attempt on his life had been successful, but he returned to Walford in September 2003. Seventeen months later, his character was killed off again, this time for good, at the hands of his manipulative second wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman). Den's last appearance occurred one day before the 20th anniversary both the show and his character's first appearance.|$|E

In 1996, this same planned stadium competed with Wembley Stadium to gain funding to become the new national stadium, but the money was used to redevelop Wembley.|$|E

Bullen shared writing duties with Lizzie Mickery and Sally Wainwright. His inspiration from American television continued; following the premiere of The West Wing in 1999, he began outlining a British version, <b>The</b> <b>Firm,</b> <b>that</b> would be set in Buckingham Palace. The project never moved beyond planning stages because Bullen believed that British political issues such as [...] "cod wars with Spain" [...] are not as [...] "sexy" [...] as the issues covered in The West Wing.|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, <b>the</b> {{share of}} <b>firms</b> {{choosing}} layoffs of permanent employees as the “most important” strategy increases monotonically with {{the intensity of}} the shocks. Among <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> had faced a weak negative demand shock by summer 2009, only 13 % chose permanent employment as the “most important” cost to cut; among <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> faced a strong demand shock but a weak credit-constraint shock, that percentage increases to 18 %. The percentage almost doubles (to 31 %) among <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> faced both a strong credit and strong demand shocks.

After less than a year, Dassault began to actively undermine the AFVG project, working on two competing [...] "in-house" [...] projects: the variable geometry Mirage G and the Mirage F1. According to Wood, both Dassault and the French Air Force had been unenthusiastic for the project from the start, the latter wanting to pursue its own indigenous aircraft equipped with variable geometry wings, while the former had determined that the AFVG did not confirm with any of its future equipment plans. While Britain was keen to procure a capable strike aircraft, France wanted interceptor aircraft; these design requirements of these different roles were relatively exclusive of one another.|$|E

Sheindlin's producer allegedly told <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>that</b> use of her image is not permitted in March 2013, but ads continued to be produced.

Sheindlin further stated, [...] "Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better. The unauthorized use of my name is outrageous and requires legal action."

500|$|According to {{a letter}} filed with the UK Registrar of Companies, the {{auditors}} to Gyrus resigned [...] "partly because of its client's accounting for the securities". KPMG qualified Gyrus' accounts {{because they could not}} ascertain that Axam was not a related party. The auditors also took issue with the accounting treatment of the preference shares. In its audit letter to Gyrus Group dated 26 April 2010, KPMG considered that there were [...] "circumstances connected with our ceasing to hold office that should be {{brought to the attention of}} the company's members or creditors." [...] Ernst & Young, <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>that</b> succeeded KPMG, also expressed reservations about the 2010 Gyrus accounts for uncertainty, due to the lack of information about Axam. Bloomberg noted that both Gyrus annual reports were filed late: instead of filing within the nine-month statutory limit, the accounts were filed more than a year from the company's year end. In late November 2011 Michael Andrew, KPMG International global chairman, said his firm had complied with its legal obligations to pass on information related to Olympus's 2008 acquisition of Gyrus, and were removed as auditors for so doing. Andrew said: [...] "It's pretty evident to me there was very, very significant fraud and that a number of parties had been complicit." [...] However, the while the Japanese firm forced a ¥71 billion restatement of dubious valuation of certain acquired assets, the firm signed off on the financial statements in the same year that contained questionable figures other members of its global network in UK and elsewhere had apparently expressed grave reservations over.|$|E

No support was found for that an increased debt-to-equity was associated with lower firm performance, and there is not enough evidence to say whether the difference in long-term debt ratio had an impact on return on assets (ROA). However, <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> dilute family control are found to have higher probability to survive longer.
