40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the experimental development of once per revolution sensor chatter. In milling operation, self excited vibrations also called the chatter {{are one of the}} main factors that limit productivity. The project is used sensor chatter and non-sensor chatter to measure the variance of the signal sampled at a once per revolution rate. The sensor chatter {{is one of the main}} factors that lower the productivity. Higher efforts tend to accelerate tool wear and can lead to tool breakage. This project used the accelerometer to measures vibration and proper acceleration. The mounting of an accelerometer is easy but it is location must be carefully chosen. Indeed, if the sensor is close to a vibration node, signal amplitude would be very low. It is very difficult to put accelerometer on a rotating part. Beside that, the sensor tachometer (RPM gauge) is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a <b>tool</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> The device usually displays the revolutions per minute (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, but for this project the software of DasyLab that used can convert to revolution per second (RPS). A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and it is inverse. The result means the FFT operation, periodic functions will include changing the peak is not one, but two places. However, both these components are symmetric, so it was only necessary to see one to obtain frequency information. And providing information about the frequency, the FFT can be used to apply signal processing techniques such as filtering the signal and image compression is much easier to implement in the frequency domain. Detection of chatter, non-chatter and marginal chatter clearly can see in accelerometer, FFT and once per revolution signal. According to the results of machining experiment, it was proven that different parameter like spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut producing chatter vibration...|$|E

This study proposes a new methodology to overcome such limitations, which involves the design of machine tools with ultra-light structural components, and the development of strategies to counteract the loss of productivity as a consequence of lightweight machines. The new methodology includes the use of modular boxes built with carbon-fibre trusses, calculation of the dynamic stiffness of the new design, the identification of its weaknesses in terms of its cutting processes, and the design and integration of active damping systems in the machine to soften the expected vibrations under the most critical cutting conditions.

The rotating tool consists of multiple cutting edges (multipoint cutting tool). Normally axis of rotation of feed given to the work piece. Milling operation is distinguished from other machining operations on the basis of orientation between the tool axis and the feed direction; however, in other operations like drilling, turning, etc. the tool is fed in the direction parallel to axis of rotation. The cutting <b>tool</b> used in <b>milling</b> operation is called milling cutter, which consists of multiple edges called teeth.

40|$|Milling {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{manufacturing}} processes for automotive components, but its productivity is limited by the onset of regenerative chatter. This is a form of unstable self-excited vibration that occurs when the volume of material removed is too large for a particular spindle speed. This form of chatter is undesirable because it results in premature tool wear, poor surface finish on the machined component and the possibility of serious damage to the machine itself. The chatter stability of a milling process can be determined using well-established theory, provided that the frequency response of the flexible structure can be determined. In practice this usually involves the excitation of a stationery (non-rotating) <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> with a modal hammer, and measurement of the response of the tool with a co-located accelerometer. However, this measurement is not necessarily accurate due to amplitude dependency factor consideration.
