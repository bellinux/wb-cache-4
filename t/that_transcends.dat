5|$|The head {{is celebrated}} as {{a mark of}} {{identity}} as well as source of the seed. Thus, the self-decapitation represents removal of maya (illusion or delusion), physical attachment, false notions, ignorance, and egoism. The scimitar also signifies severance of these obstacles to moksha (emancipation), jnana (wisdom), and self-realization. The goddess also denotes discriminating perception. Chhinnamasta allows the devotee to gain a consciousness <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> the bonds of physical attachment, the body, and the mind by her self-sacrifice. One interpretation suggests that her three eyes represent the sun, the moon, and fire while another links the third eye to transcendental knowledge. Unlike other Hindu deities who are depicted facing the devotee, Chhinnamasta generally looks at herself, prompting the devotee to look within him- or herself.|$|E

25|$|Isaac of Nineveh was a 7th-century Assyrian {{bishop and}} theologian best remembered for his written work. He is also {{regarded}} as a saint in the Church of the East, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and among the Oriental Orthodox Churches, making him the last saint chronologically to be recognised by every apostolic Church. His feast day falls on January 28. Isaac is remembered for his spiritual homilies on the inner life, which have a human breadth and theological depth <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> the Nestorian Christianity of the Church to which he belonged. They survive in Syriac manuscripts and in Greek and Arabic translations.|$|E

25|$|The Orthodox Church, in {{understanding}} {{itself to be}} the Body of Christ, and similarly {{in understanding}} the Christian life {{to lead to the}} unification in Christ of all members of his body, views the church as embracing all Christ's members, those now living on earth, and also all those through the ages who have passed on to the heavenly life. The church includes the Christian saints from all times, and also judges, prophets and righteous Jews of the first covenant, Adam and Eve, even the angels and heavenly hosts. In Orthodox services, the earthly members together with the heavenly members worship God as one community in Christ, in a union <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> time and space and joins heaven to earth. This unity of the Church is sometimes called the communion of the saints.|$|E
25|$|Presented {{with this}} quasi-paradoxical situation, Sarkar offers {{a concept of}} {{progress}} as a society <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> material and technological development. Moving {{along the lines of}} the triple bottom line that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, PROUT advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities of what could be termed a „fourth bottom line“ , characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neo-humanistic will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the summum bonum of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.|$|E

Holden expressed that the song was [...] "an artistic triumph <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> its official nature". He noted that unlike Band Aid's [...] "Do They Know It's Christmas", the vocals on [...] "We Are the World" [...] were [...] "artfully interwoven" [...] and emphasized the individuality of each singer.

500|$|The first {{recording}} of Hair {{was made in}} 1967 featuring the off-Broadway cast. The original Broadway cast recording received a Grammy Award in 1969 for Best Score from an Original Cast Show Album and sold nearly 3million copies in the U.S. by December 1969. It charted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the last Broadway cast album to do so (as of 2016). It stayed at No. 1 for 13 weeks in 1969. The New York Times noted in 2007 that [...] "The cast album of Hair was... a must-have for the middle classes. [...] Its exotic orange-and-green cover art imprinted itself instantly and indelibly on the psyche.... became a pop-rock classic that, like all good pop, has an appeal <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> particular tastes for genre or period." [...] The 1993 London revival cast album contains new music that has been incorporated into the standard rental version.|$|E
500|$|Page {{stated that}} he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had [...] "light and shade". This began to be more clearly {{realised}} beginning with Led Zeppelin III, which made greater use of acoustic instruments. This approach {{has been seen as}} exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on [...] "Stairway to Heaven", which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds. Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and progressive sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs. They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and overdubbed guitar parts. Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement has been seen as producing an individualistic style <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> any single music genre. Ian Peddie argues that they were [...] "...loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also humorous, self-reflective and extremely subtle".|$|E

Bad won Best Engineered Recording – Non Classical in 1988 and Best Music Video – Short Form for [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] in 1990. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that Jackson [...] "approached" [...] Bad {{much the same way}} he approached Thriller, which was to [...] "take the basic formula of the predecessor, expand it slightly, and move it outward." [...] While the album [...] "rebounds with songs that prove mechanical can be tolerable if delivered with hooks and panache," [...] it still made Bad feel like an artifact of its time instead a piece of music <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> it", according to Erlewine.|$|E
500|$|Other music {{critics have}} {{compared}} the song to Romeo and Juliet, with society opposing a relationship based on socioeconomic status, or {{called it a}} look into society's view of romantic relationships. Ellie D. Hernández wrote in her book about Chicano culture that [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] addresses [...] "social and cultural desire <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> the boundaries of romantic love". According to Hernández, the song's central theme is class- and race-based social division [...] "that divides [...] from her beloved" [...] and [...] "suggests [...] hegemonic crisis informing Selena's lamentations." [...] Hernández wrote that the lyrics spoke about modern societal views on romantic relationships, and one must [...] "live in accordance" [...] with those views or face [...] "emotional banishment from [...] family and culture ... Risking everything for this love {{is not at all}} an innocent choice but a decision abundant with agency and consciousness that begins {{as a consequence of the}} forbidden." ...|$|E

Bennett joins the studio sessions later on, singing the song. The final chorus finds the two singers belting together, described as [...] "join forces for a peculiar, yet potent blend of styles <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> generations and genres". Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone complimented the video, saying that it [...] "proves [...] exude a unique, adorable brand of musical chemistry". After its release, [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" [...] debuted at number-one on the Jazz Digital Songs chart of Billboard, on the week ending September 6, 2014, and the French Singles Chart at number 173.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} of radiocarbon dating {{has had a}} profound impact on archaeologyoften described as the [...] "radiocarbon revolution". [...] In the words of anthropologist R.E. Taylor, [...] " [...] data made a world prehistory possible by contributing a time scale <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> local, regional and continental boundaries". It provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods, which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies (e.g. of stone tools or pottery); it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances. The advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology, since better data recording leads to firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested. These improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a [...] date was incorrect. Taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the need to focus so much of their energy on determining the dates of their finds, and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research. For example, from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a boom in}} {{interest}} in astrology in the late 1960s. The sociologist Marcello Truzzi described three levels of involvement of [...] "Astrology-believers" [...] to account for its revived popularity {{in the face of}} scientific discrediting. He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing [...] "next to nothing" [...] about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from [...] "tension-management of anxieties" [...] and [...] "a cognitive belief-system <b>that</b> <b>transcends</b> science." [...] Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a [...] "meaningful view of their universe and [...] them an understanding of their place in it." [...] This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a sacred canopy, whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.|$|E
