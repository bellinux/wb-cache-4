5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. The brain is the most sensitive. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to have children, and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> permanent. In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} reasons to think this <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> real. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen in such {{a wide range of}} patients, medical and surgical, unselected and selected. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> very {{consistent}} in terms of the degree of difference (10-15%).

5|$|Parsnip {{leaves are}} {{sometimes}} tunnelled by the larvae of the celery fly (Euleia heraclei). Irregular, pale brown passages {{can be seen}} between {{the upper and lower}} surfaces of the leaves. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> most serious on young plants, as whole leaves may shrivel and die.

5|$|He {{writes that}} these {{positive}} results are achieved {{in a number}} of ways. Sometimes the industry-sponsored studies are flawed by design (for example by comparing the new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose), and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely. In addition, the data is analysed as the trial progresses. If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published, or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer-term effects are not examined. He writes that this publication bias, where negative results remain unpublished, is endemic within medicine and academia. As a consequence, he argues, doctors may have no idea what <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> of the drugs they prescribe.|$|E

30|$|In occupations {{with more}} {{non-routine}} service content, we observe {{a very similar}} feature to the one observed for occupations with abstract contents, but <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> seems to <b>be</b> smaller, namely, those workers in occupations with more service content are becoming younger. In this case, and differently from what happened with occupations with more abstract content, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{found to be significant}} in the recession period. As in the previous two cases, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> stronger for males. Indeed, for females <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> not significant.|$|R

5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that {{when the universe was}} young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E
5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{to a greater or}} lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages of}} a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of a}} seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> in {{chemistry}} <b>is</b> a property of substituents or functional {{groups in a}} chemical compound. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> used in a qualitative way and describes the electron withdrawing or releasing properties of substituents based on relevant resonance structures and is symbolized by the letter M. <b>The</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> negative (-M) when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group and <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive (+M) when the substituent is an electron releasing group.|$|R

5|$|While some 700,000–1,000,000 Iraqis came to Jordan {{following}} the Iraq War in 2003, most have returned. Many Iraqi Christians (Assyrians/Chaldeans) however settled temporarily or permanently in Jordan. Immigrants also include 15,000 Lebanese who arrived {{following the}} 2006 Lebanon War. Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan {{to escape the}} violence in Syria. The kingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the flux of Syrian refugees places on the country. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> largely affecting Jordanian communities, as {{the vast majority of}} Syrian refugees do not live in camps. The refugee crisis effects include competition for job opportunities, water resources and other state provided services, along with the strain on the national infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} possible tennessine compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17picometers compared with the overall length of 195pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E

50|$|The {{next set}} of {{substituent}}s are the halogens, for which <b>the</b> substituent <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still positive but much more modest. The {{reason for this is}} that while <b>the</b> inductive <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still negative, <b>the</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive, causing partial cancellation. The data also show that for these substituents, <b>the</b> meta <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> much larger than <b>the</b> para <b>effect,</b> due to <b>the</b> fact that <b>the</b> mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> greatly reduced in a meta substituent. With meta substituents a carbon atom bearing the negative charge is further away from the carboxylic acid group (structure 2b).|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> side-jump <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{a manifestation}} of the spin orbit {{interaction}} in electron scattering from an atom/ion/impurity. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> has a broad interest because of its conceptual importance for generic spin-orbital physics, in particular <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> widely discussed in spintronics. We reexamine <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> accounting for <b>the</b> exact nonperturbative electron wave function inside the atomic core. We find that value of <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> much smaller than estimates accepted in literature. The reduction factor is 1 /Z^ 2, where Z is the nucleus charge of the atom/impurity. This implies that <b>the</b> side-jump <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> practically irrelevant for spintronics, the skew scattering and/or the intrinsic mechanism always dominate the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects...|$|R
