5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>and</b> reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>and</b> associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s, the Argentine {{government}} was {{dissatisfied with the}} lack of progress the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city's tramways by this point) had made in expanding the rest of <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>and</b> thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today Line C, a line which would link two of the city's most important rail terminals (Constitución and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF), in Spanish) began construction of the other Underground lines. Line C's first section, Constitución railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agustín P. Justo, then President of Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Concerning the {{development}} of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they {{would not be able to}} get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>and</b> found them supportive up to a certain limit.

5|$|The Voice is an American singing {{competition}} {{television series}} which premiered on NBC on April 26, 2011. Based {{on the original}} The Voice of Holland, the series features several stages of competition to search for new vocal talent contested by aspiring singers, age 15 or over, drawn from public auditions. The show has four coaches who choose their favourite artists during the audition rounds, and guide their selected teams through {{the remainder of the}} season. The winner is subsequently determined by television viewers; the prizes include $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Music Group. The Voice has been very successful since its premiere, drawing high ratings for <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>and</b> becoming one of the highest-rated shows in the country.|$|E
5|$|The city {{opened up}} bidding for the {{construction}} of the network in 2005, eventually receiving bids from eight different internet service providers. Of these eight, Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance about the lack of public hearings on the subject of <b>the</b> <b>network,</b> <b>and</b> from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan {{to be involved in the}} wireless internet business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions and lawsuits, which were key reasons for the lack of transparency in the process.|$|E

We analyse structural pathologies associated with the position in <b>the</b> <b>network,</b> its density as well as a type of links between the companies in <b>the</b> <b>network.</b> Our analysis begins with a review of the benefits from the functioning in <b>the</b> <b>network.</b> We then presented the major structural pathologies in <b>the</b> <b>networks</b> <b>and</b> their threats. Finally, we described the consequences of pathologies which can be considered on three levels: the company, intra-network relationships, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> as a whole...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} {{that had been}} required to provide effective coverage {{in response to the}} crises caused by the initial Japanese movements a review of the makeshift organisation was undertaken. In October 1942, the NGAWW Company was officially formed as part of New Guinea Force Signals to consolidate the Army, RAAF and Coastwatcher stations. Meanwhile, efforts were made to standardise equipment across <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>and</b> to implement common procedures. The company subsequently came under command of New Guinea Force Signals and its headquarters was established at 9-mile near Port Moresby. Captain Thomas Warren was in command of the company at this time. The establishment of the company at this time included a headquarters, a Moresby area section, a sub-area section, and a spotting station. Sub-area sections were raised as required and at various times were located at Milne Bay, Dobodura, Wau, Bena Bena, Bulolo, Nadzab, Gusap, Hollandia and Aitape. By the end of 1942 the company was maintaining 61 operational stations and had a strength of 180 men. In mid-1943, Warren was transferred to Milne Force and he handed over command temporarily to Captain Gordon King.|$|E

Starting in 2010, Fox played a recurring role in the US drama The Good Wife as crafty attorney Louis Canning and earned Emmy nominations for three consecutive years. In 2011, Fox was featured as himself in the eighth season of the Larry David vehicle, Curb Your Enthusiasm.
