5|$|The common {{blackbird}} breeds in temperate Eurasia, North Africa, the Canary Islands, and South Asia. It {{has been}} introduced to Australia and New Zealand. Populations are sedentary {{in the south and}} west of the range, although northern birds migrate south as far as northern Africa and tropical Asia in winter. Urban males are more likely <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> in cooler climes than rural males, an adaptation made feasible by the warmer microclimate and relatively abundant food that allow the birds to establish territories and start reproducing earlier in the year.|$|E
5|$|They are a {{hardy breed}} {{due to their}} native environment, the Highlands of Scotland. This results in long hair, giving the breed its ability <b>to</b> <b>overwinter.</b> Bulls can weigh up to 800kilograms (1,800 pounds) and cows up to 500kilograms (1,100 pounds). Their milk {{generally}} has a very high butterfat content, and their meat, regarded as of the highest quality, is gaining mainstream acceptance as it is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.|$|E
5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern Hemisphere) <b>to</b> <b>overwinter,</b> {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere {{are more likely to}} migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E
50|$|Commercial breeders provide {{stock to}} be used in {{education}} programs in elementary and secondary schools. Commercially bred monarchs migrate <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> sites in Mexico expanding the knowledge of migratory behavior.|$|R
50|$|Monarch tagging is {{a popular}} {{educational}} project for students. Captive/commercially bred monarchs have been known <b>to</b> migrate <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> sites in Mexico, although their success rate is much lower {{than it is for}} wild monarchs.|$|R
50|$|For {{experimental}} work, CIBER maintains and breeds its own bee {{stock of}} around 60 colonies, kept at an apiary {{on the campus}} of the University of Western Australia. During the winter month, most of the bee stock is moved north <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> grounds.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> there.|$|E
5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E
5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{observation}} was {{the primary}} method used when monarch migration studies began. These past sightings and recovery of tagged butterflies is information cited in publications even up to 2014. Direct observations are performed by laypeople, scientists and those residing close <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> sites.|$|R
50|$|Access <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> colonies is tightly {{controlled}} by Mexico and monitored by Profepa, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN), Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR), {{local and international}} volunteers. The world Wildlife Fund pays for the salaries of enforcement officers.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific Flyway {{is a major}} north-south flyway for {{migratory birds}} in America, {{extending}} from Alaska to Patagonia. Every year, migratory birds travel {{some or all of}} this distance both in spring and in fall, following food sources, heading to breeding grounds, or travelling <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> sites.|$|R
5|$|Smeerenburg {{was one of}} {{the first}} settlements, {{established}} by the Dutch in 1619. Smaller bases were also built by the English, Danish and French. At first the outposts were merely summer camps, but from the early 1630s, a few individuals started <b>to</b> <b>overwinter.</b> Whaling at Spitsbergen lasted until the 1820s, when the Dutch, British and Danish whalers moved elsewhere in the Arctic. By the late 17th century, Russian hunters arrived; they overwintered to a greater extent and hunted land mammals such as the polar bear and fox. After British raids into the Barents Sea in 1809, Russian activity on Svalbard diminished, and ceased by the 1820s. Norwegian hunting—mostly for walrus—started in the 1790s. The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast Sámi people from the Hammerfest region, who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795. Norwegian whaling was abandoned about the same time as the Russians left, but whaling continued around Spitsbergen until the 1830s, and around Bjørnøya until the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} endemic {{to an area}} in west central China and southeastern Tibet. In China, it is found in eastern Qinghai, from the Daba Mountains {{as far north as}} the Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, and as far south as the plateau of Amdo (35° N. 101° E.), {{as well as in the}} {{southern}} part of Qinghai in Nangqên County; in the area of the Yellow River in Xinghai County; in Gansu, southwest of Xiahe and Min counties; in Sichuan, where it has been observed in the north, center and west of the province, including sightings in Songpan County at the Jiuzhaigou Valley nature reserve, in the Qionglai Mountains in the Wolong District, in the region of Barkam County, and in the area of Litang. The species has also been observed in Kunming, Yunnan, in far southwestern China, where it most likely migrates <b>to</b> <b>overwinter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The colony disperses in {{the late}} summer, with only males and future foundresses {{produced}} instead of workers, and individuals frequently cluster in groups (called a hibernaculum) <b>to</b> <b>overwinter.</b> Hibernation does not usually take place on former nest sites.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 14-17 mm. Adults are on wing from September <b>to</b> May, <b>overwintering</b> as an adult.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 17-21 mm. Adults are on wing from August <b>to</b> (after <b>overwintering)</b> {{the following}} spring.|$|R
50|$|Starting in September and October, {{eastern and}} northeastern populations migrate from {{southern}} Canada and the United States <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> sites in central Mexico where they arrive around November. They start {{the return trip}} in March, arriving around July. No individual butterfly completes the entire round trip; female monarchs lay eggs {{for the next generation}} during the northward migration and at least four generations are involved in the annual cycle.|$|R
25|$|During their forced stay, {{several men}} lost their sanity, {{not only because}} of the Antarctic winter night and the endured hardship, but also because of the {{language}} problems between the different nationalities. This was the first expedition <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> within the Antarctic Circle, and they visited the South Shetland Islands.|$|E
25|$|Viviparus georgianus breeds {{and lives}} in shallow waters, often amongst macrophytes, in spring to fall, then moves out to deeper areas in the fall in order <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> away from shore. In more open waters, fall {{migration}} begins earlier than in smaller lakes and ponds. Most growth generally occurs when waters become warmer in spring and summer, although reduced growth continues in winter.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{improvements}} in alfalfa {{over the last}} decades have consisted of better disease resistance on poorly drained soils in wet years, better ability <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> in cold climates, {{and the production of}} more leaves. Multileaf alfalfa varieties have more than three leaflets per leaf, giving them greater nutritional content by weight because there is more leafy matter for the same amount of stem.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. Adults are on wing from August <b>to,</b> after <b>overwintering,</b> May {{of the following}} year.|$|R
25|$|This is {{probably}} because northern horses {{are more likely}} <b>to</b> be <b>overwintered</b> in stables or barn, and therefore become sensitised more readily.|$|R
40|$|Many migratory songbirds follow {{circuitous}} migratory routes {{instead of}} taking the shortest path between overwintering and breeding areas. Here, we study the migration patterns in Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus), a neartic-neotropical migrant songbird, using molecular genetic approaches. This species is presently separated into genetically distinct coastal and continental populations that diverged during the Late Pleistocene (as indicated by molecular dating), yet appear to have retained ancestral patterns of migration. Low nucleotide diversity, a star-like haplotype phylogeny and unimodal mismatch distributions all {{support the hypothesis that}} both the coastal and the continental populations have undergone recent demographic expansions. Nearctic-neotropical banding and genetic data show nearly complete segregation of migratory routes and of overwintering locations: coastal populations migrate along the Pacific Coast <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> sites in Central America and Mexico, whereas continental populations migrate along an eastern route <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> sites in Panama and South America. Nearctic-neotropical banding data also show that continental birds north, northwest and east of this migratory divide fly thousands of miles east before turning south. We conclude that circuitous migration in the Swainson's thrush is an artefact of a Late Pleistocene range expansion...|$|R
25|$|Stratification, {{also called}} moist-chilling, breaks down {{physiological}} dormancy, and involves {{the addition of}} moisture to the seeds so they absorb water, and they are then subjected to a period of moist chilling to after-ripen the embryo. Sowing in late summer and fall and allowing <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> under cool conditions is {{an effective way to}} stratify seeds; some seeds respond more favorably to periods of oscillating temperatures which {{are a part of the}} natural environment.|$|E
25|$|The Southern Cross Expedition {{began in}} 1898 and lasted for two years. This {{was the first}} {{expedition}} <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> on the Antarctic mainland (Cape Adare) {{and was the first}} to make use of dogs and sledges. It made the first ascent of The Great Ice Barrier, (The Great Ice Barrier later became formally known as the Ross Ice Shelf). The expedition set a Farthest South record at 78°30'S. It also calculated the location of the South Magnetic Pole.|$|E
25|$|Belgica was a barque-rigged {{steamship}} {{that was}} built in 1884 by Christian Brinch Jørgensen at Svelvik, Norway as the whaler Patria. In 1896, she was purchased by Adrien de Gerlache for conversion to a research ship, {{taking part in the}} Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897–1901, becoming the first ship <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> in the Antarctic. In 1902, she was sold to Philippe, Duke of Orléans and used on expeditions to the Arctic in 1905 and from 1907–09.|$|E
25|$|An IMAX film, Flight of the Butterflies, {{describes}} {{the story of}} the Urquharts, Brugger and Trail to then unknown migration <b>to</b> Mexican <b>overwintering</b> areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 42-48 mm. Adults are on wing from August <b>to</b> (after <b>overwintering)</b> June of {{the following}} year. There is one generation per year.|$|R
40|$|Diapause in IVth instar larvae linked <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> {{conditions}} {{is a well-known}} phenomenon in Chironomus species. Here, diapause induction in the IVth instar of Chironomus riparius MEIGEN, 1804, is described {{for the first time}} from a combination of field and laboratory research. These observations are relevant for understanding the ecology of Ch. riparius, a widespread species in Europe, and for its use as a bioindicator in water and sediment quality assessment. This diapause is linked <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> and is characterised by an arrest in phase IV 4 - 5 a of the development of the imaginal discs in the last larval instar. The diapause could be induced experimentally by short-day conditions, i. e, a photoperiod of 8 hours light per day at 15 degreesC. However, there was a great variation in the diapause response. Under short-day conditions, half of the larvae went into a long-lasting diapause while the other half continued their development after a much shorter diapause. Moreover, diapause effects on the size of IVth instar larvae have been examined. The IIIrd instar also appears to be affected by this overwintering diapause, causing a retardation of the moult to the IVth instar. Diapause phenomena in the IIIrd instar of Chironomus species have never been described before. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|From {{this time}} {{until her death}} in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest, laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly, {{reaching}} a maximum size of 4000 to 5000 workers and a nest of 10,000 to 15,000 cells in late summer. (This is true of most species in most areas; however, Vespula squamata, {{in the southern part}} of its range, may build much larger perennial colonies populated by scores of queens, tens of thousands of workers, and hundreds of thousands of cells.) At peak size, reproductive cells are built with new males and queens produced. Adult reproductives remain in the nest fed by the workers. New queens build up fat reserves <b>to</b> <b>overwinter.</b> Adult reproductives leave the parent colony to mate. After mating, males quickly die, while fertilized queens seek protected places <b>to</b> <b>overwinter.</b> Parent colony workers dwindle, usually leaving the nest to die, as does the foundress queen. Abandoned nests rapidly decompose and disintegrate during the winter. They can persist as long as they are kept dry, but are rarely used again. In the spring, the cycle is repeated; weather in the spring is the most important factor in colony establishment.|$|E
25|$|Copulation {{takes place}} while the female feeds, because females need {{a large amount}} of food for egg development. The female lays her eggs 36–72 hours after copulation. The eggs are laid in between pieces of bark on wood-borer-infested trees or under stones in the soil. She may lay 28–42 eggs at a time. For the longer lifespaned species such as the Thanasimus sp. this occurs in late summer or early fall to give the larvae enough time for proper growth before having <b>to</b> <b>overwinter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Middleton was not {{successful}} in {{his search for}} the Northwest Passage, and neither was William Moore with his sloop Discovery five years later. As the region was too remote and thought to be useless, the bay was not again recorded or visited {{for more than a}} century. In the 1860s, American explorer Charles Francis Hall's two-masted ship Monticello reached Roes Welcome Sound in 1864 while searching for John Franklin's lost Northwest Passage expedition of 1845 and had <b>to</b> <b>overwinter</b> at the mouth of Wager Bay.|$|E
50|$|Fall-migrating monarchs are not {{the same}} ones that {{migrated}} northward approximately five months before. Instead the northern-migrating butterflies are at least four generations removed from overwintering sites. The eastern population migrates up to 4830 miles (7,778 km) <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> sites in Mexico. Other insects show migratory behavior but not nearly for as long distances. The exception would be the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria: it was reported once in 1950 that individual swarms were seen migrating from the Arabian peninsula over 5,000 km (3,105 miles) to the west coast of Africa in seven weeks.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince 2006, {{disastrous}} colony losses {{have been}} reported in Europe and North America. The causes of the losses were not readily apparent and have been attributed <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> mortalities and <b>to</b> a new phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single explanation for the extensive colony losses but that interactions between different stresses are involved. As the presence of Varroa in each colony places an important pressure on bee health, we here address the question of how Varroa contributes to the recent surge in honey bee colony losses...|$|R
50|$|This {{extinction}} event {{had long}} term {{implications for the}} evolution of amphibians. Under prolonged cold conditions, amphibians can survive by decreasing metabolic rates and resorting <b>to</b> <b>overwintering</b> strategies (i.e. spending most of the year inactive in burrows or under logs). However, this is only a short term strategy and not an effective way of dealing with prolonged unfavourable conditions, especially desiccation. Since amphibians had a limited capacity to adapt to the drier conditions that dominated Permian environments, many amphibian families failed to occupy new ecological niches and became extinct.|$|R
