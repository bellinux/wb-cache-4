5000|$|Data {{analysis}} services are offered by firms, {{also known as}} <b>tab</b> <b>houses,</b> that specialize in computer analysis of quantitative data such as those obtained in large surveys. Initially most data analysis firms supplied only tabulations (frequency counts) and cross tabulations (frequency counts that describe two or more variables simultaneously). With the proliferation of software, many firms now {{have the capability to}} analyze their own data, but, data analysis firms are still in demand.|$|R
5000|$|Microsoft {{applications}} implementing ribbons {{each have}} {{a different set of}} <b>tabs</b> which <b>house</b> user controls for that application. Within each tab, various related controls may be grouped together. Double-clicking the active tab or clicking the [...] "Minimize" [...] button hides the command panel, leaving only the tabs visible. Repeating this action reveals the pane. The ribbon consolidates the functionality previously found in menus, toolbars and occasionally task panes into one area.|$|R
50|$|In smaller theatres, {{a safety}} curtain {{is not usually}} required. Specifically, most United States {{building}} codes only require a fire curtain in theatres with a stage height of more than 50 ft. The heavy, flame-retardant <b>house</b> <b>tabs</b> can provide some degree of fire separation.|$|R

50|$|There is {{also the}} main school hall, which can seat around 300 people. This also has a {{reasonably}} sized stage, with <b>house</b> <b>tabs</b> at the front. The lighting in the hall is suspended from the ceiling above the stage and also from {{the walls of the}} hall, all of which can be controlled centrally using one of the strand lighting desks.|$|R
50|$|After {{the show}} had ended and Morecambe had first left the stage, the musicians {{returned}} {{and picked up}} their instruments. He rushed back onto the stage to join them and played various instruments making six curtain calls. On leaving {{the stage for the}} final time as the <b>house</b> <b>tabs</b> fell, he stepped into the wings and collapsed with his third heart attack in 16 years. He was rushed to Cheltenham General Hospital, where he died just before 3 a.m on Monday 28 May.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} at 144-146 Bleecker Street in New York City's Greenwich Village was originally built in 1832 as two rowhouses. Placido Mori converted 144 {{into the restaurant}} Mori in 1883 or 1884. As architecture historian Christopher Gray wrote, At some point, Mori befriended a novice architect, Raymond Hood, gave him a <b>house</b> <b>tab</b> and an apartment upstairs and in 1920 had him design a new facade for the building to include 146 Bleecker. Hood gave the buildings a row of Doric columns across the first floor, imitation Federal lintels over the windows and a setback penthouse studio.|$|R
50|$|Technically {{the theatre}} was well equipped, with a Strand 520i {{lighting}} control desk and a Yamaha GA24/12 sound desk, {{and a good}} stock of lanterns. It was a hemp or handline theatre, with the <b>house</b> <b>tabs</b> {{and three of the}} four on-stage lighting bars being winched, the house border, projection screen, mid- and up-stage tabs and cyclorama being on free-running counterweights, and all other bars on handlines. There were also four lighting bars front-of-house, accessible only by ladder. The control room was situated {{at the back of the}} auditorium, and was split unequally into two sections, with access by a short ladder on both sides of the auditorium.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Monitoring of the {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) in premature {{infants with}} conventional adhesive-backed electrodes can harm their sensitive skin. Use of an electrode belt prevents skin irritation, {{but the effect}} of belt pressure on respiratory function is unknown. A strain gauge sensor is described which measures applied belt tension. Method The device frame was comprised of an aluminum housing and slide to minimize the device weight. Velcro <b>tabs</b> connected <b>housing</b> and slide to opposite tabs located at the electrode belt ends. The slide was connected to a leaf spring, to which were bonded two piezoresistive transducers in a half-bridge circuit configuration. The device was tested for linearity and calibrated. The effect on infant respiratory function of constant belt tension in the normal range (30 g– 90 g) was determined. Results The mechanical response to a step input was second order (f n = 401 Hz, ζ = 0. 08). The relationship between applied tension and output voltage was linear in the range 25 – 225 gm of applied tension (r 2 = 0. 99). Measured device sensitivity was 2. 18 mV/gm tension using a 5 V bridge excitation voltage. When belt tension was increased in the normal range from 30 gm to 90 gm, {{there was no significant}} change in heart rate and most respiratory functions during monitoring. At an intermediate level of tension of 50 gm, pulmonary resistance and work of breathing significantly decreased. Conclusion The mechanical and electrical design of a device for monitoring electrocardiogram electrode belt tension is described. Within the typical range of application tension, cardiovascular and respiratory function are not substantially negatively affected by electrode belt force. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the 11 th {{in the series}} of annual "Greater Boston Housing Report Cards," {{the first of which}} {{appeared}} in 2002 at a time when housing prices in the region were skyrocketing. In the course of this series, we have reported on the local housing bubble from 2000 through 2005, during which time home prices appreciated at annual double-digit rates; the retreat in home prices that begain in 2006; and then the beginning of a housing recovery in 2010. Like past report cards, this 2013 report probes Greater Boston's <b>housing</b> landscape, keeping <b>tabs</b> on <b>housing</b> construction, home prices, and rents. We have analyzed the relationship between the region's economy, demography, and housing, and we have kept track of federal, state and local government policies that affect the region's housing market. This report also includes a new analysis of local zoning regulations in Greater Boston communities because of the critical role zoning can play, particularly in the development - or lack of developmeent - of multifamily housing. The 2013 Report Card attempts to answer six questions about Greater Boston's housing market and its effect on the region's well-being: 1. What are the most recent trends in home sales, housing production, and foreclosures? 2. What does the future trajectory of home prices and rents look like? 3. Given current economic conditions, is another housing bubble on the horizon? 4. Given the changing demographics and economic health of Greater Boston, have we begun to build appropriate new housing stock to meet expected demand and to help moderate furure price and rent hikes? 5. Do we still face zoning constraints at the local level that hinder the production of an appropriate housing stock for the region? 6. What roles are {{the federal government and the}} Commonwealth playing in the housing market today...|$|R
5000|$|Car Curling - As curling is {{a popular}} sport in Canada, this {{challenge}} is inspired by the amateur pastime. A Buick Skylark is used for this challenge. Contestants must push a large [...] "rock" [...] with the car and brake before reaching a [...] "hog line", while {{the momentum of the}} rock carries it into a [...] "house". The contestant closest to [...] "the button" [...] wins. Contestants have eight rocks to try to push into the house. In Shirley's attempts, she never gets comfortable getting up to speed without losing control of the rock, and she only gets two rocks to the hog line - both of which promptly stop a few feet past the line. Sly loses control in six of his eight rocks before reaching the hog line, and doesn't place any of the rocks in the house. In contrast, Afiya starts quickly and accelerates so fast, all of her rocks sail through the house; none of her eight rocks actually land within the house. Aaron also loses control of his rocks early on, and his timid driving and over-correcting for his errors does not get him any of his eight rocks in the <b>house.</b> <b>Tab</b> wins the competition when her first rock sails into the [...] "four-foot" [...] in the house.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} primary {{particle}} emissions from ventilated animal housing systems. Due {{to the lack}} of reliable data, emissions from free-range animals, the storage and application of solid and liquid animal manures are not yet included in this chapter. 2 CONTRIBUTIONS TO TOTAL EMISSIONS Apart from industry, traffic and private households, the agricultural sector is a considerable contributor to emissions of particulate matter (PM). Agricultural activities such as plant and animal production on both farm sites and fields cause PM emissions. Although a reduction of PM emissions is observed for Europe, an increasing proportion of primary PM 10 emissions originates from agriculture including emissions from animal <b>housing</b> (<b>Tab.</b> 2. 1). An earlier estimate by Klimont and Amann (2002) showed also a similar trend, i. e., European emissions from animal housing representing 2. 7 and 4. 3 % of total PM 10 in 1990 and 2000, respectively. Klimont and Amann (2002) estimated that the major source of PM emissions from housing are poultry and pig livestock operations, which are responsible for 57 % and 32 % of PM 10 Emission Inventory Guidebook September, 2006 B 1010 - 1 PARTICLE EMISSIONS FROM ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Activities 101001 – 101009 ag 101000 emissions and 50 % and 30 % of PM 2. 5 releases, respectively. More recent calculations (RAINS, 2005) suggest that each of the above sources contributes about 40 % of the total PM 10 and between 35 and 45 % of PM 2. 5 emissions from animal housing.

500|$|Author T. C. McNult has {{referred}} to the Stork Club during its existence as [...] "the most celebrated nightspot in the world"; while author Ed McMahon has called it the [...] "most realistic nightclub of all", a name [...] "synonymous with fame, class, and money, in no particular order". [...] Society writer Lucius Beebe wrote in 1946: [...] "To {{millions and millions of}} people all of over the world the Stork symbolizes and epitomizes the de luxe upholstery of quintessentially urban existence. It means fame; it means wealth; it means an elegant way of life among celebrated folk". The club was a prime example of the flourishing cafe society at the time, but the real purpose of the Stork Club, according to journalist Ed Sullivan, was people watching other people, particularly non-celebrities watching celebrities. Author Mearl L. Allen, however, highlights that the club was more than a celebrity playground, and that [...] "many decisions of tremendous social and economic importance regarding world affairs were made in the Stork Club during this time", and the likes of Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball could often be seen conversing with executive types. Mark Bernardo, author of Mad Men's Manhattan: The Insider's Guide, has said: [...] "In some ways, the Stork Club was ahead of its time—courting celebrities by picking up their <b>tabs,</b> hiring a <b>house</b> photographer who sent candid shots of guests to the tabloids, and offering a private enclave called the Cub Room, where stars could huddle away from the prying eyes of fans, all hallmarks of modern clubs that cater to boldface names". The venue was usually packed with luminaries during its golden years, and dining orders could {{take a long time to}} be dealt with.|$|R
