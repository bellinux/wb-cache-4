25|$|Social {{security}} was seriously {{threatened by the}} periodic disbandment of the military forces, a common situation {{at the conclusion of}} wars that led to hundreds of soldiers and sailors rambling around the streets of London without an occupation or a decent living arrangement. Periods of peace were commonly marked by an increase of violent crimes. In a post-war London competition for a job was fierce and the criminality rate for robbery and property crime rose alarmingly. Although sailors could eventually sign on some merchant ships, soldiers had not such prospects. Moreover, at the moment of their dismissal, cavalrymen had the possibility to keep their horses, having paid for them with their allowances. Adding their experience with weapons and their acquaintance with accomplices in a similar position, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> the perfect premises for the rising of gangs of robbers and criminal alliances.|$|E

25|$|Finally a {{settlement}} {{seemed to have}} been reached when the rebel officers asked to see Mazaki on the 27th. Mazaki, accompanied by two other members of the SMC (Nobuyuki Abe and Yoshikazu Nishi), arrived at the Ministry of War at 16:00.

The rebels told Mazaki that they were entrusting everything to him. Mazaki thanked them, but explained that he could do nothing until they returned to their units. He also stated that he would fight them himself if they went against the Emperor's wishes. The rebels replied that if they received a formal order to return, they would of course obey it. Following the meeting, both Mazaki and the rebel officers were relieved. Mazaki believed the rebel officers would leave without violence and the rebels were apparently convinced that a Mazaki cabinet would be formed shortly after they did so. Kashii issued orders for the troops to stay the night in the buildings they had occupied and reported to the Emperor that the situation would be resolved by the morning.|$|E

500|$|Unprepared by what {{historian}} Max Nettlau {{called the}} [...] "explosive imminence" [...] of the First World War at its outbreak in August 1914, anarchists resigned {{themselves to the}} reality of the situation and, after a time, began themselves to take sides. Like all nationals, the anarchists had been conditioned to react to the political interests of their nations, whose influence left few unaffected. On the climate of the time, Nettlau remarked: [...] "The air was saturated with accepted nations, conventional opinions and the peculiar illusions which people entertained concerning small nationalities and the virtues and defects of certain races. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> sorts of plausible justifications for imperialism, for financial controls and so on. And, since Tolstoy had been dead since 1910, no voice of libertarian and moral power was heard in the world: no organisation, large or small, spoke up." [...] European anarchist activity was restricted both physically and by the internal divisions within the anarchist movement over attitudes towards the war.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as far as I was concerned, I thought that I was going to [...] anyway.

500|$|Lee {{became known}} for his [...] "frightening" [...] {{tendency}} to not [...] "mince words". The director often had his cast do numerous takes for a scene {{in order to get}} the perfect shot, and was not afraid to call something [...] "boring" [...] if he disliked it. Thompson later recalled the director would [...] "always come up to you and say something unexpectedly crushing", such as asking her not to [...] "look so old." [...] She also commented, however, that [...] "he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail." [...] Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, the director encouraged her to practice t'ai chi to [...] "help her relax [...] make her do things simpler." [...] Other actors soon joined them in meditating – according to Doran, it [...] "was pretty interesting. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [...] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of."

He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond. Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding side-saddle.|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> these blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These {{are the people who}} hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I must be doing something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E

[...] The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing that [...] "Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless center of the very best rock & roll..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Best Loved Game is a {{book written}} by Geoffrey Moorhouse. It was written {{during the summer of}} 1978 (and it was first {{published}} the following year). This book describes the English cricket season of that year. It is worth mentioning that 1978 was an extraordinary time for the cricket world. The arrival of Kerry Packer about a year ago had threatened to change the whole nature of the game. Lured by the money and the media-coverage guaranteed by the media-mogul, some of the top players of world cricket had signed contracts with Packer, thus making themselves unavailable from official international cricket. With the problems being unprecedented, the cricketing world was completely unprepared for this. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> kinds of confusions and even the high court got involved in the dispute. For a brief period, the future of the royal game looked very uncertain. At that time, Moorhouse, a very distinguished writer, who loved the game immensely, decided to chronicle the cricketing events of the summer. He, like many others at the time, thought that the game would soon change forever. [...] "It seemed important to record an English season while the matter was still in balance, lest the shape and nature of our cricket should presently be spoiled.” ...|$|E

When it did finally end, I was relieved more than anything because I had had enough. I left the band early in 1976 for reasons I don't want to discuss fully … but let's just say I wasn't happy about where all the money went". The last single he played on was [...] "Child's Play", which was a No.5 hit in February. Shakespeare was briefly replaced by journeyman guitarist Gunther Gorman (ex-Home) but within weeks a more permanent replacement, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel) joined. Meanwhile, Mitchell had stepped up to join Porter as Sherbet's new main songwriting team. The pair were responsible for penning [...] "Howzat" [...] (1976), the band's only international hit, which was inspired by the sport of cricket. The song's success led to an extensive international tour in 1976-77. [...] "Howzat" [...] went to numberone in Australia, and in New Zealand, it was a Top10 hit in several European countries – including numberfour on the UK Singles Chart, numbersix in The Netherlands, and numbereight in Norway. It reached the top10 in South Africa, South-East Asia, and Israel. The single had less chart success in the United States where it reached No.61 on the Billboard Hot100. The album of the same name also made No.1 in Australia, No.12 in New Zealand, but failed to chart in the US.|$|E
