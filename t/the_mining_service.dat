This assignment may have been related to an act of April 11, 1862, establishing the “Niter and Mining Bureau”, which was charged with the securing of niter (saltpeter) for the manufacture of gunpowder, copper, lead, iron, coal, zinc, and other such materials as might be required for the prosecution of the war.|$|E
50|$|A year later, Lasut {{attended}} Bandung Technical School (Technische Hoogeschool te Bandung), {{which is}} present day Bandung Institute of Technology. His studies were discontinued again due to monetary reasons. He then applied for {{and was given}} a scholarship to become a geological assistant at <b>the</b> <b>Mining</b> <b>Service</b> (Dienst van den Mijnbouw). The start of World War II was imminent with Japanese forces pushing toward Indonesia. While at the technical school in Bandung, Lasut was trained as a Corps Rerserve Officer by the Dutch {{to aid in the}} defense against the attacking Japanese forces. He eventually fought against the Japanese at Ciater in West Java. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, Lasut worked at the Geological Service (Chorisitsu Chosayo) in Bandung as an assistant in the field of geology. Along with R. Sunu Sumosusastro, Lasut was among a few Indonesians who were given such positions in the service by the Japanese.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Chamber of Mines of South Africa (COMSA) {{certificates}} {{were introduced}} to standardize stand-alone in-house qualifications for persons working in the mining industry. When the Higher Education Qualification Framework (HEQF) Act was introduced in 2007, one of the unintended consequences was that it meant by implication that the COMSA could no longer issue qualifications. In response to these developments, the intention was to phase out COMSA certificates by establishing a deadline for the last entry for new candidates into the COMSA system of the 31 st of August 2015, before it was finally recognized that these changes will have a wider impact in industry that included the Mine Environmental and Rock Engineering disciplines. Three institutes, namely the Institute of Mine Surveyors of South Africa (IMSSA), the South African National Institute for Rock Engineers (SANIRE) and the Ventilation Society of South Africa (MVSSA) made a combined representation where {{it was agreed that}} deadline could be extended for the final time to the 31 st of August 2018. This means that the complete suite of new qualifications must be registered with South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) on the correct level and provided by approved training institutions and accredited by the Mine Qualification Authority (MQA) and the three professional institutes respectively. The application process to have a course approved is tenuous at best and it is anticipated that a minimum of two years will be required to get one level of qualification approved. The positive spin-off of this crisis is that “learned societies” and professional bodies involved in <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> <b>service</b> sector were forced to develop a range of recognized vocational qualifications to develop the skills within industry. This paper outlines the requirements for the qualifications and outlines the progress made towards the development thereof...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} {{problems}} we now encounter in web mining, We first propose a new distributed computing strategy——web service. It suggests building a web mining system based on web service, which can share and manage semi-structured data from heterogeneous platforms. Moreover, the system can integrate <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> <b>services</b> and algorithms, improve the efficiency of web <b>mining,</b> and make <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> results easier to access. We also conduct an experiment on selecting useful words to simulate the realization of <b>the</b> web <b>mining</b> system on <b>the</b> Microsoft. NET platform, which demonstrates the importance of Web <b>service</b> in Web <b>mining.</b> ...|$|R

The {{new concept}} of {{hydropower}} {{has been found}} to be technically feasible in South African gold <b>mines.</b> Chilled <b>mine</b> <b>service</b> water is piped from the surface to deep level stope; where the hydrostatic pressure provides power for stoping machinery. This water varies widely in composition and acidity. High concentrations of sulphate, chloride and nitrate are present. These ions are derived from the leaching of oxidised sulphides from the broken rock, the fissure water and the dissolution of blasting fumes. In order to minimise the deterioration of stoping machinery by corrosion and synergistic corrosive abrasive effects, a compromise between selecting a suitable corrosion resistant material and treating <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> <b>service</b> water to an acceptable level of corrosiveness is being sought...|$|R
