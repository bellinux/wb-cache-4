500|$|At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign {{she belonged}} to Kappa Kappa Gamma {{sorority}} where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, [...] "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular {{with men and}} with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E
500|$|Ivy {{appeared}} {{several times}} in GameDaily's [...] "Babe of the Week" [...] series of articles, including as a stand-alone article and at eleventh place in their [...] "Top 50 Hottest Game Babes" [...] article. They later named her amongst other female characters in the Soul series {{as an example of}} a strong and iconic female character in video gaming. The New York Times felt her appearance came from the same [...] "Goth cyberaesthetic [...] that gave us The Matrix", one they felt was already becoming outdated. UGO.com ranked her eighteenth in their [...] "Top 50 Videogame Hotties" [...] article, stating [...] "However much she instills fear in our hearts, we revel in the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from the safety of our television sets." [...] In later articles, they named her one of the top eleven girls of gaming at number ten and one of the top eleven video game heroines at number eight, stating [...] "What can you say about a chick that carries a whip? If you're talking about Ivy from the Soul Calibur series, you could say she's pretty intimidating." ...|$|E
60|$|This amazing {{statement}} aroused me from {{my personal}} and painful pre-occupation and caused me <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> blankly.|$|E
6000|$|He {{ought not}} <b>to</b> have <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> like a stuck fish and {{pretended not to}} know her. That couldn't be right. But what was right? ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Merrick was so {{astonished}} {{that she}} nearly dropped her coffee-cup and could make no better reply than <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> blankly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> brother-in-law.|$|R
60|$|The wooden figure creaked <b>to</b> and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> blandly, {{as it had}} stared for generations. For {{a moment}} Emlyn stood still, her hand upon her heart. Then she walked swiftly down the chapel, {{unlocked}} the door, and in the porch, just entering it, met the Prioress Matilda, another nun, and old Bridget, who was chattering.|$|R
6000|$|... [But as he {{continues}} <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> a strange disorder appears in his face. MAGGIE feels that {{it is to be}} now or never.] ...|$|E
60|$|Honora grew a fiery red. There was {{obviously}} {{no answer to}} such a remark, which seemed the quintessence of rudeness. But Mrs. Grainger continued to smile, and <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with the air of trying to solve a riddle.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} back to her, then, and began {{clipping}} away as before. Beth sprang up and laid a hand upon his arm, arresting him. Again he turned <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and in his eyes was a look almost of fear.|$|E
60|$|She {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> me in <b>her</b> amazement and {{the confusion}} that was congenital with it, {{and if there}} was not time for <b>her</b> to withdraw, <b>at</b> least the possibility I had suggested acted as a timely warning.|$|R
5000|$|.....So back at MODE, Betty finally {{walks up}} to Wilhelmina to {{complain}} about being tortured, only <b>to</b> see Wilhelmina <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> window and tell Betty about her painful feelings for Connor. After a brief chat, Betty leaves Wilhelmina alone.|$|R
6000|$|Huaracha, who {{had listened}} to all this babble with a stern set face, turned to Quilla and made a sign. She descended from her chair and advancing, stood before the Inca, a vision of splendour and of beauty, and bowed <b>to</b> him. He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> awhile, as did all his company, then said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] ejaculated Jolyon. [...] "You {{ought not}} to live alone." [...] And he {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> afflicted {{by the thought that}} where Beauty was, nothing ever ran quite straight, which, no doubt, was why so many people looked on it as immoral.|$|E
6000|$|They {{continued}} both <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> helpless {{for what}} ever different reasons {{to take their}} eyes away, and they were still interested in her when they heard her asking the conductor, [...] "Must I change and take another train {{before we get to}} Belford? My friends thought--" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} went to church. There were the same persons there <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> now, in her quiet wretchedness, who were there before staring at her in her--triumph may I say? No, {{there had been no}} triumph; little even then, except wretchedness; but that misery had not been so open to the public eye.|$|E
60|$|A slang {{word on the}} {{red lips}} of the {{handsome}} girl seemed wofully out of place <b>to</b> Jennie, who <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with the eager curiosity of a child. She was slender and dark, with an exquisite chin, and her hands, though slim and white, were strong and capable. Her eyes were very dark, of a velvety brown-black, {{and her hair was}} abundant and negligently piled upon her small head. Altogether she had a stately and rather foreign presence, which made Jennie feel very dowdy and very commonplace.|$|R
6000|$|At length, none {{hindering}} them, {{they reached}} the yard where the escort and the horses waited. Here, standing under an archway, were Castell and Peter. Castell greeted Margaret in English and kissed her through her veil, while Peter, who had not seen her close since months before he rode away <b>to</b> Dedham, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with all his eyes, and began to draw near to her, designing to find out, as {{he was sure he}} could do if once he touched her, whether indeed this were Margaret, or only Betty after all. Guessing what was in his mind, and that he might reveal everything, Inez, who held a long pin in her hand with which she was fastening her veil that had come loose, pretended to knock against him, and ran the point deep into his arm, muttering, [...] "Fool!" [...] as she did so. He sprang back with an oath, the guard smiled, and she began to pray his pardon.|$|R
6000|$|In the {{meantime}} Harry went up <b>to</b> Kate and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> We {{do not mean}} {{to say that he was}} intentionally rude to her. No! He went towards her intending to shake hands, and renew acquaintance with his old companion; but the moment he caught sight of her he was struck not only dumb, but motionless. The odd part of it was that Kate, too, was affected in precisely the same way, and both of them exclaimed mentally, [...] "Can it be possible?" [...] Their lips, however, gave no utterance to the question. At length Kate recollected herself, and blushing deeply, held out her hand, as she said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|And as he {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hat and think, the hurt he had received passed away, {{and he found himself}} cudgelling his brains for some way out of the muddle--for some method by which she could remain on Berande. A chaperone! Why not? He could send to Sydney on the first steamer for one. He could-- ...|$|E
6000|$|She laughed; then {{suddenly}} became frightened and serious; {{then looked at}} me, and said, [...] "It was dreadfully like business;" [...] and then entreated Morgan not <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> or, in {{the present state of}} her nerves, she should upset the punch-bowl. At last she summoned resolution enough to take out one of the pieces of card and to unfold it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{promised to}} wed Mr. Wilding this day se'night {{so that he}} saved your life and honour," [...] she told him calmly, and added, [...] "It was a bargain that we drove." [...] Richard {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> The thing she told him was too big to be swallowed at a mouthful; he was absorbing it by slow degrees.|$|E
60|$|Still {{the prince}} stood before her with downcast eyes and suffused cheeks: even {{the spur of}} {{contempt}} failed to arouse his energies. Then the maiden called to her friend, who was picking jasmine flowers {{so as not to}} witness the scene, and angrily asked why that strange man was allowed <b>to</b> stand and <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her?</b> The friend, in hot wrath, threatened to call the slave, and throw Vajramukut into the pond unless he instantly went away with his impudence. But as the prince was rooted to the spot, and really had not heard a word of what had been said to him, the two women were obliged to make the first move.|$|R
60|$|Afterwards {{there were}} questions, and {{a report by}} Miss Harber, a middle-aged lady with glasses who was the secretary. Honora looked around her. The {{membership}} of the Society, judging by those present, was surely of a sufficiently heterogeneous character to satisfy even the catholic tastes of her hostess. There were elderly ladies, some benevolent and some formidable, some bedecked and others unadorned; there were earnest-looking younger women, to whom dress was evidently a secondary consideration; {{and there was a}} sprinkling of others, perfectly gowned, several of whom were gathered in an opposite corner. Honora's eyes, as the reading of the report progressed, were drawn by a continual and resistless attraction to this group; or rather to the face of one of the women in it, which seemed <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> out <b>at</b> <b>her</b> like the eat in the tree of an old-fashioned picture puzzle, or the lineaments of George Washington among a mass of boulders on a cliff. Once one has discovered it, one can see nothing else. In vain Honora dropped her eyes; some strange fascination compelled her to raise them again until they met those of the other woman: Did their glances meet? She could never quite be sure, so disconcerting were the lights in that regard--lights, seemingly, of laughter and mockery.|$|R
6000|$|The last {{trace of}} his {{previous}} state of mind vanished, as the instantaneous and elusive trail of a bursting meteor vanishes on the profound blackness of the sky; it was the faint flicker of a painful thought, gone as soon as perceived, that nothing but her presence--after all--had the power to recall him <b>to</b> himself. He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She sat with {{her hands on her}} lap, looking down; and he noticed that her boots were dirty, her skirts wet and splashed, as though she had been driven back there by a blind fear through a waste of mud. He was indignant, amazed and shocked, but in a natural, healthy way now; so that he could control those unprofitable sentiments by the dictates of cautious self-restraint. The light in the room had no unusual brilliance now; it was a good light in which he could easily observe the expression of her face. It was that of dull fatigue. And the silence that surrounded them was the normal silence of any quiet house, hardly disturbed by the faint noises of a respectable quarter of the town. He was very cool--and it was quite coolly that he thought how much better it would be if neither of them ever spoke again. She sat with closed lips, with an air of lassitude in the stony forgetfulness of her pose, but after a moment she lifted her drooping eyelids and met his tense and inquisitive stare by a look that had all the formless eloquence of a cry. It penetrated, it stirred without informing; it was the very essence of anguish stripped of words that can be smiled at, argued away, shouted down, disdained. It was anguish naked and unashamed, the bare pain of existence let loose upon the world in the fleeting unreserve of a look that had in it an immensity of fatigue, the scornful sincerity, the black impudence of an extorted confession. Alvan Hervey was seized with wonder, as though he had seen something inconceivable; and some obscure part of his being was ready to exclaim with him: [...] "I would never have believed it!" [...] but an instantaneous revulsion of wounded susceptibilities checked the unfinished thought.|$|R
60|$|Amy stood {{under her}} parasol, {{trying to make}} the most of the small shelter afforded by Mr. Cray's garden hedge, and recollecting rather uncomfortably {{something}} she had once been told about the loitering of the disobedient Prophet being what brought him into temptation. But, having promised to wait, she could not move away, though she had to stay longer than she liked, especially as the children were going by to afternoon school, and some of her own class began <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{turned in}} the saddle <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and in the {{moonlight}} I clearly saw her eyes meet mine. So! {{that was the reason}} of her kindness and of the easy familiarity of her speech with me! She deemed me some knight-errant who caracoled through Italy in quest of imperilled maidens needing aid. Of a certainty she had gathered her knowledge of the world from the works of Messer Bojardo, or perhaps from the [...] "Amadis of Gaul" [...] of Messer Bernardo Tasso. And, no doubt, she thought that suits of motley grew on bushes by the roadside, whence those who had a fancy for disguise might cull them.|$|E
60|$|In {{the kingdom}} of the father of the Princess there were wild wastes of upland and {{mountains}} where she had been accustomed to roam freely. She loved the sunrise and the sunset and all the great drama of the open heavens more than anything else in the world, but among a people at once so democratic and so vehemently loyal as the English her freedom was much restricted. People came in brakes, in excursion trains, in organised multitudes to see her; they would cycle long distances <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and it was necessary to rise betimes if she would walk in peace. It was still near the dawn that morning when young Redwood came upon her.|$|E
60|$|Mr Pecksniff had cause <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> him, for {{the triumph}} {{in his face}} and speech and figure was a sight <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> brother <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{and almost}} gasped with astonishment.|$|R
50|$|Jerry and George finish writing their {{script and}} give it to Russell at his home, but he {{suddenly}} takes leave of them when he becomes violently ill with the stomach flu. Russell's 15-year-old daughter (Denise Richards, who was 21 at the time) has just arrived, and Russell then catches George staring at the girl's cleavage; he sends them away without providing any input on the script. Jerry and George decide {{that the best way to}} assuage Russell's anger would be to demonstrate the irresistibility of staring at a woman's cleavage by arranging for him <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> Elaine's. Gail agrees to inform Jerry when Russell dines <b>at</b> <b>her</b> restaurant again, on the condition that Elaine give her the Boticelli shoes, to which Elaine agrees. The plan works; Elaine wears a low-cut dress to the restaurant and Russell <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> cleavage; he acknowledges to Jerry and George that a man will <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> cleavage that enters his field of vision.|$|R
60|$|They {{went out}} to dinner immediately, and as she walked beside Mart she felt the young athlete's eyes resting upon her face, and the {{knowledge}} of this troubled her unaccountably. Mrs. Congdon seated him opposite her at the table, and he continued <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with the frankest curiosity. She returned his gaze at last with a certain defiance, but found no offence in his eyes, which were round as his face, and of a sincere, steady gray. He was smooth-shaven, and his blond hair was rather short. All these peculiarities appeared one by one in the intervals between her attentions to Mart and her study of the furnishings of the table, which was decorated with candles and flowers in a way quite new to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{said the}} lady, {{still staring at}} her, [...] "you look very well. I should {{scarcely}} have supposed it." [...] Cynthia took the remark in good part, for she thought the lady a character, which she was. [...] "I hope you will remember that we women were created for a higher purpose than mere beauty. The Lord gave us brains, and meant that we should use them. If {{you have a good}} mind, as I believe you have, learn to employ it for the betterment of your sex, for the time of our emancipation is at hand." [...] Having delivered this little lecture, the lady continued <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with keen eyes. [...] "You look very much like someone I used to love when I was younger. What is your name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, they haven't," [...] said Cornelia crossly, {{but not so}} {{much with}} Charmian as with the {{necessity}} she was now in of telling her about her last meeting with Ludlow. She began, [...] "They almost did," [...] and when Charmian in the intensity of her interest could not keep turning around <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> Cornelia took hold of her head and turned her face toward the fire again. Then she went on to tell how it had all happened. She did not spare herself at any point, and she ended the story with the expression of her belief that she had deserved it all. [...] "It wasn't boxing that little wretch's ears that was the disgrace; it was having brought myself to where I had to box them." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> without speaking. She came to him, laughing.|$|R
60|$|Fritz <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with eyes}} that bulged behind his spectacles.|$|R
60|$|They <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> rather suspiciously, not yet {{understanding}} her idea.|$|R
