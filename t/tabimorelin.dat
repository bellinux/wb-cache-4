50|$|<b>Tabimorelin</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} NN-703) {{is a drug}} which acts as a potent, orally-active agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue {{receptor}} (GHSR) and growth hormone secretagogue, mimicking {{the effects of the}} endogenous peptide agonist ghrelin as a stimulator of growth hormone (GH) release. It {{was one of the first}} GH secretagogues developed and is largely a modified polypeptide, but it is nevertheless orally-active in vivo. <b>Tabimorelin</b> produced sustained increases in levels of GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), along with smaller transient increases in levels of other hormones such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin. However actual clinical effects in adults with growth hormone deficiency were limited, with only the most severely GH-deficient patients showing significant benefit, and <b>tabimorelin</b> was also found to act as a CYP3A4 inhibitor which could cause it to have undesirable interactions with other drugs.|$|E
