50|$|That is, {{there are}} two tones or CV and V roots; two <b>tones</b> <b>on</b> bimoraic roots with breathy vowels, one of them falling; and four <b>tones</b> <b>on</b> bimoraic roots with other vowels, one of them falling. Thus there are four phonemic <b>tones</b> <b>on</b> CVCV, CVV, and CVN roots, the number {{expected}} if {{there are two}} possible <b>tones</b> <b>on</b> each mora, with moraic N carrying tone, though their contours are not simple juxtapositions of high/low + high/low.|$|R
5000|$|In general, the Shtokavian dialects that {{represent}} {{the foundation of the}} four standard languages have four pitch accents on stressed syllables: falling <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> a short vowel, written e.g. [...] in dictionaries; rising <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> a short vowel, written e.g. falling <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> a long vowel, written e.g. and rising <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> a long vowel, written e.g[...] In addition, the following unstressed vowel may be either short, , or long, [...] In declension and verb conjugation, accent shifts, both by type and position, are very frequent.|$|R
5000|$|Mandinka has two tones, {{high and}} low. Unmodified nouns are either high <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> all syllables or low <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> all syllables. The {{definite}} suffix -o takes a low <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> high-tone nouns and a falling <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> low-tone nouns. It also assimilates any preceding short vowel, {{resulting in a}} long /oo/ with either low or falling tone. It shortens a preceding long high vowel (ii > io, uu > uo; ee optionally > either eo or ee) or assimilates itself (aa remains aa) leaving only its tone: ...|$|R
2500|$|For {{events in}} a [...] "general or more distant future (not today)" [...] the Future Tense with -dza- is used. Some dialects put a <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the first two syllables (e.g. ndídzáthándiza [...] "I will help"); more {{frequently}} authors report a <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> -dza- only (ndidzáthandiza) The tone of -dza- may spread. In the negative, as with most negative future tenses, {{there is a single}} <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the penultimate: sindidzathandíza [...] "I won't help".|$|R
5000|$|The {{examples}} above illustrate {{various features}} of the negative tenses. First, there is normally a <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the negative-marker sí-, which spreads to the subject-marker in the following syllable. (The <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the subject-marker ndi- [...] "I" [...] does not itself spread, indicating {{that it is probably}} not original but has arisen by spreading.) In monosyllabic verbs, in the Central Region, the <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the subject-marker disappears in the Present Simple and the tones are: ...|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, the {{negative}} Present Simple has a <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> sí- when the meaning is present habitual, but a <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the penultimate {{when it is}} future. The penultimate tone occurs {{in the first of}} these only when there is an object-marker: ...|$|R
5000|$|As noted above, in {{isolation}} these words are actually pronounced bwālō, Chichēwā, etc., ending with two tones of mid height. Alternatively, in some dialects, {{they may be}} pronounced bwălò, Chichĕwà, with a rising <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the penultimate and a low <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the final.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{indication}} {{that there is}} an underlying high <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the final vowel is the fact that forms like báágula they bought do not add a phrasal <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the final syllable (except before a pause or before a pronominal word like bonnâ all).|$|R
50|$|Tones in Triqui {{languages}} are typically written with superscript numbers, so that chraa5 'river' indicates the syllable chraa {{with the highest}} (5) tone, while cha3na1 'woman' has the middle (3) <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the first syllable and the lowest (1) <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the second syllable.|$|R

A stem-medial murmured consonant which appeared after a short vowel and before a long vowel became modally voiced and left a low <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the two syllables following it: maghāuṇā [...] "to have something lit".

50|$|A final vowel therefore, {{if it is}} not toneless, {{can either}} have a high <b>tone</b> <b>on</b> the second mora (e.g. emú: one) or on the first mora (e.g. mwendâ nine), or on its single mora (muyingiré please come in). All three of these, when {{at the end of a}} sentence, are {{pronounced}} with a falling tone. But in other contexts they have different pronunciations.
