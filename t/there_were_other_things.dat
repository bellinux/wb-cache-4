Executive Producer Bill Panzer explains, [...] "Duncan MacLeod needed somebody to talk to, who was Immortal, who was significantly older than he was, and {{with whom he had}} some kind of epiphany-like experience in the past." [...] In this respect, Panzer compares Darius to Ramirez, Connor MacLeod's mentor in Highlander. Creative Consultant David Abramowitz recounts, [...] "We wanted to create a character who was once a warrior, who gave up warfare because he realized <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> in life." ...|$|E
60|$|She thought, contemptuously, that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> which d'Alcacer didn't {{know and}} {{surrendered}} {{to a sudden}} temptation to enlighten him a little.|$|E
60|$|She sighed. All {{the time}} I knew quite well that she carried on this little {{war of words}} impatiently. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> of which she desired to speak.|$|E
60|$|DR. JONATHAN (sitting down). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> more {{important}} than my health. No later news about George, I suppose.|$|R
5000|$|Fit {{the limits}} of its area while {{providing}} the element of surprise, the sense that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to <b>be</b> seen ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> in {{the world}} besides the Suffrage," [...] she replied, in an off-hand manner which was {{slightly}} mysterious.|$|R
60|$|In {{that black}} list were two murders: {{one of a}} rival by the knife, and one of a {{mistress}} by poison. And <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> even worse, too shameful, indeed, to be written.|$|E
60|$|Her {{hands were}} clasped {{to the side}} of her head. Something of horror had stolen into the steadfast gaze with which she was still {{regarding}} him. Yet <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> there which puzzled him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us go {{over them}} now," [...] cried Phil. But {{this was not}} to be, for <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to attend to just then, and the girls demanded a good share of the boys' attention.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> {{that will}} <b>be</b> stated in <b>other</b> volumes to follow. Don't <b>be</b> alarmed; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> plenty of miserable people left.|$|R
6000|$|... "I play cricket, sir," [...] the boy {{reminded}} him, {{a little}} impatiently, [...] "and, after all, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> {{in the world}} besides games." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, John; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> {{to think}} of now; <b>are</b> <b>there</b> not? And, besides, they will want here all that I can do for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} you loved me then, Cuthbert. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> you know, {{that made me feel}} it could not be so, but then {{that for the first time}} I really knew----" [...] and she stopped.|$|E
60|$|Arnold {{held her}} hands steadfastly {{and looked into}} her eyes. They were more {{beautiful}} than ever now with their mist of risen tears. But <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> in her face, things less easy to understand. He turned away regretfully.|$|E
6000|$|The talk, Nanda's face implied, {{had become}} dim to her; but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> [...] "You know he's a great gardener--I mean {{really one of}} the greatest. His garden's like a dinner in a house where the person--the person of the house--thoroughly knows and cares." ...|$|E
30|$|Student D: <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> (factors) that <b>are</b> {{important}} and influence the cost â€¦ for those (bridges) that {{are close to}} sea it is more difficult.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Well, {{the time}} will come, Oswald, {{and you will}} then speedily come to {{consider}} that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> than the reasonableness of waiting to be considered.|$|R
6000|$|He smiled ruefully as Burton {{looked him}} over. [...] "I venture to say," [...] he drawled, [...] "that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> {{in the world}} besides the open road." ...|$|R
6000|$|However, {{he would}} try cold meat for once. It looked to him as if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to eat on the table. [...] "And what is this?" [...] he shouted, {{pointing}} dramatically at a dish of large, very green-looking pickled peaches. Peaches--peaches in winter! This is strange indeed! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "I treated you as I did--and I {{thought you}} would stand it. I knew, I knew then {{as well as you}} do now that male to my female you wouldn't stand it, but somehow--I thought <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> Things that could {{override}} that...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rat me!" [...] swore Trenchard. [...] "I was in {{haste to}} bring you news of it. Besides, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to talk of. There is news that Albemarle has gone to Exeter, and that Sir Edward Phelips and Colonel Luttrell have been ordered to Taunton by the King." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> Physician," [...] he said, [...] "which are apt {{to prove}} fatal to the young. At least now you will no longer deny my power." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are things}} easy to say, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> not so easy," [...] {{returned}} Santos. [...] "But as to saying anything on horseback, {{who could do}} that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I am not angry. Anger {{does not}} last, that way, for years. But <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> Impressions last, {{when they have}} been strong. But I can't talk." ...|$|R
60|$|Also <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> At {{the great}} {{sacrifice}} before {{the temple of}} Jupiter, his place had been set too far back where the people could not see him; at the feast which followed {{the master of the}} ceremonies had neglected, or had forgotten, to pour a libation in his honour.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{mean they}} have more money? Well, it's not to be despised, but I've met men who didn't attach too much {{importance}} to it. They had the sense to see <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> of greater value, and while I don't often flatter people, you're not poor in this respect. But if you liked {{a man who was}} far from rich, would you marry him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Cliff sighed {{a little}} as the {{carpenter}} walked away, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to do. There was the pasture lot {{at the rear of}} her garden, and she could have a cow, and there was the little barn, and she could have a horse. The idea of the horse pleased her more than anything she had yet thought of in connection with her wealth.|$|E
60|$|This is {{necessarily}} {{the end of}} Fantine. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that will <b>be</b> stated in <b>other</b> volumes to follow. Don't <b>be</b> alarmed; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> plenty of miserable people left.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{are a dozen}} reasons. Why should {{my money}} be given up to him? And it <b>is</b> too late. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to <b>be</b> thought of now than marriage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] {{and once}} more it was Austin Jacinta looked at. [...] "Still, I don't {{necessarily}} mean that everybody should go bull-fighting. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> more worth while." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> {{yet to be}} done. There was a small key in a casket on the table--but now Romola {{perceived}} that her taper was dying out, and she had forgotten to provide herself with any other light. In a few moments the room was in total darkness. Feeling {{her way to the}} nearest chair, she sat down to wait for the morning.|$|E
60|$|For <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> {{to occupy}} the steward's mind. Getting acquainted with the five men aft in the cabin, and lining up the whole {{situation}} and the relations {{of each of the}} five to that situation and to one another, consumed much time. Then there was the path of the Mary Turner across the sea. No old sailor breathes who does not desire to know the casual course of his ship and the next port-of-call.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} why, as she was so powerful, she {{did not come to}} seek us, instead of leaving us to seek her through so many weary years, though I suggest that some {{superior}} force forbade her to do more than companion us unseen, watching our every act, reading our every thought, until at length we reached the predestined place and hour. Also, as will appear, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> of which {{this is not the time}} to speak, whereby I am still more tortured and perplexed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aye, and there's many {{a broken}} kopf got over Mechlin and Cognac,' grumbled my enemy. 'Donner! <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> beside lust-houses and flower-beds. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> lee-shores and nor'-westers, beaks and preventives.' ...|$|R
50|$|On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> which act as turn-offs, {{depending}} on the person's preferences. The response to an indication of sexual interest may be inhibited by issues of sexual morality.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the horror}} {{in the words}} said enough, and Lord John felt its chill. [...] "I don't {{make a point of}} that--God forbid! But <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to which the {{objection}} wouldn't apply." ...|$|R
