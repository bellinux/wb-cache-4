40|$|This paper explores ways {{in which}} risk taking is entwined with {{financial}} considerations, and examines the trade-off between acceptable levels of risk and associated costs. The changing identity of holders of funds available for risk investment, combined with the evolving attitudes of fund-seekers as {{to the nature of}} acceptable risks, points to the need for a re-examination of traditional approaches. In formulating public policy aimed at reducing risks a more formal consideration of the overall cost of Government measures, set against the achievements anticipated from <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>concerned,</b> is required whether or not that cost falls on Government. In commerce, increased use of joint ventures is seen as a likely vehicle for the development of largescale risk activities, with a loan guarantee scheme to assist in nurturing new enterprises and small businesses. Finally, the role of pension funds is examined and a case made for the consideration of index linked gilts as a means both of assisting the Government with the orderly handling of the National Debt and meeting the pension schemes' need to match liabilities that are susceptible to inflationary pressures. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} {{study was conducted}} to get an overview of activities concerning the monetary valuation of environmental health effects. The report focuses on the applicability of economic valuation methods for health effects of air pollution and noise. Advantages and disadvantages of the economic valuation methods are briefly described. The application of economic valuation of environmental health effects is still under debate. Important topics are the limited availability of data (health endpoints, risk estimates, estimations of their monetary value) and methodological problems (expression of mortality in statisical life year or life year gained, benefit transfer). Due to assumptions in monetary valuations, as well as uncertainties in the underlying health risk assessments, the resulting estimations of health related costs and benefits vary substantially. Despite these uncertainties, it is still useful to have insight into {{the costs and benefits of}} (environmental) measures. Several studies show that health benefits contribute substantially to total benefits of measures and sometimes exceed the costs of <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>concerned.</b> The health related costs and benefits could therefore add another dimension to discussions on measures to be taken. If estimations will be made in the Netherlands, it is recommended to determine specific WTP values for the Dutch situation. This will also be helpful for the discussion on methodology and the understanding of the monetary valuation of health, which may improve the (decision on the) use of monetary valuation in the future...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} GATT Article III : 2 {{on national}} treatment on internal taxation. The fact {{that as of}} 1 January 2008, national treatment violations in the goods sector have been challenged in nearly 29 % of the WTO complaints points to the great importance of the national treatment principle in the multilateral trading system on the one hand, and temptation of WTO Members to protect domestic production through internal taxes and regulations on the other. Cases involving de facto discrimination against foreign goods will increase in number given the sophistication of governments protectionist policy. The examination of a claim on a discriminatory internal tax requires a multi-tiered test of several issues including likeness, discriminatory threshold and protective application of the tax measure. This test applies differently depending on what sentence of Article III : 2 is at issue. The controversial aim-and-effect approach is not relevant to the determination of likeness, but can still be utilized, to some extent, in examining the protective application of <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>concerned.</b> Some discrepancy in the Appellate Bodys approach to the subjective intent issue seems to leave some room for referring to government statements in future analyses of protective application. Korea and its FTA partners have affirmed their adherence to GATT Article III. When the FTA parties enter into a dispute over national treatment, a problem as to the jurisdiction of WTO panels over FTAs GATT-plus provisions on national treatment may arise. Irrespective of what dispute settlement forum is resorted to, GATTplus provisions, as a lex posterior, would prevail over the corresponding provisions of Article III. Another problem is that FTA panels are not legally constrained by WTO jurisprudence. In this regard, {{it is suggested that}} FTA panels, wherever possible, follow the WTO interpretations of Article III to secure consistent and predictable application of the national treatment rule.

The right to understand Public Administration <b>measures</b> that restrict <b>the</b> rights of the foreign nationals who do not fully understand the Italian language, is {{closely linked to the}} right of defense established by article 24 of the Italian Constitution. In order to ensure the right to defence and that the foreign national can fully exercise this right, he or she must fully understand the contents of <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>concerning</b> them. Over <b>the</b> years the law has changed and limited the scope of translations, for example, approving the possibility of a summarised version of the document. Moreover, if the Public Administration cannot find an interpreter who speaks the foreign nationalâs first language, it is permissible to translate into one of the so-called working languages: English, French or Spanish. The presiding judge must verify that the document has achieved its goal and that the recipient has fully understood its content, as determined by the Constitutional Court. Consequently, the translation appears as a conditio sine qua non towards the validity of <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at <b>the</b> foreign national and omission or excessive brevity results in irremediable invalidity...|$|R

This study aims at {{comparing}} the germinative behaviour of some genotypes of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), in salt stress. For this, a test {{has been driven}} on eight genotypes whose seeds are submitted under different concentrations of NaCl (0; 34; 68 and 102 mM) in a temperature of 26 Â°C and a relative humidity of 93 %. <b>The</b> <b>measures</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>the</b> kinetics, the speed and the final germination rate.

The results suggest that the germinative capacity of the genotypes is not affected in 34 mM of NaCl. But in more elevated concentrations, it decreases and the speed of germination shows down. The increase of the salt concentration until 68 and 102 mM hinders the process of mobilization of the reserves and decreases the mean daily germination. The intraspecific variability of chickpea is relatively important. But, in presence as in absence of salt, the FLIP 97 - 254 C genotype showed the best germinative behaviour.

Without a renewal of the peace clause the EU would find its agricultural regime open to challenge at the WTO on several fronts.

Most organisations start with annual appraisals and learn from them what goes well or bad. Because of being {{under the rule of}} Britain, Lesotho inherited some of the systems mostly followed by many Commonwealth countries in the public service; some of which were confidential reporting systems for appraising employees. Investigations were made about the existing system at that time and the findings indicated {{that most of the people}} did not like it. They said it was subjective, and that it contributed to low morale, and weakened supervision/employee relations. It was realised that a new system was urgently needed. The new system was introduced which was for an open appraisal. Several attempts were made, but they failed because of lack of resources and poor communication and teamwork in the organization. This report sets out the observations and comments on the new system and the findings are discussed together with the implications of the system. The aim of this research is to investigate all <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> system whether they are being applied correctly, whether all measurements are effectively implemented and if the system is acceptable in the civil service.
