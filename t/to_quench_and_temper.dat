40|$|An {{efficient}} simulation method, {{which includes}} microstructure, temperature and stress analysis applicable <b>to</b> both <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> processes, is developed and implemented using the commercial FEM package ABAQUS. This simulation encompasses phase transformations {{and their effects}} on the temperature distribution and stress/strain evolution, including the dependency of material properties on temperature and microstructure, transformation strains, latent heats and transformation plasticity. Three different multi-phase constitutive models, namely the average property model, the Voigt model and the Reuss model, have been implemented. The average property model {{is based on the}} linear mixture of material properties of different phase, while the Voigt model assumes the same strain field in all phases and the Reuss model assumes the iso-stress field. The simulation model has been applied <b>to</b> <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> of modified 4320 steel.

40|$|The fatigue {{resistance}} in ductile irons generally increases with tensile strength and matrix hardness as the matrix microstructure varies from ferrite through ferrite/pearlite <b>and</b> ausferrite <b>to</b> <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> martensite. However, {{there is a}} maximum in the fatigue limit in austempered ductile iron (ADI) microstructures at intermediate strength. This is also associated with high ductility, and is due to retained austenite in the ausferrite matrix. This paper investigates the role of microstructure in the control of short fatigue crack propagation in ADI. The length of arrested cracks, which nucleated at graphite nodules, {{is controlled by the}} ausferrite lath length distribution. Cracks are therefore arrested by the ausferrite packet and prior austenite grain boundaries. This indicates that refinement of the microstructure, for example by the use of lower austenitisation temperatures, could decrease the size of subcritical crack nuclei, which would increase the fatigue endurance limit...|$|R

The reported investigations show that, under non-proportional normal and shear stresses, fatigue life is increased in contrast to ductile steels where life is reduced due to changing principal stress directions. This behaviour caused by the low ductility of this alloy (e < 10 %) compared <b>to</b> <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> steels suggests the application of the Normal (Principal) Stress Hypothesis (NSH).

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the hardenability is important in steel development with respect to weldability of steels {{as well as to}} the design of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> steels. The common way to judge if steel is suitability to welding is the use of a carbon equivalent, which reflects the alloy content to the hardenability of the heat affected zone (HAZ). Most common of these equivalent is the IIW carbon equivalent wich has been in use for decades. However, this is an empirical equivalent, developed for CMn steels, and it doesn't say anything about the mechanical properties obtained in the HAZ. As a guideline a maximum HAZ hardness of 350 HV is normally put to avoid cold cracking in the HAZ. Numerous carbon equivalents have been published during the years, but few have been accepted and used. A drawnback of all these equivalents is that they have been evaluated for a set of chemical compositions which may be quite narrow, or that they have been evaluated on steels produced having other cleanliness, residual element levels etc. as is common in modern steelmarketing. The hardenability of steel designated <b>to</b> <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> is normally evaluated using either Jominy testing or using a calculation using the Grossmann formalism. As the hardenability described in the carbon equivalents used in welding and the hardenability of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> steels using the Grossmann formalism are two different descriptions of the same phenomenon the aim of this thesis is to link these two formalisms together and use the knowledge from the HAZ hardenability <b>to</b> design <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> steels. The goal is to produce such steel grades having a much better weldability as compared with standard grades available at the market.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of hydrogen diffusion in 21 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo steel subjected <b>to</b> <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> treatments {{has been carried}} out at room temperature in an attempt to establish the effect of microstructures developed by the heat treatment on the diffusivity and solubility of hydrogen by means of the electrochemical permeation technique. The results obtained are as follows: (1) The diffusion coefficient in the mixed structure of martensite and ferrite phases obtained by quenching from a low austenizing temperature is higher than that in the as-quenched martensitic structure obtained from a higher austenizing temperature. On the other hand, the solubility of hydrogen shows a behavior opposite to the diffusion coefficient. When tempered at 550 ℃, the diffusion coefficient to the precipitation of fine Mo and Cr carbides at the interface of the ferrite phase, thus increasing the interfacial areas. The interface acts predominantly as the hydrogen trapping site, and hence an increase in solubility and a corresponding decrease in diffusion coefficient occur. (2) With regard to the effect of tempering temperature on hydrogen diffusion, the as-quenched martensitic structure has a low value of diffusion coefficient and has the maximum at the tempering of about 350 ℃. The value of tempered structure decreases to a maximum at near 550 ℃ and increases again at higher temperatures. The solubility of hydrogen is high for the as-quenched martensitic structure and decreases with increasing tempering temperature to a minimum at 350 ℃ after which it increases until it reaches a maximum around at 550 ℃ and decreases again at higher temperatures. (3) The diffusion coefficient and solubility of hydrogen do not change even though the tempering time is increased up to 100 hrs at 350 ℃. However, in the specimen tempered at 550 ℃, the diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing <b>tempering</b> time <b>and</b> the solubility of hydrogen increases with it. (4) In the temperature range of 7 to 60 ℃, the diffusion coefficient and solubility of hydrogen in martensite tempered at 350 ℃ can be described as follows: D= 5. 86 × 10 ^ exp[(- 5530 ± 310) /RT] (cm^ 2 /S) C= 7. 27 × 10 ^ exp[(- 16670 ± 980) /RT] (mol/cm^ 3) The hydrogen absorption occurs by the exothermic reaction.

The microstructure is in its turn a result of the chemical composition and the process parameters during its production. In this thesis the connection between microstructure and mechanical properties is studied, with focus on the microstructure development during annealing in a continuous annealing line. In-line trials as well as the lab simulations have been carried out in order to investigate the impact of alloying elements and process parameters on the microstructure. Further, a dislocation model has been developed in order to analyze the work hardening behavior of DP steels during plastic deformation. From the in-line trials it was concluded that there is an inheritance from the hot rolling process both on the microstructure and properties of the cold rolled and annealed product. Despite large cold rolling reductions, recrystallization and phase transformations, the final dual phase steel is still effected by process parameters far back in the production chain, such as the coiling temperature following the hot rolling.

A preliminary numerical analysis of the material and structural solutions for the harmonic driver flexsplines assumed to be applied was conducted. Design/methodology/approach: Under the studies performed, geometrical models of flexsplines being manufactured for the HFUC and HFUS type harmonic drivers were developed based on their actual structures and geometrical dimensions. In order to enhance the data preparation process, the model geometry was recorded in a parametrical form. By altering the individual properties of the models, {{it is possible to}} automatically generate finite element grids for flexsplines of various geometrical and structural properties. The calculations prepared {{for the sake of the}} study by application of the finite element method (FEM) were conducted using the MSC Patran/Nastran and Femap/NX Nastran software. Findings: Using composite materials in production of flexsplines enables increasing the values of their fundamental vibration frequencies. Using composite materials based on an epoxy resin matrix reinforced with glass fibres causes an increase of the fundamental frequency values by ca. 20 %, and if the reinforcement is made with carbon fibres, the values increase by up to 35 % compared to flexsplines made of steel.

Such a tool is useful to assess the residual life of a component {{in the presence of a}} crack in critical regions where high stress concentrations cause cyclic yielding of the material. The scope of this paper is to discuss the application of existing models <b>to</b> a <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> structural steel. In particular, a series of experimental tests in the LCF regime at room and at high temperature (up to T = 500 ◦C) have been per- formed in order to analyze the crack propagation in the presence of plastic deformations. Two types of specimens have been used. Smooth cylindrical specimens have been used to obtain the cyclic stress-strain curve and the Manson-Coffin curve under constant strain amplitude loading. Moreover, in order to observe the initi- ation and growth of a fatigue crack, additional cylindrical speci- mens with an artificial defect of 100 or 400 μm depth have been tested. For these specimens, during the interruption of fatigue tests, the crack advancement has been detected using the plastic replica technique with a thin foil of acetate. The experimental results have been examined in terms of crack growth rates and a series of parameters have been used to correlate these data with the external applied load. Two different approaches, i. e. frac- ture mechanics approach (based on ∆K and ∆J) and analytical model based on Manson-Coffin law, have been analyzed in order to define a model able to predict the crack growth rate for high constant strain amplitudes. Finally, a new analytical model able to predict the crack growth rates is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Use of ultra-high-strength steels (UHSS) {{in weight}} {{critical}} constructions {{is an effective}} way to save energy and minimize carbon footprint in the end use. On the other hand, the demands for reducing manufacturing costs and energy consumption of the steelmaker are increasing. This has led to development of energy efficient direct quenching (DQ) steelmaking process as an alternative <b>to</b> the conventional <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> or thermomechanical rolling and accelerate cooled processes. Ruukki has employed thermomechanical rolling <b>and</b> direct <b>quenching</b> process (TM + DQ) for a novel type of ultra-high-strength strip and plate steels since 2001. Advantages of the ultra-high-strength level (> 900 MPa) can be fully utilized only if fabricated properties are on a sufficient level. Bending {{is one of the most}} important workshop processes and a good bendability is essential for a structural steel. Hence, the metallurgy and bendability of Ruukki´s TM + DQ strip steel Optim ® 960 QC have been investigated closely. It was found that by optimizing process parameters and chemical composition, a good combination of strength and ductility can be achieved by a modification of martensitic-bainitic microstructure. Despite of smaller total elongation, the bendability of Optim ® 960 QC is at least on the same level as on conventionally manufactured 960 MPa steels. However, it is important to pay special attention to bending process (tool parameters, springback, bending force, material handling) when bending UHSS. It was also found that the bendability of Optim ® 960 QC can be significantly enhanced by local laser heat treatments or roll forming...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: AAR Grade E {{steel is}} {{extensively}} {{used in the}} rail industry for the manufacture of rail related components. Due to {{the environment in which}} these components operate, it is required that they exhibit good mechanical properties. The casting process is amongst the most economic methods of manufacturing. In the rail industry, rail components are predominantly manufactured by means of sand casting. Sand casting accounts for a significant majority of the total tonnage cast. Sand casting consists of pouring molten metal into a sand mould, allowing the metal to solidify, and then breaking up the mould to remove the casting. After the component is cast, it is usually followed by a heat treatment process. For some components a machining operation follows after the heat treatment process. Depending on the application of the component, the heat treatment required may {{have a significant effect on}} the mechanical properties and the machinability of the alloy. It is therefore important to schedule the machine appropriately and to use the most efficient and cost effective machining strategy. This may reduce costs as well as energy usage. It is also important to optimize the heat treatment process for the required mechanical properties along with an appropriate machining strategy for the alloy and family of parts concerned. A literature review has indicated that limited information exists to optimize the heat treatment of AAR Grade E steel as related to heat treatment and machining strategy. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of heat treatment on the mechanical properties and machinability of AAR Grade E steel. A detailed literature review of the various topics that are covered in this research was conducted. These include the characterization of AAR Grade E steel, fundamentals of heat treatment, the applications of heat treatment on medium carbon steel alloys, the fundamentals of metal cutting and machinability of steels. An experimental program was developed to address the objectives that were established. This was executed by producing sample castings of a given diameter and thereafter subjecting them to various heat treatment cycles. These samples were then subjected to various heat treatment processes. Thereafter, various tests were conducted in order to determine its mechanical properties as well as machinability by using an instrumented lathe. The results obtained with regards to heat treatment showed that AAR Grade E steel responds positively <b>to</b> normalising, <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> when executed at the prescribed temperatures and soaking times. In addition to this, through a positive response to the various heat treatment processes, the respective samples exhibits mechanical properties that is typical to other steel grades having a similar chemical composition and that have undergone the same heat treatment process. In terms of the effect of heat treatment on the machinability of AAR grade E steel, it was found that depending on the machinability performance measure of interest, each material condition performs in a manner that is consistent with the fundamentals of machining as has been investigated in the literature review. A number of recommendations were made for consideration for future investigations of AAR grade E steel. M. Eng. (Mechanical Engineering...|$|R
