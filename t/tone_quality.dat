50|$|Cristofori's oval spinets {{have two}} choirs of strings, each at 8-foot (normal) pitch. In the pairs of strings {{seen in the}} diagram above, each pair {{consists}} of one string from each choir. The purpose of having two choirs was evidently twofold. First, when both strings are played at once, a louder sound is obtained. Second, the two choirs of strings have different timbres, so contrasting <b>tone</b> <b>qualities</b> {{can be obtained by}} selecting just one choir.|$|R
25|$|The sring (also called blul) is a {{relatively}} small, end-blown flute with a nasal <b>tone</b> <b>quality</b> found in the Caucasus region of Eastern Armenia. It is made of wood or cane, usually with seven finger holes and one thumb hole, producing a diatonic scale. One Armenian musicologist believes the sring {{to be the most}} characteristic of national Armenian instruments.|$|E
25|$|The timbre or <b>tone</b> <b>quality</b> of the guitalin can be {{described}} as a combination between a banjo and a mandolin, while the name of the instrument is derived from the combination of the names of the guitar and mandolin.

25|$|The <b>tone</b> <b>quality</b> can {{be altered}} without {{switching}} sticks or adjusting the tuning. For example, by playing closer to the edge, the sound becomes thinner. A more staccato sound can be produced by changing the velocity of the stroke or playing closer to the center. There are many more variations in technique that a timpanist uses {{during the course of}} playing to produce subtle timbral differences.|$|E

25|$|Some trombones are tuned {{through a}} {{mechanism}} in the slide section rather than via a separate tuning slide in the bell section. This method preserves a smoother expansion {{from the start}} of the bell section to the bell flare. The tuning slide in the bell section requires two portions of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the <b>tone</b> <b>quality.</b> Tuning the trombone enables it to play with other instruments which is essential for the trombone.|$|E
25|$|Mouthpiece {{selection}} {{is a highly}} personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape {{in order to produce}} a rich symphonic <b>tone</b> <b>quality,</b> while a jazz trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims and cups allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpiece to their preference.|$|E
25|$|Heckel and {{two generations}} of {{descendants}} continued to refine the bassoon, and their instruments became the standard, with other makers following. Because of their superior singing <b>tone</b> <b>quality</b> (an improvement upon {{one of the main}} drawbacks of the Almenräder instruments), the Heckel instruments competed for prominence with the reformed Wiener system, a Boehm-style bassoon, and a completely keyed instrument devised by Charles-Joseph Sax, father of Adolphe Sax. F.W. Kruspe implemented a latecomer attempt in 1893 to reform the fingering system, but it failed to catch on. Other attempts to improve the instrument included a 24-keyed model and a single-reed mouthpiece, but both these had adverse effects on tone and were abandoned.|$|E

25|$|The {{hammered}} dulcimer was extensively {{used during}} the Middle Ages in England, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Although it had a distinctive name in each country, it was everywhere regarded {{as a kind of}} psalterium. The importance of the method of setting the strings in vibration by means of hammers, and its bearing on the acoustics of the instrument, were recognized only when the invention of the pianoforte had become a matter of history. It was then perceived that the psalterium in which the strings were plucked, and the dulcimer in which they were struck, when provided with keyboards, gave rise to two distinct families of instruments, differing essentially in <b>tone</b> <b>quality,</b> in technique and in capabilities: the evolution of the psalterium stopped at the harpsichord, that of the dulcimer gave us the pianoforte.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to final}} assembly, the {{manufacturers}} usually apply a thin coating of clear or colored acrylic lacquer or silver plate over the brass. The lacquer or plating serves {{to protect the}} brass from oxidation and maintains its shiny appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used over the years. It is also possible to plate the instrument with nickel or gold, {{and a number of}} gold-plated saxophones have been produced. Plating saxophones with gold is an expensive process because gold does not adhere directly to brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold. Some saxophonists, sellers, and repair technicians argue that the type of lacquer or plating or absence thereof may enhance an instrument's <b>tone</b> <b>quality.</b> The possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from the other variables that affect an instrument's tone colors. In any case, what constitutes a pleasing tone is a matter of personal preference.|$|E
25|$|The first {{surviving}} {{record of}} a systematized approach to teaching singing {{was developed in the}} medieval monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church sometime near the beginning of the 13th century. As with other fields of study, the monasteries were the center of musical intellectual life during the medieval period and many men within the monasteries devoted their time to the study of music and the art of singing. Highly influential {{in the development of a}} vocal pedagogical system were monks Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia who were the first to develop a concept of vocal registers. These men identified three registers: chest voice, throat voice, and head voice (pectoris, guttoris, and capitis). Their concept of head voice, however, is much more similar to the modern pedagogists understanding of the falsetto register. Other concepts discussed in the monastic system included vocal resonance, voice classification, breath support, diction, and <b>tone</b> <b>quality</b> to name a few. The ideas developed within the monastic system highly influenced the development of vocal pedagogy over the next several centuries including the Bel Canto style of singing.|$|E

5000|$|An electro-acoustic ukulele is a {{standard}} acoustic instrument to which a passive pickup has been added, a method {{similar to that used}} for an acoustic-electric guitar. Such ukuleles have nylon or gut strings, not the metal strings necessary for ukuleles with magnetic pickups. Electro-acoustic ukuleles may be played either unplugged or plugged into an amplifier. Such nylon-strung ukuleles include those designed to look like metal-strung electric guitars, such as the Epiphone Les Paul-style acoustic-electric ukulele. The acoustic and electric <b>tone</b> <b>qualities</b> will often differ between electric ukuleles, and some [...] "a/e" [...] ukuleles are built with the aim of producing quality sound when amplified, {{to the detriment of the}} acoustic sound.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of gongs, each with varying <b>tone</b> <b>qualities.</b> The name is usually {{preceded by a}} prefix to specify each different kind. The largest type (over 120 cm in diameter) called dachaoluo, known for its deep and grave tone, is used in official settings like weddings, funerals and temple ceremonies. The smallest, the goujiaoluo (狗叫锣, lit. dog-calling gong), only 8 cm in diameter, can often be seen in theatrical ensembles in the southern parts of Fujian. Both the larger and the smaller boast distinct acoustic features, functions and performing styles. Different size and thinkness of the cymbals will affect the sound tone being produced.

25|$|All notes (except those {{below the}} open D) {{can be played}} {{on more than one}} string. This is a {{standard}} design feature of stringed instruments; however, it differs from the piano, which has only one location for each of its 88 notes. For instance, the note of open A on the violin can be played as the open A, or on the D string (in first to fourth positions) or even on the G string (very high up in sixth to ninth positions). Each string has a different <b>tone</b> <b>quality,</b> because of the different weights (thicknesses) of the strings and because of the resonances of other open strings. For instance, the G string is often regarded as having a very full, sonorous sound which is particularly appropriate to late Romantic music. This is often indicated in the music by the marking, for example, sul G or IV (a Roman numeral indicating to play on the fourth string; by convention, the strings are numbered from thinnest, highest pitch (I) to the lowest pitch (IV). Even without an explicit instructions in the score, an advanced violinist will use her/his discretion and artistic sensibility to select which string to play specific notes or passages.|$|E

500|$|Jackson mixed Streisand's , using a Digidesign Venue digital {{mixing console}} at FOH for its smaller {{footprint}} (allowing more audience seats) and its plug-in audio effects. As well, the Venue mixing system {{was chosen for}} its integration with Pro Tools hardware and software, to make 128-channel hard disk recordings of the concerts directly from the three Digidesign consoles: one to mix strings, one to mix brass, reeds and percussion, and one under Jackson's control out in the audience, with Streisand's microphone inputs and stems (submixes of other microphones) from the other consoles. The recordings made in New York City and Washington, D.C. were remixed into the album Live In Concert 2006—Jackson was listed as sound designer. Sharing sound designer and FOH mixing duties with Chris Carlton, Jackson made certain that the custom soft dome monitor wedges were positioned correctly aiming up from under the stage to cover everywhere Streisand might walk. Clair Brothers supplied 18 Dolby Lake Processors for the tour, the majority used by Jackson to tune the main sound system, and the rest for control of monitor wedges used by Streisand and by the supporting artist, Il Divo. For Streisand's voice, Jackson auditioned several wireless microphones and ended up using a Sennheiser SKM 5200 transmitter equipped with a Neumann KK 105 S supercardioid capsule. He used the vocal microphone to test the sound system from different locations around the arena. When the tour hit the UK and continental Europe, Jackson changed from a Neumann to a Røde Microphones capsule, custom made to his requirements; one that Røde called the [...] "Jackson Special". Jackson used Millennia microphone preamps for any microphone that was required {{to be sent to}} multiple mixing consoles, such as at Madison Square Garden where cable runs to the recording trucks were [...] long. The use of only one preamp prevents the microphone output from being loaded down by too little resistance which can change its <b>tone</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
