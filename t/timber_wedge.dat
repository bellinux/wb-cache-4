[...] The point clip clamps {{the end of a}} moving rail (the switch rail) of a set of points to its associated stock rail, and the scotch is a <b>timber</b> <b>wedge</b> used to ensure that the other moving rail is kept away from its associated stock rail. In this way the points are fixed in either the 'normal' or 'reverse' positions and cannot be moved by the usual setting mechanisms. For infrequently used points, this guards against mechanical failure of the points leaving them in a condition to derail trains. The 'clip and scotch' method {{can also be used to}} positively deny access to the turnout or mainline.|$|E

The lower portion is clad in timber weatherboards with pairs of casement windows occupying the upper portion to ceiling height. Containing no glass, the windows are enclosed by plywood shutters ornamented with triangular pieces of timber and secured from the inside. Each shutter has an angled top to accommodate an upside-down triangular fanlight of yellow patterned glass above each pair. Timber rafters supporting the roof are exposed {{on the underside of}} the plasterboard-clad eaves, with the ends cut away in a zigzag pattern. Where the rafters pierce the wall structure, the gap beneath is in-filled with yellow patterned glass and triangular <b>timber</b> <b>wedges.</b> A triangular light fitting remains over the main entrance door.|$|R
40|$|Timber is {{the oldest}} {{construction}} material. Timber taken from well managed forests,is the most sustainable construction material. It gives the minimum or no effects to environment when disposed as construction waste. The most attractive feature in structural timber, is the high strength to weight ratio of timber {{which can be used}} to transfer tension, compression and shear. Architects love to work with timber, as it has unique characteristics such as natural grain patterns, colours and colour variations, fine finishes and the various features of the species. When compared to other construction materials such as reinforced concrete or structural steel, solid timber members use for building industry such as columns, beams, floor boards etc has a limit for section sizes and length. The cost of large sections are more expensive than that of small sections. This limitation can be overcome with composite or built up timber sections. Timber has been used by Sri Lankan builders extensively during the ancient days. The main reasons are the availability in large quantities in our forests, convenience in shaping and connecting with nails or <b>timber</b> <b>wedges</b> and the skill in the trade given by forefathers. Their inventions were not limited to kitchen utensils, agricultural tools, transport facilities or recreational facilities. Ancient carpenters added beauty to their building construction by introducing fine details to timber members and connections. The new generation has realised the value of this natural material and the sustainability compared to other major construction materials. Therefore it is the duty of Engineers to use advance technology and find most efficient use in order to make them more cost effective. Some of the applications in this context are the use of built up members to replace solid sawn timber or proper connections to form large members out of small sections. This paper shall also discuss about Some of the efficient timber structural forms used by the author...|$|R

[...] Hut-builders felled selected trees, and sawed the trunks into suitable lengths. They then split these lengths into flitches using a maul and a <b>wedge.</b> <b>Timber</b> was split , that is, along the grain, instead of by the traditional British [...] method, from {{the core of the}} trunk out towards the bark. There was neither time nor tools suitable to properly dress timber into planks, nor to season the timber; it was used green.|$|R
50|$|When the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway {{was first}} opened, traffic along it mostly {{consisted}} of traffic going between Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre, although occasionally passengers got on at intermediate points. However, after the railroad was constructed, {{and due to}} its construction, some businesses began operation near the Pine View Ice Lakes along the route. The railroad also improved business for farmers near the community of Albert, {{who were able to}} send their milk to creameries in Hazleton. It also provided electricity for communities along the route. Additionally it transported materials for the mining industry, such as <b>timber</b> props, <b>wedges,</b> and sprags to Nuangola. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway provided an easy way for hunters, fishermen, and sportsmen to access the mountainous countryside between Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton. Common places that such people frequented along the route included Nuangola Lake, Pine View Lake, and Lake Blytheburn. These areas gradually developed into villages. chickens were once exported from the railroad's Nuangola station. Another use of the railway was to carry passengers from Hazleton to the Luzerne County Courthouse.|$|R
40|$|UNESCO’s {{approach}} towards heritage {{has evolved}} from one dominated by western doctrines to an anthropological approach that recognises the value of intangible traditions where the lives, knowledge and creative processes of inhabitants are treated as equally important to tangible sites and artefacts. While the latter prioritised the preservation of objects, intangible heritage {{stresses the importance of}} the safeguarding, dissemination and reproduction of traditional practices for future generations to adopt. This knowledge-based heritage is particularly important in South East Asia, rich with rituals and oral traditions that are passed down from generation to generation. However, as a result of colonisation, industrialisation, and standardisation, there is a threat to the value of arts, skills and ideals affecting the preservation of intangible heritage amongst locals. Dominant modern or western values often contradict traditional values, which are heavily influenced by spiritual and noumenal existence. One notable example of the destruction of this heritage is the loss of knowledge of traditional housebuilding in Malaysia. The architectural heritage of a Malay house is associated with abstract Malay beliefs and the symbolism built by traditional Malay master-craftsmen over generations, often involving the whole community. The Malay house is distinguished by the light wooden stilts structure held together by <b>timber</b> <b>wedges,</b> utilising one of the earliest prefabrication methods enabling disassembly and relocation. This strongly reflects a system of cultural kinship where the Malay constantly adapts to the spiritual and natural world surrounding him. The intangible and tangible elements of traditional Malay housebuilding are inseparable as the building process adheres to strict rituals, metaphorically merging both the individuals and the object. Although the knowledge transfer of Malay housebuilding was based on an apprenticeship system where skills were inherited from within the family trade, this study investigates an alternative view of knowledge transfer within the Malay world. As a forgotten trade, traditional Malay builders are now scarce, leaving a significant generation gap that is leading to the loss of knowledge in traditional Malay making and craftsmanship. This study documents and evaluates a ‘reverse-engineering’ technique of knowledge transfer discovered during the author’s fieldwork with modern Malay craftsman, which exploits the disassembly process of a Malay house as a tool to explore indigenous, ingenious and tacit knowledge embedded in each component of the house, recovering narratives of timelessness and rootedness. Applying theories of material culture, situated learning and practiced-based learning could substantiate this technique in addressing the values of Malay workmanship, techniques and rituals, traced from heritage objects. While traditional master craftsman find it hard to articulate their skills to others and traditional apprenticeships require years to pursue, the course of action in the disassembly and assembly of a Malay house explicitly conveys invaluable approach to knowledge transfer and the learning process for future generations, enabling them to master old techniques and evolve new craft practices rooted in the present...|$|R
