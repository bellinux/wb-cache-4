30|$|Interaction of the sectorial type {{toroidal}} flow with <b>the</b> axial dipole <b>field</b> induces <b>the</b> sectorial type poloidal <b>field.</b> Since <b>the</b> sectorial harmonics dominates in the toroidal flow, the sectorial harmonics is also predominant in <b>the</b> poloidal <b>field.</b> As <b>the</b> generating layer rotates westward, <b>the</b> sectorial <b>field</b> rotates together. This {{is observed}} as <b>the</b> drifting <b>field</b> with sectorial harmonics predominant. On the other hand, the meridional type flow, interacting with <b>the</b> axial dipole <b>field,</b> induces <b>the</b> poloidal <b>field</b> of zonal harmonics. Rotation of <b>the</b> zonal <b>field</b> induces zero secular variation. Therefore, <b>the</b> zonal <b>field</b> is not observed as <b>the</b> drifting <b>field.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> sectorial type <b>field</b> produced by <b>the</b> sectorial type toroidal flow is <b>the</b> only <b>field</b> that is observed as <b>the</b> drifting <b>field.</b>|$|R
