She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside the window <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> is out there.

Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the front runner, New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio on April 24, 1945 {{to vote for a}} new commissioner, Chandler's name was not on the short list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an informal vote <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> had the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.|$|E

The immediate goal of Internet recruiting is to find individuals that a recruiter or company can present to hiring managers for the purpose of employment. Quite often, Internet recruiters have very short-term goals when it comes to recruiting online. The general catalyst that sparks this process is when a new job requisite comes in (called a REQ). The recruiter scans his or her database <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone's</b> resumes match the requirements. If not, they proceed to search on the Internet.|$|R

However, she quickly became the target to be blamed by the public opinions. Many civil groups representing residents of the public housing estates reproached Wong for being incompetent to supervise the housing constructions and they demanded her and the Director of Housing, Tony Miller to step down.

5000|$|As {{part of the}} All-New, All-Different Marvel event, a new {{incarnation}} of Zodiac appears. This version has their Sects named after their Zodiac symbol. Their Leo Sect was shown speeding down the highways of Shanghai, China as they are being pursued by Spider-Man and Mockingbird in his new Spider-Mobile. Mockingbird told Nick Fury, Jr. that Zodiac broke into Parker Industries' Shanghai branch and stole some servers which {{would allow them to}} hack into the Webware devices. Nick Fury, Jr. tells them to not let it fall into Zodiac's hands and Spider-Man tells him {{he has no intention of}} letting S.H.I.E.L.D. have access to it either, cutting off Fury's protests by threatening to stop designing tech for S.H.I.E.L.D. As they swerve to avoid energy bolts, Spider-Man boasts of his superior driving skills. In the driver's seat of the Zodiacs' getaway car, Leo tells his Leo Sect grunts to take out the road. As Mockingbird complains that the Spider-Mobile is slowing down, Spider-Man tells her not to worry about crashing because it has web-fluid airbags. The Zodiac thugs blow up a car, destroying the road, but as they gloat the Spider-Mobile tails them, driving along the underside of the overpass. Cheered on by the citizens of Shanghai, Spider-Man switches the steering over to Mockingbird and opens the roof, addressing his fans in Mandarin, which he picked up taking his driving lessons. The Spider-Mobile's wheels unfold into insectoid legs and it flips over, cutting off the Zodiacs' escape. Spider-Man jumps onto the hood of their car, displaying a couple of the new webbing types he developed: micro-coiled Z-metal [...] "Bug Zappers" [...] capable of being electrified, and shock-absorbing expanding web-foam. The Zodiacs' car crashes and Spider-Man checks on the citizens <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone's</b> hurt. When one of them reprimands him for letting Zodiac's Leo Sect escape, Spider-Man states he's delegating their apprehension to Mockingbird, who knocks the grunts out and interrogates Leo as to why Zodiac has been trying to steal the Webware servers. Leo bites a suicide pill, but Spider-Man shoots him with an antidote he developed griping that he's tired of them killing themselves. Mockingbird accuses him of adhering to his [...] "no-one dies around me" [...] idealism, but Spider-Man tells her he's not so naive anymore and simply wants to save everyone he can. Later on at Max Modell and Hector Baez' wedding, Zodiac's Pisces Sect emerges from the river. While Peter offers himself up as a distraction, Hobie Brown changes into his Spider-Man costume. The leader of the Pisces Sect reveals they are after Peter's Webware specifically, because it has access to restricted data caches. Disguised as Spider-Man, Hobie intervenes and Peter tells Sajani to help the wedding guests (who are former Horizon Labs employees) find cover. Hobie's lack of a Spider-Sense gets him knocked out of the fight and Peter realizes that he could be killed. Encrypting his Webware, he gives it to the Pisces Sect who depart as the police arrive. Peter tells Hobie to change into his Prowler costume and that they'll retrieve the Webware together before Zodiac undoes his encryption while the Horizon Lab alumni lament that they'll find themselves targeted by supervillains again as they reminisced over past incidents.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{episode is}} {{approximately}} 25 minutes long. Most {{of the stories}} are centered on Clandestino doing or plotting something that will either destroy Bluffoonia's last forest or otherwise disrupt the Bluffers' lives, and the Bluffers' attempts to thwart him. Some of the stories are centered on the Bluffers' plans to steal Clandestino's [...] "Secret of Getting It All" [...] so they {{can use it to}} remove him from power. This secret, which plays a major part in most episodes, is never successfully stolen or even revealed throughout the series. The closest of it seen is the door to the secret, locked and vaulted with chains, a skull and stylish lights around its frame. Only Clandestino is allowed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it, and <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> tries and dares, even by his servants, are to be killed.

50|$|The only scoring in {{the third}} quarter was a 33-yard field goal Badgers kicker Philip Welch. Then in the fourth quarter, Michigan State pulled farther ahead with a 15-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Keshawn Martin from Cousins. The Spartans converted the 2-point conversion with a pass to Cunningham from Cousins. With the game almost out of reach, the Badgers came down and scored on a Russell Wilson 22-yard touchdown run. The Badgers got the ball back and scored on a 2-yard touchdown pass to Ball from Wilson that tied the game at 31-31 with 1:26 left. The Spartans got the ball back and on first down, Cousins was flushed from the pocket and lost a handle of the ball but it was recovered by the Spartans. Wisconsin called a timeout with 42 seconds left and second-and 20 from the Spartans own 24-yard line. After a 12-yard completion from Cousins to Cunningham, both coaches were waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who or <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> was going to call a time out. The Badgers coach Bret Bielema called a timeout again thinking they would get the ball back if they can stop the Spartans on third down. The Spartans picked up the first down on an 11-yard shovel pass for Martin. Michigan State's last drive appeared to stall at the Wisconsin 44, but the Spartans had time for one more play. Cousins was able to buy enough time for his receivers to get down field for a final Hail Mary pass. The ball bounced off Cunningham's helmet and into Keith Nichol's hands at the 1-yard line. Badgers linebacker Mike Taylor was fighting to keep Nichol from getting into the endzone but Nichol made one final lunge {{to try to get the}} ball across the goal line. The officials ruled that the ball was short and marked at the half-yard line. After review, it was determined that Nichol had crossed the goal line and it was a touchdown. This was the second year in a row that Michigan State handed Wisconsin their first loss of the season.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Peter Seitz Adams {{and a number}} of other Contemporary Traditional Artists saw the need for an {{organization}} that could help to bring order to what they saw as the reemerging traditional art movement in California. Adams, his wife Elaine and Jeffrey Morseburg had been discussing the need for an organization that could mount exhibitions and promote the artists who were reviving California Plein-Air Painting. In 1993, when Verna Guenther, who was a member of the historic California Art Club, came <b>to</b> Morseburg <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> he knew <b>anyone</b> younger who would be capable of taking over the venerable organization that then consisted of an aging cohort of painters, Morseburg suggested Peter and Elaine Adams. The Adams saw the value in taking over an existing organization to promote traditional fine arts rather than forming a new one. Peter Adams soon accepted the Presidency of the California Art Club and has served in that capacity since that time. In order to reorganize the California Art Club, Adams recruited most of the active professional landscape and figurative painters that he knew. The core group of artists who became members of the reorganized California Art Club primarily consisted of students of Theodore Lukits or Sergei Bongart. Among the first group of painters to join the CAC included Tim Solliday, Bill Stout, Stephen Mirich, Steve Houston, Dan Goozee, Daniel W. Pinkham, Sunny Apinchapong, Richard Rackus (b. 1922) and the Russian painters, Alexander Orlov and Alexey Steele. Because of the tremendous influx of academically trained Chinese painters in California, Adams and the CAC added painters like Mian Situ, Michael Situ, and Jove Wang to its roster. Some of the artists who had been vital members of the California Art Club prior to the Adams administration, such as Don and Wanda Durborow and Rolf and Evelyn Zilmner, who was Chairman of the Gold Medal Exhibition, played important roles in the revitalization. The re-organized California Art Club soon began organizing museum shows devoted to both its historic and contemporary members and soon the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History, the Frederick R. Weissman Museum at Pepperdine and other institutions were hosting exhibitions. A newsletter with articles by recognized scholars and exhibition catalogs contributed to making the works of the CAC's Plein-Air Painters and other artists more widely known. The organization also held frequent [...] "paint outs" [...] where artists met and worked on location as a group. As the reorganized California Art Club matured, the emphasis on en plein air painting, the focus of many of the artists began to shift somewhat as more experienced figurative artists joined the organization. By 2000, the cut-off date for the artists on the list below, the California Art Club was an incredibly diverse organization, reflecting the tremendous strength of the Pacific Rim. There were young artists in their twenties and older painters in their eighties, men and women, artists from Europe, Russia, all over Asia and throughout the United States.|$|R
