5|$|After an {{interlude}} {{of several}} months in which the Peloponnesians constructed new ships and the Athenians besieged cities and raised money throughout the Aegean, the next major sea battle took place the spring of 410 BC at Cyzicus. Alcibiades {{had been forced to}} flee from Sestos to Cardia to protect his small fleet from the rebuilt Peloponnesian navy, {{but as soon as the}} Athenian fleet was reunited there its commanders led it to Cyzicus, where the Athenians had intelligence indicating that Pharnabazus and Mindarus, the Peloponnesian fleet commander, were together plotting their next move. Concealed by storm and darkness, the combined Athenian force reached the vicinity without being spotted by the Peloponnesians. Here the Athenians devised a plot <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> enemy into battle. According to Diodorus Siculus, Alcibiades advanced with a small squadron in order <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> Spartans out to battle, and, after he successfully deceived Mindarus with this ploy, the squadrons of Thrasybulus and Theramenes came to join him, cutting off the Spartans' retreat.|$|E
5|$|During the {{campaign}} Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized {{his response to}} Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> federal government's attention {{to the situation in}} the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.|$|E

The eight colors are yellow, blue, red (all from the national flag), sky blue, green, grey, silver and gold. There is also a nine piece instruction on how <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> coat of arms, followed by a full color drawing and {{a black and white}} drawing of the arms. No size specifications have been laid out for the coat of arms except for when it is used on the national flag.|$|E

5|$|The {{case against}} Martin falters as {{evidence}} disappears and witnesses fail to identify {{him in a}} line-up.

5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes is {{heightened}} by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm {{face of the}} Earth and the depths of dark space, the chaos and unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.|$|E

5|$|After {{the war and}} his {{recovery}} from the Chapultepec wound, Longstreet and Louise Garland were officially married on March 8, 1848, and the marriage produced 10 children. He and his new wife served on frontier duty in Texas, primarily at Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg and Fort Bliss in El Paso. He performed scouting missions and also served as major and paymaster for the 8th Infantry from July 1858. Author Kevin Phillips claims that during this period Longstreet {{was involved in a}} plot <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> Mexican state of Chihuahua into the Union as a slave state.|$|E
5|$|At 00:25, Kondo {{ordered all}} of his ships that were able to {{converge}} and destroy any remaining U.S.ships. However, the Japanese ships still {{did not know where}} Washington was located, and the other surviving U.S.ships had already departed the battle area. Washington steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged South Dakota. The Imperial ships finally sighted Washington and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled seamanship of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.|$|E
