40|$|Many recent {{experiments}} have used parallel Implicit Association Test (IAT) and selfreport <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> attitudes. These <b>measures</b> are sometimes strongly correlated.

Interpretations of these empirical patterns are of three types: single-representation — the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> assess a single attitude, but under the influence of different extra-attitudinal process influences; dual-representation — the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> assess distinct forms of attitudes (e. g., conscious vs. unconscious; implicit vs. explicit); and person vs. culture — a variant of the dualrepresentation view in which self-report measures reflect personal attitudes, whereas IAT measures reflect non-attitudinal cultural or semantic knowledge.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the distinguishability properties of the input-output mappings Φ [·]:K_ 0 → C[0,T] and Ψ[·]:K_ 1 → C^ 1 [0,T], which are determined by the measured output data at x= 0 and x= 1, respectively. In this study, we conclude that the distinguishability of the input-output mappings Φ[·] and Ψ [·] hold which implies the injectivity of the inverse mappings Φ^- 1 and Ψ^- 1. This provides the insight that compared to the Dirichlet type, the Neumann <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> output data is more effective for the inverse problems of determining unknown coefficients. Moreover, the measured output data f(t) and h(t) are obtained analytically by a series representation, which leads to the explicit form of the input-output mappings Φ[·] and Ψ[·]. We also show that the value of the unknown coefficient k(x) at x= 1 is determined by using the Neumann <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> output data at x= 1 which brings about more restrictions on the set of admissible coefficients. However, k(0) is not obtained by Dirichlet <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> output data at x= 0. This provides the insight that Neumann <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> output data is more effective than Dirichlet type for the inverse problem of determining an unknown coefficient. This work advances our understanding of the use of the Fourier method of separation of variables and the input-output mapping in the investigation of inverse problems for fractional parabolic equations. The authors plan to consider various fractional inverse problems in future studies, since the method discussed has a wide range of applications.|$|R
5000|$|As {{discussed}} in Mikolajczyk et al.(2005), by choosing points that maximize the determinant of the Hessian, this measure penalizes longer structures that have small second derivatives (signal changes) {{in a single}} direction.

However, it should be ensured that once the measure is carried out, the problem does not re-emerge in the short term. In fact, where there are very cracked rocks, the shallower rock portions can undergo mechanical incoherence, sometimes encouraged by extremes of climate, causing the isolation of unstable blocks.|$|E
