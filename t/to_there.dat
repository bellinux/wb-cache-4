5|$|The {{forward speed}} at which {{oscillations}} begin, at about 1m/s (2.2mph) in this example, sometimes called the double root speed due <b>to</b> <b>there</b> being a repeated root to the characteristic polynomial (two of the four eigenvalues have exactly the same value). Below this speed, the bike simply falls over as an inverted pendulum does.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the many}} western {{travelers}} coming into China {{to live and}} trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested <b>to,</b> <b>there</b> were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.|$|E

5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due <b>to</b> <b>there</b> being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
5|$|Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence {{coordinated the}} country's {{preparations}} for Phet, utilizing a national disaster plan that organized the various ministries, and providing early warnings. Storm warnings were broadcast in seven languages, a response <b>to</b> <b>there</b> being only English and Arabic warnings during Cyclone Gonu, which struck Oman in 2007. Residents were advised to remain {{away from the}} rough seas during the storm. Businesses and schools were shut down in the areas the storm affected, with schools operating as emergency shelters near Muscat. About 85% of the isolated Masirah Island was evacuated; the passage of Phet and subsequent storms affecting the Arabian Peninsula influenced the Omani government's decision to build a fixed link with the island 40km (25mi) offshore. Nationwide, 12,870people evacuated, utilizing 91 government-opened shelters. Omani officials shut down the country's {{oil and gas production}} facilities during the storm.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper; the claim {{is based on an}} exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or not, represented by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised to the power of number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded <b>to</b> <b>There</b> are 221,184 possible ways for a customer to order a Whopper sandwich. Other slogans include It takes two hands to handle a Whopper and Burger King: Home of the Whopper.|$|E

5|$|Serjeant's Inn was an Inn of Court {{restricted}} to Serjeants-at-Law. It operated from three locations, one in Holborn, known as Scroope's Inn, which was abandoned by 1498 {{for the one}} in Fleet Street, which was pulled down during the 18th century, and one on Chancery Lane, pulled down in 1877. The Inn was a voluntary association, and although most Serjeants joined upon being appointed they were not required <b>to.</b> <b>There</b> were rarely more than 40 Serjeants, even including members of the judiciary, and the Inns were noticeably smaller than the Inns of Court. Unlike the Inns of Court, Serjeant's Inn was a private establishment similar to a gentlemen's club.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Borders Railway, there have been many {{complaints}} about lack of seats, provision of ticket machines and lack of parking, especially at Tweedbank. The high demand has led ScotRail to increase some services to three or four carriage trains. However this and the general opening of the line have also contributed <b>to</b> <b>there</b> being a general shortage of train carriages across the ScotRail network, leading to them hiring extra trains.|$|E

The Captain leaves Lieutenant Geordi La Forge (Levar Burton) in command (Geordi's first time in Acting Command of a Starship).

5|$|The group stage {{began on}} 18 November and ended on 27 November with Group A's final match between Ethiopia and Burundi. At {{the end of}} the group stage, the teams who {{finished}} bottom of their group were eliminated, along with the two teams above them (in Group A), and the team above them (in Group B), whereas the teams positioned in the top two slots in the groups progressed to the knock-out rounds. Due <b>to</b> <b>there</b> being an odd number of teams, Group A contained more matches and an additional team, with a total of 5 to Group B's 4 teams.|$|E
5|$|The hill {{required}} {{a lot of}} volunteer work to maintain and run during the season and particularly for the tournament. It also lacked a ski lift. Combined, this made {{it increasingly difficult to}} recruit new ski jumpers during the 1960s, particularly after a lift was installed on Mount Revelstoke in 1961. Skiing activities moved to Mount Mackenzie during the 1960s and in 1973, the ski club also relocated <b>to</b> <b>there.</b> The Tournament of Champions during 1971 and 1972 incurred a heavy loss. The last major tournaments in Nels Nelson Hill were the Western Canadian Ski Jumping Tournament, the Canadian Junior and Senior Ski Jumping Championship and the International Cross Country Championship, held in February and March 1974. The last tournament was a junior event held in 1975. The venue has since fallen into disrepair.|$|E
5|$|When the {{division}} arrived in France, it {{came under the}} command of the First Allied Airborne Army, which controlled all Allied airborne formations. The division, along with two others, was selected to participate in Operation Varsity, the airborne operation to support the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group crossing the River Rhine, but was removed from the operation due <b>to</b> <b>there</b> being insufficient transport aircraft to carry all three divisions into combat. Several other operations were planned for {{the division}} after the end of Operation Varsity, but these operations were cancelled when their objectives were captured by the rapid advance of Allied ground forces and they became superfluous. After the end of the conflict in Europe, the 13th Airborne was shipped to the United States to stage there before it was to participate in the planned invasion of Japan, but the conflict in the Far East ended before it was required and it remained in the United States. The 13th Airborne Division was finally inactivated on 26 February 1946 and its combat personnel were transferred to the command of the 82nd Airborne Division.|$|E

5|$|Leslie Richard Groves Jr. {{was born}} in Albany, New York, on 17 August 1896, the third son of four {{children}} of a pastor, Leslie Richard Groves Sr., and his wife Gwen née Griffith. A descendant of French Huguenots who came to America in the 17th century, Leslie Groves Sr. resigned as pastor of the Sixth Presbyterian church in Albany in December 1896 to become a United States Army chaplain. He was posted to the 14th Infantry at Vancouver Barracks in Washington in 1897. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish–American War in 1898, Chaplain Groves was sent to Cuba with the 8th Infantry. On returning to Vancouver Barracks, he was ordered to rejoin the 14th Infantry in the Philippines; service in the Philippine–American War and the Boxer Rebellion followed. The 14th Infantry returned to the United States in 1901 and moved to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The family relocated <b>to</b> <b>there</b> from Vancouver, then moved to Fort Hancock, New Jersey, the next year, and returned to Vancouver in 1905. Chaplain Groves was hospitalized with tuberculosis at Fort Bayard in 1905. He decided to settle in southern California and bought a house in Altadena. His next posting was to Fort Apache, Arizona. The family spent their summers there and returned to Altadena where the children attended school.|$|E

25|$|The NCC {{was a small}} railway and did {{not require}} the variety of coach types that its parent the LMS did.
