5|$|Major issues {{brought up}} during the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's stimulus plan, which Tedisco did not take a stance on {{until late in the}} race. Murphy supported it while Tedisco eventually opposed it. Tedisco portrayed Murphy's support of the plan as a potential cause of the AIG bonus scandal. Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.|$|E
5|$|Each {{candidate}} {{aimed to}} discredit the other by pointing out his opponent's flaws or mistakes. Republicans called attention to Murphy's failure <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> a start-up computer software company he had founded in the 1990s, drawing comparison to three high-profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes. Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed {{to vote in the}} 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for {{the ability to be}} turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1947 season, Breadon {{decided to}} sell the team. He had still been unable to find land for his planned stadium, and was facing the {{prospect}} of having <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> his stadium fund. However, he would have likely had to sell the team in any event, as he had learned he had terminal prostate cancer. When local tax attorney and real estate investor Fred Saigh got word that the Cardinals were on the market, he met with Breadon and he made an unusual proposal: if Breadon sold him the team, he would not have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> his stadium fund. To ease his initial reluctance to make the deal, Saigh brought in former Postmaster General of the United States Robert E. Hannegan as a partner. In late 1947, Breadon sold the club to Saigh and Hannigan for $4 million. In addition to winning six World Series and nine NL pennants, Breadon also had the highest regular season winning percentage of any owner in franchise history at [...]570. His teams totaled 2,470 wins and 1,830 losses.|$|E

2500|$|In Anhui, Wan Li was {{responsible}} for the earliest post-Mao agrarian reform. [...] He instituted the household-responsibility system whereby farmers divided communal lands and assigned them to individual farmers. [...] However, Wan faced resistance from conservatives in Beijing who criticized his reforms as not sufficiently socialist or ineffective. [...] However, Wan pressed on with the reforms anyway. [...] His six guidelines (the Anhui liu tiao) relaxed controls on trading as well, permitting farmers to sell surplus produce independently. Peasants were allowed to grow vegetables on 3/10th of a mu and did not have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> wheat and oil-bearing plants grown on private plots.|$|E

Throughout {{the period of the}} exemption, the developer must pay at least the property taxes paid on the property prior to the exemption being granted. Developers do not have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the increased value of the property {{for the duration of the}} abatement period, with a phase out period in which the tax benefit is gradually reduced over years.

2500|$|PEF's first president, John J. Kraemer, {{served a}} single, {{turbulent}} term in office. [...] He {{was accused of}} being a [...] "no-show" [...] employee at his previous position with the New York State Department of Labor, but was exonerated of the charges. He also had been accused and found innocent of being paid a salary from both PEF and state. As his legal troubles continued, Kraemer focused on negotiating the union's second contract. [...] Pensions were a major issue for the union. In 1976, the state enacted a new pension plan under which state employees paid income taxes on their mandatory contribution to the state pension plan, which PEF claimed forced workers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> income they may never receive. Although the agreement ratified in March 1982 did not address the pension issue, the contract negotiated by Kraemer won pay raises of 9 percent the first year and 8 percent the next two years in exchange for a {{reduction in the number of}} sick days given to employees.|$|E
2500|$|On September 24, 2010, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office {{finally began}} the {{investigation}} of former Bell Police Chief Randy Adams, {{as part of the}} expanding probe of city officials.

Baylen, Los Angeles Times). Prosecutors filed suit regarding an agreement with Rizzo, Adams had himself declared disabled the day of his being hired in Bell. The disability status stands to net Adams millions of tax-free pension dollars at taxpayers’ expense. Under the agreement, the 59-year-old Adams would receive a lifetime disability benefit whenever he was ready to retire, meaning he would not have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> half of his $400,000-plus annual pension. His Bell retirement would be the third-richest in the state's huge pension system. [...] The state attorney filed suit against Adams and Bell following that report on his [...] "disability". [...] "You're only supposed to receive a disability retirement if you are disabled and unable to perform the normal duties of your job," [...] said California Public Employees' Retirement System spokesman Ed Fong.

2500|$|Sullivan and Garner {{are viewed}} as standing, in tandem, for the {{proposition}} that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer {{would probably have to}} report the amount of the illegal income, but might validly claim the privilege by labeling the item [...] "Fifth Amendment" [...] (instead of [...] "illegal gambling income," [...] "illegal drug sales," [...] etc.) The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has stated: [...] "Although the source of income might be privileged, the amount must be reported." [...] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stated: [...] ".... the amount of a taxpayer's income is not privileged even though the source of income may be, and Fifth Amendment rights can be exercised in compliance with the tax laws [...] "by simply listing his alleged ill-gotten gains in the space provided for 'miscellaneous' income on his tax form." [...] In another case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: [...] "While the source of some of [...] Johnson's income may have been privileged, assuming that the jury believed his uncorroborated testimony that he had illegal dealings in gold in 1970 and 1971, the amount of his income was not privileged and he was required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] In 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated: [...] "A careful reading of Sullivan and Garner, therefore, is that the self-incrimination privilege can be employed to protect the taxpayer from revealing the information as to an illegal source of income, but does not protect him from disclosing the amount of his income." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2013 {{legislation}}, Virginia tied its gas {{tax rate}} to {{passage of the}} Marketplace Fairness Act or similar legislation by January 1, 2015.

50|$|Deferral {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{features}} of the worldwide tax system that allows U.S. multinational companies <b>to</b> delay <b>paying</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> foreign profits.

50|$|Unfortunately for Vandervell, his tax {{avoidance}} scheme was not successful. In {{respect of the}} shares, the Inland Revenue Commissioners (IRC) argued that Vandervell retained an equitable interest (in the shares) and as such, he was liable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the value of those shares. This is because, they argued, his oral instruction to the trust company was not capable of transfer of the equitable interest, since it did not comply with the formality requirements specified in s53(1)c of the Law of Property Act 1925, requiring signed writing to evidence {{the existence of a}} disposition. The House of Lords held that s53(1)c was not applicable to situations where a beneficiary directs his trustees, by way of his Saunders v Vautier right to do so, to transfer full (legal and equitable: note Lord Browne-Wilkinson's rejection of such terminology in Westdeutsche Landesbank Gironzentralle v Islington LBC) ownership to someone else. As such, Vandervell had successfully divested himself of ownership (legal and equitable) in the shares, notwithstanding that he did so by means of an oral instruction. He was thus not liable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the shares.|$|R
