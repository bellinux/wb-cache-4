60|$|We are a <b>tidal</b> <b>harbour</b> at Pavilionstone, {{as indeed}} I have implied already in my mention of tidal trains. At low water, {{we are a}} heap of mud, with an empty channel in it where a couple of men in big boots always shovel and scoop: with what exact object, I am unable to say. At that time, all the {{stranded}} fishing-boats turn over on their sides, {{as if they were}} dead marine monsters; the colliers and other shipping stick disconsolate in the mud; the steamers look as if their white chimneys would never smoke more, and their red paddles never turn again; the green sea-slime and weed upon the rough stones at the entrance, seem records of obsolete high tides never more to flow; the flagstaff-halyards droop; the very little wooden lighthouse shrinks in the idle glare of the sun. And here I may observe of the very little wooden lighthouse, that when it is lighted at night, - red and green, - it looks so like a medical man's, that several distracted husbands have at various times been found, on occasions of premature domestic anxiety, going round and round it, trying to find the Nightbell.|$|E

50|$|These dissatisfactions led to {{the company}} {{sponsoring}} the Ely <b>Tidal</b> <b>Harbour</b> and Railway, which was authorised by Parliament on 21 July 1856. This was to construct a <b>tidal</b> <b>harbour</b> at Penarth, south-west of Cardiff, and an approach railway from Radyr on the Taff Vale line. The route was modified by an Act the following year, on 27 July 1857, {{and the name of}} the railway changed to the Penarth Harbour, Dock and Railway. The railway leading to <b>Tidal</b> <b>Harbour</b> east of Cardiff, was just over 6 miles long, was opened in August 1859, but the dock took much longer to complete: it was ready in 1865.|$|E
50|$|After running further {{alongside}} the tidal estuary the line finally arrives at Looe railway station, opposite {{the point at}} which the West Looe River flows into the East Looe River to form the <b>tidal</b> Looe <b>harbour.</b> The town centre is a five-minute walk further {{alongside the}} river and buses to Polperro stop on the road near the station.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tidal</b> Outer <b>Harbour</b> is {{only used}} for {{entrance}} to the marina through twin sea locks, which are operated 24 hours a day.

50|$|One {{result of}} this archival {{research}} was a reassessment of C.E. Broadhurst, who like Xantho, had been roundly dismissed as two of Western Australia's greatest colonial-era failures. In respect of the re-evaluation of the ship itself, the research led to a realisation that its purchase, despite its age and its many deficiencies, was a bold and logical stroke typical of an entrepreneur with great vision, but lacking the necessary access to financial and logistical support. Being mass-produced, for example, spare parts were readily available (a spare connecting-rod {{was found in the}} ship's engine room) and being very simple, easily accessible and compact, repairs could be effected with only a rudimentary knowledge of marine engineering. On reflection it became apparent that Broadhurst also used Xantho primarily as a sailing ship and would not have used the ship's engine other than to assist the vessel when proceeding against the wind, especially when entering the often difficult <b>tidal</b> <b>harbours</b> on the north-west coast. Further, with an eye to obtaining the lucrative subsidy for operating a steamer to schedule on the coast, Broadhurst also appears to have made a point by steaming into port and thereby impressing a colonial administration crying out for steam transport on the coast. As a result of these findings, the Museum's Xantho exhibition entitled 'Steamships to Suffragettes' focusses as much on the people involved (including the Broadhurst's suffragette daughter Katharine) as it does on the engine and its conservation.|$|R
50|$|Several {{attempts}} to arouse {{the interest of}} the Hon. East India Company and the Royal Mail. These failed, and the Transit loaded cargo and sailed to join convoy in June 1801. While waiting for the convoy to assemble, Gower, ever the salesman, showed her off to the King and his party on the Royal Yacht in Christchurch Bay. Gower learned later that, although George III had asked many questions about the Transit, none present had been able to answer him and none thought to ask the inventor who was nearby. Later the Chairman of the Hon. East India Company summoned Gower to a meeting. Gower says that the chairman said that the Company would buy the Transit, provided she proved to be a fast-sailing vessel. At the instance of Earl St Vincent, now the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Transit was tried against Osprey. She was a fast sloop of 383 tons (about twice the tonnage of the Transit) and, according to Gower, the commander of Osprey was generous in his praise. To Gower's chagrin, no order was forthcoming and he had to re-ship his cargo and join convoy for Lisbon on 27 August. The important question of what happened to change the decision of the Company is, as yet, unresolved. Perhaps Gower put a gloss on the intention of the Chairman of the Company or on the opinion of Osprey's captain. Perhaps someone in the Admiralty tampered with Osprey's report before forwarding it to the Company. Perhaps there was some aspect of the design of the Transit, say her problems in shallow <b>tidal</b> <b>harbours,</b> or the strange way of her sailing, that killed off the Company's enthusiasm. Maybe there is still a note in some archive that could tell us why the Transit did not become the first {{of a new generation of}} fast traders.|$|R

50|$|The Automatic Tide Marker Station {{achieved}} its objectives. However, Irvine harbour's fortunes still declined, {{partly because}} of it being a <b>tidal</b> <b>harbour</b> and {{partly because of}} intense rivalry from other local ports.

50|$|The River Avon never {{flowed through}} the Cumberland Basin. Before the 19th century {{improvements}} {{and the construction}} of the non-tidal Floating Harbour, the Avon flowed through the <b>tidal</b> <b>harbour</b> and out through the future location of the Underfall Yard. When the basin and Floating Harbour were constructed the river was diverted through the New Cut, bypassing the harbour entirely.|$|E
50|$|Twelve {{thousand}} years ago Hokianga was a river valley flanked by steep bush-clad hills. As {{the last ice age}} regressed, the dramatic rise in sea level slowly flooded the valley turning it into a <b>tidal,</b> saltwater, <b>harbour</b> with abundant sheltered deep water anchorages. This was the harbour that Kupe left from, and in 1822 saw the first European timber entrepreneurs. Southern Right Whales possibly frequented in the bay historically prior to significant depletion of the species caused by commercial and illegal hunts including mass illegal slaughters by Soviet Union with helps from Japan in 1960s to 80s. Today, large whales are rarely seen in the bay while smaller dolphins and Killer Whales are more common in the harbor water, as the harbour is one of well-regarded areas to watch them from shores.|$|R
40|$|Balanus amphitrite {{survived the}} two cold winters of 1995 / 1996 and 1996 / 1997. Actually {{it was able}} to {{reproduce}} during the following summers of 1996 and 1997. In 1997 there were even two spatfalls due to the late summer being exceptionally warm, especially the month of August. A thorough survey along the Belgian coast during 1996 and 1997 revealed that B. amphitrite was present in the harbours of Oostende and Nieuwpoort but not yet in the harbours of Blankenberge and Zeebrugge. In the harbour of Oostende it occurred in all the docks, mainly on manmade constructions, as well as fouling on yachts. In the harbour of Nieuwpoort, which bas no docks, but extensive <b>tidal</b> yachting <b>harbours,</b> B. amphitrite was found exclusively as fouling on many of the yachts. After the first findings of the southern barnacle B. amphitrite along the Belgian coast in 1995, it appears now that this species has established itself well as a regular member of the fouling cornrnunity...|$|R
40|$|In the {{mesohaline}} {{zone of the}} Westerschelde estuary Eurytemora affinis is {{the dominant}} copepod, demonstrating large biomass values nearly throughout the year. In the meso-polyhaline Lake Veere Acartia tonsa is abundant, mainly during summer. In spring a small population of Eurytemora americana is found. The <b>tidal</b> estuary <b>harboured</b> far denser copepod populations throughout the year than the stagnant brackish lake water. The average yearly copepodid + adult biomass in the Westerschelde estuary was approx. 850 mg/m³ (wet weight), in Lake Veere approx. 130 mg/m³. Temporarily low oxygen values did not influence negatively the copepod populations in the Westerschelde estuary. The seasonal distribution of the dominant copepods in both areas is explained {{in the light of}} recent literature data. Perennial Eurytemora affinis abundance in the Westerschelde estuary must be mainly caused by large concentrations of nannodetritus particles, bacteria included, throughout the year. Acartia tonsa in Lake Veere has to thrive mainly on nannophytoplankton...|$|R

The Queenhithe dock remains today, but has long fallen out of use and is heavily silted up (being <b>tidal).</b> Queenhithe <b>harbour</b> was used for importing corn into London and continued {{to be in use}} into the 20th century, by the fur and tanning trades. Being upstream of London Bridge, however, meant that large sea-going sailing ships could no longer safely reach the dock from the sea. King Charles II landed at Queenhithe during the Great Fire of London in September 1666 to view the extent of the destruction and assist in the firefighting.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{interest}} in benthic indicators for soft-bottom marine communities has dramatically increased after a rather {{long period of}} relative stagnation due {{to the need for}} new tools to assess the status of marine waters, called for by the Clean Water Act and the Water Framework Directive. Our expertise on ben- thic communities has permitted us to gather a vast amount of data from diverse water bodies under unpolluted and polluted conditions (e. g., accidental oil spill, sewage, long-term anthropogenic estuarine constraints) in <b>tidal</b> estuaries, <b>harbours,</b> and on the coastal shelf from Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. We compared the results of four biotic indices on the various available datasets: Shannon-Wiener H diversity, AMBI and BO 2 A, which divide the species into Ecological Groups, and ITI, which divides the species into trophic groups, and the agreement of Best Professional Judgement (BPJ) on the assessment of ecological conditions. Benthic indicators as "sentinel species", which is a particular species that by its presence or its relative abundance warns of possible unbalances in the surrounding environment or dis- tortions in community functions, was also tested. Indicators, BPJ and opportunist sentinel species gave similar ECoQS for the different sampling sites. We discuss the use of Biological Indicators as 'objective' or 'subjective' alternatives for assessing soft-bottom communities, and propose to employ simple methods such as BPJ and taxonomy sufﬁciency in such diagnostic approaches...|$|R
