5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her dressing room. Lawson added that having {{to pretend to be}} interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E

5|$|Using {{data from}} Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over {{large areas of the}} Martian surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E

They agreed to assassinate three of the leaders of Islam: ibn Muljam, a Jewish convert to Islam was to kill Ali, al-Hujjaj al-Tamimi was to kill Muawiya, and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi was to kill 'Amr ibn al-'As. The assassination attempts were to occur simultaneously as the three leaders came to lead morning prayer in their respective cities of Damascus, Fustat and Kufa. The method was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the prayer ranks and strike the targets with a sword dipped in poison.|$|E

The decision was attributed elsewhere in David Alexander's 1995 authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek Creator, which said that during the first batch of episodes, casting director Joseph D'Agosta reviewed the contracts for the main actors due to rising costs.|$|E
5|$|English forces laid siege to Loch Leven in 1301, but the {{garrison}} was relieved {{in the same}} year when the siege was broken by Sir John Comyn. King Robert the Bruce (reigned 1306–1329) is known to have visited the castle in 1313 and again in 1323. Following Bruce's death, the English invaded again, and laid siege to Loch Leven Castle in 1335 in support of the pretender Edward Balliol (d. 1364). According to the 14th-century chronicle of John of Fordun, the English attempted to flood the castle by building a dam across the outflow of the loch. The water level rose for a month, until the captain of the English force, Sir John de Stirling, left to attend the festival of Saint Margaret of Scotland. The defenders, under Alan de Vipont, took the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the castle at night, and damaged the dam, causing it to collapse and flood the English camp. The story has, however, been doubted by later historians.|$|E

When Rorschach is arrested, his identity is revealed to be Walter Kovacs, and he is sent to jail. Jupiter goes to stay with Dreiberg after breaking up with Manhattan.

5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early {{and have to go}} back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was SI.com's Midseason 2007 NFL Draft Projection #1pick, though Johnson had {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to earn his degree from Georgia Tech. On January 8, 2007, Johnson declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft, bypassing his senior season at Georgia Tech. He was regarded as the best athlete <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the draft and was the #1player on most draft boards. Johnson was said by ESPN {{to be able to be}} productive as a rookie, much like receiver Randy Moss was as a rookie. In a mid-February workout with speed and conditioning coach Mark Pearsall, Johnson clocked a 4.33-second 40-yard dash, recorded an 11-foot standing broad jump, and had a vertical leap of 43inches.|$|E
5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E

5|$|Magma {{sitting in}} an {{underground}} chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect {{is to increase the}} concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the summer}} Phillips was invited by Patrick {{to move to}} Nelson, British Columbia, where the latter was putting {{together}} a club of star players to challenge for the Cup. He played the 1909–10 with the local team, retiring after the season and taking up a position as a manager of a lumber company in Vancouver. However when Patrick and his brother Frank formed the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) in 1911, Phillips was convinced <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> retirement and join one of the teams in the new league, the Vancouver Millionaires. Phillips finished the 1912 season fourth on Vancouver in goals, and seventh overall in the league, with seventeen in fourteen games. Phillips, who realized that his skills had diminished, retired {{at the end of}} the season. A close friend of the Patricks, he remained close to the league, and occasionally officiated matches after his retirement.|$|E
