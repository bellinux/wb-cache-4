2500|$|A {{significant}} event {{took place}} on 15 September 1940, now known as [...] "Battle of Britain Day". Among these was the famous casualty of Dornier Do 17 Z-2 Wk Nr.2361, bearing the Geschwaderkennung code of F1+FH, 1.Staffel/KG 76 flown by Robert Zehbe. Zehbe developed engine trouble and lagged half a mile behind the main bomber stream. His Dornier attracted a swarm of fighters. Eventually Ray Holmes of 504 Squadron, out of bullets, rammed the bomber. The tail came off and air pressure snapped off the outer wings short of the engines. The bomber crashed onto the forecourt of London Victoria station. Zehbe bailed out, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack, while the injured Holmes bailed out of his plane and survived. This event {{became one of the}} defining moments of the Battle of Britain and elicited a congratulatory note to the RAF from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands who had witnessed the event. In the same action Dornier Do 17 F1+FS of 8.Staffel/KG 76, flown by Rudolf Heitsch, was found in a field near Shoreham. The Dornier was found to be fitted with a flamethrower, installed in the <b>tail.</b> <b>Oil,</b> nitrogen, and hydrogen cylinders were found in the fuselage, while the external pipe was fitted with a jet. Initially, it was concluded that it was a smoke producing device to feign damage. But it was discovered that it was a device that was triggered by one of the rear gunners to destroy a fighter pursuing the bomber from line astern. However, the lack of oxygen meant that the device failed to function, and only a continual spray of oil was emitted.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{research}} on oil price dynamics for modeling and forecasting purposes has brought forth several unsettled issues. Indeed, statistical support is claimed for various models of price paths, yet {{many of the}} competing models differ importantly {{with respect to their}} fundamental temporal properties. In this paper, we study one such property that is still debated in the literature, namely mean-reversion, with focus on forecast performance. Because of their impact on mean-reversion, we account for non-constancies in the level and in volatility. Three specifications are considered: (i) random-walk models with GARCH and normal or student-t innovations, (ii) Poisson-based jump-diffusion models with GARCH and normal or student-t innovations, and (iii) mean-reverting models that allow for uncertainty in equilibrium price and for time-varying convenience yields. We compare forecasts in real time, for 1, 3 and 5 year horizons. For the jump-based models, we rely on numerical methods to approximate forecast errors. Results based on future price data ranging from 1986 to 2007 strongly suggest that imposing the random walk for oil prices has pronounced costs for out-of-sample forecasting. Evidence in favor of price reversion to a continuously evolving mean underscores the importance of adequately modeling the connvenience yield.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the performance of VaR models at measuring risk for WTI oil one-month futures returns. Risk models, ranging from industry standards such as RiskMetrics and historical simulation to conditional extreme value model, are used to calculate commodity market risk at extreme quantiles: 0. 95, 0. 99, 0. 995 and 0. 999 for both long and short trading positions. Our results show that out of the tested fat tailed distributions, generalised Pareto distribution provides the best fit to both <b>tails</b> of <b>oil</b> returns although <b>tails</b> differ significantly, with the right tail having a higher tail index, indicative of more extreme events. The main conclusion is that, in the analysed period, only extreme value theory based models provide a reasonable degree of safety while widespread VaR models do not provide adequate risk coverage and their performance is especially weak for short position in oil...|$|R

40|$|The micellization {{properties}} and phase behavior of model ternary surfactant- oil- water systems were studied by grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations assisted by histogram-reweighting techniques. Larson’s lattice model {{was used for}} a symmetrical H 4 T 4 surfactant, where H represents hydrophilic and T hydrophobic groups. In contrast to earlier studies, we studied oil chains of variable length, from T to T 4, and determined quantitatively the effect of added oil on the critical micelle concentration (cmc). It {{was found that the}} cmc decreases as the volume fraction of oil in the aqueous phase is increased. Longer oil chains have a stronger effect than shorter chains at the same volume fraction. The <b>oil,</b> <b>tail</b> and head density profiles were obtained for typical micelles. Simulation results for the density profiles indicate that long-chain oils are almost exclusively located within the micellar aggregates, in agreement with single-chain mean-field theory predictions. Ternary phase diagrams were obtained both by simulations and by quasichemical theory. The results suggest that the critical micelle concentration line is directed towards the oil-lean corner of the three-phase triangle, if there is one present in the system. It was also found that the amount of oil that can be dissolved in the ternary system increases sharply at the surfactant critical micelle concentration, indicating that micellization greatly enhances oil solubility. 1...|$|R

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 158 - 178). Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is {{a process}} that catalytically converts hydrogen and carbon monoxide into a large variety of hydrocarbons and oxygenated products. Over the years many researchers have attempted to describe the full product spectrum (ranging from C 1 to C 100 +) but due to the complexity of the product and shortcomings of certain analytical techniques (or equipment) most researchers were only able to construct product distributions from extrapolations of data recorded from analysis of the C 1 to C 5 fraction of the Fischer-Tropsch product. With recent advances in analytical technology and the development of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) it may now be possible to analyze the complex Fischer-Tropsch products in a relatively short time while delivering good separation of even minor compounds such as oxygenates and branched compounds. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) really results in improved separation and identification of compounds in the complex Fischer-Tropsch product spectrum and will lead to a more complete product distribution especially of the minor compounds such as branched hydrocarbons, ketones, aldehydes and acids.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three chapters on electricity {{and natural gas}} prices. In the first chapter, we give a brief introduction to the characteristics of power prices and propose a mean reversion jump diffusion model, in which jump intensity depends on temperature data and overall system load, to model electricity prices. Compared to the models used in the literature, we find the model proposed in this chapter is better to capture the tail behavior in the electricity prices. In the second chapter, we use the model proposed in the first chapter to simulate the spark spread option and value the power generations. In order to simulate power generation, we first propose and estimate mean reversion jump diffusion model for natural gas prices, in which jump intensity {{is defined as a}} function of temperature and storage. Combing the model with the electricity models in chapter 1, we find that the value of power generation is closer to the real value of the power plants as reflected in the recent market transaction than one obtains from many other models used in literature. The third chapter investigates extremal dependence among the energy market. We find a tail dependence that exceeds the Pearson correlation ρ, which means the traditional Pearson correlation is not appropriate to model <b>tail</b> behavior of <b>oil,</b> natural gas and electricity prices. However, asymptotic dependence is rejected in all pairs except Henry Hub gas return and Houston Ship Channel gas return. We also find that extreme value dependence in energy market is stronger in bull market than that in bear market due to the special characteristics in energy market, which conflicts the accepted wisdom in equity market that tail correlation is much higher in periods of volatile markets from previous literature...|$|R

40|$|Aromadendrene (1) is a {{sesquiterpene}} {{present in}} the distillation <b>tail</b> of the <b>oil</b> of Eucalyptus globulus. This distillation tail is commercially available in large quantities at low price and is an interesting starting material for the synthesis of other chiral products. A fair amount of research has already been carried out on aromadendrene (Chapter 1). This research was mainly focussed on transformation and isomerization of the double bond, opening of the cyclopropane ring, oxidations of derivatives of aromadendrene, and rearrangement of the aromadendrene skeleton. In this thesis, the possibilities to use aromadendrene for other synthetic strategies were explored and the first interest was {{the development of an}} economically feasible route toward the fragrance compound 167 (Chapter 2). Ledene epoxide (154), easily available from aromadendrene, was selected as the starting material for this route, and rearrangements of this b -epoxide were investigated. The formation of products with the cubebane (159) and cadinane skeleton (160) indicates that bridgehead carbocations are the prefered intermediates in these rearrangements. From these experiments it was concluded that the synthetic route toward 167 as published by Gijsen is the most efficient route known so far. Scheme 1 Synthesis of guaiane-type compounds by opening the cyclopropane ring in aromadendrene has proven to be difficult. In Chapter 3 it was shown that the conversion of isoledene (107), a double bond isomer of aromadendrene, to compounds with the guaiane skeleton can be performed in a fairly easy way. The synthesis of the blue colorant guaiazulene (35) in 22 % isolated yield over two steps from isoledene is an improvement of the existing methods for the dehydrogenation with sulfur of aromadendrane or guaiane type sesquiterpenes.  Figure 1 A number of guaianes, for example the cyclic ethers 198 and 200, were synthesized from isoledene epoxide (193). Isoledene epoxide can be converted by (Lewis) acid to a stabilized cyclopropylcarbinyl cation, which undergoes opening of the cyclopropane ring to a guaiane skeleton. When no water is present during the reaction, ether 198 is obtained and the presence of water leads to formation of ether 200. Several functionalized derivatives of 198 have been prepared. These compounds were tested for their use as fragrances, but unfortunately they were not suitable as such. Scheme 2 A relatively new method for crop protection is the use of pheromone traps for monitoring or mass trapping of insects. By using these pheromone traps, the amount of insecticides often can be reduced considerably, which is more environmentally friendly and more selective. In Chapter 4 a method is described for the conversion of aromadendrene to methyl-branched linear pheromones. These pheromones (R) - 224, (S) - 298, and meso - 306 were all synthesized from the common linear intermediate 290. One of the key steps in the synthesis of 290 is the Baeyer-Villiger reaction of bromide 284, and opening of the lactone ring in a one-pot reaction to give the hydroxy ester 286. Via a Grob fragmentation using NaOEt in the presence of NaBH 4 and catalytic hydrogenation, 286 was then converted to compound 290. In Chapter 5 investigations towards the synthesis of dimethyl-branched linear pheromones have been described. It was shown {{that it is possible to}} convert aromadendrene to the dimethyl-branched linear intermediate 308, following a route similar to the one described in Chapter 4.
