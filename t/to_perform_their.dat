5|$|Over {{a decade}} after his {{appointment}} to the commission, White and his colleagues continued <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> duties of office without pay from the West Virginia Legislature. The legislature continued to authorize $500 annually for the hatching and stocking of fish in West Virginia's streams. White was reappointed as a commissioner by each succeeding Democratic governor. For {{the majority of his}} tenure serving on the West Virginia Fish Commission, White held the post of the commission's President.|$|E
5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in {{the third}} match of the event by LAX against Team 3D. Héctor Guerrero and Salinas {{accompanied}} LAX to the ring.

5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.|$|E
5|$|A month-long European trek began June 10 in Madrid, {{covering}} major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde. Matt Walker {{stood in}} for Vig {{for the rest}} of the summer. Garbage performed two shows in Nice and Lyon supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a further two headlining French shows in Lille and Paris with Mercury Rev as support. The European leg ended at Espárrago Rock in Spain on July 12. Throughout the run, Manson was dogged by vocal problems, leading to the cancellation of a few festival appearances. After a six-week break, Garbage returned to the United Kingdom <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> last European shows of the year – two intimate club gigs in London.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing a license <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> occupation {{and the poor}} requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E
5|$|The Christians, {{believing that}} this tribulation came upon {{them for their}} neglect of the Law of God and their {{religious}} duties, began to fervently read the Krista Purana, an epic poem {{on the life of}} Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens (1549–1619). On discovering this, some Muslims destroyed the books, but the Christians constructed subterranean refuges in which <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> religious devotions, read the books, and strengthen their faith. According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears, nose, feet and one hand.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to enforce the}} revenue laws were met with stiff resistance {{from a number of}} Massachusetts communities. Several towns refused to choose commissioners to assess the town population and estates, and officials from a number of them were consequently arrested and brought to Boston. Some were fined and released, while others were imprisoned until they promised <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> duties. The leaders of Ipswich, who had been most vocal in their opposition to the law, were tried and convicted of misdemeanor offenses.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the quick}} {{schedule}} of the shoot, Industrial Light & Magic immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal {{forms of the}} pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with the actors, and then without them to add in the skeletons, an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras. The actors also had <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> scenes again on the motion capture stage. With the shoot only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent 18-hour days on the edit, {{while at the same}} time spending time on 600 effects shots, 250 of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.|$|E
5|$|From August 1953, Montalban ceased {{working for}} London Life, {{publishing}} {{her work in}} the magazine Prediction, one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on the uses of the tarot, in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for Prediction. Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines. Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's Your Stars and Love and Madeline Alvarez's Love and the Stars. She never wrote any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate her views, and was critical of those books that taught the reader how <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> own horoscopes, believing that they put professional astrologers out of business.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E

5|$|However much it was believed, the king's divine {{status was}} the {{rationale}} {{for his role as}} Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live.|$|E
5|$|The Black Stone {{was held}} in reverence well before the preaching of Islam by Muhammad. It had long been {{associated}} with the Kaaba, which was built in the pre-Islamic period and was a site of pilgrimage of Nabateans who visited the shrine once a year <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> pilgrimage. The Kaaba held 360 idols of the Meccan gods. The Semitic cultures of the Middle East had a tradition of using unusual stones to mark places of worship, a phenomenon which is reflected in the Hebrew Bible as well as the Qur'an, although bowing to or kissing such sacred objects is repeatedly described in the Tanakh as idolatrous and was the subject of prophetic rebuke. The meteorite-origin theory of the Black Stone has seen it likened by some writers to the meteorite which was placed and worshipped in the Greek Temple of Artemis. Some writers remark on the apparent similarity of the Black Stone and its frame to the external female genitalia, and ascribe this to its earlier association with fertility rites of Arabia.|$|E
5|$|The Ultimate Warrior {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} in his steel cage match with Rick Rude. After the Warrior missed a splash attempt, Rude attempted {{to win the}} match by escaping the cage. The Warrior stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> finishing moves. Rude was then able to perform a Rude Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the Warrior rather than escape the cage. Rude performed a shoulderblock and tried to leave through the cage door. The Warrior held him back while Bobby Heenan, Rude's manager, tried to pull Rude out. The Warrior pulled both Rude and Heenan into the cage. He punched Heenan and then threw {{him out of the}} cage with an atomic drop. Warrior then knocked Rude down three times with clotheslines and threw him onto the ring floor with a gorilla press drop. Warrior climbed over the cage and dropped to the arena floor to win the match and retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|The eighth {{match was}} a Triple Threat {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between then World Heavyweight Champion The Great Khali, Batista, and Kane. In the beginning, Khali {{dominated}} most of the match, applying a nerve hold on Kane and attacking Batista. Outside the ring, they both tried <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> separate finishers on Khali, who countered both attempts. Batista and Kane performed a double-team spinebuster and chokeslam through a broadcast table. Kane performed a Chokeslam on Batista for a near-fall. Kane then retrieved a steel chair, but Batista countered a chair shot with a Spinebuster, and then performed a Batista Bomb on Kane. As Batista went for the pinfall, Khali pulled Batista outside the ring and threw Batista into the steel steps. Khali executed a Khali Bomb on Kane to win the match and retain the Title.|$|E
5|$|The town of Chiprovtsi {{and several}} of the {{surrounding}} villages were administratively organized as a has, or a private possession of the sultan's royal family and later of the sultan's mother. The special status of the area meant that the local Christians would not be subject to the usual discriminatory laws, but would have to pay an annual tribute of silver to the sultan. Later on, the estate was organized as a waqf, a land devoted for Muslim religious or charitable purposes. Chiprovtsi and the region were inhabited exclusively by Christians and they had the privilege <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>their</b> rituals in public without discrimination. The only Turkish person in the town was the sultan's representative and no Turks were allowed to settle there, as the local Bulgarians enjoyed self-government to a certain degree and were administered by an elected council of eminent Bulgarian residents (knezove). A fragment of the area's pre-Ottoman Bulgarian administrative division may have also been preserved, as it is referred to under the Slavic name voivodeship in some documents.|$|E
