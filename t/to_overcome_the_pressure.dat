The main advantage of whistling speech {{is that it allows}} the speaker to cover much larger distances (typically [...] but up to [...] in mountains and less in reverberating forests) than ordinary speech, without the strain (and lesser range) of shouting. More specifically, whistle speech can reach a loudness of 130dB, and the transmission range can reach up to 10km (as verified in La Gomera, Canary Island). The long range of whistling is enhanced by the mountainous terrain found in areas where whistled languages are used. Many areas with such languages work hard to preserve their ancient traditions, in the face of rapidly advancing telecommunications systems in many areas.|$|E

50|$|Since José Antonio Gómez {{announced}} his candidacy {{for the presidency}} of Chile, he had <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> of some leaders {{of the three major}} parties of the Concertación (DC, PPD, PS) that sought to withdraw before the primary, as he did voluntarily Soledad Alvear in the same process of 2005. One of them was the helmsman of the Socialist Party, Camilo Escalona, who during Frei's proclamation on April 5, 2009 in Rancagua, rebuked and insulted Gómez, accusing him of wanting to divide the Officialdom with his candidacy. The altercation was spread by all media, and generated criticism to Escalona, who must have apologized for what happened.|$|R

An analysis of the relative position and growth of Indian firms vis-à-vis foreign multinationals, changes in the resources and capabilities of these firms, and scope in terms of product market internationalization and overseas acquisitions during the 1995 - 2005 period, suggests an 'indigenous growth' model in the Indian pharmaceutical industry which {{is in contrast to}} the FDI initiated growth witnessed through full or partial privatization of state-owned firms in other geographical contexts.

5000|$|Once {{the flow}} has stopped, the booster is started, {{and as the}} piston withdraws along the cylinder, {{increasing}} the volume between the cylinder head and the piston crown, the pressure in the cylinder will drop, and gas will flow in from the inlet port. On the return cycle, the piston moves toward the cylinder head, decreasing {{the volume of the}} space and compressing the gas until the pressure is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> in the outlet line and the opening pressure of the outlet valve. At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the outlet valve and port.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, {{in central}} sleep apnea, the {{cessation}} of airflow {{is associated with the}} absence of physical attempts to breathe; specifically, polysomnograms reveal correlation between absence of rib cage and abdominal movements and cessation of airflow at the nose and lips. By contrast, in obstructive sleep apnea, pauses are not correlated with the absence of attempts to breathe and may even be correlated with more effortful breathing in an instinctive attempt <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on the sufferer's airway. If the majority of a sleep-apnea sufferer's apneas/hypopneas are central, his condition is classified as central; likewise, if the majority are obstructive, his condition is classified as obstructive.|$|E
50|$|If {{the engine}} has a power turbine added to drive an {{industrial}} generator or a helicopter rotor, the exit pressure {{will be as}} close to the entry pressure as possible with only enough energy left <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> losses in the exhaust ducting and expel the exhaust. For a turboprop engine there will be a particular balance between propeller power and jet thrust which gives the most economical operation. In a jet engine only enough pressure and energy is extracted from the flow to drive the compressor and other components. The remaining high-pressure gases are accelerated to provide a jet to propel an aircraft.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{universities}} recognize urgent environmental {{dilemmas and}} embrace efforts to move campus operations and university culture toward sustainability. However, the broader academic mission across departments and programs is often slower {{to connect with}} sustainability efforts. The Piedmont Project at Emory University offers one model of a faculty development program that has fostered an enriching collaborative experience and has created considerable impact across the university. KEY WORDS: campus, curriculum, environment, faculty development, sustainability s Stapp et al. (1969) assert, an important challenge for environmental education is to extend beyond awareness of environmental and sustainability problems to include aware-ness of solutions and motivation to work toward them. This challenge has <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> of research and the reward structure and traditions of the academy (Zencey, 1996). Faculty may be concerned about environmental degradation and global dimensions of sustainability (Kempton, Boster, & Hartley, 1999) but {{may be reluctant to}} take action or even to engage in public debate because their own disciplinary expertise lies elsewhere. We will explore how the Piedmont Project has not only helped teachers discover new content and paradigms that educate for sustain-ability, but has also fostered new teaching methods and new forms of community engagement...|$|R

50|$|Angina in {{the setting}} of AS occurs due to left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy (LVH) that is caused by the constant production of increased pressure required <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient caused by the AS. While the muscular layer of the left ventricle thickens, the arteries that supply the muscle do not get significantly longer or bigger, so the muscle may not receive enough blood supply to meet its oxygen requirement. This ischemia may first be evident during exercise when the heart muscle requires increased blood supply to compensate for the increased workload. The individual may complain of anginal chest pain with exertion. At this stage, a cardiac stress test with imaging may be suggestive of ischemia.|$|E
50|$|Kick is {{the entry}} of {{formation}} fluid into the wellbore during drilling operations. It occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled. The whole essence of oil well control is to prevent kick from occurring and if it happens {{to prevent it from}} developing into blowout. An uncontrolled kick usually results from not deploying the proper equipment, using poor practices, or a lack of training of the rig crews. Loss of oil well control may lead into blowout, which represents one of the most severe threats associated with the exploration of petroleum resources involving the risk of lives and environmental and economic consequences.|$|E

5000|$|The {{lack of an}} {{electrical}} ignition system also reduces the parasitic load on the engine, as the engine {{does not have to}} produce the necessary electricity to ignite the fuel. A significant amount of electricity is required by a spark ignition system, and as engine speeds and loads increase, the ignition system consumes proportionately more electricity, while simultaneously becoming less efficient. Higher cylinder pressure require a [...] "hotter" [...] spark with more current present <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> and jump the gap from electrode to electrode in the spark plug. Increased engine speeds and loads also require the spark to occur more rapidly, resulting in additional electrical system loads and demands and more engine power required to meet them. As diesel engine speeds and loads increase, the higher cylinder temperatures after compression of the intake charge result in increased injection and ignition efficiency due to increased fuel atomization. Regardless of fuel system design, a mechanical diesel fuel injection system and rapid rise of fuel pressure and flow will result in injection nozzle opening pressure being reached more rapidly and also earlier in the 4-stroke cycle with more precise fuel delivery, more precise injection timing and built-in timing advance. Additional power is required to operate the injection system as engine speeds and loads increase, but the increase is more offset than in spark-ignition engines. Modern diesel engines with electronic injection systems use a large amount of electricity for injection, but the ability to precisely time injection and even perform multiple injection events per cycle result in generally increased fuel efficiency compared to mechanically-injected diesel engines of similar size and power.|$|E
30|$|For {{an ideal}} design {{when all the}} {{necessary}} parameters of the well and the reservoir are perfectly known the pump will produce exactly the design liquid rate since it will work against the design TDH (1997; 2001; 2002).

This perfect situation, however, is seldom achieved; very often inaccuracies or lack of information on well inflow performance cause design errors and the well produces a rate different from the initial target.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} half of the third century B. C, two Greeks, Herophilus of Chalcedon and his younger {{contemporary}} Erasistratus of Ceos, became the first and last ancient scientists to perform systematic dissections of human cadavers. In all probability, they also conducted vivisections of condemned criminals. Their anatomical and physiological discoveries were extraordinary. The uniqueness of these events presents an intriguing historical puzzle. Animals had been dissected by Aristotle in the preceding century (and partly dissected by other Greeks in earlier centuries), and, later, Galen (second century A. D.) and others again systematically dissected numerous animals. But no ancient scientists ever seem to have resumed systematic human dissection. This paper explores, first, the cultural factors [...] including traditional Greek attitudes to the corpse and to the skin, also as manifested in Greek sacred laws [...] that may have prevented systematic human dissection during almost all of Greek antiquity, from the Pre-Socratic philosopher-scientists of the sixth and fifth centuries B.

Second, the exceptional constellation of cultural, political, and social circumstances in early Alexandria that might have emboldened Herophilus <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> of cultural traditions and to initiate systematic human dissection, is analyzed. Finally, the paper explores possible reasons for the mysteriously abrupt disappearance of systematic human dissection from Greek science after the death of Erasistratus and Herophilus...|$|R
