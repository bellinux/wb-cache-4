50|$|Differential <b>tempering</b> (also called graded <b>tempering,</b> {{selective}} <b>tempering</b> {{or local}} <b>tempering)</b> is the inverse of differential hardening, to ultimately produce similar results. Differential <b>tempering</b> begins by taking steel {{that has been}} uniformly quenched and hardened, and then heating it in localized areas to reduce the hardness. The process is often used in blacksmithing for <b>tempering</b> cutting instruments, softening the back, shaft, or spine, but simultaneously <b>tempering</b> the edge to a very high hardness. The process was very common in ancient Europe, for making tools, but soon was applied to knives and swords as well.|$|R

40|$|Background:  <b>Temper</b> outbursts {{in youth}} with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) {{are a common}} source of concern, but remain poorly understood. This study examined a set of hypotheses related to: (a) the prevalence of <b>temper</b> outbursts in paediatric OCD, (b) the associations of <b>temper</b> outbursts with OCD severity and depressive symptoms; and (c) the influence of <b>temper</b> outbursts on treatment response. Methods:  The prevalence of <b>temper</b> outbursts was estimated in a specialist OCD clinical sample (n = 387) using parent- and child-report. This was replicated in a community sample (n = 18, 415). Associations of <b>temper</b> outbursts with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and with depressed mood were examined using logistic regression models. The influence of <b>temper</b> outbursts on treatment response was examined in a subsample of 109 patients treated with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with or without medication. Results:  Over a third of young people with OCD displayed <b>temper</b> outbursts, and rates were similar across the clinical and community samples. <b>Temper</b> outbursts were {{two to three times}} more common in youth with OCD than in healthy controls. However, OCD symptom severity was not a strong predictor of child- or parent-reported <b>temper</b> outbursts. Instead, both child- and parent- reported <b>temper</b> outbursts were significantly associated to depressive symptoms. CBT strongly reduced OCD and depressive symptoms, as well as the severity of <b>temper</b> outbursts. There {{was no significant difference in}} post-treatment OCD or depression scores between those with <b>temper</b> outbursts compared to those without. Conclusions:  <b>Temper</b> outbursts are common in youth with OCD and are particularly related to depressed mood. They improve with CBT for OCD and do not seem to impede OCD treatment response...|$|R

T7 <b>temper</b> is achieved by overaging (meaning aging past the peak hardness) the material.

In contrast to the T6 <b>temper,</b> these eta particles are much larger and prefer growth along the grain boundaries. This reduces the susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking.

5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then <b>tempered,</b> {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Temper</b> {{modulation}} {{problems are}} both {{a hallmark of}} early childhood and a common mental health concern. Thus, characterizing specific behavioral manifestations of <b>temper</b> loss along a dimension from normative misbehaviors to clinically significant problems {{is an important step}} toward identifying clinical thresholds. Methods Parent-reported patterns of <b>temper</b> loss were delineated in a diverse community sample of preschoolers (n = 1, 490). A developmentally sensitive questionnaire, the Multidimensional Assessment of Preschool Disruptive Behavior (MAP-DB), was used to assess <b>temper</b> loss in terms of tantrum features and anger regulation. Specific aims were: (a) document the normative distribution of <b>temper</b> loss in preschoolers from normative misbehaviors to clinically concerning <b>temper</b> loss behaviors, and test for sociodemographic differences; (b) use Item Response Theory (IRT) to model a <b>Temper</b> Loss dimension; and (c) examine associations of <b>temper</b> loss and concurrent emotional and behavioral problems. Results Across sociodemographic subgroups, a unidimensional <b>Temper</b> Loss model fit the data well. Nearly all (83. 7 %) preschoolers had tantrums sometimes but only 8. 6 % had daily tantrums. Normative misbehaviors occurred more frequently than clinically concerning <b>temper</b> loss behaviors. Milder behaviors tended to reflect frustration in expectable contexts, whereas clinically concerning problem indicators were unpredictable, prolonged, and/or destructive. In multivariate models, <b>Temper</b> Loss was associated with emotional and behavioral problems. Conclusions Parent reports on a developmentally informed questionnaire, administered to a large and diverse sample, distinguished normative and problematic manifestations of preschool <b>temper</b> loss. A developmental, dimensional approach shows promise for elucidating the boundaries between normative early childhood <b>temper</b> loss and emergent psychopathology...|$|R

For asymmetric exponential distributions and the mean field Ising model with and external field simulated <b>tempering</b> is known to converge slowly. We show that <b>tempering</b> with entropy dampening distributions mixes in polynomial time for these models. Examining slow mixing times of <b>tempering</b> more closely, we show that for the mean-field 3 -state ferromagnetic Potts model, <b>tempering</b> converges slowly regardless of the temperature schedule chosen. On the other hand, <b>tempering</b> with entropy dampening distributions converges in polynomial time to stationarity. Finally we show that the slow mixing can be very expensive practically.
