5|$|At 7 am on 7 April, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> massed {{for another}} ground assault {{from the north}} and west of Lộc Ninh, with support from heavy artillery, tanks and armored {{personnel}} carriers. As <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> closed in, Vinh and his bodyguards ran out the opened gate and surrendered. Several South Vietnamese soldiers also tried to surrender, but they all returned to their positions after Smith stopped a South Vietnamese officer from raising a white T-shirt up the flagpole. By 8 am, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment was completely overwhelmed when <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> overran the southern compound with their superior numbers. At around 10 am, all tactical air support was called off in order to clear the way for B-52 strikes against Viet Cong formations west of Lộc Ninh. However, the B-52 strikes could not prevent <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> from overrunning Lộc Ninh. By 16:30, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> were in complete control of Lộc Ninh District.|$|E
5|$|Since May 1965, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> {{offensive}} in Phước Long Province {{had been in}} full-swing. Beginning on May 10, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 271st Regiment, supported by the 840th Battalion and local sapper units, attacked the district town of Phước Long, capital of the province. Simultaneously, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 272nd Regiment overran South Vietnamese government positions in the sub-sector of Phước Bình. During their brief occupation of Phước Long district, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> destroyed several major strategic hamlets in the surrounding areas, such as Ba Ra, Thuan Kiem, Thuan Loi, Phu Rieng, Da Kia, Bu Dop, Duc Bon and Song Be.|$|E
5|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> {{had won a}} clear {{victory over}} the regular units of the South Vietnamese army, they did not get away with light casualties. After the battle, a {{combined}} total of 126 Viet Cong bodies were recovered within the Special Forces compound and the district headquarters, and several hundred more were strewn all over the battlefield. Indeed, individual Viet Cong soldiers usually spare no efforts to evacuate their dead or wounded comrades; but as military operations were conducted during the rainy season, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> struggled to evacuate all their casualties from the battlefield as conditions on the main roads deteriorated. Despite the minor setbacks, the Đồng Xoài campaign marked the rapid maturity of <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 9th Division as a fighting force. For their efforts during the battle, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 272nd Regiment received the title of 'Đồng Xoài Regiment' to mark their achievements.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the initial stages in their campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> forces were ordered to regroup and prepare for the next offensive in the Long Khánh region. Viet Cong soldiers from the two regiments were assembled in War Zone D, where they were trained to attack well-fortified enemy strongholds. On November 20, 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> reached the Long Khánh battlefield, having completed a 200 kilometres march from War Zone D. On the battlefield <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 186th Battalion (from Military Region 5), the 500th and 800th Battalions (from Military Region 7), and the 445th Company also joined the offensive. To kick-start their offensive in the Baria-Long Khánh region, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> selected Bình Giã as their next target. Bình Giã was a small village located in Phước Tuy Province, about 67 kilometres away from Saigon.|$|E
5|$|In July 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 271st and 272nd Regiments, {{began moving}} into the provinces of Bình Dương, Bình Long and Phước Long {{to carry out their}} mission. During the first phase of their campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> regiments overran several {{strategic}} hamlets at Xan Sang, Cam Xe, Dong Xa, and Thai Khai. Between August and September 1964, Viet Cong regiments executed deep thrusts into Bình Dương and Châu Thành to apply additional pressure on South Vietnamese outposts situated on Route 14. During the second phase of their campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> ambushed two South Vietnamese infantry companies and destroyed five armoured vehicles, which consisted of M24 Chaffee light tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers. <b>The</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> defeated regular ARVN units at the strategic hamlets of Bình Mỹ and Bình Co.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of June 9, 1965, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> made final {{preparations}} for their assault on Đồng Xoài. While <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> assembled their formations, U.S.-led forces inside the Special Forces Camp were suddenly placed on alert, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> to commence their attack 70 minutes earlier than scheduled. At 11:30pm Viet Cong heavy mortar rounds began to fall on South Vietnamese and American positions around Đồng Xoài, soon followed by an infantry assault led by the 272nd Regiment. During the initial assault, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> sustained heavy casualties {{as they tried to}} navigate through the surrounding minefields and barb wire fences, which they had failed to pick up during previous reconnaissance missions. At about 1:30am, two helicopter gunships from the U.S. Army's 118th Aviation Company were dispatched to support the Special Forces Camp, they fired on <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> around the compound, and returned to base only after their weapons load was emptied. At around 2:30am, the Americans {{and a few of the}} Cambodian soldiers retreated to the district headquarters, where other local troops were holding out. Meanwhile, at Biên Hòa Air Base, all flight crews of the 118th Aviation Company were on the flightline preparing for combat assault at first light. By that time, however, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> had captured the Special Forces compound, and they began massing for an attack on the district headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> {{commenced}} {{a series}} of large-scale military operations against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), as ordered by the North Vietnamese government. As part of their Winter-Spring Offensive, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> unleashed its newly created 9th Division against the South Vietnamese forces at Bình Giã, fighting a large set-piece battle for the first time. Over a period of four days, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 9th Division held its ground and mauled the best units the South Vietnamese army could send against them, only breaking after intense attack by U.S. bombers.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00pm on 6 February 1965, about 300 Viet Cong {{soldiers}} of the 30th Company assembled at their positions outside Camp Holloway, where they began breaking through the wire fences. However, the Viet Cong's mission nearly turned into a disaster when their combat engineers accidentally tripped an electrical wire after breaking through the third fence barrier, but the U.S. Military Police patrolling the area did not detect it. At 1:50am on 7 February 1965, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> attackers opened fire with their AK-47 rifles, having successfully penetrated Camp Holloway. Shortly afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> mortared the airfield and the U.S. advisory compound, while the sections of the 30th Company attacked their respective targets with small arms fire. About five minutes later, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> began retreating from the facility. Later that morning <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> claimed victory, having caused the death of eight U.S. soldiers, and another 126 wounded. In addition, ten aircraft were destroyed and 15 more were damaged.|$|E
5|$|In November 1962, the National Liberation Front's Military Region 2 ordered <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 261st Battalion and the 514th Battalion, {{the home}} {{battalion}} of Dinh Tuong Province, {{to destroy the}} strategic hamlets in their region {{and at the same}} time to attack South Vietnamese sweeping operations. Between 28–30 December 1962, an American aircraft equipped with eavesdropping equipment located a Viet Cong radio transmitter. It intercepted radio signals in the hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in Dinh Tuong Province where the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was headquartered. The radio intercept and other information obtained by Jim Drummond, Vann's intelligence officer, indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> were using Ap Tan Thoi as a headquarters location. Furthermore, South Vietnamese and American intelligence personnel believed <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> had deployed a reinforced company of about 120 men to protect the transmitter. Certain that <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> unit was no larger than the reported number, the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was instructed to attack Ap Tan Thoi.|$|E

25|$|After {{the battle}} was over, the Americans found 491 <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> bodies in their base area, but {{concluded}} {{that there were many}} more deaths. The Americans concluded that they had confronted three battalions of <b>the</b> 271st <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> Regiment of <b>the</b> 9th <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> Division and elements of the 70th Guard Regiment, and that they had killed 609 and captured 5, and recovered over 50 weapons of all types. The Americans reported 17 killed and 102 wounded.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> occupation of Phước Long district, the ARVN 36th Ranger Battalion was {{ordered by the}} ARVN Joint General Staff to recapture government positions there. On May 11, two companies from the battalion sustained heavy casualties in battles with Viet Cong units positioned along Inter-Provincial Road 13 and National Highway 14. On May 12, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 271st Regiment and other support units withdrew from Phuoc Long district.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway to}} Xuyen Moc {{in the east}} had been reopened by the Australians in March and April, and with <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 275th Regiment {{believed}} to have been severely weakened following Long Tan, a series of operations aimed at destroying <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 274th Regiment were subsequently launched by 1 ATF. Australian assessments of <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 275th Regiment were seemingly reinforced by its unsuccessful attempt to ambush a convoy from US 11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment (11 ACR) on 2 December 1966. Meanwhile, after Westmoreland had again pressed Vincent on what he saw as the limited results achieved by Australian tactics, a large joint US-Australian operation was mounted against the May Tao mountains in Phuoc Tuy, moving against the communist bases in the area. The largest search and destroy operation mounted by the Australians to that point, Operation Paddington (9–15 July) was carried out in co-operation with American and South Vietnamese units based in Bien Hoa province, and targeted <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 5th Division.|$|E
5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> line of {{withdrawal}} carrying them past the Australian position, heavy fire was maintained on them as they attempted a partial retreat, resulting in further casualties. However, as daybreak neared <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> lingered, unwilling to commit to an all-out attack, but also unwilling to completely withdraw. Finally, the main Viet Cong attack began at 05:30. Earlier losses had been heavy, though, and {{they were unable to}} concentrate in sufficient numbers to mount a massed assault. Instead only a series of disjointed attacks followed, none more than 40 men strong. By 06:45 these attacks had been repelled by the Americans and <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> withdrew before dawn, avoiding the arrival of additional American air support.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong.</b> Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it {{may not be enough to}} drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the optimistic}} Australian {{assessments}} of Viet Cong capability, {{rather than having}} left Phuoc Tuy the communists were more likely reinforcing and consolidating in preparation for future operations, avoiding battle with the Australians {{in order to preserve}} their strength. Regardless, D445 Battalion had suffered heavy casualties and posed a diminished threat, while the headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 5th Division was located near the northern border, west of the May Tao mountains, with its fighting formations widely dispersed. <b>The</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 275th Regiment was reported to have moved north to War Zone D for retraining and refitting, and <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 274th Regiment had moved from its scattered locations in the north-west Hat Dich to replace it in the north-east of the province, and was now operating in unfamiliar terrain. Meanwhile, casualties, illness and poor local recruitment meant they were now largely reliant on reinforcements from North Vietnam. Unsure of the next move, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 5th Division adopted a cautious posture, with only the 1st Battalion, 275th Regiment remaining in the May Tao mountains while the 274th Regiment dispersed east of Route 2 {{for the remainder of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months of 1967, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> absorbed heavy losses as a result of {{large-scale}} search and destroy missions conducted by the United States Army, and it prompted North Vietnamese leaders to review their war strategy in South Vietnam. In light of the setbacks which North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces had experienced early in 1967, North Vietnamese General Trần Văn Trà suggested that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces could still be victorious if they inflicted as many casualties as possible on U.S. military units, hoping that the Americans would conclude that the war was too costly and withdraw from Vietnam. Thus, towards mid-1967, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 7th and 9th Divisions returned to the battlefield again, with the objective of inflicting casualties on U.S. military formations in III Corps Tactical Zone. On June 12, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division launched Operation Billings to destroy elements of <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 9th Division, which had built-up strength around northern Phuoc Vinh.|$|E

500|$|North of Ap Tan Thoi, three {{companies}} of the ARVN 11th Infantry Regiment fared no better. They marched south in three separate axes towards their objective. Again, well-concealed <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> soldiers of <b>the</b> 514th Battalion allowed their opponents to come within [...] before opening fire. [...] Immediately, the South Vietnamese infantrymen {{were forced to}} hug the ground. During the next five hours, they managed to launch three major assaults, but failed to break <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong's</b> line of defense. By 09:30, the last of Dam's reserve companies had been airlifted into Tan Hiep, about two hours late because American aircrews were prevented from landing their CH-21 helicopters, known as [...] "flying bananas" [...] for their shape, in the heavy fog that covered Tan Hiep Airfield most of the morning. With the ground attacks {{in the north and}} south bogged down, Dam decided to stretch out <b>the</b> defending <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> units by attacking the east and the west.|$|R
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} fighting at Ap My An <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> had elected to fight from a hasty but well-prepared position and had displayed good battle discipline, {{command and control}} and effective camouflage and concealment. The Australians were later generous in their praise for their performance. In particular their use of snipers had been particularly effective, although overall their individual shooting was of a poor standard and had often been too high. Townsend concluded that <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> force had most likely been ordered to fight a rearguard action until dark in order to cover the withdrawal a larger force and their command elements. Regardless, despite their strong performance, the battle also held lessons for <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> themselves. In particular their failure to deploy their machine-guns in the tree line {{on the edge of}} the landing zone had allowed the Australians to establish a foothold, despite A Company being forced to assault into an insecure landing zone with only minimal suppression from a single artillery battery. Later during the war <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> developed the effective tactic of targeting troop helicopters as they arrived at landing zones when they were most vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In early 1964 Sihanouk {{signed a}} secret {{agreement}} with North Vietnam and <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong,</b> allowing Chinese military aid meant {{for them to}} be delivered through Sihanoukville's port. In turn, the Cambodian army would be paid for delivering food supplies to <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong,</b> {{and at the same time}} skim off 10percent of all military hardware supplies. In addition, he also allowed <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> to build a trail through eastern Cambodia, so that their troops could receive war supplies from North Vietnam. The trail later became known as the Sihanouk Trail. When the US learned of Viet Cong presence in eastern Cambodia, they started a bombing campaign over it, spurring Sihanouk to sever diplomatic ties with the US in May 1965. As a result of this secret agreement, Communist countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, provided military aid to Cambodia.|$|E

As the ARVN 34th Ranger Battalion marched upward towards Phước Bình, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 272nd and 273rd Regiment was ordered to destroy the South Vietnamese Rangers. However, {{by the time the}} 272nd Regiment arrived at the South Vietnamese staging area, the Rangers had already pulled out and successfully recaptured Phước Bình. Meanwhile, on May 15, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 274th Regiment defeated two South Vietnamese Regional Force companies along Route 20, and destroyed 20 vehicles in the process.|$|E
