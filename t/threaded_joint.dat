As a result of simulation, the thread profile in the nut and surface pressures over the contact area were specified, which can serve as a basis for taking thermal load and tangential friction into consideration. In addition, the pre-tightening process and limit force of damage were determined. The resulting thread profile and limit force are in good correlation with the experimental data. The deviation can be explained with the material softening due to the higher temperature. The thermal process due to the frictional heat generation was separately analyzed.

40|$|Abstract. There {{is a big}} {{variety of}} {{machines}} and equipment – internal combustion engines, aviation parts, building frames- joined by threaded joints, realized as bolt, nut and pin ones. For successful and safe exploitation of such equipment, it is required to check the tightening degree of threaded joints. There are few known methods of such control and one is presented in this paper. The proposed method is based on contact stiffness and friction change from thread tightening degree. At the same time, tightening changes with sufficient significance the dynamical properties of such a system- natural and resonance frequencies, amplitude – frequency and amplitude-phase characteristics, so, {{that it is possible}} to evaluate the tightening degree of the investigated joint. Dynamic properties are defined by exciting transient process between bolt head and tightened by this bolt detail using as short as possible force impact. Sensors register analogical signal of transient process and transmit it to a special computer card. The computer card converts analogical signal to code.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaTorsional impulse is a {{phenomenon}} recently recognized by the artillery projectile community as an important design criteria for large caliber weapon systems. In 1976, an investigation on the in-bore motion of gun launched projectiles was initiated after {{the failure of a}} <b>threaded</b> <b>joint</b> in an 8 in. rocket assisted projectile. The failure prompted various attempts by projectile designers to characterize the torsional environment that caused the mechanical failure of the joint. Experiments were conducted using the wire-in-bore technique to provide transmission between the instruments on board the projectile and data acquisition ground station. Due to the high set-back and lateral forces, extraneous responses contained in the recorded signals made analysis of the data extremely difficult. Subsequently, the Technical Support Directorate and Large Caliber Weapons Systems Laboratory of the Armament Research and Development Center developed a telemetry projectile system (presented at the 1983 ITC Conference) capable of measuring torsional impulse phenomenon in a gun launch environment. This paper will correlate test data obtained from the first firing with the TM projectile to the response of the projectile in the tube. The accuracy of the data will be independently verified by external measurements and compared with experiments performed by Sandia Laboratories (Fig. 1). Finally, weapon design parameters that could affect the magnitude of torsional impulse and recommendations on how to minimize the potential hazard of this environment will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} problem of analyzing the nonlinear transient response of a large degree-of-freedom structural dynamics simulation. A <b>threaded</b> <b>joint</b> assembly's response to impulse loading has been studied. Twelve parameters relating to the input level, preloads of the joint and friction between components are thought to influence the acceleration response of the structure. Due to {{the high cost of}} physical testing and large amount of computation time to run analytical models (three hours on 504 processors of LANL's ASCI supercomputer, Blue Mountain to simulate three milliseconds of response) a fast-running metamodel is being developed. In this case, a metamodel is a statistically developed surrogate to the physics-based finite element model and can be evaluated in minutes on a single processor desktop computer. An unreasonable number of runs is required (312 > 500, 000) to generate a three level full factorial design with 12 parameters for metamodel creation. Some manner of down-selecting or variable screening is needed in order to determine which of the parameters most affect the response and should be retained in subsequent models. A significant effects methodology has been used, involving a design of experiments technique, in which all parameters were lirst included in the model and then eliminated on the basis of statistical contributions associated with each parameter. Bayesian variable screening techniques, in which probabilities of effects are generated and updated, have also been explored. Encouraging results have been obtained, as the two methods yield similar sets of statistically significant parameters. Both methods have been compared to general sensitivity analysis (GSA). The resulting compact metarnodel can then be explored at more levels to appropriately capture the underlying physics of the threaded assembly with a much smaller set of simulations (only 64 runs required for a three level model with quadratic and some third order terms) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} different approaches for creation of realistic immersive educational simulations of conditions of a workplace for assembly operations with aid of haptic and Virtual Reality systems. Such simulations can be used for effective training of future operators of a given workplace and testing its ergonomic quality without need of building a physical prototype. The authors have devised several different approaches to preparation of virtual workplace prototypes for training. The basic approach is utilization of immersive VR systems (Head-Mounted Devices combined with user tracking solutions) to create an interactive simulation of a workplace, {{on the basis of its}} CAD model and specification of a realized process. The second approach is using a haptic manipulator with force feedback for interaction with a virtual workplace, for more realistic feeling of a realized activity. The third, novel approach is combination of the two previous approaches. A special system was designed and built for this purpose. It uses a large-space robot to allow haptic feedback for a user equipped with an immersive set of devices. More and more often virtual prototypes of the workplaces replace the physical ones as an innovative training solutions that allow to train the future operators or improve ergonomic quality of the workplace. The reason for that is the reduction of costs needed to develop the real prototype of the workstation as well as ability of complex virtual workplaces to change the variants in order to investigate different situations. Usually such workplaces - created as interactive Virtual Reality applications - consist of a visualization operated with aid of advanced Virtual Reality systems and devices. Implementation of an immersive equipment increases sense of user's presence and use of haptic devices with force feedback makes the experience more similar to reality. The level of realism is a very important factor in an immersive and haptic simulations of workstations for training purposes. As a form of instructional simulation, also called educational simulation, immersive and haptic simulations are a powerful learning tools that require trained users to complete tasks or to solve specific problems within VR environment that replicates the real workplace conditions 19. Trainings conducted is this way are particularly beneficial when real activities and task conducted at the workplace is too dangerous, too costly or even almost impossible to do. The two basic approaches presented by the authors are innovative and important on their own, but they usually do not mix, as state-of-the-art haptic devices are stationary. Their application heavily limits spatial freedom of a user, which does not affect the level of realism of presented simulations in a positive way. In order to fully simulate the conditions of an assembly workplace, tactile input must be available, with simultaneous immersion of a user into a Virtual Environment (VE) using a HMD or a CAVE system combined with the user tracking solution. The third approach to simulation of workplace conditions, proposed by the authors, allows to bring a realistic force feedback into an immersive visualization. Thanks to this, operations like assembling a <b>threaded</b> <b>joint</b> between two parts can be trained more realistically than before, without need of building a full physical workplace...|$|E
