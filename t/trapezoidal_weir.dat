40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} paper the effect of vertical curvature of flow streamlines due to change in weir crest height on discharge coefficient (Cd) was experimentally studied. The study was carried out on four different types of weirs under different flow conditions (sharp crested weir, broad crested weir, triangular weir, and <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>weir).</b> Also, the study deals with the effect of head angle of the triangle weir on discharge coefficient. This study was carried out through 254 experimental runs. The study showed that the discharge coefficient (Cd) in both sharp and broad crested weirs was affected by the relative crest height (H/Y). By using the regression analysis, two formulas between the discharge coefficient (Cd) and the dimensionless crest height (H/Y) for both sharp and broad crested weirs were presented. The comparative study between the developed formulas and those formulas developed by other researchers showed good agreement in discharge coefficient values. For triangular weir, the effect of head angle () on discharge coefficient (Cd) {{was more than the}} effect of relative head (H/Y).

40|$|Introduction: Side weir {{structures}} are extensively used in hydraulic engineering, irrigation and environmental engineering, and it usually {{consists of a}} main weir and a lateral channel. Side weirs are also used as an emergency structure. This structure is installed on one side or {{both sides of the}} main channel to divert the flow from the main channel to the side channel. Lateral outflow takes place when the water surface in the main channel rises above the weir sill. Flow over a side weir is a typical case of spatially varied flow with decreasing discharge. There have been extensive studies on side weir overflows. Most of the previous theoretical analysis and experimental research works are related to the flow over rectangular side weirs in rectangular main channels. In the current study, the flow conditions over a <b>trapezoidal</b> side <b>weir</b> located in a rectangular main channel in subcritical flow regime is considered. Materials and Methods: The experiments were performed in a rectangular open channel having provisions for a side weir at one side of the channel. The main channel was horizontal with 12 m length, 0. 25 m width, and 0. 5 m height, and it was installed on a frame; lateral channel that has a length of 6 m, width of 0. 25 m, and height of 1 m. It was set up parallel to the main channel; walls and its bed were made up of Plexiglas plates. The side weir was positioned at a distance of 6 m from the channel’s entrance. A total of 121 experiments on <b>trapezoidal</b> side <b>weirs</b> were carried out. Results and Discussion: For <b>trapezoidal</b> side <b>weir,</b> effective non-dimensionnal parameters were identified using dimensional analysis and Buckingham's Pi-Theorem. Finally, the following non-dimensional parameters were considered as the most effective ones on the discharge coefficient of the <b>trapezoidal</b> side <b>weir</b> flow. in which Fr 1 = upstream Froude number, P= hight of the <b>trapezoidal</b> side <b>weir,</b> y 1 = upstream water depth, z=side slope of the <b>trapezoidal</b> side <b>weir</b> and T=top flow width of the <b>trapezoidal</b> side <b>weir.</b> Water surface profiles were measured along the weir crest, the main channel centerline, and far from the weir section. Different elevations in water surface profile depend on the upstream Froude number in the main channel; depth differences in low Froude numbers are at minimum values, and in high Froude numbers are at maximum amounts. The water surface level along the crest drops at the entrance of the side weir to {{the first half of the}} side weir; and it has been attributed to the side weir entrance effect at the upstream. Afterwards, the water level rises towards the downstream of the weir. According to the experimental results, measurements of the water in the centerline of the main channel are reliable and water surface drop is negligible. According to the parameters affecting the discharge coefficient for each value of z, discharge coefficient equations were developed with acceptable accuracy such that the effects of this parameter were shown separately. Finally, the general equation was proposed. The general functional form for discharge coefficient is presented as follows where the effect of the side slope parameter, z, is also considered. The mean and maximum percentage errors of the discharge coefficient computed using the proposed equation are as 2. 6...|$|R

The weir consists of an inward <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>weir</b> of slope 1 horizontal to n vertical, or 1 in n, over two sectors of {{a circle of radius}} R and depth d, separated by a distance 2 t. The weir parameters are optimized using a numerical optimization algorithm.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the dual head-discharge characteristics of a modified chimney weir. It is shown by an optimization procedure that the modified chimney weir having an inward <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>weir</b> over an inverted V-notch can produce discharges proportional to both the logarithm of the head as well as the linear power of the head reckoned independently over two different reference planes, within a prefixed maximum allowable percentage error from the theoretical discharge. A new technique is adopted to optimize the weir parameters, in order to obtain the maximum ranges of measurement under logarithmic, linear as well as combined characteristics. In the case of linear weir it is shown {{that it is possible to}} enhance the linearity range of the chimney weir by more than 540 % and for a weir with constant indication accuracy by more than 350 %. In addition, about 86 % of the overall depth of the designed linear weir and over 90 % of the logarithmic weir is converted as the corresponding measurable ranges. Experiments with four typical weirs give consistent constant average coefficient of discharge for each weir confirming the theory.

40|$|Because of slight {{variation}} of the static head due to discharge fluctuations, the labyrinth weirs {{are considered to be}} economical structures for flood control and water level regulation in irrigation networks, as compared to other devices. Labyrinth weirs are composed of folded sections observed as trapezoidal and triangular in plan view. In this study, rectangular and U-shaped labyrinth weirs were investigated. Experiments were conducted on 15 labyrinth weir models. The models included eight rectangular labyrinth models and six U-shaped labyrinth models with different heights and lengths, and one linear model. All the experiments were performed in a horizontal rectangular flume, 7 m long, 0. 32 m wide and 0. 35 m high. The results indicated that for all the models, discharge coefficient increased sharply with an increase in Ht/P and attained a maximum value. This coefficient then decreased smoothly with a further increase in Ht/P. Increasing height of weirs increased the discharge coefficient for both rectangular and U-shaped weirs. The results also showed that increasing the length parallel to the flow direction decreased and increasing the length perpendicular to the flow direction increased the discharge coefficient. Generally, the discharge coefficient for rectangular weir was less than that of the U-shaped weir. The obtained results compared with those of Tullis et al. (1995) showed that discharge coefficient for U-shaped weir is more and for rectangular weir is less than that of the <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>weir</b> for angle of the side legs of 8 and 12 degrees...|$|E

It is shown that a rectangular weir placed over an inverted V-notch of depth 0. 90 d gives the maximum operating range, where d is the overall depth of the inward <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>weir</b> (from the crest to the vertex). For all flows in the rectangular portion, the discharge is proportional to the linear power of the head, h, measured above a reference plane located at 0. 292 d below the weir crest, in the range 0. 90 d {{less than or equal to}} h less than or equal to 7. 474 : within a maximum error of +/- 1. 5 % from the theoretical discharge.

40|$|Several {{geometric}} parameters influence weir discharge {{and it is}} explained in our present study.

40|$|A piano key (PK) weir {{is a type}} of {{nonlinear}} (labyrinth-type) weir developed {{specifically for}} free-surface flow control structures with relatively small spillway footprints. Currently, no generally accepted standard PK weir design procedure is available. This is due, in part, to the large number of geometric parameters and a limited understanding of their effects on discharge efficiency (discharge efficiency is quantified by the discharge coefficient of the standard weir equation). However, Hydrocoop, a non-profit French dam spillways association, has recommended a PK weir design and a head-discharge relationship specific to that geometry. To develop {{a better understanding of the}} effects of PK weir geometry on discharge efficiency, 13 laboratory-scale, 4 -cycle PK and rectangular labyrinth weir configurations were tested. As a result, the influence of the following PK weir geometries and/or modifications on discharge efficiency were partially isolated: the inlet-to-outlet key width ratio, upstream, and downstream apex overhangs; sloped floors; raising the crest elevation via a parapet wall; fillets underneath the upstream overhangs; and the crest type. The physical model test matrix also included a PK weir configuration consistent with the Hydrocoop-recommended design. From the experimental results, the appropriateness of the Hydrocoop-recommended head-discharge relationship was evaluated, along with the discharge coefficient behavior associated with the standard <b>weir</b> equation.

40|$|Labyrinth weirs {{are often}} a {{favorable}} design option to regulate upstream water elevations and increase flow capacity; nevertheless, {{it can be difficult}} to engineer an optimal design due to the complex flow characteristics and the many geometric design variables of labyrinth weirs. This study was conducted to improve labyrinth weir design and analyses techniques using physical-model-based data sets from this and previous studies and by compiling published design methodologies and labyrinth weir information. A method for the hydraulic design and analyses of labyrinth weirs is presented. Discharge coefficient data for quarter-round and half-round labyrinth weirs are offered for sidewall angles of 6 ° to 35 °. Cycle efficiency is also introduced to aid in sidewall angle selection. Parameters and hydraulic conditions that affect flow performance are discussed. The validity of this method is presented by comparing predicted results to data from previously published labyrinth weir studies. A standard geometric design layout for arced labyrinth weirs is presented. Insights and comparisons in hydraulic performance of half-round, trapezoidal, 6 ° and 12 ° sidewall angles, labyrinth weir spillways located in a reservoir with the following orientations are presented: Normal, Inverse, Projecting, Flush, Rounded Inlet, and Arced cycle configuration. Discharge coefficients and rating curves as a function of HT/P are offered.

40|$|A {{labyrinth}} weir is {{an attractive}} alternative for water level control in flat land where the head is usually limited. It is also useful in a river where the weir width is confined by the topography. The advantages occur because the crest length of a labyrinth weir is significantly longer than {{the width of the}} river. This is achieved by having a plan form which consist of repeating geometric cycles, typically trapezoidal in form. As a result large flows can be released at relatively low heads. Trapezoidal and triangular forms have become the favoured geometric cycles for designers. [...] This study on a labyrinth weir was undertaken to confirm the operating parameters as well as to investigate different plan shapes including rectangular, rectangular with a semi-circular connection and reverse trapezoidal. Experimental and theoretical results confirmed that the trapezoidal shape with the side wall angle, α = 0. 68 αmax, and the length magnification, 1 /w = 2. 65 gave the best hydraulic performance among other labyrinth weir plan forms which were tested in this study. The effect of varying the crest width was also investigated in this study. This part of the study focused on the trapezoidal shape. It was shown that increasing the width of the crest up to 10 mm (in this case 10 % of weir height, P) was not significant in decreasing the flow despite some frictional losses on the crest. Such a crest is useful when a river has a large quantity of debris. [...] The economic advantages of labyrinth weirs were also studied with reference to the Ciwadas <b>trapezoidal</b> labyrinth <b>weir</b> which was constructed in Indonesia in 1988.
