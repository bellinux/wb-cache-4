5|$|Dsungaripterids are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} being specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> shells of molluscs and crustaceans. While this remains the dominant view of dsungaripterid paleobiology today, {{some have suggested that}} they were generalistic omnivores eating a variety of hard foods, as dsungaripterids are better adapted to terrestrial movement rather than wading and are found in inland deposits.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} Macrinus dispatched his Praetorian prefect Ulpius Julianus to {{the region}} with a contingent of troops he considered strong enough <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> rebellion. However, this force soon joined the faction of Elagabalus when, during the battle, they turned on their own commanders. The officers were killed and Julianus' head {{was sent back to}} the emperor.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after his}} return, Gallus died (before {{the spring of}} 67 CE), and was succeeded in the {{governorship}} by Mucianus. The shock of the defeat convinced the Romans {{of the need to}} fully commit <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> rebellion regardless of the effort it would require. Emperor Nero and the senate then appointed Vespasian, the future Emperor, to bring the Roman army <b>to</b> Judea and <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> rebellion with a force of four Legions.|$|R

5|$|Unknown to the Soviet forces, the German 6th Army, {{under the}} newly {{appointed}} General Paulus, was issued orders for Operation Fredericus on 30 April 1942. This operation was <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Soviet armies within the Izium salient south of Kharkov, created during the Soviet spring offensives in March and April. The final directive for this offensive, issued on 30 April, gave a start date of 18 May.|$|E
5|$|After the Spartan threat {{had been}} removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, {{who lost their}} properties. The {{residents}} of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt {{to win over the}} other state's allies.|$|E

5|$|Although {{taken by}} surprise, Kesselring moved rapidly {{to regain control}} of the situation, {{summoning}} Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen's Fourteenth Army headquarters from northern Italy, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions from the Cassino front, and the 26th Panzer Division from Tenth Army. OKW chipped in some divisions from other theatres. By February, Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio but his forces were unable <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Allied beachhead, for which Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and von Mackensen for avoidable errors.|$|E
5|$|Civil war flared {{again when}} the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony failed just as the first had {{almost as soon as}} its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then {{launched}} a campaign against Mark Antony. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's wife Fulvia raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Perugia. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Antony who went on <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> army of Sextus Pompeius, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval Battle of Naulochus.|$|E
5|$|Estañol's views {{represented}} {{those of}} {{the portion of the}} upper class which was willing {{to come to terms with}} at least a portion of the middle class in order <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> peasant uprisings, as exemplified by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
25|$|Symons {{cone crusher}} (spring cone crusher) can crush {{materials}} of above medium hardness. And {{it is widely}} used in metallurgy, building, hydropower, transportation, chemical industry, etc. When used with jaw crusher, {{it can be used}} as secondary, tertiary or quaternary <b>crushing.</b> Generally speaking, <b>the</b> standard type of Symons cone <b>crusher</b> is applied <b>to</b> medium <b>crushing.</b> <b>The</b> medium type is applied <b>to</b> fine <b>crushing.</b> <b>The</b> short head type is applied <b>to</b> coarse fine <b>crushing.</b> As casting steel technique is adopted, the machine has good rigidity and large high strength.|$|R
40|$|The Weibull {{strength}} distributions and fracture {{characteristics of}} three abrasive grains, brown corundum, white corundum and green silicon carbide, are investigated. The {{effects of the}} surface defects from <b>crushing</b> and <b>the</b> inherent microcracks from processing prior <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> on fracture strengths and characteristics of the abrasive grains are discussed together with SEM observations. A novel proof-testing {{has been carried out}} in terms of low energy ball milling so that survived abrasive grains have improved strength characteristics. Strength distributions before and after the proof-testing have been compared. It is concluded that the strength of larger grains is strongly influenced by surface defects due <b>to</b> <b>crushing,</b> and <b>the</b> strength of smaller grains is more relevant to the inherent processing microcracks and pores formed during the manufacturing process prior <b>to</b> <b>crushing.</b> <b>The</b> influence of processing conditions, such as fusing and sintering, on strength distributions of the brown corundum is also discussed...|$|R

5|$|The Iraqi Army, led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of Kurdish origin, {{although not a}} Kurdish nationalist, moved north in order <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Assyrian revolt. The Iraqi forces started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, in batches of eight or ten, where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars {{to make sure no}} one survived.|$|E
5|$|The show of {{solidarity}} between the sisters {{did not last}} long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Prince Philip of Spain, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and an active Catholic. Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.|$|E
5|$|The {{war against}} Bulgaria {{was the first}} major {{undertaking}} carried out by Basil II after his ascension to the throne in 976, although the Bulgarian attacks had begun in that year. One {{of the reasons for the}} ten years of inaction was the policy of one of the strongest nobles in Byzantium, Basil, who de facto ruled the Byzantine Empire in the first years of his namesake. During that time, the main objective of the government in Constantinople was <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> rebellion of the military commander Bardas Skleros in Asia Minor between 976 and 979.|$|E

50|$|Semi-carbonic {{maceration}} is the winemaking technique where grapes are {{put through}} {{a short period}} of carbonic maceration, followed by conventional yeast fermentations. This is the process used in the production of Beaujolais nouveau wines. To an extent, most wines were historically treated to some form of semi or partial carbonic fermentation (as noted in history section above) with the amount dependent on the shape and size of the vessel that the grapes were stored in prior <b>to</b> <b>crushing.</b> <b>The</b> deeper the vessel, the greater the proportion of grapes that could be exposed to an anaerobic environment caused by the release of carbon dioxide from <b>the</b> <b>crushed</b> grapes on <b>the</b> bottom.|$|R

Its value, however, in the past, derived from its seeds, rich in oil (60%) suitable for paint and varnish. On average, a foot of Oiticica produces 75 kg of nuts per season, but exceptionally, examples were recorded with production of up to 1,500 kilograms.|$|R
5|$|Europe {{had been}} by then embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After {{five years of}} war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798 but this too was {{defeated}} by 1801. Britain remained the only opponent for the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For {{the first time in}} ten years, all of Europe was at peace. There were many problems between the two sides and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having to turn over all colonial conquests since 1793 and France was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta. The tense situation only worsened when Napoleon sent an expeditionary force <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Haitian Revolution. In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E
5|$|In 1444 {{the major}} princes of the Albanian Principalities, which {{up to that}} point had been vassals of the Ottoman Empire, united and formed the League of Lezhë, an anti-Ottoman confederacy under Skanderbeg's lead. As a result, the Ottoman Empire sought <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> League and re-establish control over Albania. As of 1448, all Ottoman expeditions into Albania had failed and Murad II chose lead a force in person into Albanian {{territory}} and fragment the League. The sultan decided to capture the fortress of Svetigrad. This fortress served the strategic purpose of protecting the Albanian eastern frontier, while also allowing the Albanians to launch their own assaults on Ottoman territory. In late 1447, war began between Venice and the League, but had not yet escalated into full-scale conflict. Skanderbeg had declared war on Venice {{as a result of a}} diplomatic impasse. This left him open to invasion from the East.|$|E

5|$|In 1817, John Wood died in {{the midst}} of a {{financial}} scandal, and Bute decided to appoint two of his rivals to the posts of Constable and Cardiff's Town Clerk. This would have reaffirmed Bute's power to change the appointments and broken the Wood's family hold on local power, but it provoked a storm of local political wrangling. The Wood family turned on Bute, arguing that he should abandon his claims to control local Welsh affairs from Scotland. Bute replied by trying <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Wood family's bank and stacking the town council with his appointees in early 1818. The Woods successfully took legal action, challenging Bute's authority to take these actions, and anti-Bute violence flared that summer, resulting in arrests by Special Constables appointed by Bute. The pro-Bute faction in Cardiff rallied and the Woods were defeated at the Parliamentary elections that year, the results reaffirming Bute's authority over the town council.|$|E
5|$|In April 1898, Schwalbe was recommissioned {{for another}} tour abroad. She first {{returned}} to German East Africa, where the Second Boer War threatened regional stability; British warships began seizing German vessels suspected of carrying contraband to the Boers. This created a major diplomatic incident and Schwalbe {{was sent to}} protect German shipping in the area. The outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China in 1900 {{proved to be more}} pressing, and so Schwalbe was sent to join the Eight Nation Alliance that had formed <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> Boxers. During her deployment to China, she helped blockade the Yangtze and sent landing parties ashore to control unrest in Ningpo. In mid-1902, she was recalled to Germany for a second time, was overhauled, and was again decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>the</b> seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up {{a large proportion of the}} diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.|$|E
