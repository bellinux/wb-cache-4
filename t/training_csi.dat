The ECFB training is periodically (T 2 -CSI-Req) performed by each node to obtain the required CSI from its neighbors. T 2 -CSI-Req is the interval between two CSI requests of a node. The operations of ECFB have been described in Section 2.1. This section focuses on the multi-user data transmission.|$|E
30|$|In passive {{localization}} systems, {{the radio}} signal fluctuations may be {{induced by the}} targets as moving in the monitored area X, or by other environmental changes [4]. Therefore, {{the goal of the}} proposed subspace decomposition is to separate the signal perturbations due to the subject(s) from the ones induced by background noise or other effects (e.g., body movements outside the detection area or interfering devices). Background noise here refers to the alterations of the CSI data that are induced by (possibly time-varying) environmental changes in the surrounding of the detection area that are not attributable to body movements (i.e., open/closed door, people moving outside the detection area). We thus define the body-induced signal subspace and the background noise subspace, respectively. Projection matrices for both spaces are obtained during the calibration phase, using space- and frequency-domain <b>training</b> <b>CSI</b> measurements, s_f_i,t(x_A) and s_ℓ _j,t(x_A), that correspond to a single target located in selected landmarks xA. The projection matrices for both the subspaces are therefore extracted from the single target measurements obtained during the training phase. The proposed subspace decomposition approach is detailed in the following sections by looking separately to the space- and frequency-domain CSI profiles. In particular, we show that the body-induced and background subspaces can be used during online multi-target (i.e., Nd= 2) localization to separate the alterations of the CSI as induced by body movements inside the detection area X from those due to the environment (or other subjects moving outside X), respectively.|$|E

30|$|Considering {{frequency}} division duplexing (FDD)-based C-RANs, acquiring channel state information (CSI) at the CP requires downlink antenna <b>training</b> and uplink <b>CSI</b> feedback from users. Antenna <b>training</b> and <b>CSI</b> feedback consume precious time and frequency resources which increase {{with the number of}} RRHs involved in user service. Considering that the available time and frequency resources are limited, those overheads might be a bottleneck for RRH cooperation in an FDD-based C-RAN where a large number of RRHs are deployed for user service. In [16, 17], RRH cooperation strategies are developed to reduce the overhead required for acquiring CSI at the CP.|$|R

30|$|The first scheme jointly detects {{data and}} {{estimates}} the channel and noise variance, but the computational complexity is high, {{owing to the}} simultaneous detection and estimation for all antennas. To reduce the computational complexity of the first scheme, another scheme that performs data detection and channel estimation for only one antenna during each iteration and holding the unknown quantities of other antennas to their last values is proposed, whose performance only slightly degrades compared to the first scheme. Furthermore, the estimates of data, channel, and noise variance are all obtained as closed-form results, and therefore, the proposed schemes are free of exhaustive search. Simulation results demonstrate quick convergence of the proposed algorithm, and after convergence, {{the performance of the}} proposed iterative algorithm is close to that of the optimal channel estimation and data detection case, which assumes full <b>training</b> and perfect <b>CSI.</b>|$|R
30|$|However, the {{coherent}} processing {{depends on}} the reliable estimation of channel state information (CSI) between base station (BS) and users [5 – 7]. In time division duplex (TDD) massive MIMO system, by exploiting the channel reciprocity, both the uplink and downlink channels can be obtained using the simple least square (LS) approach [8]. The consumption of pilot resource scales {{with the number of}} users. However, there is no channel reciprocity in frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO system. In this case, the downlink channel estimation becomes particularly challenging since the downlink <b>training</b> and corresponding <b>CSI</b> feedback yield an unacceptably high overhead. For example, with the traditional LS channel estimation scheme, it is well-known that the length of the required pilot sequence must be larger than the number of antennas at BS [8], which will degrade the system performance greatly.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} downlink training and channel estimation in frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, where the base station (BS) equipped {{with a large number}} of antennas serves a number of single-antenna users simultaneously. To obtain the channel state information (CSI) at the BS in FDD systems, the downlink channel has to be estimated by users via downlink training and then fed back to the BS. For FDD large-scale MIMO systems, the overhead for downlink <b>training</b> and <b>CSI</b> uplink feedback could be prohibitively high, which presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we study the behavior of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator when the channel covariance matrix has a low-rank or an approximate low-rank structure. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the amount of training overhead can be substantially reduced by exploiting the low-rank property of the channel covariance matrix. In particular, we show that the MMSE estimator is able to achieve exact channel recovery in the asymptotic low-noise regime, provided that the number of pilot symbols in time is no less than the rank of the channel covariance matrix. We also present an optimal pilot design for the single-user case, and an asymptotic optimal pilot design for the multi-user scenario. Lastly, we develop a simple model-based scheme to estimate the channel covariance matrix, based on which the MMSE estimator can be employed to estimate the channel. The proposed scheme does not need any additional training overhead. Simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical results and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimated covariance-assisted MMSE estimator...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, two EM-based {{iterative}} data {{detection and}} channel and noise variance estimation schemes for MIMO-OFDM systems operating over TF dispersive channels under unknown background noise have been proposed. The resulting schemes achieve convergence {{in a few}} iterations and can effectively estimate TF dispersive channels and obtain reliable data detection under unknown background noise environments. The first scheme iteratively detects data and estimates the channel and noise variance simultaneously for all antennas, and moreover, the updating expressions of these estimates are all derived as closed-form results. Simulation results showed that after convergence, {{the performance of the}} first scheme is very close to that of the optimal case which assumes full <b>training</b> and perfect <b>CSI.</b> To reduce the computational complexity of the first scheme, another EM-based scheme that detecting data and estimating channel for only one antenna during each iteration and holding the unknown quantities of other antennas to their last estimates has been proposed, which is also derived as closed-form results. Simulation results showed that its performance only slightly degrades compared to the first scheme, but the computational complexity is significantly reduced.|$|R
30|$|To {{obtain the}} channel state {{information}} (<b>CSI),</b> <b>training</b> OFDM symbols or pilot symbols embedded in each OFDM symbol are utilized. Training OFDM symbols or equivalently OFDM preambles are transmitted {{at the beginning}} of the transmission record, while pilot symbols (complex exponentials in time) are embedded in each OFDM symbol, and they are separated from information symbols in the frequency-domain [1 – 3]. If the channel remains constant over several OFDM symbols, channel estimation by training OFDM symbols may be sufficient for symbol detection. But in the event of channel variation, training OFDM symbols should be retransmitted frequently to obtain reliable channel estimates for detection. On the other hand, to track the fast varying channel, pilot symbols are inserted into every OFDM symbol to facilitate channel estimation. This is known as pilot-assisted (or -aided) channel estimation [2, 4, 5]. The main drawback of the pilot-assisted channel estimation lies in the reduction of the transmission rate, especially when larger number pilot symbols are inserted in each OFDM symbol. Thus, it is desirable to minimize the number of embedded pilot symbols to avoid excessive transmission rate loss.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} intercell interference cancellation (ICIC) with {{a practical}} downlink training and uplink channel state information (CSI) feedback model. The average downlink throughput {{for such a}} 2 -cell network is derived. The user location has a strong effect on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and the channel estimation error. This motivates adaptively switching between traditional (single-cell) beamforming and ICIC at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) where ICIC is preferred only with low SIR and accurate channel estimation, {{and the use of}} ICIC with optimized training and feedback at high SNR. For a given channel coherence time and fixed training and feedback overheads, we develop optimal data vs. pilot power allocation for <b>CSI</b> <b>training</b> as well as optimal feedback resource allocation to feed back CSI of different channels. Both analog and finite-rate digital feedback are considered. With analog feedback, the training power optimization provides a more significant performance gain than feedback optimization; while conversely for digital feedback, performance is more sensitive to the feedback bit allocation than the training power optimization. We show that even with low-rate feedback and standard training, ICIC can transform an interference-limited cellular network into a noise-limited one.

40|$|Abstract—CSI {{fingerprint}} localization is {{an advanced}} and promising technique for indoor localization, which identifies the user’s location by mapping his measured CSI against the server’s CSI fingerprint database. This approach is highlighted {{due to its}} high granularity for location distinction and strong robustness to noise disturbances, but it also causes potential privacy leakage for the three participants in localization process: the user, the server, and the AP. Currently, {{there has been little}} research done on this issue, and the existing work often ignores the privacy concern on the AP. To fill the gap, this paper develops a privacy-preserving fuzzy localization scheme with CSI fingerprint. On one hand, it leverages the property of <b>CSI</b> <b>training</b> to guarantee the randomness and independence of the user’s measurement in each time of localization, and uses homomorphic encryption to achieve the data transmission and measurement comparison in cipher. These operations enable our scheme to preserve the location privacy of the user and APs as well as the data privacy of the server. On the other hand, the adoption of CSI fingerprint and fuzzy logic enhances the localization accuracy greatly. Through simulation experiments performed on CRAWDAD database, the efficiency of our proposed scheme is validated. I...|$|R
40|$|Interference between nodes is a {{critical}} impairment in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). This paper studies the role of multiple antennas in mitigating such interference. Specifically, a network is studied in which receivers apply zero-forcing beamforming to cancel the strongest interferers. Assuming a network with Poisson distributed transmitters and independent Rayleigh fading channels, the transmission capacity is derived, which gives {{the maximum number of}} successful transmissions per unit area. Mathematical tools from stochastic geometry are applied to obtain the asymptotic transmission capacity scaling and characterize the impact of inaccurate channel state information (CSI). It is shown that, if each node cancels L interferers, the transmission capacity decreases as the outage probability to the power of 1 /(L+ 1) as the outage probability vanishes. For fixed outage probability, as L grows, the transmission capacity increases as L to the power of (1 - 2 /alpha) where alpha is the path-loss exponent. Moreover, CSI inaccuracy is shown to have no effect on the transmission capacity scaling as the outage probability vanishes, provided that the <b>CSI</b> <b>training</b> sequence has an appropriate length, which we derived. Numerical results suggest that canceling merely one interferer by each node increases the transmission capacity by an order of magnitude or more, even when the CSI is imperfect.

5000|$|Air Force {{chaplain}} training began July 1, 1953 (when the Air Force {{was given}} responsibility to train its own chaplains) when the Air Force Chaplains Course was created under the Officer Basic Military Course at Lackland Air Force Base. The USAF Chaplain School {{was established in}} June 1960, and its emblem was approved Oct 30, 1961, incorporating Christian and Jewish chaplain insignia, along with a motto that reads [...] "Ut Omnes Unum Sint"—"That all may be one". The emblem was revised in 1966, still including the symbols for Christian and Jewish Chaplains, keeping the motto. However, when it was revised again in 1984, when the Roman numerals in the Jewish insignia changed to Hebrew letters, the motto was replaced with the school's title, [...] "Air Force Chaplain School". On Oct 31, 1992, chaplain training was integrated into the Ira C. Eaker Center for Professional Development, and the school was redesignated as the U.S. Air Force Chaplain Service Institute (CSI, which also incorporated the Chaplain Service Resource Board, so that training and resourcing could be consolidated), located at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.

40|$|In network MIMO {{cellular}} systems, subsets of {{base stations}} (BSs), or remote radio heads, are connected via backhaul links to central units (CUs) that perform joint encoding in the downlink and joint decoding in the uplink. Focusing on the uplink, an effective {{solution for the}} communication between BSs and the corresponding CU on the backhaul links is based on compressing and forwarding the baseband received signal from each BS. In the presence of ergodic fading, communicating the channel state information (CSI) from the BSs to the CU may require a sizable part of the backhaul capacity. In a prior work, this aspect was studied by assuming a Compress-Forward-Estimate (CFE) approach, whereby the BSs compress the <b>training</b> signal and <b>CSI</b> estimation {{takes place at the}} CU. In this work, instead, an Estimate-Compress-Forward (ECF) approach is investigated, whereby the BSs perform CSI estimation and forward a compressed version of the CSI to the CU. This choice is motivated by the information theoretic optimality of separate estimation and compression. Various ECF strategies are proposed that perform either separate or joint compression of estimated CSI and received signal. Moreover, the proposed strategies are combined with distributed source coding when considering multiple BSs. "Semi-coherent" strategies are also proposed that do not convey any <b>CSI</b> or <b>training</b> information on the backhaul links. Via numerical results, it is shown that a proper design of ECF strategies based on joint received signal and estimated CSI compression or of semi-coherent schemes leads to substantial performance gains compared to more conventional approaches based on non-coherent transmission or the CFE approach.

40|$|The {{research}} is done within {{the diocese of}} Kanyakumari of the Church of South India. It examines {{the viability of the}} following training programmes to socio-political factors: the Church Workers Theological Training Programme, the Sunday School Programme, the Vacation Bible School Programme, the parish-based training programmes - for example retreats and workshops, the Women&# 146;s Fellowship Programme, the Christian Endeavour Programme, the Programme of Communication and Revival {{as well as that of}} the Student Christian Movement of India, and the Union of Evangelical Students of India. The practitioners of these programmes felt the need for guide-lines to transform their programmes to be more relevant to their socio-political contexts. Hence the present qualitative-oriented research was undertaken. The preliminary interviews and reading of the related literature enabled the researcher to identify some promoted theories, regarding the relationship between the socio-political factors and the programmes; this assisted him to set up a questionnaire for semistructured interviews. A sample for interviews was chosen with the help of the organisers of the programmes. A pilot study was conducted using the questionnaire, which led to the semi-structured interviews. The respondents narrated their experiences and reflections related to the socio-political factors. The information was organised, scrutinised, and the findings were recorded under six different pointers, which enabled the researcher to exhibit and explain the connections between the training programmes and the sociopolitical factors. Then the findings were evaluated, using the puzzle-solving method. Consequently, some guidelines were devised. These guide-lines indicate the limitations and the possibilities in making a socially-oriented training programme more vibrant and viable to its socio-political factors. Moreover, they highlight the possibilities for the existing pietistic-oriented programmes to become more relevant to the context. They also guide the practitioners to construct alternative approaches in training that are more relevant. The {{research is}} a small incentive to the emerging cooperation among the practitioners of the various <b>training</b> programmes in <b>CSI</b> Kanyakumari diocese.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{the number of}} mobile and {{wireless}} communications users has dramatically increased. Wireless communication systems have experienced evolution of first generation (1 G) and second generation (2 G). Currently, the third generation (3 G) wireless communication system is rapidly spreading {{all over the world}} providing high data rate wireless multimedia services. Yet, the pursuit for higher data rates, larger coverage and more spectral efficient mobile communication still goes on. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems have emerged and been nominated as a promising solution for future generation wireless communications systems due to their capability of enhancing channel capacity, spectral efficiency and coverage. These enhancements are possible in a rich scattering environment when array antennas are used at transmit and receive ends of a communication link. To realize these benefits, a MIMO system requires the channel state information (CSI) to be available at the receiver. It has to be known before any data can be decoded. In practice, CSI is obtained by channel estimation and as a result most of MIMO detection schemes rely on an accurate estimation of CSI at the receiver end. Therefore, channel estimation is extremely critical to the proper functioning of MIMO systems. However, as CSI can be determined only in an approximate manner, it is unclear how estimation errors affect MIMO system performance. Most of works focusing on the MIMO systems’ potential assume perfect CSI available at the receiver end while estimating capacity. This assumption is not true in practice and thus the existing gap on the relationship between an estimated CSI and MIMO channel capacity forms the main motivation for the work undertaken in this thesis. The MIMO channel estimation can be performed by sending training sequences which are known both to the transmitter and the receiver. This is the most popular method to estimate the MIMO channel. In majority of works which reported the training-based MIMO channel estimation methods, the channel coefficients in the channel matrix are assumed to have Gaussian identical independent distribution (i. i. d). This assumption is not true in practical scenarios because of a limited number of scattering objects and non-ideal operation of array antennas. The shortfall of training-based channel estimation is that the training sequence does not contain any information and thus it sacrifices a considerable amount of bandwidth. To save the bandwidth and increase the spectral efficiency, blind channel estimation and semi-blind channel estimation can be used to obtain CSI. For blind and semi-blind channel estimation, no training symbols or fewer training symbols are needed to estimate the channel. Also, the transmitter does not need to cooperate with the receiver. Most of these methods are based on second or higher order statistic models of the received signal. Their disadvantage is the increased computational complexity, gradual convergence, and scalar and phase ambiguities of channel matrix elements. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the performance of training-based channel estimation and assess its impact on MIMO channel capacity under realistic channel models; optimize <b>training</b> sequences when <b>CSI</b> is available to the transmitter and the receiver, and develop blind channel estimation algorithms with low complexity and without scalar or phase ambiguity. To realize these goals, the thesis introduces the information theory of MIMO system and shows how MIMO channel capacity is related to the properties to the MIMO channel matrix. Next, realistic channel models are described which include varying distributions of scattering objects and actual electrical properties of different configurations of antennas with varying elements spacing. These models are used to assess performances of training-based channel estimation methods including Least Square (LS), Scaled Least Square (SLS) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) methods when CSI is available only at the receiver side. It is shown that as the assumed channels properties divert from the i. i. d. case, because the scattering environment and antennas operation turn away from ideal conditions, spatial correlation affects both channel estimation and capacity. In order to have a better insight into the obtained results, spatial correlation is linked to physical parameters of the channel {{as well as to the}} mathematical properties of the channel matrix. It is shown that an increased spatial correlation helps to improve the channel estimation accuracy. However, the overall effect is the decreased channel capacity. This finding shows that the MIMO system does not have to rely on the perfect knowledge of CSI to achieve increased capacity. In the next step, considerations extend to the case when CSI is assumed to be available both at the receiver and the transmitter. This scenario creates an opportunity to optimize transmitted training sequences and thus improve channel estimation. As in the previous considerations, optimized training sequences are devised under the assumption of advanced channel models. This part of investigations also includes derivations of closed-form expressions of MIMO channel capacity and bit error rate (BER) performance by taking into account channel estimation accuracy. The obtained results show that the use of LS, SLS and MMSE methods has a different effect on MIMO BER performance, with LS offering the worst performance and MMSE giving the best BER performance. The final part of the thesis focuses on devising a new blind channel estimation algorithm which employs a simple coding scheme to avoid scalar and phase ambiguities for the MIMO channel matrix. Its validity is verified by extensive simulations followed by experiments on a MIMO test-bed employing a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). It is shown that the proposed blind channel estimation algorithm is easy to implement in a DSP firmware due to its low computational complexity. Also it shows fast convergence. It offers good performance for fast fading channels in addition to slow fading channels. The work undertaken as part of this thesis has been published in several journals and refereed conference papers, which underline the originality and significance of the thesis contributions...|$|R
