50|$|The {{possibility}} {{of the creation of}} infrared lasers based on the vibrationally excited products of a chemical reaction was first proposed by John Polanyi in 1961. A pulsed (although not chemical) laser was demonstrated by Jerome V. V. Kasper and George C. Pimentel in 1965. First, hydrogen chloride (HCl) was pumped optically so vigorously that the molecule disassociated and then re-combined, leaving it in an excited state suitable for a laser. Then hydrogen fluoride (HF) and deuterium fluoride (DF) were demonstrated. Pimentel went on to explore a DF-CO2 <b>transfer</b> <b>laser.</b> Although this work did not produce a purely chemical continuous wave laser, it paved the way by showing the viability of the chemical reaction as a pumping mechanism for a chemical laser.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{transfer}} blackbody-pumped lasers is outlined, recent research results concerning these lasers are presented {{and the search}} for new lasant materials for transfer blackbody-pumped lasers is expanded. There are two basic concepts for the blackbody-pumped <b>transfer</b> <b>laser</b> which are schematically drawn. The first concept is called the translational heating concept, an example being N 2 :CO 2. Here the blackbody cavity is heated to approximately 2000 K by collected sunlight in space. An absorbing molecule would come in contact with the blackbody walls thus coming into equilibrium with the blackbody temperature. An alternative concept shown is called the vibrational heating <b>transfer</b> <b>laser.</b> Here the absorbing molecule is not translationally heated. Energy is coupled to the molecule only by optical absorption creating a high density of vibrational states. Thus the gas temperature is near room temperature whereas the vibrational temperature comes into equilibrium with the blackbody temperature...|$|E

40|$|Femtosecond mode-locked lasers {{have become}} one of the {{indispensable}} tools for spectroscopy and microwave generation for its capability to generate high-quality ultra-short pulses, and thus optical frequency combs with a wide spectrum. Particularly, many applications of the optical frequency combs require the high spectral purity and long-term stability of the combs, which are limited by the phase noise, or timing jitter, of the mode-locked lasers. Therefore, several techniques have been successfully developed recently for stabilizing the mode-locked lasers, although they suffer many drawbacks in the sense of applicability because of their relative complex designs. In this thesis, an attempt to apply the Pound-Drever-Hall technique, a powerful frequency stabilization technique for continuous wave laser, to the mode-locked lasers is demonstrated with success. Our results indicate that with this simplified and robust system, the repetition frequency of the mode-locked laser has been stabilized and there is significant phase noise suppression at low frequency, and it is capable to reduce the integrated timing jitter of the mode-locked laser by nearly four times without the need of previously stabilized <b>transfer</b> <b>lasers</b> or RF signals as references. The success from this stabilization system reveals the great potential of utilizing Pound-Derver-Hall technique for future inspirations of a cost-effective and field-deployable system that could provide state-of-the-art stabilization for the mode-locked lasers...|$|R
