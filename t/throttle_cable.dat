25|$|As Bryant {{drove down}} to Seascape, he shot at a red Ford Falcon coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen. Upon {{arriving}} at Seascape, {{he got out of}} his car. A Holden Frontera 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and actually slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the <b>throttle</b> <b>cable.</b> He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm. The car was going downhill so it was able to roll down the road out of sight around a corner. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken <b>throttle</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
500|$|At the French Grand Prix, held at {{the high}} speed Reims-Gueux circuit, Brabham {{followed}} race leader Lorenzo Bandini closely {{from the start of}} the race, using the slipstream of Bandini's more powerful Ferrari to tow him to up to [...] faster down the straights than the BT19 could manage on its own. This allowed Brabham to consolidate his lead over Ferrari's second driver, Formula One novice Mike Parkes. After 12 laps Bandini pulled away from Brabham, eventually by over 30 seconds, but when the Italian car was delayed by a broken <b>throttle</b> <b>cable</b> on lap 32, Brabham cruised to the finish to win from Parkes and become the first man to win a Formula One World Championship race in one of his own cars.|$|E
50|$|Constant vacuum carburetors, {{also called}} {{variable}} choke carburetors and constant velocity carburetors, are carburetors where the <b>throttle</b> <b>cable</b> was connected {{directly to the}} <b>throttle</b> <b>cable</b> plate. Pulling the cord caused raw gasoline to enter the carburetor, creating a large emission of hyrdocarbons.|$|E
50|$|Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) {{is also a}} new addition. The <b>throttle</b> <b>cables</b> are {{connected}} to a throttle position sensor and a new computer called G.E.N.I.C.H. that operates the butterfly valves, the EXUP valve in the exhaust and the other components involved, such as the igniter unit, and the YCC-I lifter unit. The YCC-T computes all the input of the sensors and calculates the best throttle position, ignition advance, EXUP valve and injection time in milliseconds.|$|R
50|$|Gen 5 uses {{electronic}} controlled <b>throttle</b> with <b>cable</b> (semi-drive by wire), so no {{idle speed}} controller is required. A returnless fuel rail is also used.|$|R
25|$|Reeve Aleutian Airways Flight 8, a Lockheed L-188 Electra, on 8 June 1983. Flying over Cold Bay, Alaska, the plane's number 4 engine {{propeller}} {{separated and}} cut {{a hole in the}} plane, causing an explosive decompression, jammed flight controls, snapped <b>throttle</b> <b>cables,</b> and left the flight deck crew of three with only autopilot that had no lateral control. After managing to wrench the ailerons and elevators into minimal working condition, the crew tried to land at Anchorage at high speed. They had to make a go-around, but landed on the second attempt, saving all 10 passengers on board.|$|R

2500|$|Carburetion {{had five}} {{separate}} circuits. Suzuki used peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but {{are known to}} have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage Mikuni carburetor. An 18mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the five <b>throttle</b> <b>cables,</b> providing smooth low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small primary ports. Indirectly involved with carburetion is the unique [...] "port valve". This small butterfly valve pivots in the rotor housing inside the secondary port and is directly controlled by another of the <b>throttle</b> <b>cables.</b> Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the secondary port would fill with traces of exhaust gasses whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port {{at the end of the}} exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with exhaust gasses causing a momentary misfire and felt as a dead spot or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from exhaust gasses. Carburetor tuning involves adjusting cables controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, illustrated by Suzuki Service Bulletin Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} had cloth {{bench seats}} and a metal dash sometimes with a simulated burle woodgrain. The radio {{was a simple}} mono vacuum tube type radio with integrated speaker. An ash tray was located in {{the right side of}} the dash, close to the clock Depending upon the year there were both choke and <b>throttle</b> <b>cables</b> on the dash. On the right side was the choke lever. In the earlier years the clock was integrated into the glove compartment door and was of a manual-wind seven-day type. In the 1949 and 1950 models the clock was next to the glove box and with the redesigned dash board, the clock was on the top of the dash, in a center pod. Also, this revised dash had two round pods for the speedometer and the other gauges while the 1949 and 1950 models had one large round pod directly in front of the steering wheel on the dash.|$|R
50|$|This system helps {{accomplish}} vehicle propulsion {{by means}} of an electronic <b>throttle</b> without any <b>cables</b> from the accelerator pedal to the throttle valve of the engine. In electric vehicles, this system controls the electric motors by sensing the accelerator pedal input and sending commands to the power inverter modules.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} was reworked {{again for}} 1993 as the GF4A-EL with seven solenoids, a rotor-type pump, and {{the removal of}} the <b>throttle</b> <b>cable.</b> In 1994, all US-built 4-cylinder 626s and MX-6s began using the locally-sourced ZF/Ford designed CD4E transmission, which Mazda given the code LA4A-EL.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, the M52TU ("technical update") was released, adding {{variable}} valve timing to the exhaust camshaft (called dual VANOS by BMW). Other upgrades included electronic throttle control (which uses a <b>throttle</b> <b>cable</b> as backup), a dual length intake manifold (called [...] "DISA" [...] by BMW) and revised cylinder liners.|$|E

50|$|At the season's {{first race}} in Phoenix de Cesaris {{selected}} the wrong gear {{in the short}} pre-qualifying session, buzzed the engine and was out. That result was no indication {{of what was to}} come. De Cesaris showed proper form at Monaco, forcing his way past the Benetton of Roberto Moreno and was running in the points when the Jordan's <b>throttle</b> <b>cable</b> snapped.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} McLaren to use a {{semi-automatic}} transmission; it was a McLaren-designed electro-hydraulic unit with semi-automatic activation. The team's technology partner Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG) helped with development.

It also controlled engine speed automatically during gear changes.|$|E
50|$|Arena's 2007 {{effort would}} suffer {{mechanical}} setbacks early, {{with the team}} struggling to finish races due to <b>throttle</b> <b>cable</b> linkage failures. The team was also forced to withdraw from Le Mans when a heavy accident during testing damage the car so badly that repairs could not be completed in the two weeks prior to the race. Arena was however able to finish in eighth place at the Nürburgring, earning them their first points of the season.|$|E
50|$|On 9 December 1983, {{the morning}} tanker mission for the ELF-1 {{orbiting}} E-3 protecting the Arabian oilfields from attack, {{took off from}} Riyadh Military airport along with seven Navy and Marine Corps officer observers, members of the Navy's Strategic Studies Group from Newport, RI. There were 12 souls on board, however, no additional parachutes were loaded aboard for these observers' use, if necessary. The E-3 Aircraft Commander and the crew were into their 7th hour of a normal 14-hour mission. The refueling was uneventful, but rather than the normal post-A/R vertical separation maneuver, the E-3 commander asked {{if it would be}} OK to join the tanker off the right wing so the passengers could get some good pictures. Contributing to the accident was the tanker pilot flying was in the left seat and the E-3 pilot flying was in the right seat. After several minutes on a collision course the E-3 contacted the tanker's right wing with its left wing. The E-3 wing outside of the number one engine broke off after cutting into the tanker's skin and severing the <b>throttle</b> <b>cables.</b> The wing pieces embedded themselves into the tanker fuselage, causing a rapid decompression. A break-away maneuver was conducted, and the aircraft were able to complete control checks. The tanker landed at Riyadh Military airport with two engines out on one side, while the E-3 had to dump all the fuel it just received before it was able to land there as well. The missing wing pieces that did not strike the tanker were never found, and appeared to cause no damage on the ground. The investigating board recommended that both Rated E-3 pilots and the enlisted flight engineer be permanently assigned duties other than flying, and that cameras not be allowed on the flight-deck without Wing approval.|$|R
5000|$|The AOD was {{redesigned}} {{with electronic}} controls in 1992, becoming the AODE. It was mainly {{intended for the}} new Modular V8 at first, {{but it was also}} adapted to the old AOD bell-housing for vehicles still powered by OHV engines. While the AOD, AODE and early 4R70W share some basic components like oil pans, gear sets (AODs and AODE can be retrofitted with 4R70W gear sets), most of the internals are not interchangeable because the 4R70W and AODE use electronic solenoids to shift instead of conventional hydraulics. The transmissions are not interchangeable either, as the AOD only uses a <b>throttle</b> valve <b>cable</b> for operation. The AODE and 4R70W's shift points are controlled by the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) also sometimes referred to as the Electronic Engine Control (EEC). Applications: ...|$|R
50|$|The E46 M3 {{was offered}} with a {{standard}} 6-speed Getrag transmission, but optionally came with a SMG drivelogic transmission (also known as the SMG II). This is the standard 6-speed Getrag transmission with an electrohydraulically actuated clutch (no clutch pedal). Shifts are made via the SMG gear knob or the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters. The engine had a redline of 8,000 rpm. As with most M engines, the S54 again had 6 independent throttle bodies and this time electronically operated throttles (drive-by-wire <b>throttle</b> with no <b>cable).</b>|$|R
5000|$|On many cars, the {{accelerator}} pedal motion is communicated via the <b>throttle</b> <b>cable,</b> {{to activate the}} throttle linkages, which move the throttle plate. In cars with electronic throttle control (also known as [...] "drive-by-wire"), an electric motor controls the throttle linkages and {{the accelerator}} pedal connects not to the throttle body, but to a sensor, which sends the pedal position to the Engine Control Unit (ECU). The ECU determines the throttle opening based on accelerator pedal position and inputs from other engine sensors.|$|E
5000|$|Although the 2013 {{model has}} since proved itself, {{it had a}} {{somewhat}} shaky start. In the UK, the R1200GS has been subject to various DVSA vehicle recalls covering the front brakes, anti-lock braking system, <b>throttle</b> <b>cable,</b> fuel pump, clutch, final drive assembly, brake pipes, and gearbox; and similar recalls have been issued in other countries. Early journalistic reports described the bike as having a front end [...] "head shake" [...] or speed wobble, and deliveries of the motorcycle were halted while BMW revised the front end geometry.|$|E
50|$|The {{cruise control}} takes its speed signal from a {{rotating}} driveshaft, speedometer cable, {{wheel speed sensor}} from the engine's RPM, or from internal speed pulses produced electronically by the vehicle. Most systems do not allow {{the use of the}} cruise control below a certain speed - typically around 25 mph. The vehicle will maintain the desired speed by pulling the <b>throttle</b> <b>cable</b> with a solenoid, a vacuum driven servomechanism, or by using the electronic systems built into the vehicle (fully electronic) if it uses a 'drive-by-wire' system.|$|E
50|$|One unique {{feature of}} this {{transmission}} is its use of both a modulator valve and a <b>throttle</b> valve (TV) <b>cable.</b> Most transmissions either use {{one or the other}} to control shift points and shift smoothness. On the Turbo 440-T4, the TV cable exclusively controls the shift points, while the modulator valve controls the shift feel, with very little overlap between the effects of one adjustment on the other. This feature makes it very easy for a do-it-yourself mechanic to adjust the transmission shift points with minimum effect on the shift feel.|$|R
2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} [...] "the Rambler American {{has done well}} at American Motors." [...] For its final model year, 1969, the [...] "American" [...] name was dropped as the car was now {{referred to as the}} [...] "American Motors Rambler". Continuing the tradition of minimal changes, the models received a new [...] "suspended" [...] accelerator pedal and <b>cable</b> <b>throttle</b> linkage. Additional safety equipment for the 1969 models included front shoulder belts and headrests for both front outboard seating positions and the front parking lights stayed on with the headlights. On the exterior, the center horizontal chrome grille bar was deleted.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, the Turbo Hydra-Matic 700R4 {{was renamed}} the 4L60. Under the new designation, the [...] "4" [...] {{stands for the}} number of forward gears, the [...] "L" [...] for {{longitudinal}} applications (rear-wheel-drive), and the [...] "60" [...] is the strength rating (less than the 4L80). [...] "60" [...] is the relative torque value. For example, 80 is stronger than 60, which is stronger than 40, etc. A 4L80-E can handle more torque than a 4L60-E. The [...] "E" [...] denotes electronically controlled shifting. The 4L60 however is hydraulically shifted based on governor pressure and <b>throttle</b> valve (TV) <b>cable</b> position. 1992 was the last year of widespread usage of the 700R4 (4L60).The 1993 Camaro, Corvette and Typhoon were equipped with the last production 700R4.

5000|$|Shown as {{a concept}} in November 2003, a sporty XRS model (ZZE131), {{introduced}} in 2004 between the 2005 and 2006 model years only, featured the high-revving [...] at 7600 rpm, 127 lbft Nm at 4400 rpm 2ZZ-GE engine and 6-speed manual from the Toyota Celica GT-S and Lotus Elise. The 2ZZ-GE motor was actually developed with collaboration from Yamaha motors (like other wide-angle head GE, GTE, and GZE Toyota engines), and uses similar technologies found in its sibling motor the 1ZZ-FE. The XRS was very similar to its Corolla S cousin in appearance, however there are significant changes to the mechanical components. The 2ZZ-GE uses a <b>cable</b> <b>throttle</b> (unlike the electronic throttle control of the 2ZZ-GE in the later years of the Celica GT-S) with a lift set-point at 6700 rpm and an 8200 rpm redline. The close ratio C60 6-speed manual transmission, {{also found in the}} Toyota Matrix XRS, was the only transmission available. The sport-tuned suspension lowered the Corolla XRS by 0.5 in. A Yamaha designed brace spans the front strut towers as well as a X-Brace for the rear towers. The steering column is thicker and the power steering system is unique.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} testing {{platform}} to prepare a Vertical Takeoff and Landing Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTOL UAV) for fully independent flight tests. Other preparations for flight included extensive engine thrust and endurance testing to fully evaluate the capabilities of the engine used. Also, redesign of the fuel system allowed more efficient use of the fuel onboard. Commands for thrust and steering data were transmitted to the VTOL UAV via an RF uplink while UAV attitude and positional data were returned by means of an umbilical <b>cable.</b> <b>Throttle</b> settings, vane control, and a kill switch were incorporated in the RP uplink. The testing platform was developed to allow the VTOL UAV to hover in a confined area with limited movement in order to accurately monitor the effectiveness of the flight control system. In this regard, the vehicle was allowed only several feet of movement in any direction by fastening it in an aluminum cubical frame designed for this purpose. This thesis was carried out in conjunction with another flight control project and was aimed at providing the vehicle a platform in which to operate within a constricted area. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S.
