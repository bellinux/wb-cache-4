40|$|Abstract. The {{modelling}} and {{simulation of}} sophisticated technical systems is a demanding task. On the one hand, <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> {{of a large}} number of subsystems which exhibit predominantly continuous dynamics, sometimes with (infrequent) discontinuities. On the other hand, the distributed computerised control systems constitute complex discretetime and discrete-event systems that require completely different modelling and simulation methods. For an evaluation of the behaviour and the performance of the overall system, both types of models have to be combined and simulated efficiently. This contribution presents the requirements for a modelling environment for such systems and discusses an approach that consists of object-oriented modelling and efficient simulation of the physical part using the physical systems modelling language MODELICA, a software environment for the definition of discrete-event models using various formalisms, and the integration of both parts of the system via model translation. The coordination of both parts is performed by the MODELICA simulator. The modelling environment called DES/M (discrete-event systems for Modelica) supports the interoperation of different domain specific discrete-event formalisms. To illustrate the usage of the environment, a laboratory batch plant model is presented. A more elaborate example is described in another contribution in this volume (Mosterman et al., 2002). ...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new and {{canonical}} way of rewriting the equations of gas dynamics in lagrangian coordinates in dimension two as a weakly hyperbolic system of conservation laws, where <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>part</b> is sym-metrizable.

Based on this formulation, we derive a new conservative and entropy consistent nite volume numerical scheme. We prove the stability of the numerical scheme.

40|$|International audience—The {{development}} of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) requires to model both the cyber (i. e., digital) <b>parts,</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>parts</b> and <b>the</b> interaction between them. The {{state of the}} practice in such domain usually involves different stakeholders, which use dedicated modeling languages tailored syntactically and semantically to their domain. Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a recent standard, which provides technical facilities to enable the co-simulation among the different dedicated modeling languages. In this context, this paper investigates how discrete-event models of the cyber part are supported by FMI standard for co-simulation. Two main results are presented: 1) how SystemC models can {{be integrated into the}} FMI environment and 2) FMI limitations for the efficient use of discrete-event models in co-simulation. Both results are illustrated by using a simple but illustrative use case mixing models in SystemC (for the cyber part) and Modelica (for <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>part)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|My {{abstract}} is {{a little}} different, because I perform a technical service rather than do research on a project. I work in the NPD (New Product Development) lab here on BSU campus, {{under the direction of}} Blaise Lawless. My primary work is related the SLA (Stereo Lithography Apparatus) machine, which is our 3 -D printer. I write up quotes for clients, create build platforms, and perform post-printing duties. The NPD lab on campus is a team made of Boise State professors, engineering students, and professional mechanical engineers. Their purpose is to help Idaho inventors, entrepreneurs, and manufacturers with product design, prototyping, and design for manufacturing needs. The lab has several pieces of equipment designed to further assist the team in achieving these goals, such as a CNC milling machine, the CUBE, and a SLA machine. When a client e-mails us requesting a quote on a project, or asks for a part to be built on the SLA machine, I write up a quote with the information. Once the build is given the go-ahead by the client, my job is to take the SolidWorks-generated parts and place them onto a build platform through a computer program called LightYear. This program places the parts on a ‘platform’ that the SLA machine can read. The importance of this step is because of how the SLA machine builds the parts. The SLA machine holds a vat of resin that contains the liquid, plastic-like material that <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>parts</b> are made of. This resin can be transformed from a liquid state to a solid form by the exposure to UV (ultra-violet) rays. The machine uses a UV laser for this process. <b>The</b> <b>physical</b> <b>parts</b> made by this machine are built on a metal, perforated square about eleven inches by eleven inches and about the thickness of a dinner plate. This ‘plate’ is set on two metal arms, called the ‘elevator’, suspended above the vat filled with resin. The SLA then reads the program that I have set up in Lightyear and begins the building process. <b>The</b> <b>physical</b> <b>parts</b> are uniquely built. The metal plate is lowered into the resin, then raised. The UV laser begins to harden the resin left on the plate in an outline coming from the pattern that is read from the LightYear program. After this, the metal plate is lowered again into the resin, where it will be raised and the process is repeated. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>part</b> is built, layer by layer, until completion. Because <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>parts</b> cannot be built directly onto the metal plate, supports are first built. These ‘supports’ are like stilts that the part can sit upon. This is done because after the part is built, it must be removed from the metal plate without damaging <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>part.</b> <b>The</b> supports are built for this purpose; they are broken off to remove the part from the metal plate. Later, the remaining bits of supports are sanded off from <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>part.</b> After <b>the</b> part is built from the SLA machine, it must be rinsed of excess resin. This is because the resin, when left in the liquid form, is sticky, messy, and toxic. Therefore, the part is placed in a vat of liquid called poly-flush. This liquid helps to separate the remaining liquid resin from the part. After the part is washed in the poly-flush, I hand-rinse each part in isopropyl alcohol in a further effort to remove all the excess resin. After this brief wash, each part is blown dry with an air hose, and set in a well-ventilated room to finish drying. Once each part is dry, I place the parts into a UV oven to complete the hardening, or ‘curing’, process. This is much like placing pottery into a kiln for finishing. Finally, the parts come out of the oven. At this point, I am able to use a light-grit sandpaper to get any remaining bits of supports off, as well as sand down any cosmetic blemishes that may have occurred during the build. After this step, the parts are finished, so I package the parts into a box. Later, the parts are mailed to the client...|$|R
