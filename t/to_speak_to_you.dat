500|$|On Valentine's Day 2003, {{which was}} {{the eve of the}} Iraqi {{invasion}} by the US and UK, Ono heard about a couple, Andrew and Christine Gale, who were holding a love-in protest in their tiny bedroom in Addingham, West Yorkshire. She phoned them and said, [...] "It's good <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> We're supporting you. We're all sisters together." [...] The couple said that songs like [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] and [...] "Imagine" [...] inspired their protest. In 2004, Ono remade her song [...] "Everyman..... Everywoman....." [...] to support same-sex marriage, releasing remixes that included [...] "Every Man Has a Man Who Loves Him" [...] and [...] "Every Woman Has a Woman Who Loves Her".|$|E
500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
2500|$|Shrimpton {{believes}} that the apparent indifference of earlier authors {{was due to the}} general hatred by other Greeks against the Thebans who had medized (i.e. allied with the Persians) in the second Persian invasion in 480 BC and again in 368 BC. Athenians, in particular, held a special contempt for Thebes due to the latter's actions in the Peloponnesian War; as well as the Thebans' destruction of Plataea in 373 BC, and the invasion of the Athenian-allied Boeotian city of Oropus in 366 BC. Demosthenes records this sentiment very clearly in a disclaimer in his speech On the Navy (354 BC): [...] "It is difficult <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about , because you have such a hearty dislike of them that you would not care to hear any good of them, even if it were true." ...|$|E

2500|$|Continuing the play-within-a-play structure, the Illusionist {{presents}} the remaining {{events of the}} day in scenes which the astonished participants themselves watch from behind the pillar. [...] The Chamberlain just has time to prepare Ondine for her reception with the king. Ondine is particularly advised not to mention the wart on the king's nose. [...] Ondine tactlessly mentions that the Chamberlain's hand is damp and constantly interrupts him to talk to Bertram with whom she immediately establishes a rapport. [...] At the king's reception Ondine cannot take her eyes off Bertha. [...] She accuses Bertha of trying to steal Hans from her. [...] The King says, “Bertha only wants to be your friend.” [...] Ondine replies, “You are entirely mistaken! [...] Bertha is a hypocrite. [...] She flatters you constantly. [...] Has she ever dared <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about...the wart on your nose?” [...] In panic, the Chamberlain clears the room. [...] Ondine is alone with the king. [...] The king asks, “Who are you, Ondine?” [...] Ondine explains everything and says that she weeps because “they are trying to take Hans away from me.” [...] But what if they did, the king asks. [...] “would that be such a misfortune?” [...] Ondine answers, “Oh yes. [...] If he deceives me, he will die.” [...] The king says, “Men have been known to survive such things.” [...] “Not this one,” Ondine replies.|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] {{said the}} Duke, with a scowl that was terrible even to his wife. [...] "I wished <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but I wished <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> alone." ...|$|E
