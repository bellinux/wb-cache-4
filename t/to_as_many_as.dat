5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E

Haage Jr. changed Terscheck's Echinocactus reichenbachii to Echinocereus reichenbachii, which Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose later adopted. This broke with the long-standing botanical tradition to use the earliest known name, but because Terscheck's description was lacking and possibly referred <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> a dozen species, his binomial was supplanted by Haage's.|$|E
5|$|During the rut, males {{establish}} territories, {{ranging from}} , which they mark by urinating and depositing large piles of dung. Males in neighbouring territories frequently fight {{for access to}} females, which they do by twisting and levering {{at each other with}} their horns, interspersed with stabbing attacks. Females roam the territories of different males. Outside of the rut, mixed-sex herds can range from as few as three <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 180 individuals, while all-male bachelor herds are of typically no more than 50 individuals. Harem and nursery herds are much smaller, typically including no more than 10 individuals.|$|E

5|$|The {{programme}} {{of urban}} renewal under Augustus, {{and the growth}} of Rome's population <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 1 million people, was accompanied by a nostalgia for rural life expressed in the arts. Poetry praised the idealized lives of farmers and shepherds. The interiors of houses were often decorated with painted gardens, fountains, landscapes, vegetative ornament, and animals, especially birds and marine life, rendered accurately enough that modern scholars can sometimes identify them by species. The Augustan poet Horace gently satirized the dichotomy of urban and rural values in his fable of the city mouse and the country mouse, which has often been retold as a children's story.|$|E
5|$|The two armies {{suffered}} between 46,000 and 51,000 casualties.

Many authors have referred <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 28,000 Confederate casualties, and Busey and Martin's more recent 2005 work, Regimental Strengths and Losses at Gettysburg, documents 23,231 (4,708 killed, 12,693 wounded, 5,830 captured or missing). Nearly a third of Lee's general officers were killed, wounded, or captured. The casualties for both sides during the entire campaign were 57,225.|$|E
5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E

5|$|As {{the result}} of a 2015 {{referendum}} in Houston, a mayor is elected for a four-year term, and can be elected <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> two consecutive terms. The term limits were spearheaded in 1991 by conservative political activist Clymer Wright. During 1991–2015, the city controller and city council members were subjected to a two-year, three-term limitation – the 2015 referendum amended term limits to two four-year terms. As of 2017 some councilmembers who served two terms and won a final term will have served eight years in office, whereas a freshman councilmember who won a position in 2013 can serve up to two additional terms under the previous term limit law – a select few will have at least 10 years of incumbency once their term expires.|$|E
5|$|In the Lexington Herald-Leaders 198687 preseason coaches' poll, Clay County {{was ranked}} 14th in the state, and Farmer was {{named one of}} the state's best 25 players. Farmer led his team in scoring at 23.9 points per game, and Clay County {{finished}} the regular season with a record of 282 and again won the 13th Region tournament. Farmer scored 19 points and grabbed 5 rebounds in his team's 9080 victory over Highlands High School in the KHSAA state tournament's opening round, but his performance was overshadowed by teammate Russell Chadwell's 43 points. In the quarterfinals, Farmer led the Tigers with 19 points, defeating LaRue County High School 6256 in front of 24,041 spectators at Lexington's Rupp Arena, a record crowd for a high school basketball game. In the first half of Clay County's semifinal matchup with Madison Central High School, Farmer scored 18 and his younger brother, Russ, added 12 to account for 30 of their team's 39 first-half points. The Tigers' 17-point halftime lead grew <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 25 in the second half, and the elder Farmer again led his team with 24 total points in Clay County's 7858 victory.|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E

5|$|Music in {{religious}} rituals, especially Roman Catholic, {{manifests itself in}} a number of ways. Parish bands, for example, are quite common throughout Italy. They may be as small as four or five members <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 20 or 30. They commonly perform at religious festivals specific to a particular town, usually in honor of the town's patron saint. The historic orchestral/choral masterpieces performed in church by professionals are well-known; these include such works as the Stabat Mater by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Verdi's Requiem. The Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 revolutionized music in the Roman Catholic Church, leading to {{an increase in the number}} of amateur choirs that perform regularly for services; the Council also encouraged the congregational singing of hymns, and a vast repertoire of new hymns has been composed in the last 40 years.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 2011, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests {{said that}} the {{proposal}} for according tiger reserve status for the Sathyamangalam Reserve Forests is under consideration. He said that studies using camera traps indicated there could be 19 to 25 tigers in Sathyamangalam forests. A 2011 camera trap tiger density study conducted by World Wildlife Fund indicated that the sanctuary is home to at least 25 tigers. In the same year, a DNA based project initiated by the state forest department collected 150 samples of pugmarks from Sathyamangalam forests and 69 of them were found positive for tigers by tests conducted at the Center for Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. The findings also indicated that the region is home <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 30 tigers.|$|E
5|$|On the Continent, {{particularly}} Germany, crests have a {{far greater}} significance than in Britain, and {{it is common for}} one person to display multiple crests with his arms; certain high-ranking noblemen are entitled <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> seventeen. This practice did not exist in Britain until the modern era, and arms with more than one crest are still rare. In contrast to Continental practice, where a crest is never detached from its helm, a Briton with more than one crest may choose to display only one crested helm, and have the other crests simply floating in space. Though usually adopted through marriage to an heiress, examples exist of secondary crests being granted as augmentations: after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, Robert Ross was granted, in addition to his original crest, the crest of an arm holding the US flag with a broken flagstaff.|$|E
