5|$|Batman Forevers tone is {{significantly}} different from the previous installments, becoming more family-friendly since Warner Bros. believed that the previous Batman film, Batman Returns (1992), failed to outgross its predecessor due <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> complaints about the film's violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic book of the Dick Sprang era, as well as the 1960s television series. Keaton chose not to reprise the role due to Burton stepping down as director. William Baldwin and Ethan Hawke were initially considered for Keaton's replacement before Kilmer joined the cast.|$|E

Nevertheless, he was elected and journeyed to Richmond, which, being further inland than Williamsburg, was deemed better protected from possible British attack.|$|E
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc grape traces {{its origins}} to western France in the Loire Valley and Bordeaux Regions. As noted above, {{it is not}} clear that the vine {{originated}} in western France. Ongoing research suggests it may have descended from Savagnin. It has also been associated with the Carmenere family. At some point in the 18th century, the vine paired with Cabernet Franc <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> the Cabernet Sauvignon vine in Bordeaux. In the 19th century, plantings in Bordeaux were often interspersed with Sauvignon vert (In Chile, known as Sauvignonasse) as well as the Sauvignon blanc pink mutation Sauvignon gris. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic, the insect plague which devastated French vineyards in the 19th century, these interspersed cuttings were transported to Chile where the field blends are still common today. Despite the similarity in names, Sauvignon blanc has no known relation to the Sauvignon rosé mutation found in the Loire Valley of France.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the associations among}} parental emotion socialization, and children’s emotion regulation and attachment <b>to</b> <b>parents.</b> In particular, we {{examined the}} moderating role of parental emotion socialization {{in the relationship between}} children’s emotion regulation and attachment <b>to</b> <b>parents.</b> Participants were 78 Turkish children (49 boys) aged from 60 to 77 months and their parents. Parents reported on the socialization strategies they used for their children’s emotions and on their children’s emotion regulation, and we assessed children’s attachment <b>to</b> <b>parents</b> via the Doll Story Completion Task. Results revealed that parents’ minimization reaction to children’s emotions moderated the association between children’s emotion regulation and attachment <b>to</b> <b>parents.</b> When parents’ response was punitive, children with poor emotion regulation displayed stronger attachment <b>to</b> <b>parents</b> than children with robust emotion regulation. In addition, girls had a more secure attachment than boys <b>to</b> <b>parents.</b> Our results highlight the importance of children’s emotion regulation and parental emotion socialization for children’s secure early attachment <b>to</b> <b>parents...</b>|$|R

5|$|Luongo {{recorded}} a 3–1 win against the Detroit Red Wings in his Canucks debut on October 5, 2006. Later in the month, he notched his first shutout with the Canucks, stopping 32 shots in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Blackhawks on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender {{for the first time}} in his career for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He spent the night in the intensive care unit for fears his windpipe would swell shut. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo {{recorded a}} shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12–9 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2–1 overtime victory on March 9. He surpassed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991–92. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage <b>to</b> <b>Parent</b> with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties.|$|E
5|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} win in 17 matches after beating Plymouth 2–0 at home, with Chambers and Cresswell scoring {{in the first}} half. McGrath, Rankine and Rodman were sent back to their parent clubs, having become surplus to requirements under Worthington. The team were denied a second successive win after Peter Murphy scored a stoppage-time equaliser for Accrington, with the match finishing a 1–1 home draw, after Adam Reed had given York the lead in first half stoppage time. Carson and Kerr were ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season through injury, with the former returning <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> club Ipswich after the expiration of his loan. York recorded a second victory in three matches after winning 2–0 away to Northampton, who had been on a run of ten consecutive home wins, with Chambers scoring in the first half and John Johnson scoring an own goal in the second half. This result saw York rise out of the relegation zone by moving up to 20th place in the table, having occupied 23rd place following the previous four results. Cresswell was recalled from his loan by new Sheffield United caretaker manager Chris Morgan, after making an important contribution for York in their battle against relegation.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the Study: Middle-aged {{adults are}} {{often called upon}} <b>to</b> support aging <b>parents.</b> However, {{providing}} support <b>to</b> an aging <b>parent</b> with health problems and disability may be a stressful experience. This study asked whether giving everyday support <b>to</b> <b>parents</b> {{in the context of}} health problems and disability has implications for middle-aged children’s diurnal cortisol and daily mood. Design and Methods: During four consecutive days, 148 middle-aged adults (mean age = 55) reported the support they gave <b>to</b> their <b>parents</b> and provided saliva 4 times a day (wake, 30 min post-wake, lunchtime, and bedtime). Multilevel models estimated within-person differences in positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), cortisol awakening response and area under the curve with respect to ground (AUC-G) as a function of giving same-day and previous-day support. We examined whether these associations are exacerbated when a parent has health problems or activities of daily living (ADL) needs. Results: Middle-aged children had significantly higher next-day AUC-G on days after they gave support <b>to</b> <b>parents</b> with ADL needs. When participants gave support <b>to</b> <b>parents</b> with ADL needs, they had significantly greater same-day PA and lower next-day NA. Giving support <b>to</b> <b>parents</b> with health problems was associated with significantly higher next-day NA. Implications: Giving support <b>to</b> <b>parents</b> is an ambiguous experience with implications for biological stress and daily mood. A biopsychosocial approach reveals under what conditions giving support <b>to</b> <b>parents</b> may become detrimental to health and well-being; this knowledge is essential for {{the development and implementation of}} interventions...|$|R

25|$|More recently, nest {{insulation}} {{has been}} found to be related to the mass of the incubating parent. This is known as an allometric relationship. Nest walls are constructed with an adequate quantity of nesting material so that the nest will be capable of supporting the contents of the nest. Nest thickness, nest mass and nest dimensions therefore correlate with the mass of the adult bird. The flow-on consequence of this is that nest insulation is also related <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> mass.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Baskerville is an {{associate}} professor of political science, president of the American Coalition of Fathers and Children and fathers' rights advocate and defines court-determined custody as not a right <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> one's children but as the power to prevent the other partner from parenting. Members of the fathers' rights movement state that family courts are biased against fathers and shared custody. Baskerville states that the outcome of divorce is overly one-sided and is initiated by mothers in more than two-thirds of cases – especially when children are involved. He also states that divorce provides advantages for women such as automatic custody of the children and financial benefits in the form of child support payments. Members of the FR movement also state that family courts are slow to help fathers enforce their parental rights, and are expensive and time-consuming.|$|E
