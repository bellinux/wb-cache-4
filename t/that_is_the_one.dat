25|$|Poirot {{does indeed}} get {{permission}} for an exhumation {{and the body}} is proved to be riddled with arsenic. Nurse Harrison is shocked and tells Poirot a new story of seeing Jean filling up a make-up compact with a powder from the dispensary. Poirot alerts the police who find such a compact in the bureau of the bedroom of Jean's lodgings. They show it to Nurse Harrison who excitedly confirms <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> she saw – only for Poirot {{to tell her that}} such compacts have only been manufactured for three months. Further, his valet, George, followed her some days previously, witnessing her purchase of a compact at Woolworths and then seeing her travel to Jean's lodgings to secrete it there. Trapped and broken, Nurse Harrison admits the murder.|$|E
500|$|It is {{also stated}} that my name, my real name, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> I am known by, is not my real name. Now one is given one's name—one's {{authentic}} ones—at some such ceremony as baptism, Christening, or the like, {{on the occasion of}} one's formal reception into a certain religious Faith. In the ancient Zarathustrian Parsi community to which, on my father's side, I have the honour to belong, this ceremony is normally performed, as in other Faiths, in childhood, or owing to special circumstances as in my case, later in life, when I assumed my name as it now is or, {{in the words of the}} legal document in which this is mentioned [...] "...received into the Parsi community and in accordance with the custom and tradition thereof, is now and will be henceforth known as..." [...] and here follows my name as now.|$|E

2500|$|Late closure causes {{new words}} or phrases to be {{attached}} to the current clause. For example, [...] "John said he would leave yesterday" [...] would be parsed as John said (he would leave yesterday), and not as John said (he would leave) yesterday (i.e., he spoke yesterday). Minimal attachment is a strategy of parsimony: The parser builds the simplest syntactic structure possible (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> with the fewest phrasal nodes).|$|E
2500|$|When {{this general}} fact is proved by {{mathematical}} induction, the n = 0 case is trivial, (since the empty product is 1, {{and the empty}} sum is 0). The n = 1 case is also trivial, [...] And for each n ≥ 3, the case is easy to prove from the preceding n − 1 case. The real difficulty lies in the n = 2 case, which is why <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> stated in the standard product rule.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{family name}} usually pointed out [...] as {{denoting}} Jewish ancestry is Espírito Santo (Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost)and Verdugo/Berdugo (Branch of a Tree). The rationale is that Jews would adopt {{as a family}} name an (apparently) Christian concept as a deception. In fact, they were choosing the most incorporeal Trinity person, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that offended least their (secret) Jewish faith. This theory is not totally unfounded, as {{there is evidence that}} the cult around the Holy Spirit flourished after 1496, especially among New Christians. This does not rule out that [...] "Espírito Santo" [...] was also adopted by faithful Christians, following the rationale of other religious surnames.|$|E

2500|$|Medieval {{literature}} {{is a broad}} subject, encompassing essentially all written works available in Europe and beyond during the Middle Ages (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thousand years from {{the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire ca. AD 500 {{to the beginning of the}} Florentine Renaissance in the late 15th century). [...] The literature of this time was composed of religious writings as well as secular works. Just as in modern literature, it is a complex and rich field of study, from the utterly sacred to the exuberantly profane, touching all points in-between. [...] Works of literature are often grouped by place of origin, language, and genre.|$|E
2500|$|In {{mourning}} Nellie's death, Wooden was {{comforted by}} his faith. He was a devout Christian, considering his beliefs {{more important to}} him than basketball: [...] "I have always {{tried to make it}} clear that basketball is not the ultimate. It is of small importance in comparison to the total life we live. There is only one kind of life that truly wins, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that places faith in the hands of the Savior." [...] Wooden's faith strongly influenced his life. He read the Bible daily and attended the First Christian Church. He said that he hoped his faith was apparent to others: [...] "If I were ever prosecuted for my religion, I truly hope there would be enough evidence to convict me." [...] In a 2009 interview, John Wooden described himself politically as a [...] "liberal Democrat," [...] who had voted for some Republican presidential candidates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion of}} levels of {{decision}} {{is presented in}} a different manner by Frankfurt. Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the [...] "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) {{to the effect that}} one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are [...] "wanton addicts", [...] "unwilling addicts" [...] and [...] "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.|$|E

2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said {{would not be a}} great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E

30|$|Whereas functionalist theory had {{analysed}} {{the site}} basically {{as a white}} sheet on which to graft design autonomously {{with respect to the}} evolution of the city, and in the Post-modern period design had to converse with the urban mesh as an unexpected sign and one of continuity, it <b>is</b> now <b>the</b> archaeological places <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> where <b>the</b> intervention has to “darn” different histories, heterogeneous fabrics endowed with time, contexts marked by the complexity of the city and environmental territories.|$|R
30|$|Other {{intervention}} studies involving listening strategy instruction {{focused on}} learners’ development in strategies. In this regard, (McGruddy: The effect of listening comprehension strategy training with advanced level ESL students (Doctoral dissertation, Georgetown University, Washington DC), unpublished) used a questionnaire {{in order to}} study the impact of strategy instruction on the strategies she taught, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> of predicting, selective attention, and inferencing. She found improvements {{in the use of}} some of the listening strategies taught but not others (Cross, 2009).|$|R
5|$|Unlike C++, C# {{does not}} support {{multiple}} inheritance, although a class can implement any number of interfaces. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface <b>that</b> method <b>is</b> being called through, or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and have <b>that</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.|$|R

25|$|Once Jesus, {{the prophet}} Elijah, and St. George {{were going through}} Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine.

After the shepherd asked his identity Elijah said <b>that,</b> he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at him and told him <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows.
