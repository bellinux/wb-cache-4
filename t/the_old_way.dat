5|$|To the Milanese, Sforza's victory {{now seemed}} certain, {{but he found}} his Venetian allies {{beginning}} to have doubts about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza {{would be far more}} dangerous and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident the war was over and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>way</b> of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege.|$|E

25|$|The {{second wave}} of the Reformation, {{came in the form}} of Anabaptism, that was popular among {{ordinary}} farmers in Holland and Friesland. Anabaptists were socially very radical and equalitarian; they believed that the apocalypse was very near. They refused to live <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>way,</b> and began new communities, creating considerable chaos. A prominent Dutch anabaptist was Menno Simons, who initiated the Mennonite church. The movement was allowed in the north, but never grew to a large scale.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} demolitions was small prior to World War I but had become {{considerable}} by 1955, when one house was demolished every five days. As early as 1944, the trustees of Castle Howard, convinced {{there was no}} future for Britain's great houses, had begun selling the house's contents. Increasing taxation and a shortage of staff were already ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>way</b> of life had ended. The wealth and status of the owner provided no protection to the building as even the more wealthy owners became keen to free themselves of not only {{the expense of a}} large house, but also the trappings of wealth and redundant privilege which the house represented. Thus, it was not just the smaller country houses of the gentry which were wiped from their – often purposefully built – landscapes, but also the huge ducal palaces. Alfred Waterhouse's Gothic Eaton Hall, owned by Britain's wealthiest peer was razed to the ground in 1963, {{to be replaced by a}} smaller modern building. Sixteen years earlier the Duke of Bedford had reduced Woburn Abbey to half its original size, destroying façades and interiors by both Henry Flitcroft and Henry Holland. The Duke of Devonshire saved Hardwick Hall by surrendering it to H.M. Treasury in lieu of death duties, which were charged at the maximum rate of 80% of the total value of an estate, but this solution was rarely acceptable to the government. As late as 1975, the British Labour government refused to save Mentmore, thus causing the dispersal, and emigration, of one of the country's finest art collections.|$|E

Kerrang noted in a live review from Manchester that We Still Kill <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Way</b> and To Hell We Ride were [...] "well received" [...] but that [...] "the surfeit of new material leads to a comparatively muted response". At the end of July though it was announced that the band had cancelled their appearance at Reading and Leeds, whilst still promising to play the three warm-up shows, citing that they wanted the recording of Start Something to take precedence. Ian Watkins said [...] "Unfortunately these shows are at the final stages of making the record and we felt it was more important not to short change anyone." [...] The band did however support Linkin Park at Wembley Arena in London on 22 November 2003 playing eight tracks, including five from the soon to be released new album. Therefore, the band played four dates altogether in 2003.|$|E
