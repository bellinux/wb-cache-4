5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after launch {{and during the}} ascent, flight systems reported problems with a hydrogen tank transducer and a circuit breaker; <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> immediately advised to disregard the resultant alarms and continue to orbit.|$|E
5|$|A popular myth emerged that, {{in order}} for Leigh's scream in the shower to sound realistic, ice-cold water was used. Leigh denied this on {{numerous}} occasions, saying <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> very accommodating, supplying hot water throughout the week-long shoot. All of the screams are Leigh's.|$|E
5|$|After {{about seven}} hours of rest, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> awakened by Houston {{to prepare for}} the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.|$|E

5|$|Of the 50 B-52Bs built, 27 {{were capable}} of {{carrying}} a reconnaissance pod as RB-52Bs (<b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> increased to eight in these aircraft). The 300pound (136kg) pod contained radio receivers, a combination of K-36, K-38, and T-11 cameras, and two operators on downward-firing ejection seats. The pod required only four hours to install.|$|E
50|$|Tim is {{fishing in}} the lake for Graeme's fish farm when a trawler arrives. Tim waves a welcome to <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> and <b>is</b> upset when <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>are</b> unfriendly in return.

5|$|On 17 January 1931, Breguet 280T F-AIVU of Air Union crashed whilst {{attempting}} {{to land at}} Lympne. The aircraft caught the boundary fence and crashed onto the airfield, damaging the forward fuselage and undercarriage.

5|$|On 22 November 1972, a B-52D (55-0110) from U-Tapao {{was hit by}} a {{surface-to-air missile}} (SAM) while on a raid over Vinh. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> forced to abandon the damaged {{aircraft}} over Thailand. This was the first B-52 destroyed by hostile fire. In total, 31 B-52s were lost during the war, which included 10 B-52s shot down over North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had a crew {{of between}} 56 to 60 {{officers}} and 1,613 to 1,780 enlisted men. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> augmented by another 10 officers and 61 men when serving as a squadron flagship. They carried a number of smaller watercraft, including two picket boats, two launches, two barges, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
50|$|Captain Archibald Holkham, who {{had taken}} over as Master, and 31 members of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> picked up by destroyers. Twenty-four of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> lost.

The wreck is designated as a war grave.|$|R

5|$|The Embraer {{started calling}} on the {{emergency}} frequency, 121.5MHz, immediately after the collision, but as it was later determined in the CENIPA report, the emergency transceivers in the area were not operational and thus <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> unable to reach ATC on that frequency.|$|E
5|$|The initial launch attempt, {{scheduled}} for 11 November 1995 at 7:56am EST (12:56UTC) was postponed due to poor weather at the Transatlantic Abort (TAL) site. The original launch window was 6min 57secs and the countdown had begun on schedule. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> on board when the postponement was called at the T-minus 5minute mark at approximately 7:51am EST (12:51UTC).|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks of}} pursuit from 25 May until 17 June placed an {{enormous}} strain on U-853s crew. Twenty-three-year-old Oberleutnant zur See Helmut Frömsdorf took {{command of the}} boat on 18 June (his first command) and returned to Lorient. Sommer {{and a large number}} of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> declared unfit for duty. On 10 July Sommer was formally relieved by Oberleutnant zur See Otto Wermuth.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> {{members of}} <b>the</b> Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.

5|$|Typhoon Sinlaku first {{affected}} Iwo Jima, producing sustained {{winds of}} 131km/h (82mph), with gusts to 183km/h (114mph). Residents {{on the small}} island of Minamidaitojima evacuated their homes to safer areas during the storm. Rainfall caused flooding on the island. Offshore Okinawa, a Philippine cargo ship went missing, prompting a rescue mission by the Japanese Coast Guard. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> rescued a day later, {{and no one was}} injured.|$|E
5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned {{them down on}} the grounds that <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be that young.|$|E

One <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> eliminated halfway through <b>the</b> show. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> received help from three guest ABDC alumni from past seasons. Each alumnus {{was assigned to}} one of the dance styles <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> responsible for.|$|R
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|Agreements between Norwegian and Russian {{authorities}} {{were made on}} 31 August, where Norway resumed full responsibility for the recovery and investigation, but Russian help was accepted. To allow the Russian workers access from the morning of 1 September, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> allowed to fly in and establish a base camp, but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who {{were brought to the}} Governor's offices for questioning. As they were both members of the Russian team, it was decided that the base would be disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the search}} {{recovered}} debris, including lifeboats and rafts, no survivors were found. On her final voyage, Fitzgeralds crew of 29 {{consisted of the}} captain, the first, second and third mates, five engineers, three oilers, a cook, a wiper, two maintenance men, three watchmen, three deckhands, three wheelsmen, two porters, a cadet and a steward. Most of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> from Ohio and Wisconsin; their ages ranged from 20-year-old watchman Karl A. Peckol to Captain McSorley, 63years old and planning his retirement.|$|E

50|$|In British Rowing (UK) races coxes {{are limited}} to their minimum weight. The minimum weights for a cox depend on the gender and age of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> they <b>are</b> coxing. If <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> racing at Junior 15 or younger (J15), then the minimum weight of the cox is 45 kg (99.21 lbs). Crews racing at Junior 16 and above are treated as adult <b>crews</b> for <b>the</b> {{purposes}} of cox minimum weights. If an adult <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> a Women's <b>crew,</b> <b>the</b> minimum weight of the cox is 50 kg (110.23 lbs); if <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> Mixed (usually at least half <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> women) or Open (the ARA only allows the odd exceptional event to be restricted to Men only) then the minimum weight of the cox is 55 kg.
