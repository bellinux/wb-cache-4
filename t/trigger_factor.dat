40|$|Objective: Migraine is a {{recurrent}} primary headache disorder characterized by different clinical presentations. Migraneurs report excessive sensitivity to light, sound, motion, odours, and other sensory stimuli in and between acute migraine attacks. This study was undertaken to document different <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> and {{to evaluate the}} differences in episodic and chronic migraine forms. Headache <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> were questioned in 190 patients. Methods: Headache <b>triggering</b> <b>factors</b> were questioned in 190 patients. A set of questions concerning the <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> were prepared and {{the information about the}} <b>triggering</b> <b>factors</b> was collected by a structured interview. All the patients were administered Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All analyses in this study were performed by NCSS 2007 packet programme.

The headaches with <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> were associated with greater pain intensity (p< 0. 001), headache-related disability (p< 0. 001), abortive medication use (p = 0. 02), and the proportion of migraine (p < 0. 001), relative to those without <b>trigger</b> <b>factors.</b> Traveling (odd ratios [OR]: 6. 4), hormonal changes (OR: 3. 5), noise (OR: 2. 8), alcohol (OR: 2. 5), overeating (OR: 2. 4), and stress (OR: 1. 8) were significantly associated with migraines compared to non-migraine headaches.

Thus, correlations between the concentration of allergen immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies and airway limitation or asthma severity remain unclear. Methods: Five hundred and seventy-nine asthmatic patients were enrolled, and serum specific IgE antibodies to allergens were analyzed. All suspected <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> were assessed by questionnaire, case histories over a 4 -year period, and diary card recordings; possible <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> were then re-evaluated. Results: Antibodies to the following allergens were found: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (59. 8 % of patients), D. microceras (58. 8 %), D. farinae (56. 8 %), cockroach (38. 3 %), dog dander (26. 3 %), Candida albicans (13. 3 %), cat dander (10 %), and Cladosporium herbarum (6. 6 %). A greater prevalence of allergy to dog and cat dander was found than previously. Younger patients were more often positive for mite allergens, and had higher titers of antibodies against such allergens, than older patients. Further, females had a lower concentration of mite allergen antibodies than males. No correlation between the concentration of allergen antibodies and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), or the ratio of FEV 1 :forced vital capacity (FEV 1 :FVC), was found. In addition, {{there was no significant}} change in antibody titers with varying asthma severity. Non-allergenic <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> were irritant air inhalants (94. 6 % of patients), respiratory infection (92. 2 %), exercise (75. 2 %), emotional factors (58. 8 %), drugs and chemical substances (16 %). Conclusion: There are multiple <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> in asthma. Allergenic <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> are more common in younger than older patients, whereas non-allergenic <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> are more common in older patients. There was no linear correlation between the concentration of specific IgE antibodies and asthma severity or airway limitation; therefore, to prevent asthma attacks in individual asthmatic patients, greater attention should be paid to avoiding all potential <b>trigger</b> <b>factors,</b> and not just house dust mite allergens...|$|R

40|$|The <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> of Escherichia coli is a prolyl {{isomerase}} and accelerates proline-limited {{steps in}} protein folding {{with a very}} high efficiency. It associates with nascent polypeptide chains at the ribosome and is thought to catalyse the folding of newly synthesized proteins. In its enzymatic mechanism the <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> follows the Michaelis-Menten equation. The unusually high folding activity of the <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> originates from its tight binding to the folding protein substrate, {{as reflected in the}} low Km value of 0. 7 microM. In contrast, the catalytic constant kcat is small and shows a value of 1. 3 s(- 1) at 15 degrees C. An unfolded protein inhibits the <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> in a competitive fashion.

Furthermore, our NMR relaxation data indicate that the dynamic behavior of the <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> PPIase domain and of FKBP are similar. Structural variations when compared to FKBP exist in the flap region and within the bulges of strand 5 of the P sheet.

40|$|Abstract: Shallow {{landslide}} and debris-flow {{activity in}} Iceland is frequent, often causing significant threats to many {{small towns and}} villages around the island. The main threatened areas {{are located in the}} eastern, central north and northwestern parts of Iceland. The landscape in these areas is characterized by narrow glacially eroded fjords and steep mountain slopes, often covered by debris talus. The <b>triggering</b> <b>factors</b> and threshold conditions for shallow landslides and debris flows vary in these three areas, mainly due to precipitation distribution. In eastern Iceland, shallow landslides and debris flows occur after long-lasting rainfall or intense rainfall. In central northern Iceland, snowmelt is the main <b>triggering</b> <b>factor,</b> then rain-on-snow, and long-lasting rainfall. In the northwestern part of the island long-lasting rainfall and rain-on-snow are the dominant <b>triggering</b> <b>factors.</b> Measurements of the amount of precipitation needed to trigger a shallow landslide or a debris flow has been documented in northwestern, northern and eastern Iceland to define the threshold conditions.
