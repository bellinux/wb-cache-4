5|$|Candice {{made her}} {{on-screen}} {{return on the}} February 18, 2008 episode of Raw, distracting Beth Phoenix during a match with Maria. She returned to in-ring action on March 17, teaming up with Maria to defeat Jillian Hall and Victoria. During the match, Candice injured her left shoulder by <b>tearing</b> <b>the</b> scar tissue over her previously broken left clavicle. Unlike her previous injury, Candice broke her clavicle in four separate places, in essence, shattering it. As a result, Candice was replaced by Ashley for her scheduled match at WrestleMania XXIV. On March 23, Candice underwent successful surgery on her re-broken clavicle.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{a new technique}} of suturing a <b>tear</b> in <b>the</b> anterior capsulorhexis. Methods: Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) with lens removal was done in five fresh cadaver eyes. The diameter of the CCC was measured with a calliper. Using the same calliper a <b>tear</b> of <b>the</b> CCC was created while opening the calliper’s arms. The distance between the calliper’s arms needed to <b>tear</b> <b>the</b> CCC was documented. Using 9 - 0 Ethilon 9011, CS 160 - 6 sutures in two eyes, 9 - 0 Prolene, D- 8229, CTC- 6 L sutures in two eyes, and 10 - 0 Prolene, 9090, CTC- 6 suture in one eye, <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> were sutured. A <b>tear</b> in <b>the</b> CCC was created again {{in the same way}} as <b>the</b> first <b>tear.</b> <b>The</b> distance between the calliper’s arms needed to <b>tear</b> <b>the</b> CCC was documented again. Results: Suturing of <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> restored some of the strength...|$|R

5|$|Early in the season, Bure {{sustained}} {{the first of}} several serious knee injuries during his career. On November 9, 1995, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bure was grabbed around the head by defenceman Steve Smith while approaching the end boards. Falling to the ice, he caught his skate against the boards, <b>tearing</b> <b>the</b> anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. Requiring arthroscopic surgery, in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|He started 2017 {{season with}} his fourth win in All England Open. He nearly {{missed out on}} the tournament after <b>tearing</b> <b>the</b> medial {{collateral}} ligament during a training session at the new Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM), this caused his feud with technical director Morten Frost, as Frost was not receptive to his complaint, asking for the slippery mats to be replaced. Lee lost to Lin Dan for two consecutive tournaments, {{the first in the}} final of Malaysia Open, and the second in semifinals of Badminton Asia Championships.|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), <b>tearing</b> <b>the</b> funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E

5|$|Minor {{damage was}} {{reported}} in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the Hudson River, the tornado entered Westchester County, where {{the worst of the}} damage took place. It struck the town of Sleepy Hollow, damaging roofs and <b>tearing</b> <b>the</b> siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10-foot (3m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of Pocantico Hills was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off. After a tornado warning was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 20:00, the {{trailing}} Swiftsure and Alexander, joined by Leander, attacked the French centre, causing severe damage to Franklin and killing Admiral Brueys on his quarterdeck with a cannon shot. At 21:00, a {{fire broke out}} in Orients stern, the blaze spread further by volleys from Swiftsure that also defeated efforts to extinguish it. The flames spread rapidly, racing up the masts and across the decks until the entire flagship was a blazing wreck. At 22:00, the vast magazines detonated, <b>tearing</b> <b>the</b> ship apart and hurling burning wreckage onto the neighbouring vessels. For ten minutes not a shot was fired, as the nearest ships battled to extinguish fires and the further ones paused in shock. The first ship to recommence hostilities was Franklin, but Admiral Blanquet's heavily outnumbered flagship was forced to surrender by 24:00. Tonnant, the only French ship still engaged, fought on against Majestic until 03:00, when the mortally wounded Captain Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars succeeded in dragging his ship to the temporary safety of the rear division under Rear-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve.|$|E
5|$|The Lucera, {{trying the}} same evasive tactic, {{was the next}} galley attacked; a Dutch galleot, which drove under full sail managed to ram her. The galley was struck between the {{mainmast}} and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's own bowsprit, but in return completely demolished {{the stern of the}} galley. Vice-Admiral Cant came up once more in the Half-moon, and finished Lucera (Morning Star) off by ramming, <b>tearing</b> <b>the</b> galley apart. Meanwhile, Victory and two States' galleots were chasing two galleys; San Juan and Jacinto who were already in a sinking state. With nowhere to escape and the gale blowing against them, the only option was for the respective commanders to run them aground near Nieuwpoort. In the end, both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of Niewpoort. Another galley managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near Calais. The galley San Luis, which bore Spinola himself and his thirty-six pay chests, attempted to reach Dunkirk, but as the tide was low, she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank. Ten Dutch ships fell upon San Luis, but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk. With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola's escape.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, saber-toothed cats {{have been}} artistically {{restored}} with external features {{similar to those}} of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G.J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without <b>tearing</b> <b>the</b> facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Antón and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 2001–02 season, Baggio scored eight goals {{in the first nine}} matches, leading him {{to the top of the}} Serie A goalscoring table. In his eighth league {{appearance}} of the season, against Piacenza, Baggio scored a goal but later suffered an injury. A week later, against Venezia, he scored from a penalty, but he endured a more serious injury following a hard challenge which caused him to tear the ACL of his left knee, keeping him out of action for four months. He suffered a second serious injury that season, <b>tearing</b> <b>the</b> meniscus in his left knee, after returning to the team, and coming off the bench, in the Coppa Italia semi-final against Parma on 31 January 2002. He was operated on 4 February 2002 and he returned for three matches before the end of the season, making a recovery in 76 days. On 21 April 2002, in the first game after his comeback, Baggio came on as a substitute to score two goals against Fiorentina, helping Brescia win the match. He scored again against Bologna, saving Brescia from relegation on the final matchday, and bringing his seasonal tally to 11 goals in 12 Serie A matches. Despite Baggio's performances, Italy national team head coach Giovanni Trapattoni did not deem him fully fit, prompting Trapattoni to leave Baggio out of the final squad for the 2002 World Cup. Trapattoni also expressed concern about bringing Baggio to the World Cup due to the presence of Francesco Totti and Alessandro Del Piero in his role, believing that this could create a rivalry between the players. After missing out on the tournament, Baggio reversed his initial decision to retire after the World Cup, expressing his intention to surpass the 200 Serie A goal mark.|$|E
