5|$|The border clearers' {{task was}} aided unofficially by German civilians {{from both sides}} of the former border, who {{scavenged}} the installations for fencing, wire and blocks of concrete to use in home improvements. Much of the fence was sold to a West German scrap-metal company. Environmental groups undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing grass seed <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear-cut area along the line.|$|E
5|$|A roadway {{was present}} along parts of today's H-58 {{by the late}} 1920s; initially, this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston Corners and {{connected}} with other roads to Grand Marais. In the 1930s, another segment was built to connect to Deer Park and <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gap between Kingston Corners and Grand Marais. The southwestern segment between Munising and Van Meer formed part of M-94 from 1929 until it was transferred back to county control in the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> space {{on either side of}} implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{generally}} finished life studies {{during three}} evenings sittings. On the first evening he would sketch {{the model in}} charcoal or chalk, and then ink in the outline. On the second he used oil paints <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> figures. On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings of paint. He usually painted on millboard, re-using the reverse for fresh paintings. His female models were typically shop-girls, prostitutes, actresses or poses plastiques models, while his male models tended to be Life Guards recruited from the nearby barracks, who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique, or occasionally men Etty met in public bath houses.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sinkhole's collapse, there were plans {{to fill it}} in with a soil cement made from cement, limestone, and water known locally as lodocreto ("mudcrete"). This {{substance}} was also used <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole. However, another technique, which geologists call the graded-filter technique, in which the sinkhole is filled with successive layers of boulders, smaller rocks, and gravel, could possibly be a better solution. This is because filling the hole in with cement diverts water runoff to other areas, potentially increasing the risk of sinkholes occurring {{in other parts of}} the city. The graded-filter technique, on the other hand, allows water to seep through.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Pollack’s career {{led into}} politics. A summer {{internship}} with the American Jewish Congress prompted a one-year role with the AJC. He {{worked as a}} lobbyist on legislation that would permit religious headwear for active military personal in noncombat settings. Pollack then relocated to Los Angeles to work for Winner & Associates, a leading political public relations firm. He was assigned to consult the Major Baseball League during the labor strife in the early-1990s. The inception of Pollack’s career in sports business occurred in 1992 when he realized—while flying from LA to New York—that there was a niche <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|Once {{production}} began {{it became}} apparent that Part One and Part Two were under-running so more dialogue was written <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time. It was originally intended that the character of Jackson would not reappear after the second episode, but during filming Saward became concerned that it appeared that he had been executed and so he and Clegg rewrote Part Three to include him. Part Three also looked to be under running so scenes from Part Four were brought forward and the final scenes with the Guardians were extended to compensate.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 season {{would inevitably}} {{be a new}} era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence {{and the loss of}} 6th-man Lorin Dixon left {{significant}} holes <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|E

5|$|While Burrows' {{offensive}} numbers {{increased from}} {{playing on the}} top line, the Sedins' mutually benefitted from playing with him. Daniel and Henrik {{had not had a}} constant linemate on the first line since Anson Carter played with them in 2005–06. Since then, Vigneault had used a variety of wingers, including Markus Naslund, Taylor Pyatt and Steve Bernier, <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unit. In those years, Daniel and Henrik were point-a-game players; with Burrows on their line, they vaulted into top scorers in the league, as Henrik won the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading point-getter (Daniel scored at a similar pace, but played less due to an injury).|$|E
5|$|A railway from Grantham to Sleaford {{opened in}} 1857. This was {{extended}} to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from £981 in 1858 to £168 in 1868, and the share price dropped from £40 to £10 between 1860 and 1863. The company was trading at a loss by 1871, and although an Act of Abandonment was obtained on 17 June 1878, the navigation did not actually close until 14 May 1881, which was also {{the date of the}} final meeting of the proprietors. The Act required the company <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were special provisions for the remaining structures. The next three were on a stretch of river bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct sluices if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was to be handed over to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and fill in the lock if they chose to do so.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Patrick Vieira to Juventus, Fàbregas was given the Frenchman's number 4 shirt and featured regularly in the Arsenal central midfield alongside Gilberto Silva. He made 49 appearances in all competitions during the 2005–06 season. Despite his young age, his performances came under greater scrutiny due to his increased involvement in the first team. Further, as Fàbregas possessed a smaller frame and played with less aggression than Vieira, there were initially doubts over his ability <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> void left by the Frenchman. Nevertheless, Fàbregas asserted his own style of play and impressed pundits in the Champions League against Real Madrid and Juventus. In the latter, he scored Arsenal's first goal and set up Thierry Henry for the second, {{at the same time}} proving that he could compete against tough, hard-tackling midfielders like Vieira. He then played in the Final against his former club Barcelona, but Arsenal were defeated 2–1, completing a trophyless 2005–06 campaign for Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{contacted}} Chien-Shiung Wu, {{who identified}} {{the cause of}} the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, {{which turned out to be}} 30,000 times that of uranium. Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium. Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|Leslie is {{convinced}} she can reason with Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy will not return her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, and she thinks of a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on. The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} in rural environments {{made use of}} local materials and styles. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of turf <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls, sometimes on a stone base, {{but they were not}} long lasting and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most}} expensive VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the wig after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1988), {{though not}} a {{judicial}} review application, illustrates how a decision-maker acts incorrectly if it fails {{to take into account}} relevant considerations. The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant, an auditor, guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33(1)(b) of the Accountants Act because an incomplete auditor's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years. The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision. The Court concurred, holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him how <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of it. Therefore, this was not a case of an accountant recklessly signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor. Accordingly, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee's order.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E
