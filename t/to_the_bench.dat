5|$|Prior to Kentucky's December 15 matchup against Chattanooga, Pitino {{publicly}} contemplated starting Farmer {{in place}} of Sean Woods at point and either Carlos Toomer or Jody Thompson at shooting guard instead of Brassow. The day of the game, he announced Farmer would make the second start of his career at shooting guard alongside Woods at point. Although he tied with Pelphrey for a team-high 17 points, Farmer returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> for the following game against Indiana because Pitino felt he didn't have the size to defend the Hoosiers' bigger guards.|$|E
5|$|Recurring {{injuries}} between 2001 and 2003 {{continued to}} disrupt Berger's career and deprived {{him of a}} presence in the first team, resulting in his decision to leave Liverpool after the expiration of his contract following the conclusion of the 2002–03 season. Berger had been confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> for the duration of his final season when selected, limiting him to four appearances. He left Liverpool, having scored 35 goals during his seven seasons with the club.|$|E

5|$|With {{the summer}} signing of Danny Collins, Higginbotham was dropped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> before regaining {{his place in}} the team, mainly being {{utilised}} in his more natural position in the centre of defence, and scored the first goal in a 3–0 win over Blackburn Rovers on 8 February 2010.

5|$|Coming {{into the}} match, the Kerala Blasters {{made a couple}} {{necessary}} defensive changes from the squad that faced Chennaiyin in the semi-finals. David James replaced the injured Sandip Nandy in goal, while Saumik Dey and Nirmal Chettri replaced the suspended pair of Jamie McAllister and Gurwinder Singh {{in the middle of}} defense. Atlético de Kolkata head coach, Antonio Lopez Habas, meanwhile decided to bench the team's marquee player, Luis García, and instead started Arnal in central midfield. Habas also decided to switch to playing four defenders instead of three, which meant that Kingshuk Debnath started the match while Lester Fernandez moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b>|$|E

5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's sinking fund, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
5|$|In July 1984, he {{was signed}} by Mick Buxton at Second Division Huddersfield Town. The move reunited him with Paul Jones, his former centre-half partner at Bolton. Huddersfield {{finished}} in 13th place in the 1984–85 season, {{and at the end}} of the campaign accepted an offer of £15,000 from Bolton Wanderers, who offered Allardyce a three-year contract. Bolton were then managed by Charlie Wright, who was the goalkeeper at Allardyce's first spell with the club. However Wright was sacked in December 1985, and his successor, Phil Neal, did not get along with Allardyce. Neal played himself at centre-half and relegated Allardyce <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench,</b> despite Neal being a full-back. Bolton reached the 1986 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium, which ended in a 3–0 defeat to Bristol City, with Allardyce as an unused substitute.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May 2006, Eriksson named Carrick in a 23-man {{provisional}} squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, eventually {{being named}} in the final 23-man squad for the tournament in Germany. He was an unused substitute for all three of England's Group B games as they advanced to the knockout stage. Carrick played just one game in the tournament, a 1–0 victory {{in the second round}} match against Ecuador on 25 June. The next game he was dropped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> for the quarter-final tie against Portugal, with Owen Hargreaves replacing him. The game ended goalless after extra time, Portugal won 3–1 in the subsequent penalty shootout and knocked England out of the World Cup.|$|E

60|$|It was a tidy room, but {{it seemed}} very small when they ranged <b>the</b> <b>benches,</b> and opened <b>the</b> door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seven-and-twenty children, and the four or five women who stood waiting.

5|$|On December 12 the Dukes faced {{off against}} another local rival, Robert Morris. In a 59–54win, B.J. Monteiro again {{led the team}} with 17points. Monteiro's {{continued}} high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, to wonder whether the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench,</b> or if someone else would lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.|$|E
5|$|The Devils {{struggled}} {{early in}} the 2005–06 season, ending the 2005 calendar year with a 16–18–5 record. Robinson resigned as head coach on December 19, and Lamoriello moved down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> Once Elias returned from his bout with hepatitis, the team quickly turned around, finishing 46–27–9 after a season-ending 11-game winning streak capped with a 4–3 win over the Montreal Canadiens. During that final victory, which clinched the Devils' sixth division title, Brian Gionta set a new team record for goals in a season with 48, topping Pat Verbeek's 46. The win streak to close the year was also an NHL record. The Devils won their first round Stanley Cup playoff series against the Rangers four games to none, but were eliminated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the next round.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family to go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they {{agree that it is}} better to watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E
