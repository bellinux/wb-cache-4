Since GNOME 3.2 multiseat support has been only available on systems using systemd. In November 2012 the GNOME release team concluded that systemd can be relied upon for non-basic functionality.|$|E

Leslie is appalled when he learns that the humans do not lay eggs. Nancy explains human gestation {{and that they have}} three children.|$|E

25|$|Criticisms of the {{suggestion}} range from treating the {{passage in the}} way it was written by Zosimus and ignoring {{the suggestion}}, to simply noting its speculative nature, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> problems with the suggestion (e.g., 'why would Honorius write to the cities of the Bruttii rather than to his own provincial governor for that region?', and 'why does far-off southern Italy belong in a passage about northern Italy any more than far-off Britain?'). The theory also contradicts the account of Gildas, who provides independent support that the reference is to Britain by repeating the essence of Zosimus' account and clearly applying it to Britain.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Mariátegui became {{alienated from}} the APRA, and he set about {{establishing}} the Socialist Party, which formally constituted in October of that year, with Mariátegui as general secretary (it later became the Communist Party of Peru). That year, he published his best-known work, Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality, in which he examined Peru's social and economic situation from a Marxist perspective. It {{was considered one of}} the first materialist analyses of a Latin American society. Beginning with the country’s economic history, the book proceeds <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the “Indian problem", which Mariátegui locates firmly within the “land problem”.

25|$|When {{a new set}} {{of county}} commissioners decided to remove the display cases, the local American Legion post then {{displayed}} Brostrom's Medal of Honor. In time, local veterans dwindled and the Legion Hall was taken over by the County. The last commander of the Preston American Legion Chapter in Preston then took Brostrom's display home for safe keeping. By this time, all of Brostrom's family had died except for a niece, who did not want the Medal of Honor display, citing that she {{would not be able to}} preserve it properly. A local lawyer, Jay MacKenzie, was asked to keep the display safe in his office. The medal sat there until a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, Sherman L. Fleek, who was then the command historian for the United States Military Academy at West Point and doing research on Pfc. Brostrom's life, called MacKenzie. This eventually led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> how to properly honor Brostrom and display his Medal of Honor. Since Brostrom had been a lifetime member of the LDS Church, the Church History Library was contacted and agreed to preserve and display the medal there.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{have written}} that Starship Troopers is not driven by its plot, though it {{contains}} scenes of military combat. Instead, {{much of the}} novel is given over <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> ideas. In particular, the discussion of political views is a recurring feature of what scholar Jeffrey Cass described as an [...] "ideologically intense" [...] book. A 1997 review in Salon categorized it as a [...] "philosophical novel". Critics have debated to what extent the novel promotes Heinlein's own political views. While some have stated that the novel maintains a sense of irony that allows the reader to draw their own conclusions, others have argued that Heinlein is sermonizing throughout the book, and that its purpose was to expound Heinlein's militaristic philosophy.|$|E
500|$|The {{work also}} depicts the devastation that the Anarchy caused during King Stephen's reign. The chronicler states that {{failure of the}} harvest and pillaging caused a famine. The work {{describes}} {{the area around the}} abbey for [...] as being filled with unburied corpses, and that the price of a bushel of grain rose to 200pence. The long descriptions of Nigel of Ely's disputes with King Stephen lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the Battle of Lincoln and other matters not directly related to Ely. The Liber gives a detailed account of Nigel's career, although in general the chronicle's author favours Stephen over his own bishop. The ascension of King Henry II to the English throne is considered to be an excellent event, and the Liber praises the new king.|$|E
500|$|Describing Lethbridge as [...] "one of {{the most}} compelling" [...] figures in 20th-century British archaeology, Finneran {{believed}} that {{at the start of}} the 21st century, Lethbridge was best known for his advocacy of dowsing. As such, Finneran asserted that Lethbridge's [...] "true legacy" [...] lay outside of [...] "conventional archaeology", and could instead be located within the Earth mysteries movement. Lethbridge's work continued to attract interest from parapsychologists after his death. The author [...] M.B. Devot drew heavily on Ghost and Ghoul in his Spirits of Field and Hearth. In 1978, the author Colin Wilson devoted part one of his book Mysteries <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> Lethbridge's ideas. In 2003, a group of admirers of his work calling themselves [...] "The Sons of T.C.

500|$|Early {{reviews of}} [...] "To Autumn" [...] focused {{on it as}} part of Keats's {{collection}} of poems Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. An anonymous critic in the July 1820 Monthly Review claimed, [...] "this writer is very rich both in imagination and fancy; and even a superabundance of the latter faculty is displayed in his lines 'On Autumn,' which bring the reality of nature more before our eyes than almost any description that we remember. [...] If we did not fear that, young as is Mr K., his peculiarities are fixed beyond all the power of criticism to remove, we would exhort him to become somewhat less strikingly original,—to be less fond of the folly of too new or too old phrases,—and to believe that poetry does not consist in either the one or the other." [...] Josiah Conder in the September 1820 Eclectic Review mentioned, [...] "One naturally turns first to the shorter pieces, in order to taste the flavour of the poetry. The following ode to Autumn is no unfavourable specimen." [...] An anonymous reviewer in The Edinburgh Magazine for October 1820 added <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> some of Keats's longer poems the afterthought that [...] "The ode to 'Fancy,' and the ode to 'Autumn,' also have great merit." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 1802, Francis Jeffrey, {{editor of}} the Edinburgh Review, {{submitted}} a review on Thalaba. In the October 1802 edition, he claimed that Southey [...] "belongs to a sect of poets, that has established itself in this country within these ten or twelve years, and is looked upon, we believe, {{as one of its}} chief champions and apostles... As Mr Southey is the first author, of this persuasion, that has yet been brought before us for judgment, we cannot discharge our inquisitorial office conscientiously, without premising a few words upon the nature and tendency of the tenets he has helped to promulgate. The disciples of this school boast much of its originality." [...] This led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> Southey's flaws: [...] "Originality, however, we are persuaded, is rare than mere alteration... That our new poets have abandoned the old models, may certainly be admitted; but {{we have not been able}} to discover that they have yet created any model of their own." [...] He continued to discuss the flaws of the British Romantic poets before returning to Thalaba when he argued, [...] "The subject of this poem is almost as ill chosen as the diction; and the conduct of the fable as disorderly as the versification... From this little sketch of the story, our readers will easily perceive, that it consists altogether of the most wild and extravagant fictions, and openly sets nature and probability at defiance. In its action it is not an imitation of anything; and excludes all rational criticism, as to the choice and succession of its incidents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some reviewers {{have criticized}} Munich {{for what they}} call the film's equating the Israeli assassins with [...] "terrorists". Leon Wieseltier wrote in The New Republic, [...] "...
