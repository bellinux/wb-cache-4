2500|$|For most {{of their}} history Christians have {{calculated}} Easter independently of the Jewish calendar. In principle, Easter falls on the Sunday following the full moon that follows the northern spring equinox (the paschal full moon). However, the vernal equinox and the full moon are not determined by astronomical observation. The vernal equinox is fixed to fall on 21 March (previously it varied in different areas and in some areas Easter was allowed to fall before the equinox). The full moon is an ecclesiastical full moon determined by reference to a lunar calendar, which again varied in different areas. While Easter now falls at the earliest on the 15th of the lunar month and at <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 21st, in some areas it used to fall at the earliest on the 14th (the day of the paschal full moon) and at <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 20th, or between the sixteenth and the 22nd. The last limit arises {{from the fact that}} the crucifixion was considered to have happened on the 14th (the eve of the Passover) and the resurrection therefore on the sixteenth. The [...] "computus" [...] is the procedure of determining the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon falling on or after 21 March, and the difficulty arose from doing this over the span of centuries without accurate means of measuring the precise tropical year. The synodic month had already been measured to a high degree of accuracy. The schematic model that eventually was accepted is the Metonic cycle, which equates 19 tropical years to 235 synodic months.|$|E
