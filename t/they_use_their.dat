5|$|Arboreal carton nests of {{mangrove}} swamp-dwelling Nasutitermes are {{enriched in}} lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans. This change {{is caused by}} bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> faeces as a carton building material. Arboreal termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems and branches of mangrove trees, namely, Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemose (white mangrove).|$|E
5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} increase with increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and {{may be more likely}} to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E

5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered {{a terrified}} Hilarion. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> magic {{to force him}} to dance until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then they turn on Albrecht, {{sentencing}} him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle's pleas are also dismissed and Albrecht is forced to dance until sunrise. However, the power of Giselle's love counters the Wilis' magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through the chains of hatred and vengeance that control the Wilis, and is thus released from their powers. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, Giselle returns to her grave to rest in peace.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> sharp incisors to gnaw food, {{excavate}} burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They {{tend to be}} social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.|$|E

5|$|Sponge flies, {{also known}} as spongilla-flies (Neuroptera, Sisyridae), are {{specialist}} predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water.

The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of Supernatural, an American fantasy horror {{television}} series created by Eric Kripke, premiered on September 28, 2006, and concluded on May 17, 2007, airing 22episodes. The season focuses on protagonists Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) as they track down Azazel, the demon {{responsible for the}} deaths of their mother Mary and father John. They attempt to discover the demon's plan for Sam and other psychic children—young adults who were visited by Azazel as infants and given abilities, and whose mothers often then died in a fire.

5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts {{they are able to}} spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for {{an equal amount of}} time.|$|E

5|$|More than 100 insect species prey on H. zea, usually {{feeding on}} eggs and larvae. The {{insidious}} flower bug (Orius insidiosus), a pirate bug, feeds on the eggs of H. zea, thus {{acting as a}} biological control agent. Some plants emit a blend of chemicals in response to damage from H. zea, which attract parasitic insects. Cardiochiles nigriceps, a solitary endoparasitoid wasp, makes use of these volatile plant compounds to identify the presence of H. zea. When the wasps find damaged host plants, they hover around and then search for the host with their antennae. When the females find their prey, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> antennae to position themselves and deposit eggs into the host. The braconid wasp Microplitis croceipes, which deposits its eggs inside a living caterpillar, {{is also an important}} parasitoid of both H. zea and the related species Heliothis virescens. When larval densities are high, a fungal pathogen, Nomuraea rileyi, can cause an outbreak of disease. However, pupal mortality is high not because of predators, but because of harsh weather conditions, collapsing pupal chambers, and disease.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E
5|$|The final {{episode of}} the game sees Aldaris and the Protoss {{government}} branding Tassadar a traitor and a heretic for conspiring with the dark templar. The player (later hinted to be Artanis) initially serves Aldaris in defending Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but while {{on a mission to}} arrest Tassadar, the player joins him instead. A Protoss civil war erupts, pitting Tassadar, Zeratul, and their allies against the Protoss establishment. The dark templar prove their worth when <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> energies to slay two more of the Zerg cerebrates on Aiur, and the Conclave reconciles with them. Aided by Raynor's forces—who sided with Tassadar back on Char—the Protoss break through the Overmind's weakened defenses and destroy the Overmind's outer shell, but take heavy casualties in the process. Tassadar channels his own psionic energies in combination with those of the dark templar through the hull of his command ship and crashes it into the Overmind, sacrificing himself in order to destroy it.|$|E

5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E
