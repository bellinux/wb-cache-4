500|$|After {{recovering}} from the injury, Urlacher stated, [...] "I feel more powerful. I’m running to the football, my keys {{are a lot more}} clear now, and I’m playing downhill... So I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> help my body kind of calm down and relax a little bit.

500|$|On October 14, Specter {{reported}} he {{had raised}} $1.8 {{million during the}} previous three-month period, bringing his total to about $8.7 million. The Senator {{said that he was}} aided in large part by his September 15 fundraiser hosted by Obama. In that same period, Sestak raised only $758,000, about a quarter million dollars lower than the previous quarter, making his total allocation about $4.7 million. Sestak continued working hard to overcome his name recognition problem, seldom turning down interview requests and asking his staff to work six 12-hour days a week. As a result, Sestak saw a large amount of turnover in his staff, going through nearly half a dozen press secretaries and several chiefs of staff. Sestak called on Specter participate in six debates, one for each media market in Pennsylvania, but Specter only agreed to participate in one because that was the amount of debates he participated in as a Republican. On December 7, Sestak was endorsed by Congressman Barney Frank, who said that he was impressed by Sestak's leadership on economic and military issues, as well as his positions against the military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy and the Defense of Marriage Act. The endorsement was important to Sestak {{because it was the first}} time a prominent member of Congress broke with the Democratic establishment to back him over Specter. Frank also said of Specter's switching parties, [...] "I have to say I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> our profession any good for someone to announce that he switched parties purely so he could survive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fleetwood himself later {{remarked on}} the growing stature of Green's difficulties: [...] "I think there is {{certainly}} some credence given {{to the idea that}} Peter's condition could in some way be blamed on a bad acid trip he had in Germany... I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> him much good." [...] He also recalled in 1995 that [...] "Peter basically ceased to see the light with Fleetwood Mac and had aspirations of playing for nothing in strange places—none of which really happened. He made several interesting albums after he left, then basically took a left turn in terms of his psyche. He pulled out of the mainstream and chose to stay at home. He doesn't play much anymore, which is certainly a shame, because he's my mentor, and he's the reason that Fleetwood Mac became what we became." ...|$|E

60|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{him some}} good. When {{he got back}} {{he took a long}} draught of home-brewed beer, and then went up-stairs to dress himself.|$|E

5000|$|DSM {{researcher}} Eric Hollander {{was quoted}} as saying “I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> represent a lack of interest and faith on behalf of NIMH for the DSM process and an investment in alternative diagnostic systems.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knowd you would, but I couldn't help it. Billy, the editor, {{got hold}} of me and pumped the whole story out of me before I knew <b>it.</b> I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> you any harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is looking}} better to-day; she has looked very worn and harassed, but I thought her {{brighter}} to-day. She walked over by Aubrey on his pony, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> her good." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> good. Anyhow, {{after that}} he used to grin when I opened the door, instead of {{greeting}} me as formerly with a face the picture of despair. But to return to our inexperienced friend.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I do {{not think}} he is,' said Constance; 'it {{seems to me that}} Stanhope leads him into that betting, and makes him <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not signify whether he passes or not, and so he does not take pains.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{while your}} {{difficulty}} is that the peat comes down too fast, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not go fast enough. You are afraid about your horses, but you needn't use them. The stone-boats would run down alone. Do you understand now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But what do I mean by that? That {{ought to}} depend on what Moses meant by it. Moses meant what God meant, and unless I mean the same thing I must mean {{something}} wrong. And this is what I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> mean: ...|$|R
6000|$|The Professor {{clasped his}} hands {{on the top of his}} head, and groaned. [...] "Go? I should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> go! Why, it's gone?

6000|$|... "Well, my {{object in}} that, was, almost entirely, to persuade you to reform, {{without having to}} speak to you directly. I thought it would be pleasanter to you to be {{reminded}} of your duty in that way. But I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> you much good. Did it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did.</b> The {{last time}} you drove in to the settlement, your waggon was {{standing}} probably {{four or five hours}} behind the Occidental. I think I'd try to find out if anybody borrowed one of Porter's spanners when I went in again. How long was it after you threw Jasper out, when you drove away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jake, who lighted a cigarette, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does.</b> In fact, as I {{know your}} {{capabilities}} {{and begin to}} see what you're getting after, there's not much use in my trying to put you off the track." ...|$|R
5000|$|Headey played Queen Gorgo in Zack Snyder's 300. Headey {{had to do}} nude {{scenes in}} the film.

[...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was necessary because we only get that scene to establish their relationship.

5000|$|Historian Judith Binney called {{herself a}} Pākehā and said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{is the most}} simple and {{practical}} term. It is a name given to us by Māori.

60|$|Poppy didn't die, {{though she}} got all ready for it; and felt rather {{disappointed}} when the foot healed, the jaws remained as active as ever, and the fits didn't come.

6000|$|... 'It {{has been}} blessed to you,' said Albinia, affectionately. 'My dear, we always thought your {{character}} one that wanted the softening of such--an attachment. Perhaps {{that made me}} wrongly eager for it, and ready to imagine where I ought not; I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> soften you; {{but if you had}} not conquered what was earthly and exaggerated in it, how it would be hardening and poisoning you now!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Work! By Jove, I should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did.</b> Chaps who {{previously}} couldn't {{get through the}} day without making some wretched kid's life not worth living used to go about as nervous as cats, looking over their shoulders every other second. There was one man in particular, a chap called Leigh. He was hauled out of bed one night, blindfolded, and ducked in a cold bath. He was in the School House." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have already}} written {{to them at}} Silverbridge and have had three or four answers. Mr. De Boung says that the borough is more than grateful.

6000|$|... "No," [...] and Jefferson smiled grimly, [...] "I don't quite <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does.</b> The {{point is}} that you feel {{yourself}} responsible to them, though I don't see why you should. A man has to take his chances when he makes a bargain of the kind they did." ...|$|R
2500|$|Searle argues that, without [...] "understanding" [...] (or [...] "intentionality"), {{we cannot}} {{describe}} what {{the machine is}} doing as [...] "thinking" [...] and, since <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have a [...] "mind" [...] in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that [...] "strong AI" [...] is false.|$|R

[...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did.</b> At least, not as {{he meant}} it to, though I've been trying to worry out what he did mean exactly. One thing's certain. He wasn't {{prompted}} by any solicitude for our safety. You see, {{he might have been}} counting on my distrust of him, or my usual obstinacy, and wanted me to take the higher road after all. Or he may have been playing another game. I don't know. That's why we'll take the nearest way and not worry. When you're in doubt, it's generally wisest to do the obvious thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|I will be honest--and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did.</b> I felt {{a sudden}} warmth towards that {{beautiful}} Miss Grant, that she should stoop to so much interest in my affairs. The summoning up of Catriona moved me of itself to milder and more cowardly counsels. If the Advocate knew of her and of our acquaintance--if I should please him by some of that [...] "discretion" [...] at which his letter pointed--to what might not this lead? In vain is the net spread {{in the sight of}} any fowl, the scripture says. Well, fowls must be wiser than folk! For I thought I perceived the policy, and yet fell in with it.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have got}} so far east, now--a hundred and fifty-five degrees of {{longitude}} from San Francisco--that my watch can not [...] "keep the hang" [...] {{of the time}} any more. It has grown discouraged, and stopped. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> a wise thing. The difference in time between Sebastopol and the Pacific coast is enormous. When it is six {{o'clock in the morning}} here, it is somewhere about week before last in California. We are excusable for getting a little tangled as to time. These distractions and distresses about the time have worried me so much that I was afraid my mind was so much affected that I never would have any appreciation of time again; but when I noticed how handy I was yet about comprehending when it was dinner-time, a blessed tranquillity settled down upon me, and I am tortured with doubts and fears no more.|$|E
60|$|Queen. Have I {{deposited}} within thy breast The dearest {{treasure of}} my life, my glory, And hast thou thus betrayed me!

6000|$|... "DEAR MR. MANNING,--I {{find it very}} {{difficult}} to answer your letter.
