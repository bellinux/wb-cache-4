5|$|<b>The</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland, {{or simply}} <b>the</b> <b>thyroid,</b> is an {{endocrine}} gland in the neck, {{consisting of two}} lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found {{at the front of}} the neck, below the Adam's apple. <b>The</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. The hormones also have many other effects including those on development. <b>The</b> <b>thyroid</b> hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are created from iodine and tyrosine. <b>The</b> <b>thyroid</b> also produces the hormone calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>thyroid</b> ima artery {{was first}} defined by German anatomist Johann E. Neubauer {{in the year}} 1772. Hence, it was named <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> artery of Neubauer. The artery {{originates}} lower than the inferior thyroid arteries, so it {{is also known as}} the lowest thyroid artery.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>thyroid</b> is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying <b>the</b> <b>thyroid,</b> and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland.|$|E

30|$|Twenty-one female BALB/c nude mice aged 6 {{months were}} divided into six groups and weighed. The mice in five groups were {{intravenously}} injected in the tail vein with 0.064, 0.64, 1.8, 14, and 42 kBq 211 At diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7). The sixth group was used as controls and treated with an empty syringe. The animals were killed after 24 h by cardiac puncture under anesthesia with pentobarbitalnatrium. <b>The</b> <b>thyroids</b> were collected, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C until analysis. The absorbed doses delivered to <b>the</b> <b>thyroids</b> were 0.05, 0.5, 1.4, 11, and 32 Gy during 24 h.|$|R
25|$|The common carotid usually {{gives off}} no branch {{previous}} to its bifurcation, but it occasionally gives origin to <b>the</b> superior <b>thyroid</b> artery or its laryngeal branch, the ascending pharyngeal artery, <b>the</b> inferior <b>thyroid</b> artery, or, more rarely, the vertebral artery.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>thyroid</b> sits {{near the}} front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. <b>The</b> <b>thyroid</b> {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. <b>The</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> to move up and down with swallowing. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, at the back of <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> lobes.|$|E
5|$|When present, <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> ima's chief {{supply is}} <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland, though it also {{supplies}} the trachea. The artery may extend and supply the parathyroid glands. An infrequently observed artery, {{it is more}} frequently reported {{in the context of}} enlarged parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenomas). The artery ends by supplying <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland, or the parathyroid glands, as a single unit or as multiple branches. The artery is also found to be the only supply of the parathyroid gland in rare cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
40|$|Histometric {{measurements}} {{were made on}} individual nodules and <b>the</b> internodular <b>thyroid</b> on glands from 15 patients without evidence of endocrine thyroid disease: some of <b>the</b> <b>thyroids</b> had multiple nodules. Measurements of <b>the</b> surviving internodular <b>thyroid</b> tissue showed that the various components were each within the normal range for thyroids from patients with no evidence of thyroid disease, but there were considerable deviations within a few glands in the colloid:epithelium ratio that were associated with histological appearances of dilated or collapsed acini. The interpretation of these appearances presented difficulties, but {{it was concluded that}} the balance of evidence favoured the inference that the internodular part of the gland was under physiological growth control at the time of study. The nodules varied in size: most contained proportionately less epithelium and more colloid than <b>the</b> internodular <b>thyroid.</b> It was concluded that the nodules were unlikely to be secreting autonomously in these patients...|$|R

5|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal thyroid. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, expressed in the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates {{the various}} radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis {{may have occurred}} insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's {{is more common in}} females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E

5|$|In larval lampreys, <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones {{into the}} gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of <b>the</b> <b>thyroid.</b> For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E
5|$|In medicine, a {{saturated}} solution of potassium iodide {{is used to}} treat acute thyrotoxicosis. It {{is also used to}} block uptake of iodine-131 in <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland (see isotopes section above), when this isotope is used as part of radiopharmaceuticals (such as iobenguane) that are not targeted to <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> or thyroid-type tissues.|$|E

5|$|Inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> {{is called}} thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>thyroid,</b> and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.|$|E
5|$|Numerous authors {{described}} cretinism, myxoedema {{their relationship}} with <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> in the nineteenth century.

5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are small}} {{endocrine}} glands {{in the neck}} of humans and other tetrapods that produce parathyroid hormone.

40|$|T. S. H. is <b>the</b> major {{physiological}} <b>thyroid</b> stimulator. Pathological thyroid stimulators {{may occur}} in certain disease states. In human Graves' disease thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins are produced {{and may be}} the cause of thyrotoxicosis. Some of these (L. A. T. S. -P) are human specific in their actions whereas others (L. A. T. S.) can affect <b>the</b> <b>thyroids</b> of other mammals. Pharmacological thyroid stimulation may be produced by a variety of substances including catecholamines and indolealkylamines. The physiological significance of this is considered. Following a brief review of the effects of these substances it is concluded that T. S. H. and L. A. T. S. probably act on <b>the</b> same <b>thyroid</b> receptor whereas separate receptors exist for catecholamines and indolealkylamines. [To continue reading the abstract please see the pdf]</p...|$|R
5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a third lobe present called the {{pyramidal}} lobe. When present, this lobe often stretches up the hyoid bone from <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as Lalouette's pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland's descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the position of <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> in the adult. A small horn at the back of <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called Zuckerkandl's tubercle.|$|E
