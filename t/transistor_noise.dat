40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam B. KuhnA {{technique}} for measuring and characterizing <b>transistor</b> <b>noise</b> is presented. The {{primary goal of}} the measurements is to locate the 1 /f noise corner for select transistors in Silicon-on-Sapphire processes. Additionally, {{the magnitude of the}} background channel noise of each transistor is measured. With this data, integrated circuit (IC) engineers will have a qualitative and quantitative resource for selecting transistors in designs with low noise requirements. During tests, <b>transistor</b> <b>noise</b> behavioral change is investigated over varying channel lengths, device type (N-type and P-type), threshold voltage, and bias voltage levels. Noise improvements for increased channel lengths from minimal, 1. 0 μm, and 4. 0 μm are measured. Transistors with medium and high threshold voltages are tested for comparison of their noise performance. The bias voltages are chosen to represent typical design values used in practice, with approximately 400 mV overdrive and a drain-to-source voltage range of 0. 5 to 3. 0 V. The transistors subjected to tests are custom designed in Peregrine’s 0. 5 μm (FC) and 0. 25 μm (GC) Silicon-on-Sapphire (SOS) processes. In order to allow channel current noise to dominate over other circuit noise, the transistors have extraordinarily large aspect ratios (~ 2500 - 5000).

40|$|Temporal noise sets a {{fundamental}} limit on image sensor performance, especially under low illumination and in video applications. In a CCD image sensor, temporal noise is well studied and characterized. It is {{primarily due to}} the photodetector shot noise and the thermal and 1 /f noise of the output charge to voltage amplifier. In a CMOS APS several additional sources contribute to temporal noise, including the noise due to the pixel reset, follower, and access transistors. The analysis of noise is further complicated by the nonlinearity of the APS charge to voltage characteristics, which is becoming more pronounced as CMOS technology scales, {{and the fact that}} the reset transistor operates below threshold for most of the reset time. The paper presents an accurate analysis of temporal noise in APS. We analyze the noise for each stage of the sensor operation, and identify the noise contribution from each source. We analyze noise due to photodetector shot noise taking nonlinearity into consideration. We find that nonlinearity improves SNR at high illumination. Using an MOS <b>transistor</b> subthreshold <b>noise</b> model we show that the noise due to the reset <b>transistor</b> shot <b>noise</b> is at most half the commonly quoted (V 2) value.
