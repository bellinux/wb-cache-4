25|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of voting demographics revealed that Perot's support drew heavily from across the political spectrum, with 20% of his votes coming from self-described liberals, 27% from self-described conservatives, and 53% coming from self-described moderates. Economically, however, the majority of Perot voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with {{the bulk of the}} remainder drawing from the upper middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually). Exit polls also showed <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> drew 38% of his vote from Bush, and 38% of his vote from Clinton, though it's generally considered that he aided Clinton in defeating Bush.|$|E
50|$|During the 1996 presidential primaries, the Reform Party {{was seeking}} an {{alternative}} candidate to party founder <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot,</b> who stated he didn't plan on {{running for president}} again. Reform Party activist Mark Sturdevant urged Colorado Governor Richard Lamm to seek the party's nomination. Initially hesitant, Lamm decided <b>that</b> if <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> didn't run then he would enter the presidential race.|$|R
50|$|Zonagen, Inc. {{was formed}} in 1987 by Dunbar, Baylor {{and a group of}} investors <b>that</b> {{included}} <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> and Lloyd Bentsen III, son of a former treasury secretary. The company hoped to market Dunbar's invention as a nonsurgical method of sterilizing dogs and cats. In the meantime, Zonagen would help Dunbar continue the pursuit of her life's work: the world's first contraceptive vaccine for humans.|$|R
50|$|The American Reform Party {{is a minor}} {{political}} action committee in the United States that was formed in a factional split from the larger Reform Party of the United States in October 1997. The split occurred when {{some members of the}} Reform Party, believing <b>that</b> party founder <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> had rigged the party's 1996 presidential nomination for himself, walked out of the national convention.|$|R
5000|$|After Steve Jobs {{departed}} Apple {{three years}} prior to this event, he sank from sight only emerging once in 1986 to unveil the NeXT logo and once in early 1987 to announce <b>that</b> H. <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> had invested $20 million in [...] NeXT inc.

Jobs hired multimedia artist George Coates to stage the unveiling.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ross</b> <b>Perot.</b> The billionaire. The presidential candidate. The man {{who made}} three {{references}} to the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny in a recent debate with the Vice President. However one chooses to think of him, <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> is an amazing individual. He simply did not exist as a national political figure two years ago. Yet his simple, down-to-earth approach to economics and government ("just plain talk"), his successful business background, and his stated desire to "do what's right for my country" landed him nearly 20 million votes in last year's presidential election — 19 {{percent of the electorate}} — without the support of any major party (Fineman 34). A year later he remains the most potent political force in the United States outside the Beltway. This kind of popularity by a single, independent individual is unusual, to say the least. But contrary to Perot's own often used expression, it's just not <b>that</b> simple. <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> is a skilled political operator, to be sure, but there are larger social, political, and economic forces sustaining his popularity. White House pollster Stan Greenberg is right when he says that Perot is largely a creation of the voters. The Texas billionaire has reached his current level of popularity because the public is dissatisfied with the nation's leadership. " [...] from page...|$|R
50|$|During the '92 Democratic Convention, the {{convention}} hall {{was plagued by}} the fact <b>that</b> independent candidate <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> was tied with or beating Clinton in opinion research polls. This caused a moderate turn of events at {{the convention}} to win back Perot Voters from the Perot Campaign.

Also speaking was the Vice-Presidential nominee Al Gore who appealed to the center as he was, at the time, a Southern Moderate Democrat from Tennessee.|$|R
