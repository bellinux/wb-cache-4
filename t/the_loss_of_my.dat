500|$|The three-year-old Lord Denbigh died {{suddenly}} on 19 July 1584 at Wanstead. His death shattered the dynastical hopes of the House of Dudley.

Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy's opponent in the 1994 senate race, called Kennedy [...] "the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary" [...] and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was [...] "terribly saddened". [...] She went on, [...] "Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family.... I will miss him." [...] Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy's death in which he said [...] "My heart and soul weeps at <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> best friend in the Senate, my beloved friend, Ted Kennedy."

2500|$|Dian Wei's {{death at}} the Battle of Wancheng is {{described}} in greater detail in chapter 16, but is more exaggerated than his historical biography. In this exaggeration, it was mentioned that Dian Wei was {{able to pick up}} the dead bodies of enemies by their feet and swing them as a means of attack, before he was finally killed by raining arrows and piercing spears. At Dian Wei's funeral, Cao Cao wept and told his followers, [...] "I don't feel very sad over <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eldest son (Cao Ang) and my favourite nephew (Cao Anmin). I'm only mourning Dian Wei!" ...|$|E

I was beside myself at this sight, and cried out: [...] "O Dominic, my son, are you already in Paradise?" [...] "Yes," [...] he replied, [...] "I am in Heaven."

2500|$|At {{one o'clock}} {{on the morning}} of April 2, 1865, my {{regiment}} broke camp near Petersburg, Va., and moved up to the enemy's front. Brigade pioneers and sharpshooters were ordered to rush in advance of the brigade. The pioneers were to remove all obstacles in front of the enemy's works, while the sharpshooters covered the parapet. I was at that time detailed as sergeant of the Third Brigade pioneers, and was second in command in the assault. The part of the line we were expected to carry was made of enclosed works, connected by breastworks of great strength with outer obstructions in the form of two lines of chevaux de frise and two lines of abatis. It was impossible to take the works while the enemy defended them, unless the several lines of obstruction were first removed. As Lieutenant Shiver was wounded early in the attack the command fell on me, and in directing the removal of the first two lines of the obstructions I received a shot over my ear and one in my left side and while removing the third line, a bullet shattered my right knee-joint, costing me, subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> leg. Supporting myself on the abatis, I gave my orders to my men, and at last had the satisfaction of seeing them carry away the obstruction, thus enabling General Edwards to rout the enemy and cut the railroad and telegraph. The flag of the Thirty-seventh Massachusetts was the first to wave over the enemy's works.|$|E

5000|$|In 1970 Patrick was {{appointed}} national honorary {{chairman of the}} American Lung Association's Christmas Seals campaign.

6000|$|HOPE. I {{did not see}} Him with my bodily eyes, {{but with}} the eyes <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart, and thus it was: One day I was very sad, I think sadder than {{at any one time}} in my life; and this sadness was through a fresh sight of the greatness and vileness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sins. And, as I was then looking for nothing but hell and <b>the</b> {{everlasting}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> soul, suddenly, as I thought, I saw the Lord Jesus look down from heaven upon me, and saying, [...] "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." ...|$|R

6000|$|This was {{a little}} too much. [...] "Quite out of the question, sir--and you ought to know it," [...] I said with severity. He half put out his hand. [...] "Won't you even shake hands with me?" [...] he inquired piteously. When we have most {{properly}} administered a reproof to a man, what is the perversity which makes us weakly pity him the minute afterward? I was fool enough to shake hands with this perfect stranger. And, having done it, I completed <b>the</b> total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dignity by running away. Our dear crooked little streets hid me from him directly.|$|R
30|$|I felt {{a little}} sense <b>of</b> <b>loss,</b> at <b>the</b> beginning.

60|$|Nothing {{could give}} more uneasiness than the damage our estate {{sustained}} by this traffic.

But when I found that his own fortune began to dwindle as well as mine, I was almost ready to think it was possible his lordship might have been as wicked a liver as I had, and the same vengeance as had been poured upon me for my repeated crimes might also be a punishment for him.|$|R

I do not regret my vow," [...] he went on, after Gervaise had left the room, [...] "though I regret that he is my only son.

60|$|Musing thus at last I dozed off, for I was {{so tired}} that I think I should have slept {{although}} execution awaited me at the dawn instead of another journey.

Yes, it was of this I dreamed, not of the great dangers that threatened me or <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrible <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends, perhaps because to many men, of whom I suppose I am one, the fear of scandal or of being the object of public notice, is more than the fear of danger or the smart of sorrow.|$|R

Emily, though not yet sixteen, was emancipated from schoolroom habits, and the dear girl was my devoted slave to an extent that perhaps I abused.|$|R
