5000|$|Washington trapeze (also {{known as}} head trapeze or heavy trapeze) {{refers to a}} {{variation}} on static and swinging trapeze where the aerialist performs various headstand skills on the bar, which is typically much heavier than a normal <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar</b> and has a small (about 4-inch round) headstand platform on it. The trapeze is supported by wire cables rather than ropes, and the apparatus will often be lifted and lowered during the act.|$|E

In Pular, each team member had to climb a 15-meter pole and jump to grab a <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar</b> while blindfolded. The Roadblock had one team member eating 2 kilograms of various meat. The Fast Forward required the team to climb 288 steps, rappel down 55 meters, then complete a medium difficulty rafting course.|$|E

50|$|On 1 March 1912, Berry {{jumped from}} a Benoist pusher biplane from 1,500 feet (457 m) and landed {{successfully}} at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. The pilot was Tony Jannus. The 36 foot (11 m) diameter parachute was {{contained in a}} metal canister attached to {{the underside of the}} plane - when Berry dropped from the plane his weight pulled the parachute from the canister. Rather than being attached to the parachute by a harness Berry was seated on a <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar.</b> According to Berry he dropped 400 feet (152 m) before the parachute opened.|$|E
5000|$|Static trapeze {{refers to}} a trapeze act in which the {{performer}} moves around the bar and ropes, performing {{a wide range of}} movements including balances, drops, hangs while the bar itself stays generally static. The difficulty on a static trapeze is making every move look effortless. It is like dance, in that most people of a reasonable level of strength can get onto the <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar</b> {{for the first time and}} perform some basic tricks, but an experienced artist will do them with much more grace and style.|$|E
25|$|The fairy {{magic was}} {{represented}} by circus tricks. For example, the fairies entered on <b>trapeze</b> <b>bars,</b> and the love potion that Puck fetches was a spinning plate on a rod, which Puck handed to Theseus from a trapeze fifteen feet above the stage. When Bottom turned into an ass, he acquired not the traditional ass's head, but a clown's red nose.|$|R
60|$|The {{gymnasium}} {{itself was}} a source of immense surprise to both Francis and Wilmore. It stretched along the entire top storey of a long block of buildings, and was elaborately fitted with bathrooms, a restaurant and a reading-room. The <b>trapezes,</b> <b>bars,</b> and all the usual appointments were of the best possible quality. The manager, a powerful-looking man dressed with the precision of the prosperous city magnate, came out of his office to greet them.|$|R
5000|$|Static trapeze, {{also known}} as fixed trapeze, {{is a type of}} circus art {{performed}} on the trapeze. In contrast to the other forms of trapeze, on static <b>trapeze</b> the <b>bars</b> and ropes mainly stay in place.|$|R
50|$|Bartering {{instruction}} in magic {{and all the}} paraphernalia of his exhibitions, Donaldson found himself {{the owner of a}} balloon. Without the slightest previous knowledge of balloon management, he made arrangements for an ascension, taking his first lesson in a failure, which happened for want of lighter gas or a larger balloon, the latter being too small to carry him except with pure hydrogen. The balloon was enlarged and tried again with coal gas, as in his previous attempt. This time, 30 August 1871, it succeeded in getting off after Donaldson had thrown away every available thing, even his coat, boots, and hat. This ascent was made from Reading, Pennsylvania, and the descent 18 mi distant. He made another ascent from Reading in September upon a <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar..</b>|$|E
5000|$|Swinging trapeze (or {{swinging}} single trapeze) {{refers to}} an act performed on a trapeze swinging in a forward - backward motion. The performer builds up swing from a still position, and uses {{the momentum of the}} swing to execute the tricks. Usually tricks on a swinging trapeze are thrown on the peaks of the swing and involve dynamic movements that require precise timing. Most of the tricks begin with the performer sitting or standing on the bar and end with the performer catching the bar in his/her hands or in an ankle hang (hanging by the ankles by bracing them between the rope and the bar). This act requires a great deal of strength, grace, and flexibility. The <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar</b> is weighted and often has cable inside the supporting ropes for extra strength to withstand the dynamic forces of the swing.|$|E
5000|$|Flying trapeze {{refers to}} a trapeze act where a performer, or [...] "flyer," [...] grabs the <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar</b> and jumps off a high platform, or {{pedestal}} board, so that gravity creates the swing. The swing's parts are the [...] "force out" [...] (sometimes called the [...] "cast out") {{at the far end}} of the first swing, the beat back and the rise (also known as [...] "seven") as the performer swings back above the pedestal board, and then the trick is thrown {{at the far end of}} the second swing. The performer often releases the bar and is caught by another performer, the [...] "catcher," [...] who hangs by his or her knees on another trapeze, or sometimes on a cradle, which can be either stationary or also swinging. People of any size are able to execute basic trapeze maneuvers. Flying trapeze is generally done over a net, or occasionally over water.|$|E
50|$|A triple trapeze {{is a type}} {{of static}} (still) trapeze with three <b>trapezes</b> on one <b>bar.</b> Therefore, there are four ropes {{connecting}} this trapeze to its frame, or whatever it is hanging from. Performers specialize in synchronized tricks. One example of a triple trapeze act can be seen in Cirque du Soleil's show Varekai.|$|R
50|$|The Old Gym {{is on the}} National Register of Historic Places. The {{building}} {{consisted of}} a foundation of Tennessee limestone with a structure of wooden trusses and walls of natural finished red brick. The Mansard roof was covered with slate shingles. Some of the original gymnastic equipment included a leaping rig, a vaulting board, rowing machine, parallel <b>bars,</b> <b>trapeze</b> ropes, Indian clubs, dumb bells and a walnut chest expander.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{many people}} define a flying trapeze {{act as an}} act {{involving}} two trapezes and a catcher, as of 2008, many innovative styles of flying trapeze have been performed in circuses all over the world, such as Cirque Du Soleil, The Flying Farfans, and The Flying Caceres. Cirque Du Soleil's La Nouba features a bar-to-bar flying trapeze act, and Cirque Du Soleil's Corteo presents a high-flying act quite similar to flying <b>trapeze,</b> but without <b>bars.</b> The flyers fly from one catcher to another in an innovative adagio-influenced aerial act. Still other flying trapeze acts focus on high-flying aerial tricks from the flyers, but perform their release tricks to the net, rather than to catchers. also ...|$|R
5000|$|Roland's {{final act}} {{occurred}} in Greene, Tennessee in 1937. [...] He again fell during a stunt {{but this time}} there was no awning to break his fall. [...] A contemporary trade magazine set up what happened: [...] "It had long been his ambition to develop a new act that would give more thrills than his former acts, and last winter he realized it by bringing out a high trapeze and awaying pole routing, performed without a safety net, 110 feet above the ground. At the Ottway Fair, Greenville, Tenn.,sic October 7, while completing the finale of his trapeze, a forward somersault to ankle catch, a gust of wind blew his <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar</b> from under him and he fell to his death." [...] His death certificate identified a [...] "broken right femur, broken bones of hands, probably internal injuries, probably fractured skull" [...] and concluded that he was killed by a [...] "crush injury" [...] secondary to his fall.|$|E
50|$|Amidst all this, the child's mother finally {{realizes that}} her baby is missing {{and on the}} grounds of the circus: Buddy, seeing that he must do something, climbs rapidly up a pole, and is {{followed}} by the boy's mother. Our Hero walks upon a net (presumably placed to catch trapeze artists), makes a lasso with a rope, and throws it to bring down the baby: the child resists, but comes down, pulling off the outer-clothing of the performer on whose legs he had been hanging. The baby lands in the net, but the force of his fall sends Buddy and the mother into the air; the two catch onto the same performer, and are followed by the baby; the trapezist swings, causing the child to have to catch on to the other <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar,</b> and the infant is followed by Buddy and the mother, who, as a result, are hanging in air by the legs of the baby. A bicyclist rides by on the tightrope, but is knocked off by the low-hanging Buddy and the baby's mother, who ride, Buddy on the mother's shoulders, in pursuit of the baby, still hanging by the trapeze. But the bicycle crashes, and Buddy, the baby, and his mother are sent through the fabric of the tent: the baby lands in some water, Buddy and the lady the neck of a giraffe, down which they slide in order to safely reach the ground. Mother calls for her child, Buddy futilely searches; a sobbing mother is then comforted by Buddy. Just then, the water into which the baby fell is revealed to be the home of a hippopotamus, in whose mouth the baby safely and happily sits. The mother takes her child from an obliging hippo, and the reunited two dance, in a circle, with Buddy.|$|E
5000|$|On Day 1, 16 new HouseGuests {{entered the}} newest {{rendition}} of the Big Brother House. After getting settled in and introductions were done, they were then informed by series host Julie Chen that the theme for this season is [...] "Summer of Temptation", where they would face various offers during the game that would offer them prizes and unique game-changing advantages throughout the season. However, every temptation that was accepted in the House would have a consequence that would affect {{at least one of}} the other HouseGuests. They began the summer inside the Garden of Temptation, the first competition of the season. The HouseGuests, while sequestered in 16 separate pods, were given the offer of $25,000. A flower was placed in front of the pods and the first HouseGuest to press their button when the flower lit up green would win the money. The identity of the person who pressed the button to accept the money would remain anonymous, however their actions would unleash the first twist of the season. Kevin accepted the offer, but in doing so it required him to throw the first Head of Household competition as he was now ineligible to win it. As another consequence for Kevin pressing the button, Paul from Big Brother 18 re-entered the House as the seventeenth HouseGuest. However, it was revealed by Chen that he would be swapping spots with one of the new HouseGuests that would be evicted the same night in a first-ever [...] "BB Swap." [...] Paul was given the task to select eight HouseGuests to receive a [...] "friendship" [...] bracelet. Any HouseGuest who received a [...] "friendship" [...] bracelet would be immune from eviction. He gave bracelets to Kevin, Raven, Dominique, Mark, Jason, Jessica, Ramses, and Elena. The remaining eight HouseGuests battled for their lives in the Tempted by the Fruit competition. In this competition, HouseGuests had to stand on a <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar</b> while holding on to a rope. If a HouseGuest fell off, they had to select an apple from a serpent. Four apples contained safety, while three apples were [...] "poisonous". As the competition continued, Julie would give them clues guiding them to the four safe apples. The last HouseGuest standing would guarantee his or her safety from the eviction, and the three HouseGuests with poisonous apples would be nominated for the first eviction. Cody was the winner; Christmas, Cameron, and Jillian had the poisoned apples and were put on the block. The nominees were then presented with their own temptation. Each nominee had the power to decide how their fate would ultimately be determined. They would each decide to either face an eviction vote or compete in an eviction competition, with the top 2 finishers guaranteed safety and the third place finisher automatically evicted. By a vote of 2-1, they decided to face an eviction vote, with Cameron voting for an eviction competition. On Day 1, Cameron was evicted by an 8-3-2 vote, with Cody, Mark, and Matt voting to evict Jillian, and Josh and Jason voting to evict Christmas. Julie then revealed the next twist to the viewers. Each week, America would vote to select one HouseGuest to enter the [...] "Den of Temptation." [...] Inside the Den, they would be offered a temptation. A HouseGuest is only able to be selected once throughout the entire season. However, every temptation will come with a consequence.|$|E
50|$|At the Hindu Mela, Nabagopal Mitra laid much {{emphasis}} on gymnastics, wrestling and other traditional sports. In 1868, he opened a gymnastic school at his own residence, which he named National Gymnasium. It became very popular {{and within a few}} years the school produced a number of physical education teachers. In the early 1870s the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal George Campbell formulated a new educational policy. According to this new system, European style gymnasiums were set up in the government schools and colleges. The gymnasium of the Hindu College was equipped with parallel <b>bars,</b> horizontal <b>bar,</b> <b>trapeze</b> etc. The eldest son-in-law of Nabagopal Mitra was the instructor. Mitra, realising the usefulness and necessity of the European equipments, attempted to assimilate them within the Indian tradition. So, at the National Gymnasium, while the emphasis was more on physical exercises, wrestling, sword fighting and stick wielding, gradually modern equipments like <b>bars</b> and <b>trapeze</b> were introduced. Mitra even employed a British trainer to train the Bengali Hindu pupils in European style gymnastics.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to determine}} the in vivo loads acting in hip joints and lumbar vertebral bodies during post-operative physiotherapeutic activities. Three studies were conducted: The loading of a total hip endoprosthesis was investigated during physiotherapeutic exercises (study 1) and walking with crutches (study 2), and the loads on a vertebral body replacement (VBR) were measured during position changes (study 3). Methods: 12 patients with instrumented implants (7 xhip/ 5 xVBR, mean age 59 / 66 years, mean body mass 86 / 65 kg) were investigated. The implants measure in vivo the forces and moments in 3 planes. For study 1, 6 hip patients performed 13 physiotherapeutic exercises. The peak loads were compared to those during walking with full and half weight bearing. For study 2, 7 hip patients walked with crutches using 3 -point-, 4 -point, and 2 -point-gait, and were compared to gait without crutches as a reference. For study 3, changes in position (e. g. from supine position to sitting) of 5 patients with VBR were analyzed and compared to upright standing. The resultant force Fres was computed from the force components and averaged. For the hip measurements, the torque Mtors around the implant stem axis and the bending moment Mbend in the implant neck were additionally computed in percent of the patient’s bodyweight times meter (%BW*m). Results: Study 1 : Lifting the pelvis in supine position, supported by only one leg, caused forces and moments higher than during unaided walking. Isometric contractions can potentially cause a high Fres; however, the maximum values varied strongly between 56 - 232 % body weight (=BW), depending on the contraction intensity. Study 2 : The 3 -point-gait strategy reduced Fres most effectively. However, the effects varied among subjects. Study 3 : Changes in position without physiotherapeutic instructions caused 15 160 % higher loads than with instructions. The use of a <b>trapeze</b> <b>bar</b> did not cause higher peak loads. Hand support on thighs or arm rests during rising from and sitting down on a chair reduced Fres by approximately 25 %. Conclusions: After surgical interventions, the clinician has to decide whether the primary stability of the implant requires avoidance of high loads. If so, body weight exercises and maximum voluntary contractions should be removed from the rehabilitation protocol. However, some exercises, such as lifting the pelvis shown in study 1, are also necessary in daily living when e. g. using a bed pan. Furthermore, the patients should follow the instructions of physiotherapists when changing positions and walking with crutches. Walking with 3 -point-gait requires both coordination and strength and it is questionable if elderly or weak patients are capable to perform this properly. The surgeon should therefore relate the loads on hip joint and vertebral body to those during activities of daily living and should decide individually, if unloading of the implant is necessary and feasible...|$|E
