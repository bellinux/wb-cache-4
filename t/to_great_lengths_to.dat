Originally, the {{producers}} of the film adaption of the book Into Thin Air were contacted to help. The film producers were shocked at the trouble the Simpsons staff were going to, and replied that they had simply made up translations in the film.

For example, {{she worked}} hard to keep both her name {{and the name of}} Wyatt's second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake's 1931 book, , and Marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way. Marcus also told Earp's biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although strong evidence to the contrary exists.|$|E
5|$|A Simple Plan is a 1998 American neo-noir crime thriller film {{adapted by}} Scott B. Smith from his 1993 {{novel of the}} same name. Directed by Sam Raimi, it stars Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.

The three men go <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> keep the money a secret but begin to doubt each other's trust, resulting in lies, deceit and murder.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo went <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> avoid showing their faces. While {{on the set of}} the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru went <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> find references in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which}} were probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.|$|R

5|$|During the {{interviews}} and in later correspondence, Josephine and Wyatt went <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> keep her name out of Lake's book. Lake wrote Earp {{that he planned}} to send portions of the book to his New York agent, but Earp objected because he wanted to read it first. After Earp's death on January 13, 1929, Josephine continued to try to persuade Lake to leave her and Earp's former wife, Mattie Blaylock, out of the book, even threatening legal action. Lake finally published Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931, two years after Earp's death.|$|E

50|$|The history {{behind the}} brand name Odd Molly is from {{the reality of the}} 80's when one of the founders, Per Holknekt, was a {{professional}} skater in USA.

But Divine goes <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> torment Blanca and continuously deny her a blissful life with the man she truly loves.|$|R
50|$|Burmese Days is {{an admirable}} novel. It is a crisp, fierce, and almost boisterous {{attack on the}} Anglo-Indian. The author loves Burma, he goes <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> {{describe}} the vices of the Burmese and {{the horror of the}} climate, but he loves it, and nothing can palliate for him, the presence of a handful of inefficient complacent public school types who make their living there... I liked it and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a spate of efficient indignation, graphic description, excellent narrative, excitement, and irony tempered with vitriol.|$|R
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to go <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture, Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large. In June 2008, citing hikes {{in the price of}} oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films went <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers {{to take advantage of}} their built-in following.|$|E
50|$|The ancient orders {{like those}} of wars for Israel to {{eradicate}} idol worshiping do not apply today. Jews are not taught to glorify violence. The rabbis of the Talmud saw war as an avoidable evil. They taught, 'The sword comes to the world because of delay of justice and through perversion of justice.'Jews have always hated war and Shalom expresses the hope for peace. In Judaism war is evil- at times a necessary one- yet, Judaism teaches that one has <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> avoid it.|$|R
50|$|Peter the Elder is {{believed}} to be the inventor of the forceps. The brothers went <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> keep the secret. When they arrived at the home of a woman in labour, two people had to carry a massive box with gilded carvings into the house. The pregnant patient was blindfolded so as not to reveal the secret, while all others had to leave the room. Then the operator went to work. The people outside heard screams, bells, and other strange noises until the cry of the baby indicated a successful delivery.|$|R
50|$|Whereas Popper was {{concerned}} {{in the main}} with the logic of science, Thomas Kuhn's influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions examined in detail the history of science. Kuhn argued that scientists work within a conceptual paradigm that strongly influences {{the way in which}} they see data. Scientists will go <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> defend their paradigm against falsification, by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses to existing theories. Changing a 'paradigm' is difficult, as it requires an individual scientist to break with his or her peers and defend a heterodox theory.|$|R
5|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that Grint would star in the drama film Cherrybomb with Robert Sheehan and Kimberley Nixon. Grint found shooting this film very different from the Harry Potter films since he had to adjust to doing a dozen scenes per day. Grint's character Malachy, a worker at Belfast goes <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> impress his boss's daughter, with whom he is infatuated. This film, like his next project, would involve him playing violent roles. Despite premiering at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, the film was initially unable to find a distributor. An online campaign by Grint's fans was credited with helping to secure a deal for distribution in the UK in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Kalonji went <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> secure {{international}} recognition {{and support for}} the state of South Kasai. The former colonial power, Belgium, distrusted the Congolese central government and supported both the governments of South Kasai and Katanga. Like Katanga, South Kasai had important mineral deposits, including diamond fields, and Belgian companies had large sums of money tied up in mines in the area. A Belgian company, , was the state's principal supporter and received concessions from South Kasai in exchange for financial support. The comparatively large income from these companies meant that South Kasai was able to support significant public services and cope with large numbers of internally-displaced Luba refugees. In the context of the Cold War, Kalonji was supported by Western powers and moderates in the Congolese government who viewed him as both a moderate pro-Westerner and anticommunist. Although both Katanga and South Kasai were supported by South Africa, France and the Central African Federation, neither state ever received any form of official diplomatic recognition.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs {{sometimes}} went <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> prevent this. On {{her marriage}} to Louis XIV of France, Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain, was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne. When monarchs or heirs apparent wed other monarchs or heirs, special agreements, sometimes {{in the form of}} treaties, were negotiated to determine inheritance rights. The marriage contract of Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England, for example, stipulated that the maternal possessions, as well as Burgundy and the Low Countries, were to pass to any future children of the couple, whereas the remaining paternal possessions (including Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan) would first of all go to Philip's son Don Carlos, from his previous marriage to Maria Manuela of Portugal. If Carlos were to die without any descendants, only then would they pass to the children of his second marriage. On the other hand, the Franco-Scottish treaty that arranged the 1558 marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the son and heir of Henry II of France, had it that if the queen died without descendants, Scotland would fall to the throne of France.|$|E
50|$|The Tales {{from the}} Crypt title was {{licensed}} {{for a movie}} of that name in 1972. This was followed by another film, The Vault of Horror, in 1973. The omnibus movies Creepshow (1982) and Creepshow 2, while using original scripts written by Stephen King and George A. Romero, were inspired by EC's horror comics and hosted by a Ghoulunatic-inspired character. Creepshow 2 included an animated interstitial material between vignettes, featuring a young protagonist who goes <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> acquire and keep possession of an issue of the comic book Creepshow.|$|R
50|$|This {{unattended}} nature also {{dictates that}} data loggers must be extremely reliable. Since they may operate {{for long periods}} nonstop {{with little or no}} human supervision, and may be installed in harsh or remote locations, it is imperative that so long as they have power, they will not fail to log data for any reason. Manufacturers go <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the devices can be depended on in these applications. As such dataloggers are almost completely immune to the problems that might affect a general-purpose computer in the same application, such as program crashes and the instability of some operating systems.|$|R
50|$|Jainism {{was founded}} in India in the 7th-5th century BCE, and ahimsa is its central teaching. Due to their belief in the {{sanctity}} of all life, Jains practice strict vegetarianism and many go <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> even <b>to</b> avoid harming insects.|$|R
5|$|Real {{schoolchildren}} participated {{throughout the}} movie's filming. Khan credited {{them with the}} film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them. Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and went <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> attend to them. The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming. New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and cooperation, but also gave them {{a better understanding of}} how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school. Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate. To fill out the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in. A total of 1,500children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400students.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Macintosh {{version of}} Myst {{was constructed in}} HyperCard. Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and HyperTalk scripts, with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, Myst functions {{as a series of}} separate multimedia slides linked together by commands. As the main technical constraint that impacted Myst was slow CD-ROM drive read speeds, Cyan had to go <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit PICT resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression. Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with Cinepak compression; in total, there were more than 66minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like truecolor images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500kB to around 80kB.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1936 {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of non-intervention in {{the conflict between the}} Spanish government and rebels led by General Franco. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government {{for the duration of the}} civil war. The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. Martin Tranmæl, a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper Arbeiderbladet, led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranmæl and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels. Koht went <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the International Brigades. On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of what is an adequate level of retirement spending is key for the discus-sion about whether people adequately prepare for their old age. However, surprisingly {{little is known about}} what represents an adequate expenditure level during retirement given the overall lifetime budget constraint. In this paper we address this issue by conducting a sur-vey with the American Life Panel at RAND, and with the Dutch CentER and LISS panel. We go <b>to</b> <b>great</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> ask survey questions that are meaningful to respondents and to reduce cognitive load as much as possible. Our findings suggest that adequate ”expenditure replacement rates ” exceed 70 percent. Minimum acceptable replacement rates decrease with income. The latter gradient effect is particularly pronounced for the US...|$|R
