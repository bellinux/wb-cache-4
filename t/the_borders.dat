In Wales, Henry used his power to coerce and charm the indigenous Welsh princes, while Norman Marcher Lords pushed across the valleys of South Wales. Normandy was controlled via various interlocking networks of ducal, ecclesiastical and family contacts, backed by a growing string of important ducal castles along <b>the</b> <b>borders.</b> Alliances and relationships with neighbouring counties along the Norman border were particularly important to maintaining {{the stability of the}} Duchy.|$|E
