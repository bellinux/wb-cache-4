5|$|At its founding, music {{submissions}} to {{the site}} were evaluated for inclusion solely by Lloyd, who required that all arrangements both meet his quality bar and also feature an original interpretation of the music, rather than minimally changing the original track. In early 2002, however, to better accommodate the volume of music submissions and improve selection consistency, Lloyd instituted a panel of judges, composed of accomplished artists and contributors to <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>to</b> assist him in music selection, though he still provided an initial evaluation of all submissions for meeting a minimum quality bar. Judge Larry Oji (a.k.a.

5|$|Because {{there is}} a maximum number of {{established}} positions for ranks warrant officer first class (one per squadron), promotions {{are based on the}} results of a merit review board.

Prior to 1976 the size of the squadron dictated the top rank available and many squadrons were ineligible to carry a WO1 on their establishment effectively capping promotion at WO2 for the squadron's ranking cadet.|$|E

Technomancer Press received media attention after launching TerraDrive Live, a live action MMORPG, which was debuted at PAX 2007 in Seattle. On June 1 Ahn began encouraging player generated content by launching a wiki to allow users to help flesh out the TerraDrive universe allowing <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> create factions, write backstory, and develop characters, which they could then role-play themselves during the live-action portion of the game at PAX.|$|E

In February 2010, a photoshopped version of Pedobear appeared along with mascots of the 2010 Winter Olympics in an article on the games in Gazeta Olszty≈Ñska, a Polish newspaper. This was done accidentally; due to the image being used from Google Images, the authors were unaware of the joke. Similarly, the Dutch television guide Avrobode used one of the images. It has been used as a symbol of pedophilia by Maltese graffiti vandals prior to a papal visit.|$|E
5|$|NY43 was {{extended}} slightly following {{the construction of}} a new alignment for NY30 near Central Bridge in the early 1940s. NY30 now left its old alignment southeast of Central Bridge and bypassed <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> the east. The former routing of NY30 into Central Bridge became an extension of NY43, which overlapped NY30 between the new alignment and Schoharie. When NY30A replaced NY148 in the late 1950s, the short piece of NY43 near Central Bridge became part of NY30A and NY43 was truncated back to NY30 near Schoharie. In the late 1960s, NY43 was rerouted through downtown Rensselaer to follow 3rd Avenue (previously NY381) east to US4. From there, NY43 overlapped US4 northward to Defreestville, where it rejoined its previous alignment.|$|E
5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the declarant did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself {{to be a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities. During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities may be given an opportunity by the Community Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E
5000|$|A further {{provision}} {{is the creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> Right <b>to</b> Buy for Sustainable Development.

5|$|Development of Dota 2 {{began in}} 2009 when IceFrog, the pseudonymous lead {{designer}} of the original Defense of the Ancients mod, was hired by Valve to create a modernized sequel. Dota 2 was officially released on Steam for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux-based personal computers in July 2013, following a Windows-only public beta phase that began two years prior. Despite some criticism going towards its steep learning curve and complexity, the game was praised for its rewarding gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor. The game initially used the original Source game engine until it was ported to Source 2 in 2015, making it the first game to use it. Since its release, Dota 2 {{has been one of}} the most played games on Steam, with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise being produced for it, including apparel, accessories, and toys, as well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media.
