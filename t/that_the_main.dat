5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{source of the}} mercury is likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16 percent of the mercury comes in from rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a non-toxic, inorganic form. The non-toxic mercury is converted into toxic methyl mercury by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E
5|$|According to Heisenberg, {{he began}} to address nuclear energy, {{morality}} and the war, to which Bohr seems to have reacted by terminating the conversation abruptly while not giving Heisenberg hints about his own opinions. Ivan Supek, one of Heisenberg's students and friends, claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> subject of the meeting was Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who had proposed trying to persuade Bohr to mediate peace between Britain and Germany.|$|E

5|$|After five {{successful}} seasons, Chris Carter {{wanted to}} tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film.

5|$|Bear McCreary {{was hired}} to compose the score for the series. McCreary stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> theme was based on his viewing of {{production}} designs for the opening title sequence. Instead of doing a full theme song as with his earlier works, McCreary chose to use a simple, repeating motif from the strings section.|$|E
5|$|During Simeon's reign, Bulgaria {{reached its}} {{cultural}} apogee, becoming the literary and spiritual centre of Slavic Europe. In this respect, Simeon continued his father Boris' policy of establishing and spreading Slavic culture and attracting noted scholars and writers within Bulgaria's borders. It {{was in the}} Preslav Literary School and Ohrid Literary School, founded under Boris, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> literary work in Bulgaria was concentrated {{during the reign of}} Simeon in the new Cyrillic alphabet which was developed there.|$|E

5|$|During {{the twentieth}} century the Doom Bar was {{regularly}} dredged to improve access to Padstow. By the 1930s, when Commander H.E. Turner surveyed the estuary, there were two channels round the Doom Bar, and it is thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> channel may have moved to the east side in 1929. By 2010 the original channel had disappeared. The estuary is regularly dredged by Padstow Harbour Commission's dredgers, Sandsnipe and Mannin.|$|E
5|$|In 1675, John Ogilby noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{coaching}} {{route from}} London to Southampton ran {{over the top}} of the down, going directly from Alresford to Twyford, avoiding Winchester. This remained the main coaching route until about 1800, when an alternative route via Winchester (now mostly the A31 and former A33) was formed. During this time, and up to the 19th century, the area was sometimes known as Morestead Down after the nearby village of Morestead.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in Paris Meyerbeer {{began to}} seek new libretti, {{initially}} considering Le prophète of Scribe, Le cinq mars by Henri Saint-Georges and eventually settling on Scribe's Vasco da Gama (later to become L'Africaine), which he contracted to complete by 1840. However, Meyerbeer had envisaged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> role in L'Africaine would be written for Falcon; after the catastrophic failure {{of her voice}} in 1837, he turned instead to Le prophète.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo Power {{reviewed}} Snake Rattle 'n' Roll {{as part of}} {{an overview}} of NES games which the magazine felt were overlooked or otherwise did not sell well. Their main criticism was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> characters were not recognizable to anyone, giving the game a lack of visibility amongst consumers. Otherwise, they praised the game for its precise controls and for its blend of puzzle and action elements.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet forces {{attempted}} to capture Estonia and its capital Tallinn.

The Red Army command presumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> direction of retreat for the German forces would be Tallinn, and concentrated their forces there in an attempt to block the roads.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of skilled}} craftspeople in Northumberland made the {{construction}} of the house difficult. For example, Richardson speculates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> staircase was assembled from a kit. It is one step too short for the Northumberland hallway, but no extra step was added to finish off the symmetry of the stairwell, suggesting a dearth of skilled labor.|$|E

5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be that young.|$|E

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to escape}} {{under cover of}} {{darkness}} on 14 April, the French squadron was spotted by a number of small British ships stationed close inshore. These ships raised the alarm and the main British squadron followed in pursuit. The rearmost French ship of the line, Hautpoult, was closely followed by the small brig HMS Recruit, which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running battle that lasted three days and ended off the coast of Puerto Rico. The British suffered 45 casualties, the French nearly 100. The remainder of the French squadron escaped, with the two surviving ships of the line sailing directly for France, eventually reaching Cherbourg in May.|$|E
5|$|Between 1 and 17 October, the Japanese {{delivered}} 15,000{{troops to}} Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive. After his staff officers observed the American defenses around Lunga Point, Hyakutake decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by {{troops from the}} 38th Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defenses from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River. The 7000-member 2ndDivision was split into three units; the Left Wing Unit under Major General Yumio Nasu containing the 29th Infantry Regiment, the Right Wing Unit under Kawaguchi consisting of troops from the 230th Infantry Regiment (from the 38th Infantry Division), and the division reserve led by Maruyama comprising the 16th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
