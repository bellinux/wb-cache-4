25|$|In 1852, the Lieutenant Governor of Victoria C.J. La Trobe {{commissioned}} a surveyor {{to lay out}} a town at Shortland's Bluff. On 1 May 1853, he appointed a postmaster at the Bluff to <b>transship</b> Geelong and Western District mails. This first settlement was proclaimed Queenscliff on 23 June 1853, and two months later the first town lots were sold. Prior to these developments, between 1838 and 1843, pilot operations had begun, a grazing lease had been granted, and a lighthouse had been established in the area.|$|E
25|$|The Northern East West Freight Corridor was an {{initiative}} by the International Union of Railways aiming {{to establish a}} freight corridor from the Far East to North America. The route would use the Ofoten Line and <b>transship</b> from rail to ship at Narvik. The main report for the project was made in 2004, but since there had been limited funding for the project. In 2005, Ofotbanen entered the container freight market, with a train running from Narvik via Sweden to Oslo, both via the Meråker Line and via the Kongsvinger Line. The trains would continue to Drammen when necessary.|$|E
25|$|In April 2, 1831, Daniel Van Slyke reported: it is {{with great}} {{difficulty}} {{we have been able}} to preserve order among the boatmen, who in striving to push forward for a preference in passing the several locks are sometimes dis-posed to injure each other’s boats as a means of carrying their point. An unfortunate in-stance of this kind happened on Wednesday last at the locks on the 9th section. A strongly constructed boat ran her bow against a gondola loaded with flour, and so much injured her as to render it necessary to <b>transship</b> the load. But no damage was done to the cargo.|$|E
2500|$|The Rjukan Line is a [...] {{line from}} Rjukan to Mæl, where the wagons were <b>transshipped</b> to ferries.|$|R

30|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} characteristics and operational performances, four hub ports, namely, Colombo in South Asia and Singapore, Kelang, and Tanjung Pelepas in Southeast Asia, {{compete in the}} feeder market related to the Bay of Bengal, which is not directly served by mainline vessels in hub and spoke networks. Moreover, due to their {{close proximity to the}} East-West trunk sea route, these four hub ports compete with each other to be selected as the transshipment hub for relay networks. The consideration of two liner networks is important, as shipping lines take this aspect into account when determining the movement of containers. As an example, if one vessel has containers destined to Tuticorin feeder port as well as containers being <b>transshipped</b> to another mainline vessel, and if this first vessel calls at both Colombo and Singapore, the container destined to Tuticorin port would be <b>transshipped</b> at Colombo because of the lower feeder cost, whereas the container being <b>transshipped</b> to another mainline vessel would be <b>transshipped</b> at Singapore because the connecting mainline vessel also calls at Singapore port. We assume that these aspects create distinct roles for transshipment hubs in hub and spoke or relay networks.|$|R
25|$|Seeing {{that other}} Japanese car makers were {{allowing}} their dealers in Puerto Rico to <b>transship</b> excess inventory to Latin America and the continental United States, Soler {{asked if it}} could do the same. Mitsubishi refused, saying the vehicles were customized for the Puerto Rican market. They lacked heaters and defoggers {{that they would have}} needed on the mainland, and their engines could not run on the lower-grade leaded gasoline sold in many Latin American countries at that time. Further, Soler had no experience with maritime shipping and would not been able to meet its service obligations under warranty for transshipped cars and trucks. Mitsubishi also was concerned that transshipments to the continental U.S. would be seen as skirting the voluntary import restraints Japanese automakers had been practicing in the American market to mitigate the potential political backlash from their distressed American counterparts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the northeastern}} North Atlantic the Spanish Basques used vessels of smaller tonnage {{than those that}} {{took part in the}} Terranova voyages, which {{resulted}} in a somewhat lower haul per ship, partly because of their smaller overall length and partly because of the space the tryworks occupied. The French Basques employed 250-ton frigates (r. 100–350 tons) with reinforced stem-posts and timbers in order to withstand the rigors of whaling in the West Ice - the area between eastern Greenland and Spitsbergen. They were also fitted with six to fourteen cannons, as France and Holland were often at war during this period. Many of the French Basque ships, instead of returning to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Ciboure, or Bayonne (where they would have to <b>transship</b> their oil and bone), went into Le Havre or Honfleur in Normandy, where {{a large percentage of the}} whale oil market existed. Poor catches in the 1680s, and the War of the League of Augsburg (1688–97) caused a dramatic decline in French Basque whaling. By the early 18th century, only one or two vessels were left in the trade.|$|E
500|$|There were {{restrictions}} on reporting attacks on ships. Frank Aiken, the government minister whose responsibilities included censorship, reverted this policy. His {{intention was to}} let Germany know that the Irish public know, and [...] "they don't like it". There had been a British proposal for transshipment. [...] William Warnock, the Irish chargé d'affaires in Berlin told Germany that Ireland was refusing to <b>transship</b> British cargoes, while protesting against the attacks on Irish ships, and other neutral ships with Irish cargoes. Deliberate attacks on cross-channel shipping ceased on 5 November 1941, when the collier Glencree was strafed. There were attacks on other routes. Mines were a constant danger.|$|E
50|$|In 1908 {{the company}} leased wharf space at Minffordd, {{installing}} turntables and siding to allow finished slates to be <b>transshipped</b> {{to the standard}} gauge railway there.|$|R

500|$|Construction began {{once the}} {{necessary}} land had been purchased, {{but it soon}} {{became apparent that the}} original surveys were inadequate. The canal engineer John Rennie was asked to advise the proprietors, and proposed three options, for boats of , for boats of , and for barges which were [...] wide. The first was ruled out on cost, the third because of the need to <b>transship</b> all goods at Highbridge, and the second was adopted because it allowed the coasters that worked the Bristol Channel to use the canal. This option required locks of [...] by , and was costed at £28,720. The route would be as authorised, but a single lock was required on the upper section to simplify the water supply. Work resumed in July 1828.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 January 1863 the {{standard}} gauge Newtown and Machynlleth Railway had opened, followed on 1 July {{of the same}} year by the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway's line from Machynlleth to Borth. These two lines [...] became part of the Cambrian Railways by August 1865. The opening of {{the standard}} gauge line to Borth made the section of the CM from Machynlleth to Derwenlas obsolete. It was much easier to <b>transship</b> slates to the main line at Machynlleth, so the lower section of the tramway was abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, Socony Vacuum Oil {{opened the}} huge Mammoth Oil Port on Staten Island {{which had a}} {{capacity}} of handling {{a quarter of a}} billion gallons of petroleum products a year and could <b>transship</b> oil from ocean-going tankers and river barges. In 1940, Socony-Vacuum purchased the Gilmore Oil Company of California, which 1946 was merged with its another subsidiary, General Petroleum Corporation. [...] In 1947, Jersey Standard and Royal Dutch Shell formed a joint venture Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV for oil and gas exploration and production in the Netherlands. [...] In 1948, Jersey Standard and Socony-Vacuum acquired interests in the Arab-American Oil Company (Aramco).|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} Auckland portion, between Newmarket and Westfield, {{was actually}} built {{as part of}} the Onehunga Branch in 1873 and was only classified {{as part of the}} North Auckland Line at a later date. [...] The first section of a line northwards from Auckland was not officially begun until later that decade, and work took place concurrently with the Whangarei - Kamo section. [...] The first portion, from Newmarket to Glen Eden, opened without ceremony on 29 March 1880. [...] On 21 December 1880, it was opened to Henderson, and on 13 July 1881, it was opened to Helensville. [...] The extension to Helensville connected to the Kaipara - Riverhead Section; its northern terminus was extended from Helensville South to a more central Helensville station, and the portion from Kumeu to Riverhead was made redundant as it was quicker to convey goods by train directly to Auckland than <b>transship</b> them to ships at Riverhead. [...] Accordingly, Kumeu - Riverhead was closed on 18 July 1881.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{a chance}} did not occur. For {{four or five}} days the gale {{continued}} with great severity and, before it ceased, the ship was well down the coast of Spain, on her way south. When the captain saw that there was but small chance of his being able to <b>transship</b> his involuntary passenger, he said to him: ...|$|E

50|$|In both cases, a single, unique, <b>transshipped</b> {{container}} is counted {{twice in}} the port performance, since it is handled twice by the waterside cranes (separate unloading from arriving ship A, waiting in the stack, and loading onto departing ship B)...|$|R

50|$|The {{successor}} railway to the E&NR, the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway, installed train ferries {{for goods}} and mineral traffic: the wagons were transferred on to rails on the ferryboats, avoiding the <b>transshipping,</b> {{but this was}} still an imperfect arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|Transloading may be {{confused}} with transshipment, but in modern usage they represent different concepts. Transloading concerns the mechanics of transport, while transshipment is essentially a legal term addressing how the shipment originates and is destined. Consider a load of grain that is transloaded at an elevator, where it is combined with grain from other farms and thus leaves on the train as a distinct shipment from that in which it arrived. It thus cannot {{be said to be}} <b>transshipped.</b> Or consider a package shipped through a package delivery service or the mails: it may change shipping mode several times along the trip, but since it is (from an external point of view) conveyed as a single shipment regardless of how it is conveyed or what else travels with it on the legs of its journey, it is not considered to be <b>transshipped.</b> Conversely, a load on a truck can be taken in one (legal) shipment to an intermediate point and then to its ultimate destination without ever leaving the truck. If this is specified as two shipments, then the goods are <b>transshipped,</b> but no transloading has taken place.|$|R
