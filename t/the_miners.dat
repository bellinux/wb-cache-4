5|$|In 1938, Wensloff {{spent his}} first season in the New York Yankees minor league system, playing for the Class-C Joplin Miners of the Western Association. In an {{exhibition}} game with <b>the</b> <b>Miners</b> against the St. Louis Browns, Wensloff allowed eight runs and failed to pitch for a full inning as <b>the</b> <b>Miners</b> lost, 125. In 28 games for <b>the</b> <b>Miners</b> in 1938, he won and lost 13 games each and finished {{the season with a}} 3.48 ERA. Wensloff continued his tenure with <b>the</b> <b>Miners</b> during the 1939 season. By the end of July, he had a win-loss record of 172. In his final season at the Class-C level, Wensloff compiled a 26–4 record in 31 games, pitching 249 innings. At the end of the season, Wensloff had the most wins in the league along with Maury Newlin of the Topeka Owls, and was also third in the league in innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|When Colorado state troops {{arrived in}} Cripple Creek {{early on the}} morning of June 6, more {{violence}} had already broken out. The deputies were exchanging gunfire with <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> on Bull Hill. Gen. Brooks quickly moved his troops from the train station to the foot of Bull Hill. As Sheriff Bowers and Gen. Brooks began to argue about what course of action to take next, the deputies took advantage of the lull and attempted to charge <b>the</b> <b>miners.</b> <b>The</b> <b>miners</b> sounded the whistle at the Victor mine, alerting Gen. Brooks. Soldiers of the state militia quickly intercepted the deputies and stopped their advance. Brooks ordered his men to occupy the top of Bull Hill, and <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> offered no resistance.|$|E
5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among <b>the</b> <b>miners,</b> who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some of <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> loaded a flatcar with dynamite {{and attempted to}} roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. <b>The</b> <b>miners</b> subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>miner's</b> cap (Fahrhaube) {{is part of}} <b>the</b> {{traditional}} <b>miner's</b> costume. It {{consists of}} a white material (linen) and served in the Middle Ages to protect <b>the</b> <b>miner</b> when descending below ground (unter Tage).

5|$|News of {{the mine}} owners' meeting with Bowers soon leaked out, and <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> {{organized}} and armed themselves in response. Calderwood was leaving {{on a tour of}} the WFM locals in Colorado to raise funds for the Cripple Creek strike, and so appointed Junius J. Johnson, a former U.S. Army officer, to take over strike operations. Johnson immediately established a camp atop Bull Hill, which overlooked the town of Altman. He ordered that fortifications be built, a commissary stocked and <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> be drilled in maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{spread that}} the strike was weakening. Volunteers and others not {{connected}} with <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> association {{took over the}} mine pumps, which had been abandoned by <b>the</b> <b>miners,</b> {{in order to prevent}} flooding of the tunnels. There were minor acts of violence. The Citizens' Corps prepared for a possible armed confrontation, drilled by those of its members who were Civil War veterans. The group used the mine company store owned by W. W. Scranton as their headquarters, after vacating two other locations because owners feared the presence of the group would attract violence.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation {{established}} the Mine Survey Institute at Khewra in 1971. The institute conducts mine surveys, organizes mining-related courses for <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> and has establishes the Khewra Model High School and the Khewra Women College. More recently <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> won an important environmental {{case against the}} mining company {{for the provision of}} unpolluted drinking water. The water available to the residents of Khewra had been polluted by salt, coal and other nearby mining activity. This case is internationally recognised as important with regard to the relationship between humanity and the environment.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Asteroid <b>Miner</b> : After MacArthur {{appears in}} the system, the first ship to {{rendezvous}} comes {{from a group of}} Trojan asteroids related to the only gas giant planet. The pilot is a Brown Motie, an [...] "idiot savant engineer" [...] with instinctive understanding of science and technology, amazing dexterity, and poor communication skills. Whitbread boards <b>the</b> <b>Miner's</b> ship and finds it occupied by <b>the</b> <b>Miner</b> and dozens of Watchmakers, smaller Moties with similar abilities but lower intelligence. <b>The</b> <b>Miner</b> accompanies Whitbread back to MacArthur, bringing two Watchmakers and killing the rest by evacuating her ship's air. The humans are unable to communicate with <b>the</b> <b>Miner,</b> not realizing her status, but discover her ability to improve gadgets. Before the next delegation of Moties arrives, <b>the</b> <b>Miner</b> dies from failing to become pregnant in time. The Watchmakers reproduce in vast numbers and re-make MacArthur under the humans' noses, eventually leading to the ship's evacuation and destruction.|$|R

5|$|The labor {{strike was}} unsuccessful, and <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> {{went back to}} work within a couple of months. The {{national}} Knights of Labor organization refused to support the Carbon strike and the hold out by white miners in Rock Springs following the Rock Springs Riot. The organization avoided supporting <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> along the Union Pacific Railroad, because it {{did not want to be}} seen as condoning the violence at Rock Springs. When the Union Pacific Coal Department reopened the mines, it fired 45 white miners connected to the violence.|$|E
5|$|Warned {{about the}} size of the force Bowers was raising, Gov. Davis Hanson Waite interceded again in the strike. He issued a {{proclamation}} on May 27 in which he called on <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> to disband their encampment on Bull Hill. In a development unparalleled in American labor history, he also declared the force of 1,200 deputies to be illegal and ordered the group disbanded. He also ordered the state militia to be on the alert for a possible move on Cripple Creek. On May 28, the governor visited <b>the</b> <b>miners,</b> who authorized Waite to negotiate on their behalf.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the sheriff of St. George, {{accompanied}} by a posse of 30 men, arrested 25 members of <b>the</b> <b>Miners</b> Union, including Matthew O'Loughlin. As Silver Reef's jail {{was too small to}} hold all 25 prisoners, most of them were jailed in the Rice Building. The Rice Building could not hold all of the prisoners, so a line was drawn around the building, and anyone who crossed the line was threatened with shooting. <b>The</b> <b>Miners</b> Union members were transferred to Beaver, where they were tried for riot, conspiracy, and false imprisonment. Thirteen of the members were sentenced to imprisonment; three were bailed out, while ten were sent to the Utah Territorial Penitentiary. Matthew O'Loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a $75 fine.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} mines. To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of <b>the</b> <b>miners.</b> Instead of striking again, <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> accepted this. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> inadvertently dug below the water table, and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the mines were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the mines continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, but none of these attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone. One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E

5|$|Colleagues urged Charlton {{to stand}} for the state electoral {{district}} of Waratah, and on 5 December 1903 Charlton became the second member for the district in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. His representation of that district was short-lived, as the next year he transferred to Northumberland, replacing John Norton. Charlton became the unofficial spokesperson for <b>the</b> <b>miners,</b> speaking principally about mining matters in parliament. In 1909 a coal miners' strike struck New South Wales and Charlton was called upon by the Colliery Employees' Federation to represent {{it in front of}} a wage board. Charlton was unsuccessful in gaining better conditions for <b>the</b> <b>miners</b> but he did settle the dispute, talking to miners around the state and convincing them to return to work. He resigned from state politics and in 1910 Charlton wrested the federal Division of Hunter from the sitting Frank Liddell. Hunter has remained a safe Labor seat ever since.|$|E
