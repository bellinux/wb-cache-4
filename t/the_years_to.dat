5|$|Although Z. Marcas {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France {{were in danger of}} being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Planica event and following numerous near-flat ground landings, it became clear that ski flying had once again outgrown an older hill and needed enlarging in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come. In 2005, almost immediately after the conclusion of the World Cup season, talks were under way to upgrade the hill in Vikersund. This became a reality in mid-2010, when the FIS announced major rule changes at the 47th International Ski Congress in Antalya, Turkey, to allow for ski flying hills to be constructed to their largest sizes yet.|$|E

5|$|The town of Siliguri, {{the start}} of the railway route, was {{connected}} with Calcutta (now Kolkata) via railway in 1878, while the additional journey to Darjeeling required the use of tongas (horse-driven carts) along a dust track. On the recommendations of a committee appointed by Sir Ashley Eden, work on the railroad began in 1879 and was completed by July 1881. The line underwent several improvements such as making gradients more gradual over <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> increase manoeuvrability. By 1909–1910, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was carrying roughly 174,000 passengers and 47,000 tons of goods annually.|$|E

5|$|After {{buying the}} team, COMSAT {{organized}} its Denver sports franchises under a separate subsidiary, Ascent Entertainment Group Inc., which {{went public in}} 1995, with 80% of its stock bought by COMSAT and the other 20% available on NASDAQ. The Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver (where the Denver Nuggets also played) on October 6, 1995, winning 3–2 against the Detroit Red Wings. Valeri Kamensky scored the first goal as the Avalanche. Led by captain Joe Sakic, forward Peter Forsberg and defenseman Adam Foote {{on the ice and}} Pierre Lacroix as the general manager and Marc Crawford as the head coach, the Avalanche became stronger when All-Star Montreal Canadiens goalie Patrick Roy joined the team. Feeling humiliated for being left in the net after having let in nine goals in 26 shots during a Canadiens game against the Red Wings, Roy joined the Avalanche on December 6, 1995, together with ex-Montreal captain Mike Keane in a trade for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Ručinský and Andrei Kovalenko.
