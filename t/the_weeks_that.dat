Amato's role as assistant head coach was filled by Jim Gladden, {{who had been a}} coach at Florida State for more than 25 years {{at the time he was}} named the assistant head coach. At Virginia Tech, head coach Frank Beamer also made some changes to his coaching staff, promoting several position coaches to higher positions in the Tech football hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Chinese media {{coverage}} of the Ürümqi riots was extensive, and was compared favourably to that of the unrest in Tibet in 2008. When the riots began, communications were immediately cut off.

They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E

5|$|On December 4, 2011, {{the final}} Bowl Championship Series standings were {{unveiled}} with LSU ranked first, followed by Alabama, {{to set up}} a rematch between the two teams in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> led up to the game, the notion of a split national championship became a major storyline. This was the case as the AP Poll is not tied to the Bowl Championship Series and some AP voters expressed they might vote LSU national champions even if they lost as they defeated Alabama in their regular season game. However, after Alabama shut out LSU 21–0 in the BCS National Championship Game, the AP voted them national champions to give the Crimson Tide the consensus national championship and thus avoid a split title with LSU.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> {{followed}} the battle, the Spanish troops and local militia increased their pressure on Castellfollit's garrison. On 5 April, the Catalan miquelets, supported by five companies of dragoons and several peasants, defeated {{a party of}} French troops from Berga and Castellfollit, killing 60 soldiers and taking 200 prisoners. Noailles, then ill of rheumatism, ordered Lieutenant-general Saint-Sylvestre to assemble a supply convoy to relieve Castellfollit, which he put under an escort of 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. A corps of miquelets, Spanish dragoons and peasants led by Blai de Trinxeria attacked and defeated the convoy on 15 April. After that, the French garrisons of Castellfollit and Hostalric fell under an effective blockade. On 19 May, Saint-Sylvestre assembled an army of 8,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry and relieved Hostalric, but Castellfollit remained blockaded. Noailles and his second in command were not in good terms: if Saint-Sylvestre advocated for demolishing and abandoning both Hostalric and Castellfollit, Noailles {{was not willing to}} give ground.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> {{followed}} {{the conclusion of}} the season, several changes were made to the Alabama coaching staff.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> {{followed}} {{the conclusion of}} the season, several changes were made to the Alabama coaching staff. On January 9 offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier was officially hired in the same capacity at Michigan as the replacement for Al Borges. On January 10, former Oakland Raiders, Tennessee and USC head coach Lane Kiffin was hired as the replacement for Nussmeier as both offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. On January 11, it was announced defensive line coach Chris Rumph had resigned and took the same position on the Texas staff. On January 13 USC defensive line coach Bo Davis was hired as Rumph's replacement. Davis previously coached defensive line at Alabama from 2007 to 2010 and had also served under Saban at LSU and with the Miami Dolphins. On February 12, Greg Brown resigned to become the safeties coach at Louisville. Two days later, Kevin Steele was promoted from Alabama's director of player personnel to inside linebackers coach. Steele previously served as a defensive assistant for Saban at Alabama in 2007 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Rey Mysterio versus Eddie Guerrero in a singles match. Two {{months prior to}} Judgment Day, at WrestleMania 21, Rey Mysterio defeated Eddie Guerrero. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> followed, Guerrero and Mysterio were challenged by MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina) to defend the WWE Tag Team Championship, which Guerrero and Mysterio accepted. MNM defeated Guerrero and Mysterio to win the WWE Tag Team title after Guerrero walked {{out in the middle}} of the match. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Mysterio were given a rematch for the Tag Team championship. During the match, however, Mysterio accidentally performed a flying body press on Guerrero which led to Guerrero abandoning Mysterio, but returned as the fans urged Guerrero to come back. MNM retained the belt after pinning Mysterio for the win. The following week, Teddy Long booked a Street Fight match, a match without disqualifications and where scoring conditions can occur anywhere, between Mysterio and Guerrero's nephew, Chavo Guerrero. Mysterio came out as the winner of the match. After the match, Mercury and Nitro attacked Mysterio, which prompted Guerrero to come out and clear the ring. Guerrero, however, attacked Mysterio. The assault led to Guerrero lifting Mysterio off the ground and driving Mysterio's back on the ring steps. This angle saw Guerrero turn into a villain. As a result, the following week, Long promoted a match between Guerrero and Mysterio at Judgment Day.|$|E
5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E

5|$|The battalion's {{personnel}} {{during the}} early stages of its existence were volunteers who enlisted within the 4th Military District, which encompassed South Australia and Broken Hill, New South Wales. Many of the commissioned officers and some of the non-commissioned officers had previous military experience in the Militia, while the bulk of the enlisted personnel had no prior military service. Rudimentary individual soldier training was conducted along with sports meets throughout August, followed by skill-at-arms training and range shoots in September, while key appointment holders were sent away on various promotion and other specialist training courses. In early October, the battalion was presented with its battle flag by veterans who had served in the 43rd Battalion during World War I, and a short time later it was announced that the 24th Brigade would be transferred to join the 9th Division in the Middle East. More intense training, including company and battalion-level field training was conducted in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> followed. In late November, the 2/43rd received their Unit Colour Patches in preparation for deployment and the battalion marched through the centre of Adelaide. Finally, on 28 December 1940, the men entrained at Oakbank, and were transported by rail to Melbourne, where they embarked on the transport Mauretania.|$|E
