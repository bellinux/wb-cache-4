25|$|On January 13, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> <b>Mercury</b> News {{reported}} that the city of San Jose, San Jose State University and the Earthquakes owners were in negotiations to build a soccer stadium {{just east of the}} Earthquakes' previous home, Spartan Stadium. The new facility, to have 22,000 permanent seats but be expandable to a capacity of 30,000 for single games, would be privately built by Lewis Wolff and John Fisher, the primary owners of the Earthquakes, with San Jose State providing the needed land. Additionally, the team and the university would build community soccer fields across Senter Road in Kelley Park using San Jose municipal bond money that had been approved years earlier for the purpose but never spent. The plan was for the new version of the San Jose Earthquakes to play in Spartan Stadium during the 2008 MLS season, then move into the new stadium in 2009. Plans for the stadium collapsed on April 19 of that year after the Earthquakes and SJSU could not come to an agreement on revenue sharing.|$|E
25|$|With most Republicans lukewarm about Beeson {{and some}} {{actually}} thinking of abstaining or voting against him, Eisenhower began lobbying conservative Southern Democrats {{to support the}} nomination. On January 29, Senators H.

The newspaper, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> <b>Mercury,</b> said it stood by its story. Beeson then made the surprising request on January 30 to speak again before the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee. The request was granted. Democratic Senator James E. Murray said Beeson's integrity had been called into question, and all six Democrats on the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee said that new revelations that Farmer and Beeson had a pre-existing relationship indicated Beeson would not be independent of Farmer's influence. But during a six-hour hearing on February 2, Beeson admitted that the newspaper article was correct. When directly {{asked if he had}} submitted a letter of resignation, he said he had not but had given an oral resignation. He then admitted that he had not stopped making contributions to his company's pension plan, and implied he was really on a leave of absence. He also reversed his January 22 testimony and said Farmer had not recommended him to Eisenhower at all. His revelations led to an adjournment so that Paul L.

He commented that some parts of the show were [...] "ridiculous", while pointing towards the theme of [...] "brotherly pettiness" [...] which ran through the majority of the two previews he was provided with. Barney concluded that while some moments in the show were poignant, the most engaging sections of the episodes were the clips that showed the Jackson 5 at the height of their fame. [...] "When you mentally juxtapose those images against scenes of four bickering middle-aged guys, it becomes apparent that there are times when it's much more fun to live in the past." ...|$|R
