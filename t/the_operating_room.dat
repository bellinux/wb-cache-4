40|$|Objectives: To {{know how}} the nursing {{students}} evaluate the clinical-practical knowledge appraised at their clinical clerkship, measured through the satisfaction with the nursing staff Teaching Skills, the Perceived Support and their Global Satisfaction. Methodology: Cross-section, descriptive study carried out at the Ramon y Cajal Hospital. The target population were the 2008 / 09 nursing students at their clinical clerkship in the hospital, with a total number of 459 shifts. Questionnaire was self-designed and self-administered. Analyzed variables were the student academic year, the hospital ward and their relation with: 1. Teaching Skills, 2. Perceived Support, 3. General Satisfaction. Results: 314 questionnaires were filled out and returned, which is 69, 41 % {{of the total number}} of questionnaires. Students at <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms</b> and at <b>the</b> Paediatric Wards gave statistically significant lower qualifications (p= 0, 005 and p= 0, 003) than the Emergencies students to the nursing staff Teaching Skills. Regarding the Perceived Support, statistically significant higher scores were given to the Paediatrics (p= 0, 002) and the Surgical Wards (0, 001) compared to <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms</b> staff. Finally, in General Satisfaction the lowest, but non statistically significant, scores were given also to <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms</b> (p> 0, 05). Conclusions: Nursing staff from <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms</b> and <b>the</b> Paediatric Wards should ameliorate their teaching skills, and those at <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms,</b> also <b>the</b> support given during the students clinical clerkship. The proposed improvement actions suggest that meetings between supervisors, nursing staff and professors in order to discuss the teaching objectives are necessary, as well as informational sessions between students and nursing staff at the wards...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With {{the aim of}} rationalization, {{resources}} optimization {{and service}} quality improvement, Moroccan hospitals are improving their management strategy, especially in <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>rooms.</b> Budget cuts and {{the increasing number of}} patients of <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> services are <b>the</b> major constraints of reasonable hospital management. Those <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> responsible are in charge of searching for a way to respond optimally to these needs. Therefore, it is undeniable that the optimization of the allocated expenses and resources of these rooms has become a necessity. In the present work we model <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> using <b>the</b> object approach with UML. A study of a real case of the National Institute of Oncology (NIO) is presented to elucidate the functional, static and dynamic aspects.

In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

5|$|The outer {{fringes of}} Hurricane Dean swept over Haiti {{bringing}} heavy squalls. On Gonâve Island, {{thousands of people}} lost power and some took shelter in schools and churches. The roof of the Hopital St. Michel in Jacmel, damaged before the storm, leaked significantly leading to water damage in <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> Two {{people were killed in}} Tiburon and Moron, towns in the south and southeast of the island, respectively. Seven other storm-related deaths were confirmed but few details were given. Another four were injured in a sailboat after disregarding warnings to stay in port. Several hundred homes were destroyed due to the resulting landslides. In the department of Sud-Est, Nippes, Centre, and Artibonite, 5,154people retreated to temporary shelters. Hurricanes typically pose significant hazards to potable water in Haiti, but Hurricane Dean produced only a modest 2.06inches (52mm) of rainfall. As such, the storm caused no major problems with water and sanitation, except in the town of Bainet, where the temperamental water system was compromised.|$|E

40|$|Background & purpose: There are {{occupational}} hazards {{related to}} Nitrous Oxide (N 2 O) in hospitals <b>operating</b> and recovery <b>rooms.</b> These hazards include the decrease of mental performance and audio-visual ability, and reduced fertility, spontaneous abortion and neurological, renal and liver diseases. In this survey, {{the concentration of}} Nitrous Oxide in indoor air of hospitals <b>operating</b> and recovery <b>rooms</b> in Babol University of medical sciences was determined. Materials & Methods: This descriptive study was performed in 23 <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> and 3 recovery rooms in 3 educational hospitals of Babol medical sciences university. The rooms with continuous usage of N 2 O with 2 - 3 lit/min of flow of general anesthesia were studied. For sampling and detecting N 2 O concentration as part per million (ppm), a portable IR spectrophotometer (3015 model of Bacharach Inc.) was used. The sampling was performed in 5 different zones of <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> and 1 zone of recovery room in 3 different hours of work time (8 : 30 - 9 AM, 10 : 30 - 11 AM and 12 : 30 - 1 : 00 PM). One-way ANOVA,SPSS 18 was used to analyze data and comparing the means. Results: N 2 O concentration mean in 5 different zones of <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> was 318 ± 22. 6, 325. 5 ± 24. 1, 299 ± 21. 8, and 301 ± 22, 314 ± 23. 7 ppm and in recovery room, it was 51 ± 15 ppm. There {{was no significant difference}} between the means of N 2 O concentration in different zones of <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>rooms,</b> but <b>the</b> means of N 2 O concentration in different zones of <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> and recovery room were significant (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Considering high average concentration of Nitrous Oxide in different <b>operating</b> and recovery <b>rooms</b> with maximum contamination levels of N 2 O, this situation subjects the health personnel to risk. Therefore, further research and applying protection utilities are recommended...|$|R
5|$|During Shepherd's surgery, {{his hand}} becomes numb, and he frustratedly exits <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> In the intern appendectomy, Wilson {{makes a mistake}} and freezes, leading to a scolding from Meredith Grey. Back in Minnesota, Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her {{superiors}} at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Craig Thomas (William Daniels) and Dr. Parker (Steven Culp), so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan's death. However, her PTSD hinders her from boarding the plane, and she ultimately remains in Minnesota. Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), now a plastic surgical fellow, sits by Sloan's bedside and talks of medical cases to him. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) enters Sloan's hospital room and removes him from life support. Unable to cope with Sloan's death, Meredith Grey boards a plane to visit Yang, but panics before it takes off. Shortly thereafter, Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar, where he reveals {{that he will be}} staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. The next morning, Hunt visits Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) at her family's farm, and asks her to begin working in Seattle again.

5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E
