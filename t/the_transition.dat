5|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} {{is dependent on}} the activation energy needed to form <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Secondly the enzyme stabilises <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.|$|E

5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. <b>The</b> <b>transition</b> region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. <b>The</b> <b>transition</b> region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. <b>The</b> <b>transition</b> from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years.

40|$|Homogeneous {{nucleation}} of a {{new phase}} near a second, continuous, <b>transition,</b> is considered. <b>The</b> continuous <b>transition</b> is in <b>the</b> metastable region associated with <b>the</b> first-order phase <b>transition,</b> one of whose coexisting phases is nucleating. Mean-field calculations show that as <b>the</b> continuous <b>transition</b> is approached, <b>the</b> size of the nucleus varies as the response function of the order parameter of <b>the</b> continuous <b>transition.</b> This response function diverges at <b>the</b> continuous <b>transition,</b> as does <b>the</b> temperature derivative of the free energy barrier to nucleation.
