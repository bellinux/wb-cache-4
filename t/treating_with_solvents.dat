The ultimate goal of this processing is to repair defects such as grains, dislocations, and vacancies in the original superlattice.

Renal mercury (RHg), urinary mercury (UHg), serum creatinine (SCr), urine kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM- 1), renal pathology, and renal mediators were examined. At both 8 weeks and 12 weeks, RHg, UHg, and urine KIM- 1 were significantly higher in the cinnabar group than in the control group, although SCr was unchanged. Kidney lesions in the cinnabar-treated rats occurred mainly in the tubules and interstitium, including vacuolization, protein casts, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and slight increase in interstitial collagen. In addition, mild mesangial proliferation was observed in glomeruli. Moreover, the expression of inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators was upregulated in the cinnabar group. In conclusion, cinnabar may cause kidney damage due to the accumulation of mercury, and renal inflammation and slight fibrogenesis may occur in rats.

Particularly, little information is available on RSV's effects on metabolic pathways and the cell-extra cellular matrix (ECM) communication that are critical for cancer cell growth. To identify important targets of RSV, we analyzed whole protein fractions from HT- 29 advanced human colon cancer cell line <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>solvent</b> control, IGF- 1 (10 nM) and RSV (150 μM) using LC/MS/MS-Mud PIT (Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology). Results Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a vital metabolic pathway for cell cycle progression, was elevated and suppressed by IGF- 1 and RSV, respectively in the HT- 29 cell line. Enzymatic assays confirmed RSV suppression of glucose- 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (rate limiting) and transketolase, key enzymes of the PPP. RSV (150 μM) suppressed, whereas IGF- 1 (10 nM) elevated focal adhesion complex (FAC) proteins, talin and pFAK, critical for the cell-ECM communication. Western blotting analyses confirmed the suppression or elevation of these proteins in HT- 29 cancer cells <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> RSV or IGF- 1, respectively. Conclusions Proteomic analysis enabled us to establish PPP and the talin-pFAK as targets of RSV which suppress cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in the colon cancer cell line HT- 29.

40|$|Iron {{overload}} is {{the hallmark}} of hereditary hemochromatosis and a complication of iron-loading anemias such as β-thalassemia. Treatment can be burdensome and have significant side effects, and new therapeutic options are needed. Iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis and β-thalassemia intermedia is caused by hepcidin deficiency. Although transgenic hepcidin replacement in mouse models of these diseases prevents iron overload or decreases its potential toxicity, natural hepcidin is prohibitively expensive for human application and has unfavorable pharmacologic properties. Here, we report the rational design of hepcidin agonists based on the mutagenesis of hepcidin and the hepcidin-binding region of ferroportin and computer modeling of their docking. We identified specific hydrophobic/aromatic residues required for hepcidin-ferroportin binding and obtained evidence in vitro that a thiol-disulfide interaction between ferroportin C 326 and the hepcidin disulfide cage may stabilize binding. Guided by this model, we showed that 7 – 9 N-terminal amino acids of hepcidin, including a single thiol cysteine, comprised the minimal structure that retained hepcidin activity, as shown by the induction of ferroportin degradation in reporter cells. Further modifications to increase resistance to proteolysis and oral bioavailability yielded minihepcidins that, after parenteral or oral administration to mice, lowered serum iron levels comparably to those after parenteral native hepcidin. Moreover, liver iron concentrations were lower in mice chronically <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> minihepcidins than those in mice <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>solvent</b> alone.

Methods: Both genders of C 57 BL 6, BALB/C mice and Sprague Dawley rats; (10 animals in each group) were compared for induction of AHE to clarify which animal and gender were appropriate.

40|$|The pasting of {{commercial}} maize starches {{was found to}} be a biphasic phenomenon, exhibiting an expected first viscosity peak as well as an unexpected, relatively large second viscosity peak under specific cooking conditions when using a Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA). The second peak formed at long holding times (between 32 and 45 min), holding temperatures within the range of 82 to 95 °C, starch concentrations from 8 to 13 % {{with a wide range of}} initial heating rates (0 · 5 – 10 °C/min) and shear conditions (150 – 500 rev/min). The second pasting peak is attributed to the formation of complexes between amylose and low levels of lipid present in maize starch. When lipid was partially removed by extraction with methanol-chloroform (1 : 3 v/v), the second pasting peak disappeared. When, however, the starch sample was <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>solvent</b> and the solvent removed by evaporation, the second peak remained, but formed earlier. Increasing the holding temperature gave a slightly higher first viscosity peak, slightly earlier, and led to a decrease in the area and height of the second viscosity peak. Increasing heating rate also led to an earlier, slightly higher first peak and earlier but lower second viscosity peak. Increasing starch concentration led to an increase in height and area of both the first and second peaks and their later occurrence. Increasing shear led to a decrease in height and area of both the first and second peaks and their later appearance. 2000 Academic Pres...|$|R
