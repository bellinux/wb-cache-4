5|$|The couple {{bought the}} Georgian five-bay villa (built around 1830) for £48,000 at auction in 1968, {{along with its}} eight acres of land, and lived there until 1976. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{registered}} as a Grade II listed building in 1949 under the name Gladsmuir, previously known as Gladsmuir House. Jane Howard restored an earlier name, Lemmons; the next owners changed it back to Gladsmuir.|$|E
5|$|Between 1820 and 1828 {{the earl}} had {{converted}} the abandoned tennis {{court and the}} Castle Inn – which he closed in 1812 after buying the castle – into a new, grand building, called Castle House, overlooking {{the north side of}} the outer bailey. By the 1840s <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> leased out, first to George Hodges and his family, and then to William Urwick and to Robert Marston, all important members of the local landowning classes. The mansion included a drawing room, dining room, study, servants' quarters, a conservatory and grapevines, and in 1887 was worth £50 a year in rent.|$|E

5|$|In 1901 Gaudí {{decorated}} {{the house of}} Isabel Güell López, Marchioness of Castelldosrius, and daughter of Eusebi Güell. Situated at 19 Carrer Junta de Comerç, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> built in 1885 and renovated between 1901 and 1904; it was destroyed by a bomb during the Civil War. The following year Gaudí {{took part in the}} decoration of the Bar Torino, property of Flaminio Mezzalana, located at 18 Passeig de Gràcia; Gaudí designed the ornamentation of el Salón Árabe of that establishment, made with varnished Arabian-style cardboard tiles (which no longer exist).|$|E
5|$|Jane Howard {{found that}} the house had {{previously}} been called Lemmons, and decided to restore that name. It was known as Gladsmuir when they bought it—from Gladsmuir Heath, the former name of Hadley Common, site of the Battle of Barnet in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> registered under that name as a Grade II listed building in 1949, previously known as Gladsmuir House, with an address in Hadley Wood Road. As of 2014 the address was listed as Hadley Common.|$|E
5|$|Morrissey {{was born}} in the Kensington area of Liverpool, the son of Joe, a cobbler, and Joan, who worked for Littlewoods. He was their fourth child, {{following}} brothers Tony and Paul, and sister Karen Lane. The family lived at 45 Seldon Street, in the Kensington district of Liverpool. For National Museums Liverpool's Eight Hundred Lives project, Morrissey wrote that <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in his family since {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. His grandmother had been married there and his mother was born there. In 1971, the family moved to a larger, modern house on the new estates at Knotty Ash, and Seldon Street was later demolished.|$|E
50|$|The {{site is a}} 40 acre parcel near a small creek about 15 ft below <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Springs near <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dammed by a wall {{aligned with}} the piano bay's angled wall, forming a small pond. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{modified}} and somewhat enlarged, with consultation from Taliesin.|$|R

5|$|The manor of Southcote {{remained}} in the Blagrave family until the early 20th century, when it was owned by Henry Barry Blagrave. Henry died in 1927, though the manor house was demolished in 1921 after lying empty {{following the death of}} Wastel Brisco and his wife Sarah in 1891 and 1901 respectively. In 1920 <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> purchased by a contractor with intentions to demolish the site, though the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a committee to attempt to raise money to save the house. The Sphere reported that the bricks and oak panelling were in demand and were likely removed for re-use before the building's demolition.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenery and}} {{background}} of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources; car model types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus' abductors escaped the police were drawn from real examples, while Hergé closely adhered {{to the reality of}} the port and docks at Saint-Nazaire. Professor Tarragon's house was drawn from a real house in Avenue Delleur, Boitsfort, which Jacobs had identified for Hergé's purposes. Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves outside the house and completed a sketch of the building. Immediately after, two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up; <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Hergé realised that, had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching, they would have been interrogated.|$|E
5|$|Stern House, {{a private}} home in which Zionist leader Theodor Herzl had lodged {{overnight}} during his 1898 visit to Jerusalem. The house had become a Zionist shrine, with the room in which Herzl slept given over to photos and memorabilia from Herzl's life. Though <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> heavily damaged in the 1948 war, preservationists won a suit in the Israel Supreme Court to save it from demolition. The two-story masonry-block house, originally located at 18 Mamilla Street, was dismantled brick by brick and warehoused for ten years until builders were ready to reassemble it on Alrov Mamilla Avenue. Safdie left the colored numbers on the brick facades of this and other preserved houses to emphasize the preservation nature of the work. The Stern House presently houses a restaurant, bar, and Steimatzky bookstore.|$|E

5|$|The 1902 Education Act {{also made}} it a legal {{requirement}} for the County Council to provide an equal educational opportunity for girls. A conference was held in October 1903 to discuss the founding of a girls' school, and by January 1905 Wisbech High School for Girls was established in Harecroft House on the North Brink. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> donated on a long-term lease for the purpose by the Peckover family. Harecroft House had been built in 1844 by Algernon Peckover, and his descendants {{lived in the house}} until the death of Susannah Peckover in 1903, after which it was left vacant. The first headmistress was Beatrice Sparks, who was the first woman to complete the Oxford Tripos in mathematics. New schoolrooms were added to the High School in 1906, 1913, 1922 and 1936, when a mixed-use gymnasium and hall was constructed. This hall was, until recently, used as the school dining room and will from 2017 be the school's library. Originally, the High School was also able to take boarders, which continued until after World War II.|$|E
25|$|The {{same day}} the House also called for the United Nations & the Security Council to {{intervene}} in Libya {{in order to protect}} civilians & government institutions.

25|$|The {{shell of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{completed}} by 1913, when work stopped. Holms had lost {{money on a}} bad speculation, and a fall from a horse supposedly upset his mental balance. Further work {{was carried out in}} 1920, but the house was never completed. Nevertheless, Holms continued to live on the estate, giving dinner parties in the half-finished house.|$|E

25|$|The {{architectural}} style {{is described as}} Neoclassical, with other 20th century elements. The house was built as a wooden structure before 1864, when it was acquired by Domingo Paoli, the father of Antonio Paoli. By 1870, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> upgraded into a wood and brick masonry residence. In 1914 it was upgraded into the current brick and stucco structure by the prominent local architect and civil engineer Manuel V. Domenech.|$|E
25|$|After Kenneth Martin {{failed to}} report to his job at an {{electric}} company on December 9, 1958, the family was officially reported missing.

Bush for president and Richard Burr as United States Senator, Easley won his second term as governor and Democrats reestablished control over both chambers of the state legislature (<b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> split equally between the two major parties since 2003).|$|E
25|$|Sandycombe Lodge is a Grade II* listed {{house at}} 40 Sandycoombe Road, Twickenham, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. In the picturesque-cottage style, it was {{designed}} and built in 1813 by the artist J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851) as his country retreat and as a home for his father William (1745–1829). Turner lived there from 1814 to 1826. Originally known as Solus Lodge, {{it is the only}} surviving building designed by Turner, and shows the influence of his friend Sir John Soane.

25|$|Demolition of Ungdomshuset {{began at}} 8 am on 5 March 2007. A {{demolition}} crane started its {{work at the}} back of the house with the top floor. The logos on the crane were covered and workers wore masks to conceal their identity. The union representing Ungdomshuset was on the ground trying to persuade the workers to stop working and reveal the company they were working for. At 10am the Danish Working Environment Authority (Arbejdstilsynet) had the demolition interrupted due to reported concerns about dust and the potential presence of asbestos. The demolition resumed at 11am. At 4pm, about one-third of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> removed. The demolition was broadcast live by webcam on TV2 News' website.|$|E
