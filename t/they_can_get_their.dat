[...] But the town has changed {{as a number of}} Mormons have moved to Excellent, and the town's libertine ways are going away. After some time, the four African American Wisdom brothers (Homer, Blind Jude, Ulysses, and Virgil) arrive in Excellent. [...] Disagreement between the Mormon settlers and Ida Richilieu and her friends breaks out and descends into arson (the brothel is burned down, killing several of their friends) and murder (the four Wisdom brothers are killed). In the period after this tragedy, Ida Richilieu, Dellwood Barker, Alma Hatch, and Shed try to break out of their depression by consuming all the opium and alcohol <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> hands on.

For my part, I feel more cur'osity about the feeble-witted sister than about your beauty. There's something that comes close to a man's feelin's, when he meets with a fellow-creatur' that has all the outward show of an accountable mortal, and who fails of being what he seems, only through a lack of reason.

He might have had the pick of them at Basle,--or at Strasbourg either, for the matter of that; but he has thought my girl better than them all; and I love him for it--so I do. It was to be expected that a young fellow with means to please himself should choose to have a good-looking wife to sit at his table with him. Who'll blame him for that? And he has found the prettiest in all the country round. But he has wanted something more than good looks,--and he has got a great deal more. Yes; I say it, I, Michel Voss, though I am your uncle;--that he has got the pride of the whole country round. My darling, my own one, my child!' ...|$|E
