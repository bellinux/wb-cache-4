2500|$|In March 2005, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, {{charged with}} {{ensuring}} {{value for money}} in public spending, published a report concluding that it was [...] "impossible to determine" [...] whether the PPP was better value than a publicly run investment programme, {{primarily because of the}} untested periodic review structure of the 30-year contracts. These were to be revised every 7.5 years, meaning that the ultimate price for the promised £15.7 billion of investment was still unknown. It noted that using public bond finance would have saved £90 million a year in financing costs, even though the Government guaranteed repayment of 95% of costs in the event of premature termination, and the contracts placed limits and exemptions on financial risk transferred to the infrastructure companies. The system still received an annual public subsidy of £1 billion, but its spending was now determined entirely by the infracos' interpretation of their 2000-page PPP contracts. Although the private operators were expected to receive at least 18–20% returns on capital (for Metronet), for the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> associated with major upgrades, most of the work was low-risk maintenance and replacement. The public-sector procurement option (using private companies for specific major projects) would also have saved the £455 million cost of concluding the PPP contracts, not to mention the five years' delay the contract negotiations caused.|$|E

Conceptual distinction is made between the first modern and the second modern <b>type</b> <b>of</b> family <b>risk</b> {{as well as between}} its objective and subjective dimensions. The major finding in terms of variation <b>of</b> family <b>risks</b> is that the second-modern <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> is more conspicuous than the first-modern one in Seoul and Tokyo whereas the reverse is the case in Beijing. Yet these two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> coexist in all three cities. The contextualized relationship between the objective and subjective dimensions shows the tendency that the risk perception moves up or down in a way reflecting the official statistics <b>of</b> family <b>risks.</b> We argue that this pattern of contextualization can be explained by social construction <b>of</b> <b>risks...</b>|$|R

50|$|From another perspective, {{the farmer}} and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the futures contract: the farmer {{reduces the risk}} that the price of wheat will fall below the price {{specified}} in the contract and acquires {{the risk that the}} price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract (thereby losing additional income that he could have earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is the insurer (risk taker) for one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> and the counter-party is the insurer (risk taker) for another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E

We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> higher-order <b>risk</b> vulnerabilities and explain their behavioral implications. We find that as in the case <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> vulnerability, all familiar HARA utility functions have all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> higher-order <b>risk</b> vulnerabilities except for a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> third-order <b>risk</b> vulnerability corresponding to a downside risk aversion measure called the Schwarzian derivative...|$|R

50|$|Management of {{security}} risks applies {{the principles of}} risk management to the management {{of security}} threats. It consists of identifying threats (or risk causes), assessing the effectiveness of existing controls to face those threats, determining the risks' consequence(s), prioritizing the risks by rating the likelihood and impact, classifying the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> and selecting an appropriate risk option or risk response.|$|E

The present study aims to analyze different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> management strategies and throws some light on challenges and opportunities regarding implementation of Basel-II in international financial system. The present paper also attempts to discuss the different methods and techniques used to measure financial risk management.

50|$|For the {{contract}} to be valid, however, the parties must in fact agree on every term each of them regards as being a non-severable part of the proposed contract.
