50|$|<b>Trimegestone</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2001.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimegestone</b> is marketed in {{combination}} with an estrogen under the brand names Ondeva and Totelle Sekvens.|$|E
50|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} of <b>trimegestone</b> is 100%. Its elimination half-life is 13.8 hours. It is metabolized mainly via hydroxylation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimegestone</b> is marketed in France and Sweden and {{possibly}} also in other European countries. It {{is not available}} in the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimegestone</b> is a 19-norpregnane steroid and a {{derivative}} of 19-norprogesterone (19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) and 17α-methylprogesterone. It {{is also known}} as 21(S)-hydroxy-17α,21-dimethyl-9-dehydro-19-norprogesterone? or 21(S)-hydroxy-17α,21-dimethyl-19-norpregna-4,9-dien-3,20-dione?, as well as 17β-(S)-lactoyl-17α-methylestra-4,9-dien-3-one or 17β-((S)-2-hydroxypropanoyl)-17α-methylestra-4,9-dien-3-one.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimegestone</b> {{has very}} high {{affinity}} for the progesterone receptor, only weak {{affinity for the}} mineralocorticoid receptor, and little or no affinity for other steroid hormone receptors. In accordance, it {{is described as a}} very potent and pure progestogen, in fact the most potent progestin of the 19-norprogesterone group (clinically effective in endometriosis at only 0.1 mg/day), and possesses weak antimineralocorticoid activity and no androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, or glucocorticoid activity. Unlike progesterone, <b>trimegestone</b> does not metabolize into neurosteroids and hence does not influence GABAA receptor signaling or produce sedative side effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimegestone</b> (INN) (brand names Ondeva, Totelle Sekvens (both in {{combination}} with estrogen)) is a steroidal progestin of the 19-norprogesterone group related to promegestone which is marketed in Europe as a hormonal contraceptive and for use in hormonal replacement therapy for postmenopausal symptoms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimegestone</b> {{is closely}} related {{structurally}} to the 19-norprogesterone and 17α-methylprogesterone derivatives demegestone and promegestone and {{is also known as}} 21-hydroxypromegestone. It is also related to the 19-norprogesterone derivatives gestonorone caproate, nomegestrol acetate, norgestomet, and segesterone acetate and to the 17α-methylprogesterone derivative medrogestone.|$|E
5000|$|... 19-Norpregnane, {{also known}} as 13β-methyl-17β-ethylgonane, is a norsteroid and the 19-demethyl {{analogue}} of pregnane. It is the parent compound of 19-norprogesterone (19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) and derivatives of it such as the progestins demegestone, gestonorone caproate (gestronol hexanoate), nomegestrol acetate, norgestomet, promegestone, segesterone acetate (nestorone), and <b>trimegestone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 19-Norprogesterone is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a group}} of medically used progestins, which includes nomegestrol acetate, promegestone, <b>trimegestone,</b> demegestone, gestonorone caproate, segesterone acetate (nestorone), and norgestomet (veterinary). In addition, the testosterone analogue of 19-norprogesterone, 19-nortestosterone (also known as nandrolone), is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and progestogen, and is the parent compound of a large group of AAS and progestins that includes norethisterone.|$|E
50|$|The {{observation}} of two-fold improved potency of 17α-MP relative to progesterone led to {{renewed interest in}} 17α-substituted derivatives of progesterone. Subsequently, hydroxyprogesterone acetate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate were synthesized in 1953 and introduced in 1956 and 1957, respectively, and medroxyprogesterone acetate was discovered in 1956 and introduced in 1959. In addition, though 17α-MP itself was never introduced for medical use, progestogen derivatives of the compound, including medrogestone (1966) and the 19-norprogesterone derivatives demegestone (1974), promegestone (1983), and <b>trimegestone</b> (2001), have been marketed.|$|E
40|$|The health {{benefits}} of long term postmenopausal HRT are well recognised, but the re-initiation of cyclical bleeding, especially when irregular or heavy, has {{a profound impact on}} continuation rates. In this thesis, this clinical problem was investigated in 256 postmenopausal women who participated in a randomised dose ranging study of sequentially administered <b>trimegestone</b> (4 doses) with continuous micronised oestradiol, for 6 months.;A strong dose dependent modulation of the bleeding pattern was documented. Women in the higher <b>trimegestone</b> dose groups had better bleeding patterns compared to those on the lower doses. This was subsequently confirmed when 134 women completed a further 6 months' extraction study with a single dose of <b>trimegestone</b> (0. 25 mg). The presence of submucous fibroids in 176 women predicted the occurrence of abnormal bleeding pattern, however, the dose of <b>trimegestone</b> remained the dominant factor.;These clinical data led to detailed histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the endometrial samples collected on day 24 of the last treatment cycle.;The majority of the results showed remarkable similarities between the test endometria and the natural cycle. None of the parameters clearly demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of <b>trimegestone.</b> When the expression of metalloproteinases - 1 and - 3 were assessed in specimens from women who received the highest and the lowest dose of <b>trimegestone,</b> where the bleeding pattern was completely different, no dose effect was demonstrated.;These conclusions led me to question the ability to demonstrate this apparent similarity of endometrial effect between <b>trimegestone</b> and progesterone. For this I have developed a primary stromal cell culture system, and examined the expression of MMP- 1, and - 3 mRNA in these cells. Similarity between <b>trimegestone</b> and progesterone was again demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown that hormone therapy (HT) {{increases}} the risk of venous thromboembolism in post menopausal women. The mechanism of this increased risk is unknown; however, activation of the haemostatic system is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism. In post-menopausal women the estrogen /progestogen composition of the HT can influence the level of haemostatic activation. It was the objective of this study to compare changes in inhibitors and activation markers of the haemostatic system in healthy post-menopausal women taking estradiol (2 mg) combined with dydrogesterone or a new progestin, <b>trimegestone.</b> A multicentre study of 186 women randomised to six months therapy with either estradiol (2 mg) +trimegestone (0. 5 mg) or estradiol (2 mg) +dydrogesterone (10 mg) was performed. Antithrombin and protein S activity was decreased and activated protein C (APC) resistance, D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1. 2, were increased in both groups on treatment. Protein C activity was decreased and plasmin-antiplasmin complex was increased in the <b>trimegestone</b> group only. The increase in plasmin-antiplasmin complex and D-dimer was greater after six cycles of treatment in the <b>trimegestone</b> group compared with the dydrogesterone group. In conclusion, decreased levels of inhibitors of blood coagulation and increased thrombin production were found in both groups however a greater increase in the levels of plasmin-antiplasmin complex and D-dimer was found in the <b>trimegestone</b> group. This suggests an enhanced fibrinolytic response in this group. Further studies are required to determine the significance of this finding with respect to venous thrombosis risk. © 2008 Schattauer GmbH...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To study {{cardiovascular}} risk markers {{in women}} taking estradiol/trimegestone or estradiol/dydrogesterone. Design: Multicenter, randomized, prospective, double-blind study of 184 healthy post-menopausal women randomized to 6 cycles of either estradiol (2 mg) + <b>trimegestone</b> (0. 5 mg) (T-group) or estradiol (2 mg) + dydrogesterone (10 mg) (DYDR group). Cardiovascular risk markers were measured before, after cycle 1, 3 and 6 and at 4 weeks post-treatment. Results: Fibrinogen was reduced {{in both groups}} but more markedly in the DYDR group. Factor VIIc activity levels decreased in both groups with a greater change in the T-group. Factor VII antigen was increased in both groups with a greater increase in the DYDR group. Factor VIIa was increased in the DYDR group only. Plasminogen levels were also increased in both groups with a greater increase in the T-group. There were no statistically significant changes in lipid variables between the different regimens. Changes in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were correlated positively with changes in factor VIIc in the DYDR group and negatively with changes in factor VIIc in the T-group. Trigemestone {{was associated with a}} better bleeding pattern. Conclusions: <b>Trimegestone</b> was associated with less procoagulant changes in factor VIIa and factor VIIc activity and larger decrease in PAI- 1 activity compared with the dydrogesterone preparation. These results reflect less androgenic properties of the <b>trimegestone</b> preparation. The fibrinogen level and Lp(a) were more decreased during dydrogesterone treatment. Further investigation is required to clarify the relative importance of beneficial effects with respect to cardiovascular risk. © 2009...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar o efeito da trimegestona sobre a proliferação celular do tecido mamário de ratas castradas. MÉTODOS: Foram utilizadas 45 ratas adultas e virgens, da linhagem Wistar, submetidas à castração. Após o 60 º dia da castração, confirmado o hipoestrogenismo, os animais foram divididos aleatoriamente em três grupos, {{conforme}} o tratamento proposto: controle (n= 15) recebeu soro fisiológico 0, 9 %; estrogênio (n= 15) recebeu 17 beta-estradiol; e combinado (n= 15) recebeu 17 beta-estradiol associado à trimegestona, todos por 60 dias consecutivos. Após o término do tratamento, procedeu-se a exérese das mamas inguinais, destinadas a análise morfométrica pela coloração de hematoxilina e eosina (HE) e imuno-histoquímica pela quantificação do anticorpo anti-PCNA no tecido mamário, seguido de eutanásia. Os parâmetros morfométricos avaliados foram: proliferação celular epitelial, atividade secretora e alteração do estroma mamário. Ocorreram nove óbitos durante o experimento. As variáveis foram submetidas à análise estatística adotando-se como significante p PURPOSE: To {{evaluate the}} efect of <b>trimegestone</b> on the histological {{changes of the}} mammary tissue of castrated rats. METHODS: Forty-five virgin female Wistar rats were used after oophorectomy. Sixty days after surgery, with hypoestrogenisms confirmed, the experimental rats {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups of 15 animals each, when then the specific treatment for each group was started. The control group (C) and experimental groups 1 and 2 respectively received 0. 9 % saline solution, 17 -beta-estradiol and 17 -beta-estradiol in combination with <b>trimegestone</b> for 60 consecutive days. After the end of treatment, the inguinal mammary glands were removed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for morphometry and examined by immunohistochemistry for the quantification of anti-PCNA antibody in the mammary tissue, followed by euthanasia. The morphometric parameters evaluated were: epithelium cell-proliferation, secretor activity and mammary stroma changes. There were nine deaths during the experiment. The variables were submitted to statistical analysis adopting the 0. 05 level of significance. RESULTS:Histological changes were observed in 16 / 36 rats, mild epithelial hyperplasia in 13 / 36, moderate epithelial hyperplasia in 3 / 36, with no cases of severe epithelial hyperplasia. Stromal fibrosis was found in 10 / 36 and secretory activity in 5 / 36 rats. All morphometric variables were significant in the estrogen group compared to control (p= 0. 0361), although there were no difference between the group receiving combined treatment and the controls (p= 0. 405). The immunohistochemical analysis showed no difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS:The hormones administered to castrated rats, i. e., 17 beta-estradiol alone or in combination with <b>trimegestone,</b> increased the proliferation of breast cells, but this effect appeared to be lower in the combined treatment, the same occurring regarding fibrosis of the mammary stroma...|$|E
40|$|ReviewSynthetic progestins {{are used}} by {{millions}} of women as contraceptives and in hormone replacement therapy (HRT), although their molecular mechanisms of action are not well understood. The importance of investigating these mechanisms, as compared to those of progesterone, has been highlighted by clinical evidence showing that medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), a first generation progestin, {{increases the risk of}} breast cancer and coronary heart disease in HRT users. A diverse range of later generation progestins with varying structures and pharmacological properties is available for therapeutic use and it is becoming clear that different progestins elicit beneficial and adverse effects to different extents. These differences in biological activity are likely to be due to many factors including variations in dose, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and regulation of, and/or binding, to serum-binding proteins and steroidogenic enzymes. Since the intracellular effects on gene expression and cell signaling of steroids are mediated via intracellular steroid receptors, differential actions via the progesterone and other steroid receptors and their isoforms, are likely to be the major cause of differential intracellular actions of progestins. Since many progestins bind not only to the progesterone receptor, but also to the glucocorticoid, androgen, mineralocorticoid, and possibly the estrogen receptors, it is plausible that synthetic progestins exert therapeutic actions as well as side-effects via some of these receptors. Here we review the molecular mechanisms of intracellular actions of old (MPA, norethisterone, levonorgestrel, gestodene) vs. new (drospirenone, dienogest, <b>trimegestone)</b> generation progestins, via steroid receptors. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The progestins have {{different}} pharmacologic properties {{depending upon the}} parent molecule, usually testosterone or progesterone (P), from which they are derived. Very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce con-siderable differences in {{the activity of the}} derivative. In hormonal contraceptives, progestins represent the major agent designed for suppressing ovulation and are used in combination with estrogen (E) usually ethinyl-estradiol (EE). The development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. Steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone receptor (PR) agonists have been synthesized as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. Several new progestins, have been synthesized in the last two decades. These include dienogest (DNG), drospirenone (DRSP), Nestorone (NES), nomegestrol acetate (NOMAc) and <b>trimegestone</b> (TMG). These new progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone P. DRSP differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from spirolactone. It is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. The antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. TMG and NES are the most potent progestins synthesized to date, followed by two of the older progestins, keto-desogestrel (keto-DSG) and levonorgestrel (LNG). The new mole-cules TMG, DRSP and DNG also have antiandrogenic activity. Striking differences exist regarding the side effects among the progestins and the combination with EE leads to other reactions related to the E itself and whether th...|$|E
