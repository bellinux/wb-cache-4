Isaac was {{the oldest of the}} biblical patriarchs {{at the time of his}} death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{said that}} the scariest moment of his career was when he {{attempted}} to pitch while sober in a 1973 game. During pre-game warmups, he could not recreate his pitching mechanics. Ellis went to his locker, took some amphetamines with coffee, and returned to pitch. In August 1973, pictures circulated of Ellis wearing hair curlers in the bullpen during pre-game warmups. The Pirates <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> wear curlers on the field again. Ellis agreed, but charged that the Pirates were displaying racism. Ebony devoted a spread to Ellis about his hairstyles, which {{was inspired by the}} hair curlers.|$|E

Emma reluctantly agrees, and learns from Ruby (Meghan Ory) that she should stop by the home of her ex-boyfriend Sean (Phillipps). Emma goes there and speaks to Sean and his father, finding {{out that it is}} the latter that has <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get involved with the pregnant teenager. Emma discovers that Ruby has given her car to Ashley so that she can leave Storybrooke and head to Boston. Emma and Henry (Jared S.

25|$|Hartness had an {{unpleasant}} experience at Union Hardware: {{he had been}} understandably naive about arranging for royalties on his patents, and the business owners chose not to help rectify the oversight.

When Mame Chiekh Ibra Fall was taking a haircut, S.Touba <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> take a haircut today, {{because it is not}} a day to take a haircut and he didn't take a haircut because he didn't have permission.|$|E

Boycott pushed a ball from Peter Philpott away with his hand during his innings, but Brian Booth refused to appeal for handled the ball and Wally Grout just <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do it again.

5000|$|Mary {{resided in}} [...] "her own house" [...] in Nazareth in Galilee, {{possibly}} with her parents, and during her betrothal — {{the first stage}} of a Jewish marriage — the angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah by conceiving him through the Holy Spirit, and, after initially expressing incredulity at the announcement, she responded, [...] "I am the handmaid of the Lord.

[...] Joseph planned to quietly divorce her, but was told her conception was by the Holy Spirit in a dream by [...] "an angel of the Lord"; the angel <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> hesitate <b>to</b> take her as his wife, which Joseph did, thereby formally completing the wedding rites.|$|R
25|$|As {{related in}} chapter 2, Loki, under {{the service of}} Odin, found out about Freyja's actions and told Odin. Odin told Loki to get the {{necklace}} {{and bring it to}} him. Loki said that since no one could enter Freyja's bower against her will, this wouldn't be an easy task, yet Odin <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come back until he had found a way to get the necklace. Howling, Loki turned away and went to Freyja's bower but found it locked, and that he couldn't enter. So Loki transformed himself into a fly, and after having trouble finding even the tiniest of entrances, he managed to find a tiny hole at the gable-top, yet even here he had to squeeze through to enter.|$|E
25|$|In The Concept of Anxiety, Haufniensis {{focuses on}} the first anxiety {{experienced}} by man: Adam's choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts {{of good and evil}} did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed original sin, Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What he did know was that God <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> eat from the tree. The anxiety {{comes from the fact that}} God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is anxiety that leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin.|$|E
25|$|Elijah {{encounters}} Ahab {{again in}} , after Ahab has acquired {{possession of a}} vineyard by murder. Ahab desires to have the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters, in Ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.|$|E

25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{to say that}} before God formed him in the womb, God knew him, sanctified him, and {{appointed}} him a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah protested {{that he could not}} speak, for he was a child, but God <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fear, for he would go wherever God would send him, say whatever God would command him to say, and God would be with him to deliver him. Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had put words in his mouth and set him over the nations to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he saw, he replied that he saw the rod of an almond tree, and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Kallinger often {{rebelled against}} his {{teachers}} and his adoptive parents. He dreamed {{of becoming a}} playwright, and had played the part of Ebenezer Scrooge in the local YWCA's performance of A Christmas Carol in the ninth grade. When Kallinger was 15, he began dating a girl named Hilda Bergman, whom he met at a theater which {{he was allowed to}} visit on Saturdays. His parents <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see her, but he married her and had two children with her. She later left him because of the domestic violence she suffered at his hands. Kallinger was hospitalized at St. Mary's on September 4, 1957 due to severe headaches and loss of appetite which doctors believed was a result of stress surrounding his divorce. Kallinger remarried on April 20, 1958 and had five children with his second wife. He was extremely abusive towards his family, and often inflicted the same punishments on them that he had suffered from his adoptive parents.|$|E
25|$|Clemente {{spent much}} of his time during the {{off-season}} involved in charity work. When Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, was affected by a massive earthquake on December 23, 1972, Clemente (who visited Managua three weeks before the quake) immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors. The airplane he chartered for a New Year's Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and subpar flight personnel, and was overloaded by 4,200 pounds. It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972 due to engine failure. A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case apparently belonging to Clemente was the only personal item recovered from the plane. Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguillén was {{the only member of the}} Pirates not to attend Roberto's memorial service. The Pirates catcher chose instead to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four-engine plane, were never recovered. Montreal Expos pitcher Tom Walker, then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico (in a league later named after Clemente), helped Clemente load the plane, but either because of the plane's weight load or because he wanted Walker, who was single, to go enjoy New Year's, Clemente <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> join him on the flight. Walker's son is current Milwaukee Brewers second baseman and former Met and Pirate Neil Walker.|$|E

30|$|One lime boss described: now {{if someone}} owes me {{hundreds}} of thousands of RMB, they do <b>not</b> even need <b>to</b> leave me a note. All the contracts, except the ones for outsourcing, are all based on oral agreements. For now, we mainly deal with those people who we had previous transactions and are reliable, and we maintain good relations… for instance, the large deal we had last year with a coal mining company was introduced by a friend, and all the transactions we had were made through oral contracts, which often involves millions of RMB. At once, he owed me several {{hundreds of thousands}} of RMB, but he paid back most of the debt {{by the end of the}} year. So when he was still short of a couple of thousands of RMB at the end of last year and he proposed to give me a note, I just <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> even <b>to</b> bother, as long as he remembers to pay me back in full next time (Interview record 20090313 – LMQ).|$|R

50|$|After Satan {{has given}} up trying to turn Job away from the Lord, God removed Job's affliction and {{returned}} his family to him, doubling them in number. He returned Job's wealth and showered Job with gold. Once Job's wife had seen her husband restored to prosperity and health, she prayed thanks to God but then worried over the oath her husband had taken earlier, in which he had promised to beat her with a hundred strokes. Job was also deeply grieved over the oath he had taken, amidst his suffering. God, however, sent a revelation to Job, which <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> beat his wife but to gently hit her with a bundle of soft grass.|$|R

Astro is drained out of energy and falls {{unconscious}} at Atlas’ feet. About to destroy him, Atlas forgives him remembering of Livian's words who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> take advantage of weak people.

It then sent him to anoint himself and bathe before he slept, so he would be whole on the morning. He did this, and went on to rescue the second, and the youngest daughter.
