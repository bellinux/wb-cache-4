50|$|In the Second World War, all shower valves for British {{military}} {{use were}} made by them. By 1950 the Leonard brand of shower equipment was becoming the main brand used for institutional buildings - schools and hospitals.

The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> were not just used for showers but for general heating of water, including their thermostatic steam water heaters.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{synthesise}} {{and evaluate}} {{the evidence of the}} effectiveness of interventions to prevent scalds in children. MethodsAn overview of systematic reviews (SR) and a SR of primary studies were performed evaluating interventions to prevent scalds in children. A comprehensive literature search was conducted covering various resources up to October 2012. Experimental and controlled observational studies reporting scald injuries, safety practices and safety equipment use were included. ResultsFourteen systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included. There is little evidence that interventions are effective in reducing the incidence of scalds in children. More evidence was found that inventions are effective in promoting safe hot tap water temperature, especially when home safety education, home safety checks and discounted or free safety equipment including thermometers and <b>thermostatic</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> were provided. No consistent evidence was found for the effectiveness of interventions on the safe handling of hot food or drinks nor improving kitchen safety practices. ConclusionEducation, home safety checks along with thermometers or <b>thermostatic</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> should be promoted to reduce tap water scalds. Further research is needed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} interventions on scald injuries and to disentangle the effects of multifaceted interventions on scald injuries and safety practices...|$|R
50|$|It is {{increasingly}} common practice {{around the world}} to regulate the storage water temperature to above 60 °C (140 °F), and to circulate or distribute water at a temperature less than 50 °C (122 °F). Water above these temperatures can cause scald injuries. Many countries, states, or municipalities now require that the temperature of all bath water in newly built and extensively refurbished domestic properties be controlled to a maximum of 48 °C (118 °F). Installing <b>thermostatic</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> can ensure that water is delivered at the required temperature, thereby reducing the risk of scalding accidents; it also reduces hot water consumption from a supply that is maintained at a higher temperature.|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>thermostatic</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> (TMVs) in reducing bath hot tap water temperature, assess acceptability of TMVs to families and impact on bath time safety practices. Design Pragmatic parallel arm randomised controlled trial. Setting A social housing organisation in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. Participants 124 families {{with at least one}} child under 5 years. Intervention A TMV fitted by a qualified plumber and educational leaflets before and at the time of TMV fitting. Main outcome measures Bath hot tap water temperature at 3 -month and 12 -month post-intervention or randomisation, acceptability, problems with TMVs and bath time safety practices. Results Intervention arm families had a significantly lower bath hot water temperature at 3 -month and 12 -month follow-up than families in the control arm (3 months: intervention arm median 45. 0 °C, control arm median 56. 0 °C, difference between medians, − 11. 0, 95...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{measure the}} water {{temperature}} issuing from {{a representative sample of}} patient-accessible outlets around the Royal Adelaide Hospital. To initiate an audit cycle in the event of unacceptably high water temperatures to ensure their reduction. Methods: Samples were taken of water issuing from hot taps, showers, and hand hygiene basins in patient areas throughout the hospital, encompassing newly renovated as well as old sections of the hospital. A 45 second “warming ” period was followed by hot water collection into a polystyrene cup to 8 cm. The mean of 3 temperatures measured using an infrared thermometer was calculated. Results: Several taps and patient showers were demonstrated to supply water at a temperature capable of causing scald injuries. Most problem outlets were found in the oldest section of the hospital, fewer in the wing of “intermediate ” age and none in the most recently renovated emergency block. The data were tabulated and summarized before being passed on to RAH Engineering and Building Services, which initiated remedial action. Several <b>thermostatic</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> were found to be faulty (and replaced) or poorly set (and re-set). After this adjustment, outlets previously supplying excessively hot water were re-tested and found to be safe...|$|R
50|$|Water for baths, {{sinks and}} basins can be {{provided}} by separate hot and cold taps; this arrangement is common in older installations, particularly in public washrooms/lavatories and utility rooms/laundries. In kitchens and bathrooms, mixer taps are commonly used. In this case, hot and cold water from the two <b>valves</b> is <b>mixed</b> before reaching the outlet, allowing the water to emerge at any temperature between that of the hot and cold water supplies. Mixer taps were invented by Thomas Campbell of Saint John, New Brunswick, and patented in 1880.For baths and showers, mixer taps frequently incorporate some sort of pressure balancing feature so that the hot/cold mixture ratio will not be affected by transient changes in the pressure of one or other of the supplies. This helps avoid scalding or uncomfortable chilling as other water loads occur (such as the flushing of a toilet).Rather than two separate valves, mixer taps frequently use a single, more complex, valve controlled by a single handle (single handle mixer). The handle moves up and down to control {{the amount of water}} flow and from side to side to control the temperature of the water. Especially for baths and showers, the latest designs are <b>thermostatic</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> that do this using a built-in thermostat, and can be mechanical or electronic. There are also faucets with color LEDs to show the temperature of the water.|$|R

40|$|Many {{physiological}} experiments involve switching {{between two}} or more solutions. For example, when drugs are applied to tissues the concentration of the drug is usually changed as a step function, by switching from a control saline to a saline containing the drug.
