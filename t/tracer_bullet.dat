5|$|In other media, the {{television}} series Sledge Hammer! (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with {{such topics as}} capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. Sesame Street (1969–curr.) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog as a private eye; the sketches refer {{to some of the}} typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor's radio program A Prairie Home Companion features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor's show). Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger has trod the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as Garfield's Babes and Bullets (1989) and comic strip characters such as <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet</b> of Calvin and Hobbes have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet</b> is a hard-boiled private {{investigator}} styled after film noir and detective fiction stereotypes, such as Sam Spade of The Maltese Falcon or Philip Marlowe, who spouts incisive metaphors and wears a trench coat and fedora. He resembles Calvin, though the Frank Miller-like high-contrast art style Watterson uses in the <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet</b> strips obscures Bullet's features. Watterson considered this style dramatic but regarded it as time-consuming, {{and that the}} human eye has {{to work hard to}} study predominantly dark spaces, so he drew few <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet</b> strips. There have been only three strip sequences that involved <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet.</b> <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet</b> owns at least three guns: a [...]38 revolver, a [...]44 Magnum and a [...]45 handgun.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet</b> only {{appeared}} twice more. In {{his second}} appearance, Calvin has {{to solve a}} problem on a math test and imagines the process as <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet.</b> He last appeared in a story wherein Calvin and Hobbes break a lamp during a football game.|$|E

5000|$|The {{standard}} combat ammunition mix for the M60 {{consists of}} four ball (M80) cartridges and one tracer (M62) in belts of 100 rounds. The four-to-one ratio theoretically allows the gunner to accurately [...] "walk" [...] the fire into the enemy. <b>Tracer</b> <b>bullets</b> do not fly quite the same trajectory as ball, and weapon's sights must be used for accurate fire—particularly at ranges in excess of 800 meters, where 7.62×51mm NATO <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets</b> usually burn out and are no longer visible. This {{is a problem for}} all weapons in this caliber using this tracer round.|$|R
50|$|American forces retook {{the fort}} from the Japanese during {{the liberation of}} the Philippines in 1945. The American troops pumped two parts diesel oil and one part {{gasoline}} into the mortar pits, stood off, and ignited mixture with <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the comic}} strip Calvin and Hobbes, the protagonist, Calvin, has several alter egos {{including}} Spaceman Spiff, Stupendous Man, <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet,</b> and others who appear less frequently.|$|E
50|$|Variant of the T-46, a <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet</b> {{designed}} for fire adjustment and target designation. The bullet has a green tip, and the tracer burns for 3 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Watterson {{first used}} <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet</b> {{in a story}} where Calvin has Hobbes cut his hair because, [...] "the barber never cuts it the way likes," [...] and ends up bald. This story {{turned out to be}} one of Watterson's favorites: the sight of Calvin's haircut was one of the few times his own work made him laugh aloud, and Calvin's use of a fedora to cover his head led to the {{introduction}} of <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet.</b> Watterson would later lament, [...] "Would that I could write like this more often" [...] (Tenth Anniversary Book).|$|E
5000|$|We {{shot down}} the plane legally... Later {{we began to}} lie about small details: the plane was {{supposedly}} flying without running lights or strobe light, that <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets</b> were fired, or that I had radio contact {{with them on the}} emergency frequency of 121.5 megahertz.|$|R
50|$|The Pre-Crisis {{version of}} Terra-Man has an altered {{physiology}} that slows down his aging process, and {{allows him to}} survive unprotected in space. He wields a special six-shooter that can fire <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets,</b> energy-leeching tumbleweeds, and laser lassos. Terra-Man uses an Arguvian Space Steed named Nova as his mode of transportation.|$|R
50|$|In the Second World War, a 1943 air battle left three farms ablaze from <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets.</b> Between Bergenhausen and Pleizenhausen lay a camp {{run by the}} Nazi Reichsarbeitsdienst, {{which was}} utterly {{destroyed}} by bombing in 1945. Since 1946, Pleizenhausen {{has been part of}} the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.|$|R
50|$|Production was {{suspended}} during World War I {{and during the}} conflict Captain Buckingham, the company owner, gained fame as {{the inventor of the}} <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet,</b> which was used against airships.|$|E
50|$|In 1940 he {{emigrated to}} Canada {{to work at}} one of the munitions {{factories}} there to perfect <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet</b> techniques and then became a scientific adviser to the Canadian Government War Department.|$|E

50|$|During a {{squadron}} dogfight on 21 April 1918 in the Somme River valley, LeBoutillier, Robert Foster, and Merrill Samuel Taylor shot down an Albatros two-seater and sparked a running dogfight during which Captain Roy Brown {{claimed to have}} downed Manfred von Richthofen. LeBoutillier claimed to have witnessed Brown's <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets</b> penetrating Richthofen's cockpit. Immediately after its crash, LeBoutillier flew over the triplane of von Richthofen.|$|R
500|$|Enterprise {{launched}} {{aircraft to}} patrol Ford Island {{and search for}} Japanese carriers. Five American pilots returning from missions to hunt down the Japanese fleet were mistakenly shot down by Ford Island anti-aircraft gunners while attempting to land. The island's commanding officer said about the friendly-fire losses, [...] "Somebody let fly and I never saw so many bullets {{in the air in}} my life and never expect to... all <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets</b> at night." ...|$|R
2500|$|....When enemy search {{lights are}} {{sweeping}} the sky searching for one, {{it is best}} to refrain from shooting till they actually find and hold the light on the plane, for the <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets</b> are an aid to the searchers in locating the fliers position.

5000|$|Calvin {{frequently}} imagines {{himself as}} other human characters with super powers, usually to avoid difficult situations (like school tests). His alter egos are: Stupendous Man, <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet,</b> and Spaceman Spiff. Stupendous Man is when Calvin {{puts on a}} mask and cape and pretends to have super powers, often picturing his mom, babysitter, or teacher as villains. <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet</b> is when Calvin is a private eye and takes [...] "cases," [...] usually from his mom or teacher. As Spaceman Spiff, Calvin frequently crashes his spacecraft and is left on alien planets. Later Watterson said he regretted creating the Spaceman Spiff character {{due to lack of}} flexibility and humor.|$|E
5000|$|Tracers {{can also}} serve to direct fire at a given target, because it is visible to other combatants. The {{disadvantage}} is that they betray the gunner's position; the tracer path leads back to its source. To {{make it more difficult}} for an enemy to do this, most modern tracers have a delay element, which results in the trace becoming visible some distance from the muzzle. Depending on the target, <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet</b> lethality may be similar to standard ball ammunition. [...] The forward portion of a <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet</b> contains a substantial slug of lead filler, nearly as much as the non-tracer ball round that it trajectory matches. [...] In the case of the M196/M193 bullet set, the lethality differences are probably negligible for this reason. However, with the M856/M855 bullet set, the M855 ball round contains a steel penetrator tip that is not present in the M856 <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet.</b> As a result, different lethality effects can be expected against various targets. Nevertheless, under some circumstances, a slight degradation in lethality can often be made up for by the psychological and suppressive-fire effects tracer bullets can have on an enemy who is receiving them.|$|E
5000|$|With an MCLOS missile, the {{operator}} must track the missile and the target simultaneously and guide the missile to the target. Typically the missile is steered with a joystick, and its path is observed through a periscope-type telescopic sight. The missiles are usually equipped with a magnesium flare in the base that automatically ignites upon launch and allows the gunner to visually track the fast-moving missile {{in a manner similar}} in concept to a <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet.</b>|$|E

25|$|Before the Tomcat's {{could be}} {{launched}} {{they had to}} have their radar-guided missiles removed and simpler weapons including <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets</b> installed. Around this time, Israeli intelligence agents found that the plane carrying the hijackers was an EgyptAir Boeing 737, flight 2843. They also determined its tail number and departure time. The information was passed onto Oliver North, relayed to the Pentagon, who relayed it to the Sixth Fleet, who relayed it to the Saratoga. The Hawkeye crew received the information before taking off.|$|R
5000|$|Garfield: His 9 Lives was {{published}} by Ballantine Books under the Garfield franchise in 1984, with creator Jim Davis writing {{he and his staff}} wrote the book to explore the character beyond what could be achieved in the comic strip. Ron Tuthill wrote the [...] "Babes and Bullets: The Continuing Adventures of Sam Spayed" [...] chapter, illustrated by Kevin Campbell. Film noir parodies were popular in films, with Sam Spayed and <b>Tracer</b> <b>Bullet</b> in Calvin and Hobbes marking the parody's crossover to comic strips.|$|E
50|$|On February 29, 1960, {{while at}} his home in Florence, South Carolina, Purvis died from a gunshot wound to the head fired from the pistol given to him by fellow agents when he {{resigned}} from the FBI. The FBI investigated his death and declared it a suicide, although the official coroner's report did not label the cause of death as such. A later investigation suggested that Purvis may have shot himself accidentally while trying to extract a <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet</b> jammed in the pistol. He was 56 years old.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{stories by}} Judge Dredd creator John Wagner have added a stun bullet, while stories by Gordon Rennie have {{included}} a stunner beam (which doesn't always work) and an [...] "exorcist" [...] bullet for use against supernatural enemies. These {{and the six}} modes of fire listed above are canon. The Judge Dredd audio drama Wanted: Dredd Or Alive has a <b>Tracer</b> <b>bullet,</b> which allows Judges to electronically track what they've shot. One story had a judge fire a marker shell, a round which tags its target with green paint.|$|E
50|$|When I {{went into}} the street, I saw a nightmarish spectacle. Red <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets</b> {{streaked}} through the night air. The four-story Savoy Hotel, illuminated by floodlights, was surrounded by troops, local police and border police in full battle regalia. Military vehicles, armored cars and personnel carriers clogged the surrounding streets. Red Magen David ambulance crews were administering first aid to wounded civilians on the sidewalks and gutters. Looking out to sea, the blinding light of magnesium flares revealed naval patrol boats cruising just off the beach.|$|R
5000|$|Snipers of the Soviet Union {{played an}} {{important}} role mainly on the Eastern Front of World War II, apart from other preceding and subsequent conflicts. In World War II, Soviet snipers used the 7.62×54mmR rifle cartridge with light, heavy, armour-piercing (B-30), armour-piercing-incendiary (B-32), zeroing-and-incendiary (P3), and <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets.</b> Most Soviet World War II snipers carried a combat load of 120 rifle cartridges in the field. Unlike the militaries of other nations, these snipers could be men or women. In 1943, there were over 2,000 women functioning in this role.|$|R
5000|$|... ("spitzer with core night tracer" [...] )— red {{circular}} groove, black <b>bullet</b> point—German night <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets.</b> The bullet {{was basically}} the same as used in the S.m.K. ammunition but combined with a dimmed tracer that was visible from 150 m to 800 to 1000 m and would not temporarily blind dark adapted eyes in low light conditions. It had a bullet weight of 10.00 g and a muzzle velocity of 810 m/s and an operating pressure of [...] This ammunition was also produced in a S.m.K. Glspur-v high-velocity or [...] "v" [...] ammunition variant that added 115 m/s muzzle velocity to the normal S.m.K. Glspur variant. These rounds were also available in S.m.K. Glspur 100/600 and S.m.K. Glspur-v 100/600 variants for aerial use that burned between 100 and 600 m.|$|R
50|$|His {{next move}} {{took him to}} the Western Front, to Jasta 41, in October 1917. He scored once for them, on 6 December 1917. On 9 January 1918, he was {{promoted}} to command of Jasta 56; he arrived simultaneously with Franz Piechulek, who would become the squadron's leading ace. Beginning 19 February, and running through 24 March, he tallied nine more confirmed victories, and an unconfirmed one. On 26 March, he received the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. On 27 March, he was wounded in the hand by a <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet,</b> and the hand had to be amputated. This ended Schlieff's flying career.|$|E
50|$|Also {{called a}} drone spike, a <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet</b> is a spike {{with the current}} architecture, current {{technology}} set, current set of best practices that results in production quality code. It might just be a very narrow implementation of the functionality but is not throw away code. It is of production quality, {{and the rest of}} the iterations can build on this code. The name has military origins as ammunition that makes the path of the bullet visible, allowing for corrections. Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected.|$|E
5000|$|The weapon {{consists}} of an extendable launch tube with an integrated 9mm spotting rifle and 1× sight. The spotting rifle has five rounds of ammunition, and is ballistically matched to the rocket. The rounds it uses are quite unusual, consisting of a 9 mm <b>tracer</b> <b>bullet</b> loaded in a necked up 7.62mm NATO shell casing, with a [...]22 Hornet blank mounted {{in the base of}} the larger case, providing the propellant charge. Upon firing, the [...]22 cartridge case pushes {{out of the back of}} the 7.62 mm casing, unlocking the breech of the spotting rifle in a form of primer actuation. The spotting rifle on the USMC Mk.153 Mod.0 SMAW was derived from the LAW 80.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese stood {{firm and}} the last {{defenders}} had to be blown out from the cellars by rolling down petrol drums and igniting them with <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets.</b> It {{was not until the}} 11th of March that the hill fell into British hands. Aerial bombardment was resorted to when shelling from the hill failed to breach the city wall and destroy the enemy, and Mandalay Palace, a national heritage of great importance, burnt down during the siege. Whether it was the shelling and bombing or the enemy that destroyed the splendid teak palace was never determined with any certainty.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} outgrew its {{facilities in}} Elizabeth {{and moved to}} Roswell Park in 1932. In ten more years the company had once more outgrown these facilities and moved to Summit, New Jersey where it currently resides. In May, 1942 the Summit location opened and was immediately contracted by the US Army and Navy to produce materials for World War II. From 1942 to 1945 the company produced parts for tanks, warships and airplanes. Over one million pounds of magnesium powder were produced for <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets</b> and flares. During this time the Summit location was heavily guarded.|$|R
50|$|In 1945 {{during the}} {{offensive}} to recapture Manila, the heavily fortified island {{was the last}} position in the bay that was held by the Japanese. After a heavy aerial and naval bombardment, U.S. troops gained access to {{the deck of the}} fort on April 13 and were able to confine the garrison below. Rather than attempting to break in, the troops and engineers adapted the solution first used some days earlier in the assault of mortar forts on Fort Hughes. There, the troops pumped two parts diesel oil and one part gasoline into mortar pits, stood off, and ignited it with <b>tracer</b> <b>bullets.</b>|$|R
