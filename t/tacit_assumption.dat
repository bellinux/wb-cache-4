500|$|The {{commercial}} success of Rhythm Nation 1814 was an unexpected achievement for mainstream pop music. Although Jackson was told focusing her album's theme on social consciousness would negatively impact sales, it was [...] "a prediction soon proved wrong when {{the album was}} certified multi-platinum" [...] and subsequently topped the pop, R and dance music charts. In She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul (2003), Lucy O'Brien wrote that contrary to A's fear that the album would underperform, its multi-platinum sales pushed Jackson {{to a level of}} superstardom rivaling her brother Michael, calling it a [...] "personal manifesto" [...] and regarding it as a female counterpart to Marvin Gaye's What's Going On (1971). Timothy E. Scheurer, author of Born in the USA: The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to the Present (2007), wrote that the album [...] "may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There's a Riot Going On and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people." [...] It made history as the only album to generate seven top-five hits on the Billboard Hot 100, surpassing Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) and Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. (1984), each having seven top ten hits. It is also the only album to achieve number one hits in three separate calendar years, with [...] "Miss You Much" [...] in 1989, [...] "Escapade" [...] and [...] "Black Cat" [...] in 1990, and [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] in 1991. Additionally, it is one of only nine albums—including Michael Jackson's Bad (1987), [...] (1977), Whitney Houston's Whitney (1987), George Michael's Faith (1987), Paula Abdul's Forever Your Girl (1989), Mariah Carey's self-titled debut (1990), Usher's Confessions (2004) and ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{has changed}} her lyrical focus over the years, {{becoming}} {{the subject of}} analysis in musicology, African American studies, and gender studies. David Ritz compared Jackson's musical style to Marvin Gaye's, stating, [...] "like Marvin, autobiography seemed the sole source of her music. Her art, also like Marvin's, floated over a reservoir of secret pain." [...] Much of her success {{has been attributed to}} [...] "a series of powerful, metallic grooves; her chirpy, multi-tracked vocals; and a lyrical philosophy built on pride and self-knowledge." [...] Ritz also stated, [...] "The mystery is the low flame that burns around the perimeters of Janet Jackson's soul. The flame feeds off the most highly combustible elements: survival and ambition, caution and creativity, supreme confidence and dark fear." [...] During the 1980s, her lyrics embodied self-actualization, feminist principles, and politically driven ideology. Gillian G. Gaar, author of She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock & Roll (2002), described Control as [...] "an autobiographical tale about her life with her parents, her first marriage, and breaking free." [...] Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture (2010) author Jessie Carney Smith wrote [...] "with that album, she asserted her independence, individuality, and personal power. She challenged audiences to see her as a transformed person, from an ingénue to a grow-up, multi-talented celebrity." [...] Referring to Rhythm Nation 1814 as an embodiment of hope, Timothy E. Scheurer, author of Born in the USA: The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to the Present (2007) wrote [...] "It may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There's a Riot Going On and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{ambiguity}} of the word Infinite is the real fallacy in the amusing logical puzzle of Achilles and the Tortoise, a puzzle which has been too hard for the ingenuity or patience of many philosophers, and which no less a thinker than Sir William Hamilton considered as insoluble; as a sound argument, though leading to a palpable falsehood. The fallacy, as Hobbes hinted, lies in the <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> that whatever is infinitely divisible is infinite; but the following solution (to the invention of which I have no claim) is more precise and satisfactory.|$|E

That if one thing makes us think of another as preceding or following it, that other must precede it or follow it in actual fact. And conversely, that when we can not conceive two things together they can not exist together, and that their combination may, without further evidence, be rejected from the list of possible occurrences.|$|E

He felt that he must have seemed to her very unkind, and that in so far as a well-regulated conscience permitted the exercise of unpractical passions, she honored him with a superior detestation.

In considering the possible causes of the immense differences of specific gravity among the planets, I was led to question {{the validity of the}} <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> that each planet consists of solid or liquid matter from centre to surface.

6000|$|... “It is very {{important}} for us to observe, that these controversies have never been questions of insulated and arbitrary definitions, as men seem often tempted to imagine them to have been. In all cases there is a <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> of some proposition which is to be expressed by means of the definition, and which gives it its importance. The dispute concerning the definition thus acquires a real value, and becomes a question concerning true and false. Thus, in the discussion of the question, What is a uniform force? it was taken for granted that gravity is a uniform force. In the debate of the vis viva, it was assumed that in the mutual action of bodies the whole effect of the force is unchanged. In the zoological definition of species (that it consists of individuals which have, or may have, sprung from the same parents), it is presumed that individuals so related resemble each other more than those which are excluded by such a definition; or, perhaps, that species so defined have permanent and definite differences. A definition of organization, or of some other term which was not employed to express some principle, would be of no value.|$|E

50|$|Schein model defines {{organizational}} culture as the deepest and strongest aspect of organization life. The culture has three cognitive levels {{which one can}} measure. The first level is where the organizational attributes that can be seen, felt and heard by the uninitiated observer - this level includes - behavior, colours, furnishings, recognition. The attributes can be measured by observation of anyone that meets the culture. The next level is about the professed culture of the organization members - this level includes - slogans, flyers, lists, statements. One can measure there by interviews and reading papers of the organization. The last and deepest level is where lie the organization's <b>tacit</b> <b>assumptions</b> - these elements are unseen, subconscious, the 'unspoken rules' of the organization. To find out those <b>tacit</b> <b>assumptions,</b> one needs to discover the in-depth of the organization by deep observation and interpretation of an expert.Schein's model gives an opportunity to measure these levels and to compare the links between them. if the links are strongs {{then there is a}} strong {{organizational culture}}.|$|R

60|$|Sitka Charley did {{not know}} this kind of woman. Five minutes before, {{he did not even}} dream of taking charge of the expedition; but when she came to him with her {{wonderful}} smile and her straight clean English, and talked to the point, without pleading or persuading, he had incontinently yielded. Had there been a softness and appeal to mercy in the eyes, a tremble to the voice, a taking advantage of sex, he would have stiffened to steel; instead her clear-searching eyes and clear-ringing voice, her utter frankness and <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> of equality, had robbed him of his reason. He felt, then, that this was a new breed of woman; and ere they had been trail mates for many days he knew why the sons of such women mastered the land and the sea, and why the sons of his own womankind could not prevail against them. Tender and soft! Day after day he watched her, muscle-weary, exhausted, indomitable, and the words beat in upon him in a perennial refrain. Tender and soft! He knew her feet had been born to easy paths and sunny lands, strangers to the moccasined pain of the North, unkissed by the chill lips of the frost, and he watched and marveled at them twinkling ever through the weary day.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{if any one}} {{chose to}} assert that all bodies when {{uncontrolled}} set out in a direct line toward the North Pole, he might equally prove his point by {{the principle of the}} Sufficient Reason. By what right is it assumed that a state of rest is the particular state which can not be deviated from without special cause? Why not a state of motion, and of some particular sort of motion? Why may we not say that the natural state of a horse left to himself is to amble, because otherwise he must either trot, gallop, or stand still, and because we know no reason why he should do one of these rather than another? If this is to be called an unfair use of the “sufficient reason,” and the other a fair one, there must be a <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> that a state of rest is more natural to a horse than a state of ambling. If this means that it is the state which the animal will assume when left to himself, that is the very point to be proved; and if it does not mean this, it can only mean that a state of rest is the simplest state, and therefore the most likely to prevail in nature, {{which is one of the}} fallacies or natural prejudices we have already examined.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} urged by several writers that as high {{intellectual}} powers are advantageous to a nation, the old Greeks, who stood some grades higher in intellect than any race {{that has ever}} existed,[244] ought to have risen, if the power of natural selection were real, still higher in the scale, increased in number, and stocked the whole of Europe. Here we have the <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption,</b> so often made with respect to corporeal structures, {{that there is some}} innate tendency towards continued development in mind and body. But development of all kinds depends on many concurrent favourable circumstances. Natural selection acts only in a tentative manner. Individuals and races may have acquired certain indisputable advantages, and yet have perished from failing in other characters. The Greeks may have retrograded from a want of coherence between the many small states, from the small size of their whole country, from the practice of slavery, or from extreme sensuality; for they did not succumb until “they were enervated and corrupt to the very core.”[245] The western nations of Europe, who now so immeasurably surpass their former savage progenitors and stand at the summit of civilisation, owe little or none of their superiority to direct inheritance from the old Greeks; though they owe much to the written works of this wonderful people.|$|E

60|$|There {{had been}} {{after the first}} {{interchange}} among the three a talk of some five minutes in the hall, and then {{the two men had}} adjourned to the garden, Miss Gostrey for the time disappearing. Strether in due course accompanied his friend to the room he had bespoken and had, before going out, scrupulously visited; where at the end of another half-hour he had no less discreetly left him. On leaving him he repaired straight to his own room, but with the prompt effect of feeling the compass of that chamber resented by his condition. There he enjoyed at once the first consequence of their reunion. A place was too small for him after it that had seemed large enough before. He had awaited it with something he would have been sorry, have been almost ashamed not to recognise as emotion, yet with a <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> {{at the same time that}} emotion would in the event find itself relieved. The actual oddity was that he was only more excited; and his excitement-to which indeed he would have found it difficult instantly to give a name--brought him once more downstairs and caused him for some minutes vaguely to wander. He went once more to the garden; he looked into the public room, found Miss Gostrey writing letters and backed out; he roamed, fidgeted and wasted time; but he was to have his more intimate session with his friend before the evening closed.|$|E
60|$|It will be {{hereafter}} {{seen that}} when any important consequences seem to follow, as in mathematics, from an essential proposition, or, in other words, from a proposition {{involved in the}} meaning of a name, what they really flow from is the <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> of the real existence of the objects so named. Apart from this assumption of real existence, the class of propositions in which the predicate is of the essence of the subject (that is, in which the predicate connotes the whole or part of what the subject connotes, but nothing besides) answer no purpose but that of unfolding the whole or some part of the meaning of the name, to those who did not previously know it. Accordingly, the most useful, and in strictness the only useful kind of essential propositions, are Definitions: which, to be complete, should unfold the whole of what is involved in {{the meaning of the word}} defined; that is (when it is a connotative word), the whole of what it connotes. In defining a name, however, it is not usual to specify its entire connotation, but so much only as is sufficient to mark out the objects usually denoted by it from all other known objects. And sometimes a merely accidental property, not involved in the meaning of the name, answers this purpose equally well. The various kinds of definition which these distinctions give rise to, and the purposes to which they are respectively subservient, will be minutely considered in the proper place.|$|E

[...] I had had no disposition to deny anything she told me, and I could not see that her satisfaction in being justified by the event made poor Dolcino's throat any better. The truth is that, as the sequel proved, Miss Ambient had some of the qualities of the sibyl, and had therefore, perhaps, a right to the sibylline contortions. Her brother was so preoccupied that I felt my presence to be an indiscretion, and was sorry I had promised to remain over the morrow. I said to Mark that, evidently, I had better leave them in the morning; to which he replied that, on the contrary, if he was to pass the next days in the fidgets, my company would be an extreme relief to him. The fidgets had already begun for him, poor fellow; and as we sat in his study with our cigars after dinner, he wandered to the door whenever he heard the sound of the doctor's wheels. Miss Ambient, who shared this apartment with us, gave me at such moments significant glances; she had gone upstairs before rejoining us to ask after the child His mother and his nurse gave a tolerable account of him; but Miss Ambient found his fever high and his symptoms very grave. The doctor came at ten o'clock, and I went to bed after hearing from Mark that he saw no present cause for alarm. He had made every provision for the night, and was to return early in the morning.|$|E
