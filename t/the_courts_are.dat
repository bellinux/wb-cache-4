5|$|Judicial Commissioner Menon also {{mentioned}} another {{exception to the}} justiciability rule: when <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. However, the judge did not explain this exception further, {{and it has not}} yet been applied or discussed in any other Singapore case.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> {{established}} under <b>the</b> Children's <b>Court</b> Act 1992 (Qld). <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> a <b>court</b> {{of record}} and <b>is</b> an inferior <b>court.</b> <b>The</b> <b>court</b> {{came into existence}} in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Finally, in 1865, the Law on the Organization of <b>the</b> <b>Courts</b> <b>was</b> passed, and <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> {{organized}} into <b>the</b> district <b>courts,</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> of appeal and <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Cassation. According to <b>the</b> Law, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Cassation had three chambers. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> composed of 15 judges, {{one of them}} being the president. The judges were appointed by the Prince through a decree. The Law gave <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Cassation <b>the</b> power of judicial interpretation instead of the Minister of Justice. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> still under <b>the</b> Government's influence, but the judicial independence was constantly strengthening.|$|R
5|$|Germany has a {{civil law}} system based on Roman law with some {{references}} to Germanic law. The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court.|$|E
5|$|I do not, and I have {{no doubt}} your Lordships do not, have any wish to expand {{the role of the}} {{judiciary}} at the expense of any other organ of the State or to seek to frustrate the properly expressed wish of Parliament as contained in legislation. The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> bound to apply.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> {{headed by}} a lawspeaker (førstelagmann), {{currently}} by Arild Oskar Eidesen. The administration of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> managed by <b>the</b> Norwegian National <b>Courts</b> Administration.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> pickleball <b>court</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} a doubles {{badminton}} <b>court.</b> <b>The</b> actual size of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> 20×44 feet for both doubles and singles. The net is hung at 36 inches on the ends, and 34 inches at center. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> striped like a tennis court, with no alleys; but <b>the</b> outer <b>courts,</b> and not <b>the</b> inner <b>courts,</b> <b>are</b> divided in half by service lines. <b>The</b> inner <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> non-volley zones and extend 7 feet from the net on either side.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Palace <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> held weekly {{together}} with <b>the</b> ancient <b>Court</b> of Marshalsea. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> abolished in 1849.|$|R
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E
5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to vote is a constitutional one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or said by him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> to interpret the restriction.|$|E
50|$|On July 2, 2003 <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> again restructured. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> {{split into}} two {{separate}} <b>Courts,</b> with <b>the</b> Trial Division continued as <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> and <b>the</b> Appeal Division continued as <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> of Appeal.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{created with}} nine judges: one three-judge panel {{for each of}} three districts. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> later expanded to fifteen judges (five districts, each with one three judge panel).|$|R
25|$|Occasionally <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> {{asked to}} make a ruling when parents cannot agree {{on whether or not}} to circumcise a child.|$|E
25|$|Questions may be {{posed to}} either the Prime Minister, or any Minister of the Cabinet of Canada, who will answer the {{question}} unless the Speaker rejects the question under established rules or accepted custom. For example, {{although it is not}} codified, questions on current legal matters before <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> not acceptable questions.|$|E
25|$|Pirbright is {{the home}} of Pirbright Tennis Club which was formed in 1976. Initially playing in the Burrow Hill part of the village, the club soon moved to its ground on School Lane. Pirbright Tennis Club has over 300 members and five adult teams; <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> also used by {{students}} from the local schools.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Courts</b> <b>were</b> reorganized and <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> made an {{elective}} body. Their terms were extended to seven years.|$|R
50|$|The first Chief Justice of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> Joseph Henry Lumpkin, who was {{appointed}} in 1863. There have been 27 Chief Justices, and the current Chief Justice of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> Harris Hines.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} called <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court,</b> as it <b>is</b> now, but {{was known}} as <b>the</b> Central <b>Court</b> in <b>the</b> meantime. The 2012 Kim Il-sung-Kim Jong-il Constitution of North Korea restored its name. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> based in <b>the</b> capital Pyongyang.|$|R
25|$|An error as to a {{jurisdictional}} fact or precedent fact {{is committed}} when a decision-maker {{makes a decision}} {{in the absence of}} a fact that must exist objectively before the decision-maker is empowered by the legislation to decide. Here, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> not concerned with the evaluation of facts, but whether the facts exist for the decision maker to exercise his power.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Courts</b> <b>are</b> {{staffed by}} civil {{servants}} who are {{employed by the}} Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service which is a non-ministerial government department whose corporate board is chaired by the Lord President of the Court of Session, and is independent of the Scottish Ministers. The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service publishes an online map, lists of Sheriffs, and {{the rules of the}} court under different procedures.|$|E
25|$|While <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> obligated {{in theory}} to give {{deference}} to the NLRB's interpretation of the Act, they do not always do so. The court may direct the NLRB to reconsider its decision or reverse it outright if it {{is convinced that the}} Board is in error. The court may also reverse Board actions that it considers to be an abuse of the NLRB's discretion, typically in the choice of remedies to be applied.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} 1936, {{and was given}} {{temporary}} accommodation in Skien, with <b>the</b> <b>court</b> room in <b>the</b> city hall. By 1991 <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> located at three different places in the city, before the current Tønsberg Courthouse was opened.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> {{created on}} July 2, 2003, by <b>the</b> <b>Courts</b> Administration Service Act when it and <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> <b>were</b> split from its predecessor, <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> of Canada.|$|R
5000|$|This {{opinion of}} <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> in {{conflict}} with other First Amendment restriction cases. The only reason <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> changing now is because the messages are not content neutral - it is about abortion.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the summer}} climate in {{southern}} England, Wimbledon employs 'Court Attendants' each year, who work to maintain court conditions. Their principal responsibility {{is to ensure that}} <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> quickly covered when it begins to rain, so that play can resume as quickly as possible once the referees decide to uncover the courts. The court attendants are mainly university students working to make summer money. Centre Court is covered by full-time groundstaff, however.|$|E
25|$|The Courts Service Act 1998 {{created the}} Courts Service {{to manage the}} courts and {{associated}} property, and provide assistance and facilities to their users, including judges. The Courts Service also provides information to the public. The Board of the Courts Service, which oversees policy formulation and implementation, is headed by a Chief Executive Officer. Judges of <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> independent of the service in their judicial functions and are in that capacity paid {{by the state and}} not the service.|$|E
25|$|Most {{statutes}} {{are meant}} to be applied in the main not by legal practitioners and judges but by administrative decision makers. Certain laws receive more judicial interpretation than others, either because more is at stake or because those who are affected {{are in a position to}} take the matter to court. Whilst the meanings presented to the court are often those that benefit the litigants themselves, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> not bound to select one of the interpretations offered by the parties.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> a {{superior}} <b>court</b> and {{a court of}} record. Judges appointed by the Governor-General constituted it as required. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> permitted to sit anywhere in Australia as the interests of justice required, and was confined to hearing a case on the island. When hearing criminal cases, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> sat with a jury to determine an accused person’s guilt. If <b>the</b> <b>court</b> sat outside <b>the</b> island, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> could use jurors from the State or Territory that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> actually sitting at.|$|R

50|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} <b>court</b> <b>is</b> No. 1 <b>Court.</b> <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> constructed in 1997 to replace <b>the</b> old No.1 <b>Court,</b> which <b>was</b> adjacent to Centre <b>Court.</b> <b>The</b> old No.1 <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> demolished because its capacity for spectators <b>was</b> too low. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> said {{to have had a}} unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. <b>The</b> new No.1 <b>Court</b> has a capacity of approximately 11,000.|$|R
