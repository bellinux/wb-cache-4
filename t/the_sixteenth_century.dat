5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century.

Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Almost half the years in the second half of <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> saw local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584-8, 1595 and 1597â€“1609.|$|E

5|$|From a low base at the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> trade expanded in the 1530s, but suffered from the English invasions of the Rough Wooing in the 1540s. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The fortunes of Scottish burghs in the export trade changed across the century. Haddington, which {{had been one of the}} major centres of trade in the late Medieval period, saw its share of foreign exports collapse in <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Aberdeen's share of trade remained stable for most of the century, but slumped in the last decade. The small Fife ports grew in significance and Edinburgh took an increasing share of trade through its port of Leith. This forced smaller ports to diversify into other commodities and to undertake more coastal trading. Overall there was an increase in foreign trade from the 1570s, of which Edinburgh received the major share.|$|E

5|$|From the {{eleventh}} through the fourteenth centuries, urban development at Gedi expanded {{primarily to the}} north, west and south with the eventual shift of the population around the Great Mosque during the fifteenth century. Gedi's population and prosperity peaked during the fifteenth and into <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> until it and many other coastal sites began to decline in the late-sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Gedi was abandoned {{by the middle of}} the seventeenth century. The presence of the Portuguese from <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> has been considered one of the primary factors in Gedi's eventual abandonment with their attempts to monopolize trade and due to armed intervention. However, a drop in the water table seen with the deepening of the well next to the Great Mosque, a Wazimba raid along the coast in 1589, and Galla migrations and raids from Somalia may have been additional factors in the abandonment of Gedi an most of the mainland coastal sites north of Mombasa.|$|E
