5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> <b>of</b> Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> <b>of</b> Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E

5|$|Some of Hendrix's {{unfinished}} {{material was}} released as the 1971 title <b>The</b> <b>Cry</b> <b>of</b> Love. Although the album reached number {{three in the}} U.S. and number two in the UK, producers Mitchell and Kramer later complained that {{they were unable to}} make use of all the available songs because some tracks were used for 1971's Rainbow Bridge; still others were issued on 1972's War Heroes. Material from <b>The</b> <b>Cry</b> <b>of</b> Love was re-released in 1997 as First Rays of the New Rising Sun, along with the other tracks that Mitchell and Kramer had wanted to include.|$|E

25|$|As the Katipunan's Supremo, Andrés Bonifacio had a {{personal}} flag which depicts a white sun with an indefinite number of rays on a field of red. Below the sun are three white Ks arranged horizontally. This flag was first unveiled on August 23, 1896 during <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> <b>of</b> Pugadlawin where the assembled Katipunan members tore their cedulas (community tax certificates) in defiance of Spanish authority. The flag was used later during the Battle of San Juan del Monte on August 30, 1896, the first major battle of the Philippine Revolution.|$|E
25|$|In {{planning}} the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged {{support for the}} Katipunan {{in exchange for a}} promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, a delegation was sent to Emperor Meiji of Japan in order to solicit funds and military arms. The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities after a member named Teodoro Patiño revealed the Katipunan's illegal activities to his sister, and finally to the mother portress of Mandaluyong Orphanage. Seven days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, on December 26, 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> <b>of</b> Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution.|$|E
