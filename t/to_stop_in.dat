Her husband and her two other children were traveling later that day. At around 13:00 local time (17:00 UTC), she decided <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Lolol.

5|$|The two-month {{journey to}} the New World was marked by {{seasickness}} and boredom. The ship's captain, Lebourcier, intended <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> the West Indies to sell cargo, but Lafayette, fearful of arrest, bought the cargo to avoid docking at the islands. He landed on North Island near Georgetown, South Carolina, on 13 June 1777.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} the early 1930s, the {{four members of the}} Zara class took part in training exercises with the Italian fleet and participated in fleet reviews held for foreign leaders, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Gorizia and Pola were involved in the Spanish Civil War; in 1936 Pola conducted non-intervention patrols and Gorizia carried Italian nationals from Gijon, Spain, to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France that year. After departing France, Gorizia visited Germany, and on the way back, she suffered a major explosion in an aviation gasoline tank that forced her to put into Gibraltar for repairs. There, British shipyard inspectors discovered that the ship was grossly over the Washington Treaty's displacement restriction. In March 1939, all four ships sortied to prevent a squadron of Republican warships from reaching the Black Sea, forcing them <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Bizerte, Tunisia, where they were interned. The following month, Zara, Pola, and Gorizia provided gunfire support to Italian forces invading Albania.|$|E
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E

Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|Just a {{week after}} Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia, the Newfoundland and Labrador Emergency Measures Organization advised the general public to take {{appropriate}} actions for the anticipated effects of Hurricane Kate, including high winds and potentially up to 3in (80mm) of rain. Such actions include securing loose objects, cleaning debris from storm drains, and owning appropriate hurricane supplies (such as a charged cell phone and batteries {{in the event of}} power outages). A cruise ship scheduled <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> St. John's bypassed Newfoundland to avoid the storm. The Newfoundland and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for Newfoundland, while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane-force wind warning. Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate and a cold front, the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern Newfoundland. Offshore, waves were expected to reach 33feet (10m), while marine wind warnings were issued as well.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March, Cormoran {{returned}} to Sydney {{for yet another}} annual overhaul. Afterward, she resumed her typical cruising duties in the German Pacific colonies. In September, she and the steamer Planet pulled free the Norwegian barque Fram, which had run aground. She received another major overhaul in Tsingtau in May 1912, which was followed by surveying cruises in the German colonies. She {{did not return to}} Apia until 10 January 1913. Cormoran was reclassified as a gunboat on 24 February 1913 by order of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office). From 4 June to 5 July, she underwent repairs in Sydney. She was then obliged <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Bougainville due to tribal feuds on the island. She landed her shore party to assist the Polizeitruppen in suppressing the conflict. She departed for Tsingtau for further repair work in early 1914, arriving on 30 May.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May, the German {{high command}} {{recalled}} the expeditionary force to Germany. The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June. The ships stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo, where they stayed from 22 to 26 June. Steaming against the monsoons forced the fleet <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Mahé, Seychelles, {{to take on}} more coal. The ships then stopped for a day each to take on coal in Aden and Port Said. On 1 August they reached Cadiz, and then met with the I Division and steamed back to Germany together. They separated after reaching Helgoland, and on 11 August, after reaching the Jade roadstead, the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral von Koester, who was now the Inspector General of the Navy. The following day the expeditionary fleet was dissolved. In the end, the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 1939, Zara and {{her sister}} ships sortied from Taranto to {{intercept}} a squadron of Republican warshipsthree cruisers and eight destroyersattempting to reach the Black Sea. The Italian ships were ordered not to open fire but merely to try to impede {{the progress of the}} Spanish ships and force them to dock at Augusta, Sicily, where they would be interned. The Spanish commander refused <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Augusta and instead steamed to Bizerte in French Tunisia, where his ships were interned. A month later, from 7 to 9 April, Gorizia supported the Italian invasion of Albania without incident. She was present during the visit of Ramón Serrano Suñer, then the foreign minister of Francoist Spain, which had recently defeated the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. Five days later, the ship took part in the Navy Day festivities in Venice. Gorizia spent the rest of 1939 and early 1940 uneventfully.|$|E
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E

5|$|The A9, {{the great}} road {{connecting}} Edinburgh with Inverness {{and the far}} north, once ran through Evanton, {{on the path of}} Balconie Street. However, a bypass was created as part of a general scheme to shorten the journey between Inverness to Invergordon. This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village, but decreased the revenue available to local businesses. The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone, distorting the shape of the fields. This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village. For those who do not have cars, the only means of transport is either by foot or by the #25 bus service operated by Stagecoach. Recently, the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Evanton. Now residents can travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall, making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport.|$|E
5|$|The Holborn rail crash {{occurred}} on the Central line at Holborn on 9 July 1980, at about 13:28 and involved two 1962 stock trains. The 13:17 train from Liverpool Street to White City, standing at the westbound platform, was run into by the 12:49 Hainault to Ealing Broadway train. The rear train was slowing after its brakes had been applied by the emergency train stop system because it had passed two signals at danger, but it failed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> time to avoid collision. The driver of the rear train and 20 passengers were injured. An inquiry concluded that the accident {{was caused by the}} driver failing to control his train. Disruption of services occurred until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|The first ship of the class, Reşadiye, {{was ordered}} on 8 June 1911. Work stopped in 1912 {{following}} {{the start of}} the First Balkan War due to the probability that the Ottoman government would run out of funds. Work resumed in May 1913 following the conclusion of the conflict. The second ship, Fatih Sultan Mehmed, was ordered on 29 April 1914 in response to the Greek order for Vasilefs Konstantinos in early 1914. The British government ordered work <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> late July 1914, {{as a result of the}} growing tensions that culminated in the outbreak of World War I on the 28th; what material that had been assembled was dismantled on the slipway in August.|$|E

5|$|The {{next three}} British ships, Vanguard {{in the lead}} {{followed}} by HMS Minotaur and HMS Defence, remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40. Nelson focused his flagship's fire on Spartiate, while Captain Thomas Louis in Minotaur attacked the unengaged Aquilon and Captain John Peyton in Defence joined the attack on Peuple Souverain. With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered, the following British ships, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic, passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre. Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than they and began to take severe damage. Captain Henry Darby on Bellerophon missed his intended anchor near Franklin and instead found his ship underneath the main battery of the French flagship. Captain George Blagdon Westcott on Majestic also missed his station and almost collided with Heureux, coming under heavy fire from Tonnant. Unable <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> time, Westcott's jib boom became entangled with Tonnants shroud.|$|E
5|$|The {{season ended}} with a few more matches against various English counties. Miller struck 81 not out in a low-scoring win against Nottinghamshire. In a match against Leveson-Gower's XI, which {{comprised}} Test-level England players, Miller struck 71 in just over an hour as the Australians finished at 506 and took an innings victory. Miller's time in England ended on a losing note when he scored a duck and eight and took 2/10 and 2/17 as the Australian Services lost to Surrey by three wickets. In matches that were given first-class status, Miller had score 725 runs at 72.50 for the season, finishing second in the averages and the aggregates. The success of the Australian Services team prompted the Foreign Minister of Australia Doc Evatt to ask the team <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> India and Ceylon on their return to Australia {{to play in a}} fundraising tour for the Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines, intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and avoid the need for hearses <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> the public road. The building housed two mortuaries, the LNC's boardroom and funerary workshops, {{and a series of}} separate waiting rooms for those attending first, second and third class funerals. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level above. Although the original London terminus did not have its own chapel, on some occasions mourners would not be able or willing to make the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church. On these occasions one of the waiting rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel.|$|E
