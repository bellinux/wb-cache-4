5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} hearing in 2002 both DNK director Tor Helge Lyngstøl and Minister of Justice, Odd Einar Dørum, {{stated that the}} choice of TETRA would provide sufficient data capacity. In {{a parliamentary}} decision in 2004 {{it was decided to}} opt for the open European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as a data <b>transmission</b> <b>standard,</b> which is used by all other police TETRA systems in Europe, but this was later changed by the directorate to the proprietary TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS) owned by Motorola. The latter would limit the number of supplies and would increase the investment costs.|$|E

2500|$|The 1974 Ninety-Eight was now Oldsmobile's longest running series {{dating back}} to 1941, and was still popular. Five models were offered with the Regency Coupe taking {{the place of the}} Luxury Coupe. Standard {{equipment}} included: power brakes with front discs, cigarette lighter, electric clock, interior hood release, lamp package, molding package, remote control outside mirror, windshield radio antenna, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, spare tire cover, power windows, power seat and Turbo-Hydramatic <b>transmission.</b> <b>Standard</b> tire size was J78-15.

2500|$|The {{number of}} body styles {{was reduced to}} four for 1971. The {{convertible}} was gone as were the 4-door sedan body styles. A new body style was the Luxury Coupe. For {{the first time ever}} all Oldsmobile 98s were now hardtops, {{and for the first time}} since 1964 not all hardtops were called Holidays. [...] Standard equipment included armrests, front and rear, power brakes with front discs, electric clock, carpeting, inside hood release, lamp package, power seat, power steering and Turbo-Hydramatic <b>transmission.</b> <b>Standard</b> tire size was J78-15. Interiors were vinyl, cloth and leather. Ninety-Eights were built in both Linden and Lansing.|$|E
2500|$|A new sports-oriented model, the AMX, was {{introduced}} to appeal to young, performance-oriented car buyers. The AMX was available only as a hatchback with the six or the V8 engine (automatic only) featuring a floor-shifted four-speed manual or automatic <b>transmission.</b> <b>Standard</b> was an upgraded black or tan interior with a floor console, [...] "rally" [...] instrumentation with tachometer, and [...] "soft-feel" [...] sports steering wheel. The special [...] "Hornet AMX" [...] was only available in four exterior colors that included matching painted bumpers with a wraparound rubber guard strip, body side rubber guard strip and contrasting AMX model identification bodyside decals ahead of the rear wheels. The exterior included a front spoiler integrated into the front lower fender extensions, rear lower fender flares, sport-styled road wheels, brushed aluminum [...] "Targa top" [...] band over the B-pillars and roof, black left and right outside mirrors, and louvers for the rear hatch window. Options included bright aluminum road wheels and large Hornet-graphic decals on the hood and on the decklid. This model marked the return of a famous name that evoked AMC's original AMX two-seat sports car.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the turmoil}} of 1982, Renault de México took over VAM from the Mexican {{government}} in February 1983. As with AMC, Renault was most interested in the Jeep line, VAM's production facilities, and its established dealer network. As soon as the agreement was finalized, Renault ordered the termination of VAM's passenger car line so it would not compete with its own products. VAM's 1983 models existed mainly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories as well as fulfilling previous agreements with sourcing companies. The American line for 1983 soldiered on in a very limited form. The American GFS and American ECD models were virtually not produced for the final year. Both sedan models existed as the base manual and semi-equipped automatics units. Cars with manual transmissions had a parcel shelf as standard equipment while the units with automatic transmission featured aluminum road wheels, the same door panels and seat designs as the previous GFS and ECD models along with their respective door armrest safety reflectors. The two-door automatic models had a reclining mechanism for their front seats. Regardless of the <b>transmission,</b> <b>standard</b> equipment included power brakes, power steering, and dual remote mirrors. The American DL station wagon model was virtually the only high-trim American model to be available. For 1983, the base automatic and the basic DL were merged into a single version alongside the equipped DL and the base manual, creating three versions for the year unlike the four {{of the last two}} years. The mid-range version had the same equipment as the sedan models with automatic transmission of the year, it was also called [...] "American DL" [...] and carried the same woodgrain panels and moldings that were never seen in the base automatics of the previous two years. The differences between the mid-range DL and the top-of-the-line DL are the presence of the AM/FM stereo radio, reading dome light, lighted vanity mirror, intermittent wipers and air conditioning in the latter model. The only optional accessories available were the AM/FM stereo tape player radio, remote-controlled door mirrors and electric antenna. Only the top-of-the-line DL carried the [...] I6 while the rest had the [...] Cars equipped with air conditioning included the larger 282 engine. Leftover 1983 VAM Americans were sold as 1984 models.|$|E
