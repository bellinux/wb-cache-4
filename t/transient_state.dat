Heaven is the ultimate happiness received when soul escapes the cycle of rebirths and reunites with the Creator, while hell is conceptualized as the bitterness of being unable to reunite with the Creator and escape from the cycle of rebirth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transient</b> (<b>state)</b> {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness.

The basic NDR element, {{which is made}} of several Si-based metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOS) and SiGe-based heterojunction-bipolar-transistor (HBT) devices, can be implemented by using a standard BiCMOS process. These MVL circuits are designed based on the triggering-pulse control, saw-tooth input signal, and peak-control methods, respectively. However, there are some <b>transient</b> <b>states</b> existing between the multiple stable levels {{for the first two}} methods.

40|$|Abstract – This paper proposes an {{estimation}} algorithm for {{the separate}} {{primary and secondary}} leak-age inductances of a three phase Y-Δ transformer using least squares method. The voltage equations from the primary and secondary windings are combined into a differential equation to estimate the separate primary and secondary leakage inductances {{in order to use}} the line current of the delta wind-ing. Separate primary and secondary leakage inductances are obtained by applying least squares method to the differential equation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated under <b>transient</b> <b>states,</b> such as magnetic inrush and overexcitation, {{as well as in the}} steady state with various cut-off frequencies of low-pass filter. The proposed technique can accurately generate separate leakage inductances both in the steady and <b>transient</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

According to the topological structure of the fast process, we divide the states of the chain into the <b>transient</b> <b>states</b> and the recurrent states. We show that a two-time-scale chain can be simplified to a reduced chain in two different ways: removal of the <b>transient</b> <b>states</b> and aggregation of the recurrent states. Both the two operations will lead to a decrease in the entropy production rate and its adiabatic part and will keep its non-adiabatic part the same. This suggests that although model simplification can retain almost all the dynamic information of the chain, it will lose some thermodynamic information as a trade-off...|$|R
