5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery.

5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{diffusion}} of national and Republican ideas across France {{during the second half of}} the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century. Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> the Bastille was widely evoked by the French Resistance during the Second World War and until the 1950s Bastille Day remained the single most significant French national holiday.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{was named}} to the see of York around 732 (other sources date the {{appointment}} to 734) by his cousin Ceolwulf, the king of Northumbria. Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control. They also worked together to deal with problems that had developed in the relationship between the church and royal government. An example of the brothers' cooperation is {{the fact that some of}} Eadberht's coins feature Ecbert's image on the opposite face.|$|E

5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius {{saying that he was}} sending a pallium, <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.|$|E
5|$|Green was the {{traditional}} color of Irish nationalism, {{beginning in the}} 17th century. The green harp flag, with a traditional gaelic harp, became <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> the movement. It was the banner of the Society of United Irishmen, which organized the Irish Rebellion of 1798, calling for Irish independence. The uprising was suppressed with great bloodshed by the British army. When Ireland achieved independence in 1922, green was incorporated into the national flag.|$|E
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. <b>The</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
