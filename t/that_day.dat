5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance developed northeast of Yap on July 7 and slowly increased in organization. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance later <b>that</b> <b>day</b> {{as it moved}} northwestward. By July 8, it had developed sufficient convection to be designated a tropical depression by the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The depression continued to strengthen, and was designated Tropical Storm Bilis by the JMA early on July 9. The JTWC upgraded Bilis to tropical storm status later <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> On July 10, Bilis moved into the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), and was designated Tropical Storm Florita for local warnings.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate {{due to a}} combination of jetstream interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, the storm was downgraded into a Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later <b>that</b> <b>day</b> and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
5|$|Alabama Governor Robert J.

Following the tornado outbreak on the evening of April 27, President Barack Obama granted a federal emergency declaration for the state of Alabama, giving federal assistance, including search and rescue assets, to the affected region.|$|E

5|$|Although {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} initially minimal around {{the center of}} circulation, convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized. Late on September10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September11, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January16 to {{the west}} of Diego Garcia, and <b>that</b> <b>day</b> Météo-France (MF) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 08. The system maintained thunderstorms over a developing circulation, located in an area of weak to moderate wind shear. It developed outflow and gradually organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on January17. <b>That</b> <b>day,</b> the MF discontinued advisories after the system briefly halted its development trend. The disturbance continued its movement {{to the west}}-southwest, and on January19 began intensifying. <b>That</b> <b>day,</b> the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S {{to the north of the}} northern coast of Madagascar. After continued development, MF upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Ernest on January20.|$|E
5|$|As Isaac tracked northwestward, it re-strengthened {{into a major}} {{hurricane}} on September28. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> Isaac peaked as a moderate-Category4 hurricane. However, Isaac {{began to}} track northward over an area of colder sea surface temperatures (SSTs), which gradually weakened the storm {{over the next three}} days. Eventually, the storm curved northeastward, and weakened to a tropical storm early on October1. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> Isaac transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. While extratropical, it brushed the British Isles, producing below gale-force winds. The storm had no interaction with land while tropical; however, one fatality occurred on Long Island when large swells generated by Isaac overturned a boat. In addition, rough seas also affected the coastlines of Bermuda and The Carolinas.|$|E

5|$|By September4, {{the maximum}} winds were found {{closer to the}} center of {{circulation}} and the cyclone developed a warmer core, a main feature in tropical cyclones. An anticyclone also developed over Babe and later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone. By this time, Babe had turned nearly due north and was near hurricane-status. Around this time, reconnaissance missions into the storm found a closed eyewall with an eye measuring roughly 23mi (37km) in diameter. Another reconnaissance flight <b>that</b> <b>day</b> found sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h); however, these winds were located roughly 65mi (100km) from the center and considered to be unrepresentative of the storm's actual intensity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} on September21 Harvey {{accelerated}} slightly and turned southeastward.

At around 1700UTC on September21 Harvey made landfall near Everglades City, Florida with sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm further accelerated across the Florida Peninsula and quickly merged with a developing storm off the coast of South Carolina at 0600UTC on September22. Although the remnants of Harvey became unidentifiable later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> Environment Canada reported that the system crossed Newfoundland before dissipating on September24.|$|E
