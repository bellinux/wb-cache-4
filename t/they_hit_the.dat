5|$|Academic Andrew Price-Smith {{has made}} the {{argument}} that the virus helped tip {{the balance of power in}} the later days of the war towards the Allied cause. He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> Allied powers, and that both morbidity and mortality in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France.|$|E
5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> player.|$|E
5|$|Lost Luggage is {{an action}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling luggage from a wildly unpredictable baggage carousel. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that fall from the carousel before <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground. The player starts with three suitcases, which act as lives, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.|$|E

50|$|Sailors use {{traditional}} nautical {{terms for}} {{the parts of}} or directions on a vessel: starboard (right), port or larboard (left), forward or fore (front), aft or abaft (rearward), bow (forward part of the hull), stern (aft part of the hull), beam (the widest part). Vertical spars are masts, horizontal spars are booms (if <b>they</b> can <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> sailor), yards, gaffs (if they are too high to reach) or poles (if <b>they</b> cannot <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> sailor).|$|R
5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in the second wave. They were engaged before <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> beach, {{and three of the}} landing craft that the Commandos were travelling in were hit by high-velocity shells. Casualties were high, with No. 6 Troop suffering at least 20 wounded, but in the end they were lower than had been expected.|$|E
5|$|Word was {{spreading}} about the band's bizarre stage show {{by the time}} <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> road again, resulting in ever-larger audiences at their concerts. Not long after Malcolm's arrival, the band recorded their act for posterity by filming two concerts at Detroit's Traxx club. Some of this footage was eventually packaged as Blind Eye Sees All, their only official video release to date. They purchased their first 8-track recorder at this time, {{and used it to}} record two songs later used on the A-side of Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis.|$|E
5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.|$|E
50|$|The Satelites played every Monday {{night for}} $1. at Hedgen's in Buckhead, and Pranks played various bars. <b>They</b> all <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> big time.|$|R
50|$|Players {{can also}} create complex holes such as ‘two-part holes’ where <b>the</b> players must <b>hit</b> or reach one object before {{attempting}} {{to shoot at}} the hole. For example, a ‘two-part hole’ could consist of <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> scoreboard first, and then once <b>they</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> scoreboard <b>they</b> must <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball back to home plate, {{that would be one}} hole with the player with the fewest strokes winning the hole. ‘Two-part holes’ are typically saved for the last hole in order to make things more complex and difficult on the leader.|$|R

25|$|Hailstorms are rain drops {{that fall}} as ice, rather than melting before <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground. A {{particularly}} damaging hailstorm hit Munich, Germany, on July 12, 1984, causing about $2 billion in insurance claims.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{principle}} of the participles may be illustrated with the verb fali (to fall). Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff. Before the character falls, they are falonta (about to fall). As they drop, they are falanta (falling). After <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground, they are falinta (fallen).|$|E
25|$|The first bishop {{to claim}} primacy in writing was Pope Stephen I (254-257). The {{timing of the}} claim is significant, for it was made during {{the worst of the}} tumults of the 3rd century. There were several persecutions during this century, and <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> Church of Rome hard.|$|E

25|$|The {{eruption}} of Krakatoa created pyroclastic flows which generated megatsunamis when <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> {{waters of the}} Sunda Strait on 27 August 1883. The waves reached heights of up to 24 metres (79 feet) along the south coast of Sumatra and up to 42 metres (138 feet) along {{the west coast of}} Java.|$|E
25|$|Flak from German {{anti-aircraft}} guns resulted in planes either going under or over their prescribed altitudes. Some {{of the men}} who jumped from planes at lower altitudes were injured when <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground because of their chutes not having enough time to slow their descent, while others who jumped from higher altitudes reported a terrifying descent of several minutes watching tracer fire streaking up towards them.|$|E
25|$|The {{mirror is}} {{aluminized}} by {{placing it in}} a vacuum chamber with electrically heated tungsten or nichrome coils that can evaporate aluminum. In a vacuum, the hot aluminum atoms travel in straight lines. When <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> surface of the mirror, they cool and stick. Some mirror coating shops then evaporate a layer of quartz onto the mirror, whereas others expose it to pure oxygen or air in an oven so that the mirror will form a tough, clear layer of aluminum oxide.|$|E

25|$|The MCC won {{another country}} match, {{but it was}} not the push over that the other had been. No England bowler took a wicket in the home team's 150/2 as both openers were run out before a {{sporting}} declaration was made. Alan Knott (32) and Keith Fletcher (66) opened the innings and put on 86, but they lost five wickets before <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> winning runs. As before they batted on {{to the end of the}} day for batting practice and ended on 163/5.|$|E
25|$|Richmond began 1966 strongly. A {{month before}} the finals, <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> top of the ladder {{for the first time}} since 1951 and seemed certain to play in September. However, two losses dropped the Tigers to fifth place with {{thirteen}} wins and a draw. They became the best performing team to miss the finals since the inception of the McIntyre finals system in 1931. Richmond dismissed a number of players, replacing them with new players such as Royce Hart and Francis Bourke.|$|E
25|$|Minder is a British comedy-drama {{about the}} London {{criminal}} underworld. Initially produced by Verity Lambert, {{it was made}} by Euston Films, a subsidiary of Thames Television and shown on ITV (originally by Thames, then Central Independent Television in 1993 and 1994 after Thames lost its franchise). The original show ran for ten series between 29 October 1979 and 10 March 1994. The series was notable for using a range of leading British actors, {{as well as many}} up-and-coming performers before <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> big time; at its peak it was one of ITV's biggest ratings winners.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was a wheel rim which broke and damaged the train six kilometres south of the accident site. The wheel rim penetrated the carriage floor and lifted the check rail {{of a set of}} points close to Eschede station. The broken-off check rail then forced the point blades of the following set of points to change direction, and the rear cars of the trainset were diverted to a different track. <b>They</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> pillars of a street overpass, which then collapsed onto the tracks. Only three cars and the front powerhead passed under the bridge, the rest of the 14-car train jackknifed into the collapsed bridge.|$|E
25|$|After goalless first half, Johor Darul Ta'zim {{immediately}} {{scored in}} the second with a goal from Hariss Harun. Bengaluru were unlucky as <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> post a couple of times, but couldn't score a goal, but continued the attack. Finally in the closing minutes, Eugeneson Lyngdoh scored a goal directly from the corner and the match went into extra-time. Johor Darul Ta'zim again took the lead when Suppiah Chanturu placed the ball past Bengaluru keeper, Lalthuammawia Ralte. Bengaluru continued to attack, but couldn't find an equalizer and thus were eliminated from the AFC Champions League early. As a result, Bengaluru then contested in 2015 AFC Cup in group E.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the band}} began playing showcases and opening for local talent, they caught the {{attention}} of record executive Derek Shulman, who signed them to Mercury Records and who was part of the PolyGram company. Because Jon Bon Jovi wanted a group name, Pamela Maher, a friend of Richard Fischer and an employee of Doc McGhee, suggested they call themselves Bon Jovi, following the example of the other famous two-word bands such as Van Halen. This name was chosen instead of the original idea of Johnny Electric. Pamela's suggestion of the name was met with little enthusiasm, but two years later <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> charts under that name.|$|E
5000|$|... 1994 saw {{the band}} re-grouping, {{and working on}} {{material}} for their next record, and continuing to play shows in the midwest. During the summer of 1994, <b>they</b> again <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> road, this time focusing on the western US with Endpoint and Shift.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most tennis games, Dream Match Tennis is {{controlled}} primarily {{through the use}} of [...] rather than simply the directional buttons. If a player wants to hit a cross-court shot, <b>they</b> have to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball slightly early. If <b>they</b> want to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball in the opposite direction, <b>they</b> have to <b>hit</b> it slightly later (i.e., when it's going behind the player's character). The directional buttons can be used to get extra angle or direction; for instance, the downwards directional button makes the ball go short, and is useful for hitting angled cross-court shots.|$|R
5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with systems named after places, saints or things <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> before <b>the</b> formal start of naming in the Western Pacific.
