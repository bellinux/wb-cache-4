5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|Men {{were to be}} enlisted {{into the}} Force by a {{specific}} county association {{and as part of}} a specific corps; if that corps contained multiple units, he was to be posted to one of his choosing. As with the Regular Army, men were not permitted to be transferred from one corps to another or to a regular unit without their consent. Periods of service were not to exceed four years, and could be extended for a further four years {{at the end of that}} period. If the Force was called out for permanent service when <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> man's discharge came due, he could be required to prolong his service by up to twelve months. A member of the Force could buy his discharge before the end of his term by giving three months notice and paying a sum of up to five pounds, except in times of embodiment for service, and could be discharged for disobedience to orders or misconduct as judged by his commanding officer. First appointments to the lowest grade of officer in any Territorial Force unit were to be given to persons recommended by the association president, provided they fulfilled all the necessary qualifications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we extend the XPath data model and query {{language}} to include valid time. XPath is <b>a</b> language <b>for</b> specifying locations within an XML document.

We extend the XPath query language with an axis to access nodes in a valid-time view of <b>the</b> valid <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> node. <b>The</b> view is a calendar-specific formatting of <b>the</b> valid <b>time</b> in XML. By rendering <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in XML, we can reuse nontemporal XPath to extract the desired information within a valid-time axis. The extension is fully backwards-compatible with XPath. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{motion is}} periodic, repeating {{itself in a}} {{sinusoidal}} fashion with constant amplitude, A.
