The Scientific American article that introduced the tinfoil phonograph to the public mentioned Marey, Rosapelly and Barlow as well as Scott as creators of devices for recording but, importantly, not reproducing sound.

A decade later, Edison developed a greatly improved phonograph that used a hollow wax cylinder instead of a foil sheet. This proved to be both a better-sounding and far more useful and durable device.

50|$|Boats from Khasab take {{tourists}} {{on trips}} {{to view the}} dolphins common in the waters around the Musandam, {{as well as to}} visit Telegraph Island, for a short time (between 1865 and 1868) the site of a manned <b>telegraph</b> <b>repeater</b> station on the cable section between Bahrain and Bombay.|$|E
5000|$|Navigation of {{the ship}} {{took place on the}} bridge, and the {{electronics}} were updated throughout thevessels’ service life. The bridge contained a compass, engine-order <b>telegraph,</b> gyro <b>repeater,</b> andhelm. Behind the bridge on the starboard side was the chartroom while the radar room with afathometer was on the port side. In the aft section of the bridge deck were communicationsrooms that received and sent communiqués. The gyro room was on the first platform beneath thenavigation bridge ...|$|R
50|$|Barrow Creek {{was chosen}} as a site for an Overland <b>Telegraph</b> morse <b>{{repeater}}</b> station by John Ross in September 1871. The station was officially opened on 16 August 1872 by Charles Todd. It was one of 15 such repeater stations on a network traversing Australia and linking to Europe, providing essential communication services. A manned repeater station in newer buildings remained in operation until at least the 1970s. There was also a post office and telephone exchange servicing local cattle stations. The original Telegraph Station has been preserved {{and is now a}} monument to the troubles which beset {{the early days of the}} Territory.|$|R
2500|$|A key {{advantage}} seen by Sinclair {{and his colleagues}} (inspecting the site {{under the cover of}} [...] "Captain Ridley's shooting party") was Bletchley's geographical centrality. It was almost immediately adjacent to Bletchley railway station, where the [...] "Varsity Line" [...] between Oxford and Cambridgewhose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakersmet the main West Coast railway line connecting London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Watling Street, the main road linking London to the north-west (now the A5) was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the <b>telegraph</b> and telephone <b>repeater</b> station in nearby Fenny Stratford.|$|R
50|$|The Eyre Telegraph Station is a {{building}} on the remote south coast of Western Australia, on the Great Australian Bight. Built in 1897 of local limestone, it is a substantial one-storey structure, with a wide timber-framed verandah and a corrugated iron roof, that housed a <b>telegraph</b> <b>repeater</b> station on the line between Adelaide, South Australia, and Albany, Western Australia. It is now within the Nuytsland Nature Reserve, below the Nullarbor Plain escarpment, and is surrounded by mallee woodland and sand dunes.|$|E
50|$|The Overland Telegraph {{that once}} linked Melbourne to London was {{constructed}} in the 1870s and forged a corridor {{through the middle of}} the continent that the Explorer’s Way and Ghan train now travel. A temporary building for a <b>telegraph</b> <b>repeater</b> station was erected near the watercourse of Tennant Creek in 1872. Two years later, the solid stone buildings of the Tennant Creek Telegraph Station that remain on the site today, were completed by the occupants of the station. This is one of the four remaining original telegraph stations in Australia. Tennant Creek was the site of Australia’s last gold rush during the 1930s and at that time was the third-largest gold producer in Australia. The Tennant Creek Telegraph Station remained an isolated outpost until that time.|$|E
5000|$|The track {{follows a}} {{traditional}} Aboriginal trading route. Along the Track are numerous springs feeding {{water from the}} Great Artesian Basin, the most accessible examples being the mound springs found in Wabma Kadarbu Mound Springs Conservation Park near Coward Springs. Later, because {{of the availability of}} water, the route was chosen for the steam-train powered Central Australian Railway, the original route of The Ghan, also the route taken by the explorer John McDouall Stuart on his third expedition in 1859. [...] Remnants of the many railway sidings and bridges, the ruins of railway buildings, and Overland <b>Telegraph</b> <b>repeater</b> stations are located along the track - some of the best preserved are the Coward Springs Campground - complete with natural artesian spa and Curdimurka.|$|E
5000|$|In 1864 the Government of India {{contracted}} the Gutta Percha company to manufacture the core. Henley’s Telegraph Works was {{to construct the}} armouring, and Sir Charles Bright was appointed the consulting engineer. Because telegraph signals tended to fade over distance, {{it was necessary to}} build a series of repeater stations along the cable route to boost them, hence the decision to build a repeater station at Musandam. The cable was landed on a small rocky island in the Elphinstone Inlet (Khor Ash Sham) of the Musandam Peninsula. Hence this island became known as <b>Telegraph</b> Island. A <b>repeater</b> station was built on the island, which was about a mile offshore, because of fears about the volatile tribes on the mainland, primarily the Zahuriyeen tribe, who lived on the nearby Maqtab Isthmus. The work of laying the Gwadar to Musandam section took a month to complete.|$|R
5000|$|During {{construction}} of the Overland Telegraph line from Adelaide to Darwin in 1870, workers first crossed a creek that was notable for the pine trees that grew on its banks. In 1871 workers digging holes for the telegraph line found gold in the soil, triggering another Australian gold rush. The town grew rapidly with the influx of miners, {{many of whom were}} Chinese immigrants brought into the Territory from 1874 as a source of cheap labour. [...] By 1873, a <b>telegraph</b> <b>repeater</b> station and police camp had been established. By 1875 there were two hotels, The Royal Mail and The Standard, competing for business. A public school opened in the town in 1899. By the 1890s, up to 15 mines were operating in the area, and the town's population exceeded 3000 people.|$|E
50|$|On 29 December 1859 {{the newly}} {{constructed}} telegraph line {{was brought into}} use, the line was built generally alongside the Great Western Road from Sydney to Bathurst and was constructed of timber poles with one galvanised wire tied to insulators on each pole. At several intermediate points along the route a <b>telegraph</b> <b>repeater</b> station was located, including Parramatta, Penrith, Katoomba and Hartley. At the intermediate repeater stations an operator manually retyped the message, passing it through that location. The system operated on the earth return principle whereby the circuit started at a large battery at one end (end A), via a morse key used by the telegraph operator, passed along the galvanised iron wire attached to the poles, then through the morse instrument {{at the far end}} (end B) and returned to the battery (at end A) through the ground (earth). This was a cheap method of construction requiring only one wire and no pole crossarms.|$|E
