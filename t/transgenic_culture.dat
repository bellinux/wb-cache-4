40|$|With the {{worldwide}} use of insecticides, {{the number of}} resistant insect species increases resulting in decreased efficacy of pesticides and threat of human welfare by crop failures and disease transmission. Environmental concentrations of some insecticides are so high that even populations of non-target organisms are selected for resistance. Thus, Cyp 6 g 1 -overexpressing strains of Drosophila melanogaster Meig. were selected; they are resistant {{to a wide range}} of diverse insecticides, including DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and imidacloprid. Up to now however, no evidence has been available that the cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase CYP 6 G 1 is able to metabolise insecticides. This should be studied regarding imidacloprid, DDT, and methoxychlor by heterologous expression of Cyp 6 g 1 in cell suspension cultures of Nicotiana tabacum L. as convenient in vitro system. The required vectors with cDNA of Cyp 6 g 1 and vectors with cDNA of Cyp 71 u 4 v 2 (barley) and Cyp 3 a 4 (human) for additional studies, were constructed, tobacco cells were transformed and studied by molecular biology. It was demonstrated, that CYP 6 G 1 is capable of metabolising the (14 C-labelled) insecticides. Cyp 6 g 1 -transgenic culture 6 L converted 400 µg imidacloprid within 48 h to 60 % of 4 -hydroxyimidacloprid, 20 % of 5 -hydroxyimidacloprid, 7 % of olefinic imidacloprid and minor amounts of 4, 5 -dihydroxyimidacloprid with an absolute metabolic rate of 86 % (no detectable turnover in the non-transgenic culture LS). In supplementary studies, the metabolic pathway of imidacloprid derived from CYP 6 G 1 was elucidated, and it was shown that the appearance of the olefinic metabolite was traced back to the influence of the acidic media. After simultaneous application of P 450 inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (200 µg), the CYP 6 G 1 -dependent metabolism of imidacloprid (20 µg, 24 h) was inhibited by 82 %. DDT (20 µg) was only converted under anaerobic conditions in a closed system within 48 h by reductive dechlorination to 16 % DDD (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) (in one parallel) besides low amounts of possible further metabolites with an absolute metabolic rate of 37 %. However, this result showed only a limited reproducibility. In the LS culture only 2 % DDD were detected in the closed system with an absolute metabolic rate of 11 %. Methoxychlor (45. 8 µg) was converted to 17 % of catechol methoxychlor, 16 % of trishydroxymethoxychlor, 8 % of bishydroxymethoxychlor, and 6 % of monohydroxymethoxychlor in the 6 L cell culture within 24 h (absolute metabolic rate: 96 %). In contrast to studies with imidacloprid and DDT, LS culture showed a high absolute metabolic rate of 62 % regarding methoxychlor. Nevertheless, 34 % of the metabolic rate and especially the increased formation of trishydroxymethoxychlor and catechol methoxychlor could be traced back to the enzymatic activity of CYP 6 G 1. Similarly, the absolute metabolic rate of methoxychlor in 6 L and LS culture was inhibited by 43 % and 92 %, respectively, after simultaneous application of piperonyl butoxide (458 µg). Due to this treatment, the glycoside fraction decreased in favour of primary metabolites. The metabolic capacity of CYP 6 G 1 leads to detoxification of different insecticides towards Drosophila. Thus, the gap between the supposed resistance gene Cyp 6 g 1 and the observed resistance phenomenon was closed by the evidence that CYP 6 G 1 is at least able to metabolise three insecticides. It should be mentioned that CYP 6 G 1 is presumably not alone responsible for the resistance towards DDT but confers probably resistance towards methoxychlor. Using 4 -n-nonylphenol, a substrate of CYP 71 U 4 v 2, which was shown to be overexpressed in barley during pathogen defence, was finally identified. Cyp 71 u 4 v 2 -transgenic culture formed the main metabolites 4 ’-hydroxy- 4 -n-nonylphenol and 5 ’-hydroxy- 4 -n-nonylphenol with an absolute metabolic rate of 93 %. In the non-transgenic culture, a high metabolic rate of 60 % was also detected. However, the pattern of side chain hydroxylated metabolites with the main metabolite 8 ’-hydroxy- 4 -n-nonylphenol differed obviously from that of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>culture</b> – thus clearly proving the enzymatic activity of CYP 71 U 4 v 2. The turnover of the degradation product of nonylphenol polyethoxylates formerly used in pesticide formulations by endogenous enzymes could be quite relevant for barley. The present work showed that the tobacco cell suspension culture is a convenient expression system for P 450 genes of diverse origin enabling to elucidate or predict metabolism-based resistance phenomena without the need of expression of appropriate P 450 reductase...|$|E

The present study {{deals with the}} effect of rolB on phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and stilbene synthase (STS) gene expression in two rolB transgenic V. amurensis callus cultures with different levels of rolB expression and resveratrol production. The total expression of PALs and STSs in rolB <b>transgenic</b> <b>cultures</b> increased 1. 3 – 3. 8 times compared with the control culture. In the rolB <b>transgenic</b> <b>cultures</b> expression of VaPAL 1, VaPAL 2, and six STS genes was increased, while expression of VaPAL 3 and VaSTS 6 was not significantly changed. These results suggest that rolB increases resveratrol production via selective enhancement of expression of individual genes from PAL and STS gene families.

40|$|Aggregates of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau are {{hallmarks}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) leading to neurodegeneration and synaptic loss. While increasing {{evidence suggests that}} inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) may mitigate certain aspects of AD neuropathology, the precise role of different NMDAR subtypes for Aβ- and tau-mediated toxicity remains to be elucidated. Using mouse organotypic hippocampal slice <b>cultures</b> from arcAβ <b>transgenic</b> mice combined with Sindbis virus-mediated expression of human wild-type tau protein (hTau), we show that Aβ caused dendritic spine loss independently of tau. However, the presence of hTau was required for Aβ-induced cell death accompanied by increased hTau phosphorylation. Inhibition of NR 2 B-containing NMDARs abolished Aβ-induced hTau phosphorylation and toxicity by preventing GSK- 3 β activation but did not affect dendritic spine loss. Inversely, NR 2 A-containing NMDAR inhibition as well as NR 2 A-subunit knockout diminished dendritic spine loss but not the Aβ effect on hTau. Activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs in primary neurons caused degeneration of hTau-expressing neurons, which could be prevented by NR 2 B-NMDAR inhibition but not by NR 2 A knockout. Furthermore, caspase- 3 activity was increased in arcAβ <b>transgenic</b> <b>cultures.</b> Activity was reduced by NR 2 A knockout but not by NR 2 B inhibition. Accordingly, caspase- 3 inhibition abolished spine loss but not hTau-dependent toxicity in arcAβ <b>transgenic</b> slice <b>cultures.</b> Our data show that Aβ induces dendritic spine loss via a pathway involving NR 2 A-containing NMDARs and active caspase- 3 whereas activation of eSyn NR 2 B-containing NMDARs is required for hTau-dependent neurodegeneration, independent of caspase- 3...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Genetics. Institute for Plant Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{main goal}} of this project was to {{elucidate}} the apparent role of neutral invertase (NI) in sucrose accumulation in sugarcane. In {{the first part of}} the study putative transgenic cell lines (transformed with antisense NI constructs) were characterised to confirm the stable integration and expression of the transgene. Batch suspension cultures were used to initiate replicate cultures of several of these transgenic lines as well as a control, and the metabolism of the cultures during a 14 day growth cycle was examined. The transgenic lines had substantially reduced levels of NI activity. While the activities of the other invertases remained unchanged, the activity of sucrose synthase (SuSy) was significantly higher in the <b>transgenic</b> suspension <b>cultures</b> relative to the control. Throughout the growth cycle, sucrose concentrations in the transgenic lines were consistently higher, and glucose and fructose concentrations lower, than the control. The <b>transgenic</b> <b>cultures</b> also exhibited a decreased growth rate in comparison to the control. Labelling studies confirmed a decrease in the in vivo rate of invertase-mediated sucrose hydrolysis in the transgenic lines, as well as indicating a decline in the partitioning of carbon to respiratory pathways in these cultures. In the second part of the study, which focussed on greenhouse-grown transgenic plants, similar results were reported. NI activity was significantly decreased, and SuSy activity increased in all of the tissues sampled. The sucrose concentration and purity were also higher in the transgenic tissues, while the in vivo sucrose hydrolysis rate was lower. Allocation of carbon to respiration was lower in the transgenic plants, suggesting that a decrease in sucrose breakdown reduces the availability of hexoses for growth and respiration. Overall, the results suggest that NI plays a key role in the control of sucrose metabolism, and that changes in the activity of this enzyme have far-reaching effects on cellular metabolism. The fact that the trends reported in the whole-plant studies parallel those of the suspension cultures confirms that suspension cultures can be used as a model system in metabolic engineering research in sugarcane. Thus the possibility now exists to analyse large numbers of transgenic lines in a quicker time frame and at a reduced cost in comparison to conventional methods...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, plant cells gained {{increasing}} interest as host {{systems for the}} production of human and animal pharmaceuticals. <b>Transgenic</b> tobacco suspension <b>cultures</b> are an especially promising production host because of their beneficial growth, low maintenance requirement and the possibility of contained cultivation in bioreactors under controlled conditions. The excellent product quality of plant-produced proteins was demonstrated for a multitude of proteins, but the heterogeneous and low protein productivity of <b>transgenic</b> plant suspension <b>cultures</b> is still a bottleneck that constrains their economic profitability and their competitiveness towards established systems like mammalian cells or yeasts. To overcome this current drawback various strategies are followed to boost recombinant protein level in plant suspension cultures. Currently, the optimization of bioreactor design, bioprocess control or medium composition is investigated on a broad range, but also the optimization of the plant host systems themselves are of major interest. The objective of this work was the application of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) technology for the selection of highly productive BY- 2 cells from a heterogeneous tobacco suspension culture. The BY- 2 cells co-produce the human antibody M 12 and the selectable marker protein DsRed; the coding sequences of the recombinant proteins were present as separate expression cassettes on one T-DNA. The FACS strategy was {{based on the assumption that}} the amount of the fluorescent marker protein correlates with the amount of antibody produced within a cell. Initial experiments on protoplast preparation and regeneration medium composition led to the reliable regeneration of BY- 2 protoplasts, the sustained reformation of cell walls and the efficient proliferation of plant cells at low densities (2 x 102 per ml). Starting from the heterogeneous transgenic BY- 2 suspension culture MTED# 18 the strict and consecutive flow cytometric sorting of highly DsRed fluorescent cells in pools of 20 cells resulted in the isolation of polyclonal suspension cultures that showed increased levels of both recombinant proteins and the highest producing culture MTED# 18 psR 3 C 11. 5. 8 accumulated almost 10 -fold more M 12 antibody than the parental MTED# 18 culture. Similarly, it was demonstrated that flow sorting also resulted in a fourfold enrichment of DsRed fluorescent cells that showed a homogeneous distribution of the red fluorescence. For the FACS-based generation of monoclonal lines a procedure using feeder cells was developed that enabled the regeneration of single BY- 2 cells. In fact, this work describes for the first time, a straightforward procedure for single cell regeneration after flow sorting. Monoclonal BY- 2 lines with advanced homogeneity and up to finally 13 -fold improved recombinant M 12 productivity were established. For the best monoclonal lines, i. e. MTED# 18 msR 2 C 24. 3 or MTED# 18 msR 2 C 21. 1, recombinant M 12 antibody accumulation levels of up to 182. 9 ± 7. 8 µg/g fresh weight were obtained that also remained stable over an observation period of one year. The characterization of the improved polyclonal cultures and monoclonal lines regarding growth and M 12 antibody production revealed that the growth was delayed and the overall biomass was reduced for the majority of flow sorted suspensions compared to the parental culture. Correspondingly, the time point of highest M 12 accumulation was delayed with a retardation time of approx. 30 h. The up-scaled cultivation of the monoclonal BY- 2 line MTED# 18 msR 2 C 21. 1 in a 3 l stirred tank bioreactor was successful and a volumetric M 12 antibody accumulation of 141 ± 3 mg/l was reached, a value that exceeded the one determined for the same suspension culture grown in shake flasks by 50 %. Aiming at a further increase in M 12 antibody accumulation the impact of cultivation in nitrogen-enriched medium was investigated for various monoclonal suspension lines. Indeed, the recombinant M 12 antibody amounts were 18 - 100 % higher upon cultivation in nitrogen-enriched medium compared to the standard BY- 2 medium. The FACS-supported generation of transgenic polyclonal cell lines at an early stage after a transformation resulted in the rapid generation of highly productive <b>transgenic</b> tobacco <b>cultures</b> with a time saving of 2. 5 months. BY- 2 cells were transformed with plant expression vectors encoding either the M 12 antibody in combination with DsRed or the fluorescent protein tGFP. <b>Transgenic</b> <b>cultures</b> were simultaneously established by FACS-based selection of transgenic events and by the conventional callus-based strategy. Comparative immunological analyses confirmed that the majority of <b>transgenic</b> suspension <b>cultures</b> originating from the FACS selection were of superior homogeneity and produced 1. 6 -fold more M 12 antibody or respectively 2. 4 -fold more tGFP compared to the amounts determined for the cultures derived from the conventional transformation procedure...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by synaptic alterations and neurodegeneration. Histopathological hallmarks represent amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau. To determine whether synaptic changes and neurodegeneration share common pathways, we established an ex vivo model using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures from amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice combined with virus-mediated expression of EGFP-tagged tau constructs. Confocal high-resolution imaging, algorithm-based evaluation of spines, and live imaging {{were used to determine}} spine changes and neurodegeneration. We report that Abeta but not tau induces spine loss and shifts spine shape from mushroom to stubby through a mechanism involving NMDA receptor (NMDAR), calcineurin, and GSK- 3 beta activation. In contrast, Abeta alone does not cause neurodegeneration but induces toxicity through phosphorylation of wild-type (wt) tau in an NMDAR-dependent pathway. We show that GSK- 3 beta levels are elevated in APP <b>transgenic</b> <b>cultures</b> and that inhibiting GSK- 3 beta activity or use of phosphorylation-blocking tau mutations prevented Abeta-induced toxicity of tau. FTDP- 17 tau mutants are differentially affected by Abeta. While R 406 W tau shows increased toxicity in the presence of Abeta, no change is observed with P 301 L tau. While blocking NMDAR activity abolishes toxicity of both wt and R 406 W tau, the inhibition of GSK- 3 beta only protects against toxicity of wt tau but not of R 406 W tau induced by Abeta. Tau aggregation does not correlate with toxicity. We propose that Abeta-induced spine pathology and tau-dependent neurodegeneration are mediated by divergent pathways downstream of NMDAR activation and suggest that Abeta affects wt and R 406 W tau toxicity by different pathways downstream of NMDAR activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for t-resveratrol for {{industrial}} uses has generated considerable interest in its production. Heterologous resveratrol production in plant cell suspensions, apart from requiring the introduction of {{only one or two}} genes, has the advantage of high biomass yield and a short cultivation time, and thus could be an option for large-scale production. Silybum marianum {{is the source of the}} flavonolignan silymarin. Phenylpropanoid synthesis in cultures of this species can be activated by elicitation with methyl jasmonate and methylated β-cyclodextrins, with products of the pathway (coniferyl alcohol and some isomers of the silymarin complex) being released into the medium. Given that stilbene synthase shares the same key precursors involved in flavonoid and /or monolignol biosynthesis, we explored the potential of metabolically engineered S. marianum cultures for t-resveratrol production. Cell suspensions were stably transformed with Vitis vinifera stilbene synthase 3 and the expression of the transgene led to extracellular t-resveratrol accumulation at the level of milligrams per litre under elicitation. Resveratrol synthesis occurred at the expense of coniferyl alcohol. Production of silymarin was less affected in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>cultures,</b> since the flavonoid pathway is limiting for its synthesis, due to the preferred supply of precursors for the monolignol branch. The fact that the expressed STS gene took excessively produced precursors of non-bioactive compounds (coniferyl alcohol), while keeping the metabolic flow for target secondary compounds (i. e. silymarin) unaltered, opens a way to extend the applications of plant cell cultures for the simultaneous production of both constitutive and foreign valuable metabolites.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Plant Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Sugarcane is {{cultivated}} {{because of}} the high levels of sucrose it stores in its internodes. Starch metabolism has been a neglected aspect of sugarcane research despite the problems caused by it during sugarcane processing. Currently there is no information available on the starch content in different South African commercial sugarcane varieties. This project had two main aims of which the first was to determine the starch content in the internodal tissues of six commercial sugarcane varieties. The activities of ADP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and β- amylase were also determined. The second aim of the project was to manipulate starch metabolism in sugarcane using transgenesis. To achieve this, transformation vectors for the down-regulation of AGPase activity and over-expression of β-amylase activity were designed. These vectors were then used to transform sugarcane calli and the results were analysed in suspension cultures. Starch levels in sugarcane internodal tissue increased more than 4 times from young to mature internodes. There were also large differences between varieties. When mature tissues of different varieties were compared, their starch concentration varied between 0. 18 and 0. 51 mg g- 1 FW, with the majority of the varieties having a starch concentration between 0. 26 and 0. 32 mg g- 1 FW. NCo 376 ’s starch concentration was much lower than the rest at 0. 18 mg g- 1 FW and N 19 ’s was much higher at 0. 51 mg. g- 1 FW. There was also a very strong correlation between starch and sucrose concentration (R 2 = 0. 53, p ≤ 0. 01) which could be {{due to the fact that}} these metabolites are synthesized from the same hexose-phosphate pool. No correlation was evident between starch concentration and AGPase activity. This was true for correlations based on either tissue maturity or variety. β-amylase activity expressed on a protein basis was almost 5 times higher in the young internodes compared to mature internodes, suggesting that carbon might be cycled through starch in these internodes. AGPase activity in the <b>transgenic</b> suspension <b>cultures</b> was reduced by between 0. 14 and 0. 54 of the activity of the wild type control. This reduction led to a reduction in starch concentration of between 0. 38 and 0. 47 times that of the wild type control. There was a significant correlation between the reduction in AGPase activity and the reduction in starch (R 2 = 0. 58, p ≤ 0. 05). β-amylase activity in the <b>transgenic</b> suspension <b>cultures</b> was increased to 1. 5 - 2 times that of the wild type control. This led to a reduction in starch concentration of between 0. 1 and 0. 4 times that of the wild type control.

Cells undergoing PCD were found to display characteristic death morphology, caused by cytoplasmic retraction of the protoplast, and to have cleaved DNA. We evaluated if the morphological characteristics of PCD could be used to monitor changes in cell death induction thresholds in <b>transgenic</b> cell <b>cultures</b> with high levels of peroxidase activity. Again, using a heat shock assay, we show that tobacco cell cultures with elevated levels of peroxidase have higher cell death induction threshold levels than wild type tobacco cell cultures. Thus, assessing PCD associated morphological changes can report on the effect of altering peroxidase genes on cell death activation in tobacco. This study demonstrates that PCD morphology could routinely be used to monitor the effects of introduced genes on programmed cell death induction thresholds in plants...|$|R

Fused-silica capillary and an alkaline solution of 20 mM ammonium acetate at pH 8. 5 are used being the most suitable {{for the analysis of}} choline and atropine in less than 10 min. Under the optimized conditions, including CE and ESI-MS parameters, the method resolved both compounds with very high sensitivity. The system exhibited good linear response in the range of 25 – 500 mg/L and 500 – 1000 mg/L for choline and atropine, respectively. The detection limit of choline was 18 mg/L and 320 mg/L for atropine.

40|$|Msx 1 and Msx 2 double mutants exhibit severe {{limb and}} heart phenotypes.   Msx 1 {{has been shown}} to inhibit {{terminal}} differentiation by acting as a potent repressor of transcriptional regulation.   This study outlines the identification of two  highly conserved enhancer elements of the Msx 1 gene that drive transgene expression in two distinct migrating cell populations. The proximal enhancer, PE, drives transgene expression in Pax 3 expressing pre-muscle masses, which {{in the context of the}} known function of Msx 1 in muscle de-differentiation, supports a role for Msx 1 in delaying the differentiation of myogenic limb precursor cells and aiding in their migration.   Furthermore, using a combination of bioinformatics, reporter gene assays in tissue <b>culture,</b> <b>transgenics</b> and ChIP assays, an interaction of the TCF 4 transcription factor and PE was identified that is critical for its expression.   Consistent with this, <b>transgenic</b> explant <b>culture</b> data demonstrates a role of Wnt signalling in supporting the activity of the PE enhancer immigrating limb pre-muscle mass cells where Msx 1 may play a role in allowing migration of these cells by hindering myogenesis. Msx 1 is expressed in cardiac neural crest (CNC) cells migrating from rhombomere 6 and {{has been shown to}} be essential in outflow tract development.   An additional enhancer of Msx 1 was identified, KE, that has been exceptionally highly conserved in cis with the Msx 1 gene in all vertebrate species.   Transgene expression in CNC and the presence of heart-specific transcription binding sites within KE suggest a role for this element during cardiogenesis. The identification of these enhancers, which have been better conserved than the coding sequence of the gene they regulate, argues a shift in focus from gene coding regions to gene regulatory regions when attempting to identify the genetic causes of congenital limb and heart malformations.

40|$|Plant {{alkaloid}} biosynthesis produces many {{natural products}} with medicinal value. For example, vinblastine and vincristine from Catharanthus roseus monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis, and camptothecin derivatives from Ophiorrhiza pumila quinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, are anticancer agents currently {{used in the}} clinic. Strictosidine synthase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of these medicinal natural products, but its narrow substrate scope limits precursor-directed biosynthesis of alkaloid analogs in plant cell cultures. I describe two new assays to monitor strictosidine synthase activity, which enable the rapid screening of enzyme mutant libraries to identify two strictosidine synthase variants that accept new substrates. A <b>transgenic</b> plant cell <b>culture</b> that contains one of these mutants generated "unnatural" monoterpene indole alkaloids in C. roseus. I also describe the characterization of 0. pumila strictosidine synthase, which has considerably broader substrate specificity than the homologous enzyme from C. roseus. This alternative catalyst is a candidate enzyme for construction of <b>transgenic</b> cell <b>cultures,</b> and potentially useful as a biocatalyst, since it catalyzes the asymmetric Pictet- Spengler reaction to form tetrahydro-p-carboline pharmacophores. I used computer modeling to propose a model for how strictosidine synthase achieves its high stereoselectivity; this model {{may be used to}} engineer a Pictet-Spenglerase that forms the alternative stereoisomer. (cont.) Such a stereocomplementary catalyst would be useful in biocatalysis, giving the synthetic organic chemist access to both stereoisomers in high enantiomeric purity. Finally, I describe the total synthesis of stereoisomer mixtures of indole alkaloid precursors, and use these mixtures to determine the stereoselectivity of strictosidine synthase and two subsequent enzymes in monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis. The combination of chemical synthesis and the recruitment of enzymes from unrelated biosynthetic pathways could generate diverse alkaloid libraries, containing different stereoisomers, for bioactivity evaluation. by Peter Bernhardt.

40|$|The {{medicinal}} plant Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) produces over 130 monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) natural products. Many of these compounds have pharmaceutical value, {{such as the}} anticancer agents vinblastine and vincristine. Unnatural modifications can impart novel bioactivity to the parent natural product. Advances in synthetic biology and microbial engineering have allowed overproduction of natural products and their analogs in non-native organisms such as yeast and E. coli. However, re-engineering of plant pathways to yield "novel" products has been limited, particularly {{when compared to the}} successes achieved in prokaryotic systems. This thesis describes several strategies to re-engineer MIA biosynthesis in periwinkle to produce novel alkaloids. The first strategy involves the introduction of a biosynthetic enzyme with redesigned substrate specificity into periwinkle. The resulting <b>transgenic</b> plant <b>culture</b> produces a variety of unnatural alkaloid compounds when co-cultured with precursors that the re-engineered enzyme has been designed to accept. The second strategy improves upon this work by enabling periwinkle to autonomously synthesize precursor analogs in situ. Specifically, the prokaryotic halogenation machinery was introduced into the genome of periwinkle, which lacks the biosynthetic ability to produce halogenated compounds. These halogenases function {{within the context of the}} plant cell to generate halogenated precursor, which is then shuttled into MIA metabolism to yield halogenated alkaloids. Altogether, a new functional group-an organohalide-was introduced into plant secondary metabolism in a regioselective and predictable manner. The third strategy involves RNAi-mediated suppression of MIA biosynthesis in periwinkle. Alkaloid production was obliterated in the resulting <b>transgenic</b> plant <b>culture.</b> The silenced plant culture produces a variety of fluorinated alkaloids when co-cultured with fluorinated starting substrate. The yields of some unnatural alkaloids were improved since the natural precursor was absent. Finally, the fourth strategy describes chemical functionalization of halogenated MIAs. Postbiosynthetic chemical derivatizations of halogenated MIAs using palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions robustly afforded aryl and heteroaryl analogs of MIAs. Altogether, the work described in this thesis demonstrates the versatility of {{medicinal plant}}s in the generation of unnatural alkaloids. Thus, despite their genetic complexity, plants are a viable platform for synthetic biology efforts. by Weerawat Runguphan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Short interfering RNA (siRNA) {{is widely}} used for {{studying}} post-transcriptional gene silencing and holds great promise {{as a tool for}} both identifying function of novel genes and validating drug targets. Two siRNA fragments (siRNA-a and -b), which were designed against different specific areas of coding region of the same target green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, were used to silence GFP expression in cultured gfp transgenic cells of rice (Oryza sativa L.; OS), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.; GH), Fraser fir [Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir; AF], and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana Mill.; PV). Differential gene silencing was observed in the bombarded transgenic cells between two siRNAs, and these results were consistent with the inactivation of GFP confirmed by laser scanning microscopy, Northern blot, and siRNA analysis in tested <b>transgenic</b> cell <b>cultures.</b> These data suggest that siRNA-mediated gene inactivation can be the siRNA specific in different plant species. These results indicate that siRNA is a highly specific tool for targeted gene knockdown and for establishing siRNA-mediated gene silencing, which could be a reliable approach for large-scale screening of gene function and drug target validation...|$|R

40|$|Inducible cAMP early {{repressor}} (ICER) is {{a member}} of the CREM transcription factor family and is a dominant negative regulator of cAMP-mediated transcription. PTH has been shown to induce ICER expression potently and transiently in cultured osteoblasts and in calvariae in vivo. To establish the role of ICER in bone, we previously developed transgenic mice overexpressing ICER in vivo by cloning ICER cDNA with an N-terminal FLAG epitope downstream of a 3. 6 kb fragment of the rat Col 1 a 1 promoter (pOBCol 3. 6 -ICER), targeting ICER overexpression to cells of the osteoblast lineage. ICER transgenic mice showed reduced body size and weight, a dramatic reduction in trabecular bone parameters and disruption of cortical bone integrity. Serum osteocalcin from ICER transgenic mice was dramatically reduced compared to wild type littermates. Femurs showed a marked reduction in osteocalcin (OC) expression while Col 1 a 1 and bone sialoprotein (BSP) expression was less affected. ^ Ex vivo analysis of osteogenic bone marrow stromal cell cultures showed reduced expression of Col 1 a 1, BSP and OC as well as reduced mineralization. In addition, studies of bone marrow stromal cells cultured with RANKL and m-CSF showed an increase in osteoclastogenesis in ICER <b>transgenic</b> <b>cultures</b> compared to wild type cells. Therefore, the low bone mass phenotype seen in ICER transgenic mice is likely due to an uncoupling of bone remodeling involving both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. ^ The loss of osteocalcin gene expression suggested that ICER may regulate its expression in osteoblasts. Activating transcription factor- 4 (ATF 4) has been shown to induce osteocalcin expression at the OSE 1 site. To determine if ICER regulated ATF 4 -induced osteocalcin gene expression, MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were transfected with a promoter-reporter construct containing four multimerized OSE 1 sites cloned into the pGL 3 -basic vector (4 OSE 1 -Luc). Cells were co-transfected with pCR 3. 1 -ICER and/or pCMV-ATF 4 expression. ATF 4 induced 4 OSE 1 -Luc activity 30 -fold over control. ICER DNA was shown to potently repressed ATF 4 induction at the OSE 1 site. ^ We conclude that ICER overexpression in osteoblasts results in impaired osteoblast differentiation and function with a concomitant increase in osteoclastogenesis leading to a low bone mass phenotype in ICER transgenic mice. Furthermore, ICER represses osteocalcin gene expression likely due to disruption of ATF 4 function. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} endogenous glucocorticoid signaling in bone, we previously developed Col 2. 3 -HSD 2 and Col 3. 6 -HSD 2 transgenic mice in which a 2. 3 -kb or 3. 6 -kb Colla 1 promoter fragment drives expression of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD 2) in mature and early osteoblasts, respectively. In the first study, we first characterized the bone phenotype of Col 3. 6 -HSD 2 mice. Col 3. 6 -HSD 2 mice had decreased trabecular bone in vertebra and decreased cortical bone in femur and tibia. Transgenic calvarial osteoblast and bone marrow stromal cultures had decreased alkaline phosphatase and mineral staining, and reduced Colla 1, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin mRNA expression. Cell growth and proliferation were decreased in <b>transgenic</b> <b>cultures.</b> <b>Transgenic</b> bone marrow cells showed more osteoclast formation in vitro. However, osteoclast resorptive activity was decreased in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis showed that multiple signaling pathways were affected in transgenic osteoblasts including cell cycle and integrin. These data suggest that endogenous glucocorticoid signaling is required for optimal bone mass acquisition by affecting both the osteoblast and osteoclast lineages. ^ Second, we studied whether murine osteoclast lineage cells express 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD 1). Osteoclast precursors from bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), RAW 264. 7 cells, and sorted precursors based on surface markers (CD 11 b- CD 45 R- CD 3 -CD 115 +) were treated with M-CSF and RANKL to induce osteoclast formation. HSD 1 was expressed in progenitor cells and significantly reduced in osteoclasts, while HSD 2 expression was not changed. When the progenitor cells were treated with M-CSF or up to 4 days, M-CSF caused a time- and dose-dependent reduction of HSD 1 mRNA, with the greatest reduction after only one day treatment. To study the function of HSD 1 in osteoclast formation, BMMs were treated with M-CSF and RANKL {{in the presence of}} 11 -DHC and its active metabolite corticosterone for up to 5 days. Both steroids caused a dose- and time-dependent suppression of osteoclast formation. The major inhibition of osteoclastogenesis occurred at the early stage of osteoclast formation, and the inhibition was blunted by pre-treatment with the HSD inhibitor carbenoxolone (CBX). These data show that osteoclast precursors express HSD 1 as a means of generating locally active glucocorticoids and this system declines during osteoclast formation in vitro. ...|$|R

40|$|OsRac 1, {{one of the}} Rac/Rop {{family of}} small GTPases, plays {{important}} roles in defense responses, including {{a role in the}} production of reactive oxygen species mediated by NADPH oxidase. We have identified an effector of OsRac 1, namely rice (Oryza sativa) cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (OsCCR 1), an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis. Lignin, which is polymerized through peroxidase activity by using H 2 O 2 in the cell wall, {{is an important factor in}} plant defense responses, because it presents an undegradable mechanical barrier to most pathogens. Expression of OsCCR 1 was induced by a sphingolipid elicitor, suggesting that OsCCR 1 participates in defense signaling. In in vitro interaction and two-hybrid experiments, OsRac 1 was shown to bind OsCCR 1 in a GTP-dependent manner. Moreover, the interaction of OsCCR 1 with OsRac 1 led to the enzymatic activation of OsCCR 1 in vitro. <b>Transgenic</b> cell <b>cultures</b> expressing the constitutively active OsRac 1 accumulated lignin through enhanced CCR activity and increased reactive oxygen species production.
