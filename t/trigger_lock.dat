2500|$|... (3) The handgun ban and the trigger-lock {{requirement}} (as {{applied to}} self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District’s total ban on handgun possession {{in the home}} amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of “arms” that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition – {{in the place where}} the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute – would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a <b>trigger</b> <b>lock</b> makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. Pp.56–64.|$|E

50|$|Some {{firearms}} manufactured {{after the}} late 1990s include mandatory integral locking mechanisms {{that must be}} deactivated by a unique key before the gun can be fired. These integral locking mechanisms are intended as child-safety devices during unattended storage of the firearm—not as safety mechanisms while carrying. Other devices in this category are <b>trigger</b> <b>locks,</b> bore locks, and gun safes.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{controversy}} surrounding manufacturing standards, usage, and legislation of trigger locks. While supporters of trigger locks {{argue that they}} will save children from dying in gun accidents, critics point to demonstrations that some models can be removed by children with very little force and common household tools. Many firearms can go off if the gun is dropped. It is important to make sure to look for firearms that fully disengage the hammer when the safety is put on. A former senior product manager at Master Lock, a <b>trigger</b> <b>lock</b> manufacturer, {{was quoted as saying}} “If you put a <b>trigger</b> <b>lock</b> on any loaded gun, you are making the gun more dangerous.” Critics also point out that a <b>trigger</b> <b>lock</b> will increase the time it takes a gun owner to respond to a self-defense emergency. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Washington, D.C. law that required handguns to be locked or otherwise kept inoperative within the home, saying that this [...] "makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense." ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: US {{children}} aged between 5 years and 14 years have {{a rate of}} gun-related homicide 17 times higher and a rate of gun-related suicide and unintentional firearm injury 10 times higher than other developed countries. Gun buyback programs have been criticized as ineffective interventions in decreasing violence. The Injury Free Coalition for Kids-Worcester (IFCK-W) Goods for Guns buyback is a multipronged approach to address these concerns and {{to reduce the number}} of firearms in the community. METHODS: The IFCK-W buyback program is funded by corporate sponsors, grants, and individual donations. Citizens are instructed to transport guns, ammunition, and weapons safely to police headquarters on two Saturdays in December. Participants are guaranteed anonymity by the District Attorney 2 ̆ 7 s office and receive gift certificates for operable guns. Trained volunteers administer an anonymous survey to willing participants. Individuals who disclose having unsafely stored guns remaining at home receive educational counseling and <b>trigger</b> <b>locks.</b> Guns and ammunition are destroyed at a later time in a gun crushing ceremony. RESULTS: Since 2002, 1, 861 guns (444 rifle/shotgun, 738 pistol/revolver, and 679 automatic/semiautomatic) have been collected at a cost of 99, 250 (average, 53 /gun). Seven hundred ten people have surrendered firearms, 534 surveys have been administered, and ≈ 75 <b>trigger</b> <b>locks</b> have been distributed per year. CONCLUSIONS: IFCK-W Goods for Guns is a relatively inexpensive injury prevention model program that removes unwanted firearms from homes, raises community awareness about gun safety, and provides high-risk individuals with <b>trigger</b> <b>locks</b> and educational counseling...|$|R
5000|$|The Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 {{was passed}} by the District of Columbia city council on September 24, 1976. The law banned {{residents}} from owning handguns, automatic firearms, or high-capacity semi-automatic firearms, as well as prohibited possession of unregistered firearms. Exceptions to the ban were allowed for police officers and guns registered before 1976. The law also required firearms kept in the home to be [...] "unloaded, disassembled, or bound by a <b>trigger</b> <b>lock</b> or similar device"; this was deemed to be a prohibition on the use of firearms for self-defense in the home. On June 26, 2008, in the historic case of District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court of the United States determined that the ban and <b>trigger</b> <b>lock</b> provisions violate the Second Amendment.|$|E

50|$|Heller {{pertained to}} three District of Columbia {{ordinances}} involving restrictions on firearms amounting {{to a total}} ban.

50|$|Because {{of their}} {{inability}} to regulate firearms directly, some cities, such as Los Angeles, have prohibited residents from possessing a handgun or rifle magazine that fit more than 10 rounds, require firearms be stored in locked containers or with <b>trigger</b> <b>locks</b> installed when not in use, and have enacted ammunition regulations. Many jurisdictions have enacted ordinances restricting or banning the discharge of firearms within their boundaries.|$|R
