25|$|Tigrinya differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} classical Ethiopian Semitic language Ge'ez by having phrasal verbs {{and using a}} word-order that places the main verb last instead of first in the sentence. There is a strong Ge'ez influence on Tigrinya literature, especially with terms that relate to Christian life, Biblical names, and so on. Ge'ez, because of its status within Ethiopian culture, acted as a literary medium until relatively recent times. Aside from Ge’ez, Tigrinya itself has had development into the press as the language was incorporated in a ministry newspaper that was published by the British administration of Eritrea. It sold 5000 copies weekly and was at the affordable price of five cents and it {{was reported to be}} {{the first of its kind}} in the region. However, The earliest written example of Tigrinya is a text of local laws found in Logosarda district, Southern Region, Eritrea and in northern Ethiopia, which dates from the 13th century during the reign of the Zagwe dynasty. However, the phonology of the <b>Tigrinya</b> <b>language</b> along with the morphology still strongly shows the connection to the predecessor language of Ge'ez while the connection also displays Tigriniya's semitic character.|$|E

All of these possible realizations - velar ejective fricative, uvular ejective fricative, velar ejective affricate and uvular ejective affricate - are cross-linguistically very rare sounds.

2500|$|Protestants, {{sometimes}} {{known by}} the slang name P'ent'ay, in Eritrea make up between less than 1% to 5% of the Christians. A minor church is the Kale Hiywot Church of Eritrea. Protestant denominations include Christian Brethren, Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea. In 1926, Swedish missionaries founded the Evangelical/Lutheran Church of Eritrea. However there was tension between the Catholic Church as the Roman Catholic Italians resisted and discouraged the spread of Protestantism in their colony and even lay prohibitions and numerous constraints on {{the activities of the}} Swedish missionaries. The Lutheran Church of Eritrea and its Swedish and Eritrean missionaries were the ones who translated the Bible from Ge'ez language only understood by higher clergymen, into the <b>Tigrinya</b> <b>language</b> and other local languages and their main goal was to reach and [...] "enlighten" [...] {{as many people as possible}} in the world through education.|$|E
2500|$|P'ent'ay (from , also transliterated as Pentay or Pente) is an Amharic and <b>Tigrinya</b> <b>language</b> {{term for}} a Christian of a Protestant denomination, widely used in Ethiopia and among Ethiopians and Eritreans living abroad. The term was coined in the late 1960s and {{was used as a}} pejorative for churches that {{believed}} in the Pentecostal experience. Today, it is used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches. The term P'ent'ay is a shortening of the word [...] "Pentecostal"; however, it is widely used when referring to all Protestant Christians whether they are actual Pentecostals or not. Some Orthodox will also apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia. The equivalent rendition in many other languages is Evangelicals. The four major Evangelical denominations in Ethiopia are: the Kale Heywet (Word of Life); Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran; Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel) and Meserete Kristos (meaning [...] "Christ foundation") or Mennonite. Some P'ent'ay communities - especially Mekane Yesus - have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents mainstream, traditional Ethiopian Christianity. But {{for the most part they}} are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic bishops {{issued on}} 25 May 2014, the 23rd {{anniversary of the}} {{independence}} of the state, a pastoral letter that some saw as critical of the Government. An English translation of the document, the original of which is in the <b>Tigrinya</b> <b>language,</b> extends to 17 pages. The bishops spoke of the emigration of the many young Eritreans who risk their lives in the hope of emigrating to other countries. They repeated what they had written in 2001: [...] "o-one leaves a land of milk and honey to seek another country offering the same opportunities. If one's homeland is a place of peace, jobs and freedom of expression {{there is no reason to}} leave it to suffer hardship, loneliness and exile in an effort to look for opportunity elsewhere." [...] They spoke also of [...] "the delusion engendered as result of the non-achievement of the ends proposed, the uselessness of one’s own aspirations, looking to distant lands as the only alternative for self-fulfilment, are bringing a growing number of people to frustration and desperation. They find themselves looking at a horizon that grows always darker and heavier. Alongside this, the breakup of the family unit inside the country – through military service unlimited in terms of time and monetary reward and through the imprisonment of many young people in actual prison or in punishment camps – is exposing to misery not only elderly parents with no visible means of support, but also entire families and it is having serious consequences at the economic level as well as at the psychological and mental levels." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the east}} African Semitic <b>language</b> <b>Tigrinya,</b> gerundive {{is used to}} denote a {{particular}} finite verb form, not a verbal adjective or adverb.

In the latter case, it may sometimes be translated with an adverbial clause: bitri hidju kheydu (literally, [...] "a-stick he-took-hold-of he-began-walking") means [...] "while holding a stick, he is walking", i.e. [...] "he is carrying a stick".
