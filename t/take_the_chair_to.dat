6000|$|All the impatience of Hiram {{seemed to}} vanish the instant {{he entered the}} apartment.

He muttered to himself, 'Damn him!' ...|$|R
50|$|After the Duke had withdrawn, {{along with}} the Archbishops and the Bishops of London, Durham and Carlisle, the Bishop of Chester <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> deny reports that the College would be open only to Anglicans.

5000|$|Another <b>chair</b> of <b>the</b> same style, {{believed}} at {{the time}} to be of the same date, was owned by Horace Walpole and kept in his Gothic pile Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, Middlesex. When the contents were sold in 1842, [...] the then vicar of Glastonbury, the Reverend Lionel Lewis, made an impassioned speech telling <b>the</b> bidders <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> belonged in Glastonbury. Nobody bidding against him, Lewis <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> St John's Church in Glastonbury where it remains. However, this chair is now believed to be a later copy.|$|R
6000|$|Brother Bawkwell <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> offered <b>to</b> him, {{and opened}} the proceedings, in solemn silence, by looking at his watch. [...] "Twenty-five minutes past two," [...] he said to himself--and put the watch back again.|$|R

His clothes and bearing, and quiet, unobtrusive manners, all seemed to suggest truthfully enough his possible identity--an English detective from an advertised office. Duncombe smiled as he realized the almost pitiful inadequacy of such methods.|$|R

6000|$|Mercy paused. Grace's {{reception}} had startled her. She instinctively <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> nearest <b>to</b> her {{to support}} herself.

60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{opposite}} <b>to</b> hers. <b>The</b> chafing-dish {{was between}} them. He {{was filled with}} a curious sense of unreality. It was a little scene, this, out of a story or a play. It didn't actually concern him. It wasn't Nora who sat within a few feet of him, bending down over the chafing-dish and stirring its contents vigorously.|$|R
60|$|Bessy either {{forgot to}} {{introduce}} her escort {{or did not}} care to. She nodded a dismissal to him, spoke sweetly to Blair, and then <b>took</b> <b>the</b> empty <b>chair</b> next <b>to</b> Lane.|$|R
60|$|Vane {{was sitting}} {{alone in the room}} set apart for the Clermont Company in Nairn's office, when Drayton was shown in. He <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> Vane pointed <b>to</b> and lighted a cigar the latter gave him.|$|R
60|$|Here stood a table {{covered with}} a snow-white cloth, and embellished with silver and crystal {{ornaments}} of every description. Having seated herself and having indicated <b>to</b> Jonathan <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> opposite <b>to</b> her, <b>the</b> two were presently served with a repast such as our hero had not thought could have existed out of the pages of certain extraordinary Oriental tales which one time had fallen to his lot to read.|$|R
60|$|Peter Phipps was a {{man whose}} life had been spent in facing and {{overcoming}} difficulties, but as he <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> which Josephine had somewhat ungraciously pointed, he was compelled to admit to himself that he was confronted with a task which might well tax his astuteness to the utmost. To begin with he made use {{of one of his}} favourite weapons,--silence. He sat quite still, studying the situation, and in those few moments Josephine found herself studying him. He was tall, over six feet, with burly shoulders, a thickset body, and legs rather short for his height. He was clean-shaven, his hair was a sandy grey, his complexion florid, his eyes blue and piercing. His upper lip was long, and his mouth, when closed, rather resembled some sort of a trap. He was dressed with care, almost with distinction. But for his pronounced American accent, he would probably have been taken for a Scandinavian.|$|R

6000|$|She <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{opposite}} <b>to</b> that {{on which}} he usually sat, and then began her tale. Her cousin, Barrington Erle, had brought her there, and was below, waiting {{for her in the}} Governor's house. He had procured an order for her admission that evening, direct from Sir Harry Coldfoot, the Home Secretary,--which, however, as she admitted, had been given under the idea that she and Erle were to see him together. [...] "But I would not let him come with me," [...] she said. [...] "I could not have spoken to you, had he been here;--could I?" ...|$|R
60|$|Wrayson {{found himself}} {{a few minutes}} later alone with the Baron, who, with some solemnity, rose and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{opposite}} <b>to</b> him. Conversation between them, however, languished, for the Baron spoke only in monosyllables, and his attitude gave Wrayson the idea that he viewed his presence at the chate√¢u with disfavour. With stiff punctiliousness, he begged Wrayson to try some wonderful Burgundy, and passed a box of cigarettes. He did not, however, open any topic of conversation, and Wrayson, embarrassed in his choice of subjects by the fact that any remark he could make might sound like an attempt at gratifying his curiosity, remained also silent. In a very few minutes the Baron rose.|$|R
50|$|The Council of Ministers meets on weekly basis, usually Fridays in {{the morning}} at Moncloa Palace, but exceptionally, it may meet in any other city of Spain. <b>The</b> {{meetings}} are <b>chaired</b> by <b>the</b> Prime Minister, though, in his absence, Vice presidents <b>take</b> <b>the</b> responsibility <b>to</b> <b>chair</b> over <b>the</b> cabinet. Also on exceptional occasions, the cabinet can be <b>chaired</b> by <b>the</b> King of Spain:in that event the meeting is solely consultative.|$|R
50|$|In 1906, Glicenstein {{returned}} {{from a trip to}} Germany and exhibited his paintings there until World War I broke out and he moved his family to Poland.

60|$|Magdalen {{entered the}} room as he said those words, and after the first {{greetings}} were exchanged, <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> presented <b>to</b> her with the most unsuspicious readiness. Noel Vanstone applied the Crucial Test on the spot, with the highest appreciation of the fair material which {{was the subject of}} experiment. Not the vestige of a mole was visible on any part of the smooth white surface of Miss Bygrave's neck. It mutely answered the blinking inquiry of Noel Vanstone's half-closed eyes by the flattest practical contradiction of Mrs. Lecount. That one central incident in the events of the morning was of all the incidents that had hitherto occurred, the most important in its results. That one discovery shook the housekeeper's hold on her master as nothing had shaken it yet.|$|R
25|$|The next {{match was}} between Test and Scott Steiner. After Test tried a clothesline, Steiner countered with a fallaway slam for a one count. Later during the match, Test {{attempted}} a diving double axe handle but Steiner reversed {{it into a}} suplex. In the end, Test attempted to hit Steiner with a chair but Keibler came inside <b>the</b> ring and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> Keibler tried <b>to</b> hit Test but hit Steiner, allowing Test to execute a running big boot for the pin. Therefore, Steiner became Test's property, as per the pre-match stipulation.|$|R
5000|$|At 1:45 pm on Friday 23 July 1943 nurse Doris Irene Mitchell {{went to the}} air-raid shelter where Brown's bath {{chair was}} kept. She found that {{the door was locked}} from the inside and upon {{returning}} with Mrs Brown they had met Eric Brown, then aged 19, coming out. Eric was irritated and evasive. Both women <b>took</b> <b>the</b> wheeled <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house and helped Archibald to get in. Brown was dressed in pyjamas and a dressing gown and was covered with a plaid travelling rug. Mitchell took Archibald Brown out of the house. After walking for about a mile, Brown had shifted his weight apparently while feeling for a cigarette in his pocket. Mitchell, having stopped to light the cigarette returned to the back of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> and pushed it forward. Within half a dozen paces there was a violent explosion. [...] Mitchell suffered leg injuries and {{as far as she could}} see Brown and his bath chair had completely disappeared. The police found portions of the body at the side of the road and in nearby trees and gardens.|$|R
60|$|The {{events of}} the twenty months between the {{resignation}} of Lord North (1782) and the accession of Pitt {{to the office of}} Prime Minister (December 1783) mark an important crisis in political history, and they mark an important crisis in Burke's career and hopes. Lord Rockingham had just been three months in office, when he died (July 1782). This dissolved the bond that held the two sections of the ministry together, and let loose a flood of rival ambitions and sharp animosities. Lord Shelburne believed himself to have an irresistible claim to the chief post in the administration; among other reasons, because he might have had it before Lord Rockingham three months earlier, if he had so chosen. The king supported him, not from any partiality to his person, but because he dreaded and hated Charles Fox. The character of Shelburne is one of the perplexities of the time. His views on peace and free trade make him one of the precursors of the Manchester School. No minister was so well informed as to the threads of policy in foreign countries. He was the intimate or the patron of men who now stand out as among the first lights of that time--of Morellet, of Priestley, of Bentham. Yet a few months of power seem to have disclosed faults of character, which left him without a single political friend, and blighted him with irreparable discredit. Fox, who was now the head of the Rockingham section of the Whigs, had, before the death of the late premier, been on the point of refusing to serve any longer with Lord Shelburne, and he now very promptly refused to serve under him. When Parliament met after Rockingham's death, gossips noticed that Fox and Burke continued, long after <b>the</b> Speaker had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>to</b> walk backwards and forwards in the Court of Bequests, engaged in earnest conversation. According to one story, Burke was very reluctant to abandon an office whose emoluments were as convenient to him as to his spendthrift colleague. According to another and more probable legend, it was Burke who hurried the rupture, and stimulated Fox's jealousy of Shelburne. The Duke of Richmond disapproved of the secession, and remained in the Government. Sheridan also disapproved, but he sacrificed his personal conviction to loyalty to Fox.|$|R
6000|$|ESTHER--[Shaking her head.] Goodness, Lily {{is trying}} on the nerves. [JAYSON, his two sons, JOHN and DICK, and JOHN's wife, EMILY, enter from hallway in rear. JAYSON, the father, is a short, stout, bald-headed man of sixty. A typical, small-town, New England best-family banker, {{reserved}} in pose, unobtrusively important--a placid exterior hiding querulousness and a fussy temper. JOHN JUNIOR is his father {{over again in}} appearance, but pompous, obtrusive, purse-and-family-proud, extremely irritating in his self-complacent air of authority, emptily assertive and loud. He is about forty. RICHARD, the other brother, is a typical young Casino and country club member, college-bred, good looking, not unlikable. He has been {{an officer in the}} war and has not forgotten it. EMILY, JOHN JR.'s wife, is one of those small, mouse-like women who conceal beneath an outward aspect of gentle, unprotected innocence a very active envy, a silly pride, and a mean malice. The people in the room with the exception of MRS. DAVIDSON rise to greet them. All exchange familiar, perfunctory greetings.

60|$|Breckon {{wished to}} himself {{that she had been}} able to help noticing it, or were more capable of minding her own {{business}} than she showed herself, and his heart closed about Ellen with a tenderness that was dangerously indignant. At the same time he felt himself withheld by Miss Rasmith's witness from being all to the girl that he wished to be, and that he now seemed to have been in those first days of storm, while Miss Rasmith and her mother were still keeping their cabin. He foresaw that it would end in Miss Rasmith's sympathetic nature not being able to withhold itself from Ellen's need of cheerful companionship, and he was surprised, as little as he was pleased, one morning, when he came <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> beside her <b>to</b> find Miss Rasmith in it, talking and laughing to the girl, who perversely showed herself amused. Miss Rasmith made as if to offer him the seat, but he had to go away disappointed, after standing long enough before them to be aware that they were suspending some topic while he stayed.|$|R
50|$|Sharp was not {{completely}} alone {{at the beginning of}} the struggle: the Quakers, especially in America, were committed abolitionists. Sharp had a long and fruitful correspondence with Anthony Benezet, a Quaker abolitionist in Pennsylvania. However, the Quakers were a marginal group in England, and were debarred from standing for Parliament, and they had no doubt as to whom should be the chairman of the new society they were founding, The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. On 22 May 1787, at the inaugural meeting of the Committee - nine Quakers and three Anglicans (who strengthened the committee's likelihood of influencing Parliament) - Sharp's position was unanimously agreed. In the 20 years of the society's existence, during which Sharp was ever-present at Committee meetings, such was Sharp's modesty that he would never <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> always contriving <b>to</b> arrive just after the meeting had started to avoid any chance of having to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> meeting. While the committee felt it sensible to concentrate on the slave trade, Sharp felt strongly that the target should be slavery itself. On this he was out-voted, but he worked tirelessly for the Society nevertheless.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the history of}} the Endeavor folding wheelchair. In its current incarnation, it is an adjustable folding manual wheelchair conceptually based on a diamond shaped truss (similar to a bicycle). By disconnecting this truss at two points, <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> is able <b>to</b> fold flat enough to fit in the overhead bin of an airplane. It also features "airplane wheels" for maneuvering down the aisle of an airplane, taking the place of a boarding <b>chair.</b> <b>The</b> main part of the study was a clinical trial to gain feedback on <b>the</b> current <b>chair</b> design. <b>The</b> first phase of the study involved users performing obstacles encountered on a daily basis using the Endeavor and their personal <b>chair.</b> In <b>the</b> second phase, users <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> home <b>to</b> see how <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> would function in their everyday lives. Because participants were comparing the Endeavor <b>to</b> their personal <b>chairs,</b> much of <b>the</b> feedback received was based primarily on the differences between the geometry and options of the Endeavor and their personal <b>chairs.</b> Based on <b>the</b> clinical results, the most important features that the Endeavor is lacking are: a more forgiving seatpan, and a more effective range of adjustability. In the future, a more organized approach based on product development methods should be used to develop better design criteria. The results of this study showed that in its current form, the Endeavor folding wheelchair may best be a special-purpose chair. By addressing all of the safety concerns, improving the ranges of adjustability to match the dimensions of the users in our focus group, and adding usability related options <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> may be able to function as an everyday wheelchair for many users. When our take-home participants were asked if they would like their chair better if they had "airplane wheels" five of the nine agreed. With some redesign to increase ease of use and decrease weight they could be marketed as their own product...|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} day, three-quarters {{of an hour}} before the meeting of the Board of Directors, old Mr Longestaffe called in Abchurch Lane. He was received very civilly by Miles Grendall, and asked to sit down. Mr Melmotte quite expected him, and would walk with him over to the offices of the railway, and introduce him to the Board. Mr Longestaffe, with some shyness, intimated his desire to have a few moments conversation with the chairman before the Board met. Fearing his son, especially fearing Squercum, he had made up his mind to suggest that the little matter about Pickering Park should be settled. Miles assured him that the opportunity should be given him, but that at the present moment the chief secretary of the Russian Legation was with Mr Melmotte. Either the chief secretary was very tedious with his business, or else other big men must have come in, for Mr Longestaffe was not relieved till he was summoned to walk off to the Board five minutes after the hour at which the Board should have met. He thought that he could explain his views in the street; but on the stairs they were joined by Mr Cohenlupe, and in three minutes they were in the Board room. Mr Longestaffe was then presented, and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> opposite <b>to</b> Miles Grendall. Montague was not there, but had {{sent a letter to the}} secretary explaining that for reasons with which the chairman was acquainted he should absent himself from the present meeting. 'All right,' said Melmotte. 'I know all about it. Go on. I'm not sure but that Mr Montague's retirement from among us may be an advantage. He could not be made to understand that unanimity in such an enterprise as this is essential. I am confident that the new director whom I have had the pleasure of introducing to you to-day will not sin in the same direction.' Then Mr Melmotte bowed and smiled very sweetly on Mr Longestaffe.|$|R
