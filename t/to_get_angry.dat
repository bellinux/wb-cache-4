At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis.

5|$|Veronica {{connects the}} five {{people who were}} framed to an {{incident}} where a student was publicly harassed in gym class. Keith is still dating Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel). Veronica and Wallace spend the night investigating students, and Veronica eventually deduces that Wallace ingested {{a small amount of}} an illegal substance, most likely in a gift basket earlier that year. In a flashback, Veronica and Logan make out in the car until the PCH bikers shoot out the car's windows. Veronica asks Keith for help in finding out the names of a company's shareholders.

When Logan starts <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>angry,</b> Keith barges in and makes him leave. Logan is carrying on a relationship with Kendall.|$|E
25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is {{an emotion}} that is felt in {{all stages of}} infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E

He often had {{disputes}} with his clients when they disregarded his ideas and works. He used <b>to</b> also <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> with the workers on his sites at times. It is very unfortunate that {{this aspect of}} Nari's life has attained more significance in people's minds rather than his creative genius.|$|R

2500|$|Editorially, Raymond {{sought a}} niche between Greeley's open {{partisanship}} and Bennett's party-neutrality. In {{the first issue}} of the Times Raymond announced his purpose to write in temperate and measured language and to get into a passion as rarely as possible. [...] "There are few things in this world which it is worthwhile <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> about; and they are just the things anger will not improve." [...] In controversy he meant to avoid abusive language. His editorials were generally cautious, impersonal, and finished in form.|$|E
