[...] The reviewer highlighted [...] "Hot to the Touch" [...] as an example of such an example, noting that Flame Princess represents [...] "an uncomplicated yet vastly pertinent metaphor for the hypothesis that the closer you cherish someone, the likelier they are <b>to</b> <b>singe</b> your soft exterior and the easier it is for them to affectionately melt your exposed heart." [...] Marc Snetiker of Entertainment Weekly awarded the episode a [...] "B", noting that [...] "the season four premiere of this inspired 'toon about a boy and his precocious dog is as colorful, clever, and unpredictably funny as ever." ...|$|E

Wright's men made little {{progress}} south of the Mechanicsville Road, which connected New and Old Cold Harbor, recoiling from heavy fire. North of the road, Brig. Gen. Emory Upton's brigade of Brig. Gen. David A. Russell's division also encountered heavy fire from Brig. Gen. Thomas L.

But being the bright spot in too many dull movies (He Said, She Said; Irreconcilable Differences) stalled her career.

However, the final such attempt produces a scuffle between the two camps, so loud that neighbors mistaken it for a fire or an attack by the Austrian troops stationed in Fălticeni (a military presence concomitant to the Crimean War and a Moldavian interregnum). This ends when all young men are evicted from the house, Creangă himself moving in with a local smith. In spring, it becomes apparent that the Fălticeni school is to be closed down, and its students moved to the Socola Monastery in Iași. The chapter ends with mention of the uncertainty gripping students: some decide to attempt their chances in Socola {{by the start of}} a new school year, while others abandon their career prospects.|$|E

25|$|Although a furbearer, the wildcat's skin is {{of little}} {{commercial}} value, due to the unattractive colour of its natural state, and the difficulties present in dyeing it. In the former Soviet Union, the fur of a forest wildcat usually fetched 50 kopecks, while that of a steppe wildcat fetched 60 kopecks. Wildcat skin is almost solely used for making cheap scarfs, muffs, and women's coats. It is sometimes converted into imitation sealskin. As a rule, wildcat fur is difficult to dye in dark brown or black, and {{has a tendency to}} turn green when the dye is not well settled into the hair. When dye is overly applied, wildcat fur is highly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>singeing.</b>|$|R

40|$|We present Singe, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) {{compiler}} for combustion chemistry that leverages warp specialization to pro-duce {{high performance}} code for GPUs. Instead {{of relying on}} tra-ditional GPU programming models that emphasize data-parallel computations, warp specialization allows compilers like <b>Singe</b> <b>to</b> partition computations into sub-computations which are then as-signed to different warps within a thread block. Fine-grain synchro-nization between warps is performed efficiently in hardware using producer-consumer named barriers. Partitioning computations us-ing warp specialization allows <b>Singe</b> <b>to</b> deal efficiently with the irregularity in both data access patterns and computation. Further-more, warp-specialized partitioning of computations allows <b>Singe</b> <b>to</b> fit extremely large working sets into on-chip memories. Finally, we describe the architecture and general compilation techniques necessary for constructing a warp-specializing compiler. We show that the warp-specialized code emitted by <b>Singe</b> is up <b>to</b> 3. 75 X faster than previously optimized data-parallel GPU kernels...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of an unstable allele of the singed-bristle locus on the X chromosome was studied {{in connection with}} the occurrence of lethal mutations on that same chromosome. The unstable allele, weak singed (snw), is {{under the control of the}} P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis and, in the M cytotype, mutates secondarily <b>to</b> extreme <b>singed</b> (sne) and <b>to</b> wild type (sn+) at high rates. Chromosomes whose snw allele had mutated in this fashion sustained lethal mutations at a rate of 3 %; whereas, those whose snw allele had apparently remained unchanged, acquired lethals at a lower rate, 1. 3 %. The significant difference between these values indicates a statistical coincidence between the phenomena of snw instability and X-linked lethal mutation induction. This coincidence can be explained by postulating that mutations at the singed locus sometimes release a genetic element capable of reinserting elsewhere in the chromosome. Alternately, snw instability and lethal induction might be associated because they are the effects of a common cause, perhaps some mutation-inducing substance present in various amounts in the germ cells of dysgenic flies. —The lethals that occurred on chromosomes whose snw allele had mutated to sne mapped preferentially close <b>to</b> <b>singed.</b> The lethals on the snw and sn+ chromosomes did not show this concentration on the map. Cytological analysis of samples of all three types of lethal chromosomes indicated that, with one exception, there was no detectable breakage at the singed locus itself. The single instance of breakage at singed was not associated with any change in the singed phenotype. Thus, the instability of snw apparently does not involve detectable breakage of the singed locus, or if it does, this breakage is not a common event...|$|R
