5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> <b>century,</b> Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> <b>century.</b> Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> <b>century.</b> Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is debatable. The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> <b>century.</b> It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E
5|$|Ascall's {{father was}} Ragnall mac Torcaill (died 1146), {{a man who}} may well have ruled as King of Dublin.

5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> <b>century,</b> the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) {{sought to}} explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} last {{corrector}} (C3) {{wrote in the}} 800's, possibly in Constantinople.

5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> <b>century,</b> the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E

5|$|Bow Back Rivers or Stratford Back Rivers is {{a complex}} of {{waterways}} between Bow and Stratford in east London, England, which connect the River Lea to the River Thames.

5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century, universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, to Oxford or Cambridge, or to the Continent. Just over 1,000 students have been identified as doing so between <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> <b>century</b> and 1410. Among the destinations Paris was the most important, but also Cologne, Orléans, Wittenberg, Louvain and Vienna.|$|E

5|$|On June 26, 1934, {{work began}} on the removal of <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> <b>century</b> Byzantine mosaics. It was {{conducted}} by the Mosaic Section of the Leningrad Academy of Fine Arts.
