5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the ironworks, <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|Rwandans {{have been}} growing coffee since colonial times, but until 1999 the product was classed below Grade C, making it unsalable on the global markets. <b>The</b> <b>farmers</b> {{did not have the}} means to wash and prepare their coffee {{cherries}} to specifications in a timely manner. Buyers paid US$0.33 per kilogram, a price that kept <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> poor.|$|E

50|$|Borrow recounted a {{story in}} which a farmer is hunting Twm over the theft of a bullock. <b>The</b> <b>farmer</b> reaches Twm's mother's house and asks whether Twm Shone Catti (another of Borrow's spellings) lives there. A beggar answers that he does, and agrees to hold <b>the</b> <b>farmer's</b> horse and whip for him. As <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> goes into <b>the</b> house, the beggar jumps onto the horse: it is Twm. He gallops {{to the house of}} <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> and tells <b>the</b> <b>farmer's</b> wife that <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> is in trouble, needs money urgently, and has sent Twm to fetch it, with the horse and whip to prove that the message really came from <b>the</b> <b>farmer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>farmer's</b> wife pays up. Twm, now in {{possession}} of <b>the</b> <b>farmer's</b> money and horse, hastily departs for London, later selling the horse.|$|R

50|$|Another {{variation}} {{is to eliminate}} players. <b>The</b> <b>farmer</b> is spun three times, points {{in front of them}} and says 'Oink piggy pink' and the piggy facing them must squeal. If <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> guesses correctly, that piggy is out of the game and <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> becomes a piggy. The eliminated piggy chooses another piggy to become <b>the</b> <b>farmer.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> is incorrect, he or she is out of the game, and the piggy who squealed becomes <b>the</b> <b>farmer.</b> This continues until only one farmer and one piggy remain. At this time there's no need for <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> to guess who the piggy is since only one player is left. The two remaining players are the winners.|$|R

Shortly thereafter he was promoted to the position of manager of a new local branch of the bank.|$|E
5|$|Before the Battle of Niså, Harald {{had been}} joined by Haakon Ivarsson, who {{distinguished}} himself in the battle and gained Harald's favour. Reportedly even considering {{to give him the}} title of Earl, Haakon was greatly upset when Harald later backed down from his promise. With a strong hold over the Uplands, Haakon was additionally given the earldom of Värmland by the Swedish king Stenkil. In early 1064, Haakon entered the Uplands and collected their taxes, the region thus effectively threatening to renounce their loyalty to Harald. The revolt of Haakon and <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> in the Uplands may have been the main reason why Harald finally had been willing to enter a peace agreement with Sweyn Estridsson. After the agreement, Harald went to Oslo and sent tax collectors to the Uplands, only to find that <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> would withhold their taxes until Haakon arrived. In response, Harald entered Sweden with an army and quickly defeated Haakon. Still facing opposition from <b>the</b> <b>farmers,</b> Harald embarked on a campaign to crush the areas that had withheld their taxes. Due to the remote location of the region in the interior of the country, the Uplands had never been an integrated part of the Norwegian king's realm. Using harsh measures, Harald burned down farms and small villages, and had people maimed and killed. Starting in Romerike, his campaign continued into Hedmark, Hadeland and Ringerike. Since the regions contained several rich rural communities, Harald strengthened his economic position by confiscating farming estates. By the end of 1065 there was probably peace in Norway, as any opposition had either been killed, chased into exile or silenced.|$|E

5000|$|To {{play the}} game, one player is {{chosen to be}} the [...] "farmer"; the others are <b>the</b> piggies. <b>The</b> <b>farmer</b> is blindfolded and holds a pillow. All other players then sit in a circle {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>farmer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>farmer</b> is spun around three times and then has to make his or {{her way to the}} piggies, place the pillow on the lap of the chosen piggy without touching the piggy with his or her hands (to maintain the anonymity of the piggy), and sit down, squashing <b>the</b> piggy. <b>The</b> <b>farmer</b> then says [...] "Squeak Piggy Squeak". When the chosen piggy squeaks, <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> has to guess the name of the player on whom he or she is sitting. If <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> guesses correctly, <b>the</b> piggy becomes <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> in <b>the</b> next round. If the guess is incorrect, then <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> remains to be spun again for the next round. The piggies all switch chairs so that <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> will not know who is sitting where. Instead of [...] "Squeak Piggy Squeak", any other animal sound can be substituted, like [...] "Moo Cow Moo" [...] or even [...] "Roar Lion Roar".|$|R

5|$|In an earlier, more celebrated case, Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1968), a {{group of}} farmers pressed the Milk Marketing Board to {{increase}} the prices for milk payable to them, but the Board refused. <b>The</b> <b>farmers</b> complained to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under section 19(3) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Under the section, the Minister had power to direct that a complaint be considered by the Committee of Investigation {{but he refused to}} exercise the statutory power and provided no reasons for his refusal. <b>The</b> <b>farmers</b> alleged misconduct on Minister's part. The House of Lords held that a minister's power under an Act is not unfettered, and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the objects of the statute as his non-exercise of the power had been based on a misunderstanding of the purpose for which the power was given to him. Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act, and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate the policy and objects of the Act.|$|E

5000|$|Legend {{has it that}} {{a farmer}} from Mobberley was taking a milk white mare to sell at the market in Macclesfield. Walking along the Edge, he reached a spot known locally as [...] "Thieves Hole" [...] where an old man clad in a grey and flowing garment stopped him. The old man offered <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> a sum of money for his horse but <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> refused, saying {{he could get a}} better price at the market. The old man told <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> that he would be at this spot again that evening when <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> returned, not having found a {{purchaser}} for <b>the</b> horse. <b>The</b> <b>farmer</b> failed to sell the horse making his journey back along the Edge. At the same point, the old man appeared again, repeating his offer, which this time was accepted. The old man told <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> to follow him with the horse. As they approached an area just past Stormy Point, the old man held out a wand and uttered a spell, opening the rock revealing a pair of huge iron gates, which the wizard - as he was - opened. Assuring no harm the wizard told <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> to enter. <b>The</b> <b>farmer</b> did so, and was led through the gates into a large cavern. In <b>the</b> cavern, <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> saw countless men and white horses, all asleep. In a recess there was a chest, from which the wizard took the payment for the horse, which he gave to <b>the</b> <b>farmer.</b> <b>The</b> astonished <b>farmer</b> asked what all this meant; the wizard explained that all these sleeping warriors were ready to awake and fight should England fall into danger. He then ordered <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> to leave and return home.|$|R

5|$|The 2009 midterm {{elections}} took place {{a year after}} the crisis with <b>the</b> <b>farmers.</b> The Kirchners were highly unpopular at the time, and people rejected their policies and governing style.

5|$|The {{region of}} Flanders is {{particularly}} conducive to agriculture, {{and in the}} 19th century the draining of the swamps and improved farming techniques led to a major expansion in cultivated areas and farm sizes. As there were no existing horses {{in the area that}} were suitable for plowing, <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> found it necessary to create a breed of draft horse specifically for their use. From the 1850s on, farmers selected horses that eventually became the Trait du Nord. <b>The</b> <b>farmers</b> combined large Belgian breeds adapted to swampy ground with the Ardennes and Dutch breeds for size, weight and strength. The result was a muscular, powerful, and tough breed with long legs that facilitated movement. The Trait du Nord was unique in being selected specifically for farming, as many draft breeds were also bred for use in transport.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, Welsh land owners {{divided up}} the land to allow for tenant-based farming. Each small holding would include {{vegetable}} crops, as well as a cow, pigs and a few chickens. The 18th and 19th centuries were a time of unrest for the Welsh people. The Welsh food riots began in 1740, when colliers blamed the lack of food on problems in the supply, and continued throughout Wales as a whole. The worst riots happened in the 1790s after a grain shortage, which coincided with political upheaval in the form of forced military service and high taxes on the roads, leaving farmers unable to make a profit. As a result of riots by colliers in the mid 1790s, magistrates in Glamorgan sold the rioters corn at a reduced price. At the same time they also requested military assistance from the government to stop further rioting. Due to the close-knit nature of the poor communities, and the slightly higher status of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> above the labourers, the rioters generally blamed <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> and corn merchants, rather than the gentry.|$|E
