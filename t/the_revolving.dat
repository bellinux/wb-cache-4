5|$|In Fig.2, the {{corresponding}} part of <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, {{the body in}} the static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E
5|$|Besides clockwork, hydraulic-powered armillary spheres, odometers, and {{mechanical}} compass vehicles, {{there were other}} impressive devices of mechanical engineering found during the Song dynasty. Although literary references for mechanical revolving repositories and book cases of Buddhist temples trace back to at least 823 during the Tang dynasty, they came to prominence during the Song dynasty. The invention of <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> book case is considered to have happened earlier, and is credited to the layman Fu Xi in 544. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> speaker.|$|E

5000|$|The London {{production}} was criticized. The projections were dizzying, out of focus, and <b>the</b> <b>revolve</b> (turntable) was not synchronized with <b>the</b> projections. (<b>The</b> <b>revolve</b> {{is used to}} move actors from one point of the stage to another while pictures behind them move, giving {{the effect of a}} camera swooping about.) The CurtainUp reviewer noted [...] "The technology from William Dudley... is impressive. But I have reservations. These graphics do not for me suspend disbelief. I am always aware that what I am watching is a picture and not the real thing...The 'Wow!' factor is missing." ...|$|R

25|$|A {{revolving}} door has {{three or four}} doors that hang on a center shaft and rotate around a vertical axis within a round enclosure. In high-rise buildings, regular doors are hard to open because of air pressure differentials. In order to address this problem, <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> door was invented in 1888 by Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Van Kannel patented <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> door on August 7, 1888.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>revolving</b> {{stage in}} <b>the</b> western world {{was built by}} Karl Lautenschläger (1843-1906) in 1896 in Munich, Germany. Lautenschläger studied under Carl Brandt at the court theatre in Darmstad. From there he went to Munich, where he worked for 22 years and became the head {{machinist}} at the Royal theatre. He {{is known for his}} revolving stage, sometimes called the Lautenschläger stage, which later acquired the legacy of being called the new Shakespeare stage. The stage was installed at the Residenz Theatre for a performance of Don Giovanni, an opera by Wolfgang Mozart. <b>The</b> <b>revolve</b> at <b>the</b> Residenz Theatre was fifty feet in diameter and was raised slightly off of the regular stage floor. With the proscenium, a little less than a fourth of <b>the</b> <b>revolve</b> was visible to the audience. Lautenschläger used electricity to power the turntable, with the table turning on rollers, which ran on a circular track. This particular revolve was split into quarter sections and allowed four scenes to be set {{at the top of the}} show. The rotating stage allowed for depth, like landscapes with views in the distance and a more three-dimensional set in front of the walls of <b>the</b> <b>revolve.</b>|$|R

25|$|In lobbying, <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> door is the cycling {{of former}} federal {{employees}} into jobs as lobbyists while former K Street employees are pulled into government positions. Government officials can only work certain terms in their positions, for example senators, and afterwards they form valuable connections {{that could help}} influence future law making. The other form of <b>the</b> <b>revolving</b> door is pushing lobbyists into government positions, and then developing connections and returning into the lobbying world to use said connections. This is a controversial issue in the political lobbying world.|$|E
