5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different <b>things,</b> <b>because</b> individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E
25|$|The money street {{children}} earn {{that is not}} spent on food is usually quickly spent on other <b>things</b> <b>because</b> older children and police frequently steal their money. This lack of ability to save causes severe financial insecurity. While children occasionally send some of their earnings home to their families, they {{spend most of their}} extra money on entertainment.|$|E
25|$|The {{service was}} a trade-off, as the longer {{distance}} via Solør added {{an hour to}} the travel time for passengers from Østerdalen. In exchange, people from Solør and Kongsvinger received a direct service to both Oslo and Trondheim. Passengers from Østerdalen used the train less, among other <b>things</b> <b>because</b> {{of the lack of}} a direct service to Hamar. After a three-year trial, the long-distance trains moved back to Hamar and two daily local services were reintroduced through Solør.|$|E
50|$|The Jewish {{tradition}} often {{encourages the}} elimination of “otherness” instead {{for all to see}} each other as moral counterparts and emphasizes the obligation to render aid and intervene autonomously, doing the right <b>thing</b> <b>because</b> it’s right, not in a heteronomous way, doing the right <b>thing</b> <b>because</b> we feel we must. The tradition teaches not to simply love, but to tolerate {{in order to be able}} to achieve justice.|$|R

25|$|States cannot {{transfer}} {{rights over}} {{something they do}} not own. In the case of Kelantan and any other Peninsular Malaysian state, the Deed should have been worded to refer only to onshore petroleum. Unfortunately for Kelantan, the matter cannot end with the two agreements. There is a supreme Constitution in Malaysia with a federal-state division of legislative and financial powers. The constitutional allocation cannot be altered except by constitutionally permitted procedures and amendments. Even mutual agreements cannot override the constitutional scheme of <b>things</b> <b>because</b> jurisdiction {{is a matter of}} law and not of consent or acquiescence.|$|E
25|$|Another measurement, {{calculated}} {{as part of}} a wider assessment of water management in 2007, aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into 'physical' and 'economic'. Physical water scarcity is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Water stress harms living <b>things</b> <b>because</b> every organism needs water to live.|$|E
25|$|Stoskopff {{returned}} to Strasbourg in 1639. This {{could have been}} for familial reasons or because of the strong increase of religious conflict in Paris. One year later, he joined the guild of Steltz, to which other painters, copper engravers and craftsmen in the arts belonged. There were several arguments between the artist and the guild after he joined it, among other <b>things</b> <b>because</b> Stoskopff loved his freedom as an independent and self-responsible artist {{and did not want}} to operate a workshop with apprentices, as was usually done. He achieved wealth and prestige in Strasbourg and married the stepdaughter of his youngest sister in 1646.|$|E

25|$|It {{seemed to}} strike an {{extraordinary}} {{balance between the}} psychological and the supernatural {{in such a way}} as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these <b>things</b> <b>because</b> he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of an increasing fractal dimension with space-filling {{might be taken}} to mean fractal dimensions measure density, {{but that is not}} so; the two are not strictly correlated. Instead, a fractal dimension measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: self-similarity and detail or irregularity. These features are evident in the two examples of fractal curves. Both are curves with topological dimension of 1, so one might {{hope to be able to}} measure their length or slope, as with ordinary lines. But we cannot do either of these <b>things,</b> <b>because</b> fractal curves have complexity in the form of self-similarity and detail that ordinary lines lack. The self-similarity lies in the infinite scaling, and the detail in the defining elements of each set. The length between any two points on these curves is undefined because the curves are theoretical constructs that never stop repeating themselves. Every smaller piece is composed of an infinite number of scaled segments that look exactly like the first iteration. These are not rectifiable curves, meaning they cannot be measured by being broken down into many segments approximating their respective lengths. They cannot be characterized by finding their lengths or slopes. However, their fractal dimensions can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard.|$|E
500|$|For his 1981 Don't Give In album, Leon Patillo {{recorded}} a heavily {{revised version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord".

500|$|Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) {{reveal that}} they are {{adopting}} a boy from the United States. Mitchell worries {{that he will not}} be able to do all the father/son <b>things</b> <b>because</b> of his sexuality and his inability to participate in [...] "manly" [...] activities such as catching and shooting. Despite this, he reassures himself after he blows up a birdhouse with a firecracker with Luke (Nolan Gould).|$|E
500|$|García Márquez {{believed}} {{that most of}} the information available on Bolívar was one-dimensional: [...] "No one ever said in Bolívar's biographies that he sang or that he was constipated... but historians don't say these <b>things</b> <b>because</b> they think they are not important." [...] In the epilogue to the novel, García Márquez writes that he researched the book for two years; the task was difficult, both because of his lack of experience in conducting historical research, and the lack of documentary evidence for the events of the final period of Bolívar's life.|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{examined}} issues of gender misidentification that are prevalent {{in much of}} Hemingway's work. He was interested in cross-gender themes, as shown by his depictions of effeminate men and boyish women. In his fiction, a woman's hair is often symbolically important and used to denote gender. Brett, with her short hair, is androgynous and compared to a boy—yet the ambiguity {{lies in the fact}} that she is described as a [...] "damned fine-looking woman." [...] While Jake is attracted to this ambiguity, Romero is repulsed by it. In keeping with his strict moral code he wants a feminine partner and rejects Brett, among other <b>things,</b> <b>because</b> she will not grow her hair.|$|E

500|$|Following {{exposure}} with British {{magazines and}} newspapers and a successful performance on BBC Radio 1, Bloc Party received a contract offer from Parlophone. The band members declined the opportunity {{because they did not}} want to work for a major record label and instead signed a recording contract with East London indie label Wichita Recordings, chosen because it did not want to stamp its agenda on the conception of records. Frontman and chief writer Okereke wanted Silent Alarm to emphasise the importance of finding pleasure in small mundane <b>things,</b> <b>because</b> [...] "those are the sort of things that can be incredibly touching". The album was born out of [...] "a nagging youthful urgency" [...] and the realisation that responsibility has to be taken for the first time as a young adult. Before recording started, Okereke attended singing lessons to open up his voice.|$|E
500|$|The film {{opened in}} 3,929 theaters in the United States and Canada on May 16, 2008. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film a PG. To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered {{a shot of}} a fallen helmet {{to make clear that}} it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made {{numerous}} edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining [...] "When you sit down and you're watching it, and you see the kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're doing all of these <b>things</b> <b>because</b> you're essentially making the film for yourself. When you start showing it to an audience, that then influences how you feel about the film." ...|$|E

500|$|Haynes {{confirmed}} deliverables {{were completed}} on December 15, 2014. Carrie Brownstein {{stated that the}} first cut was extensive and most of her scenes were left out. [...] In November 2015, Sarah Paulson said that a key scene between Abby and Therese {{as well as some}} of the conversation in a scene with Carol was cut from the film. In January 2016, Rooney Mara revealed that an intimate scene between Therese and Richard was also deleted. Editor Affonso Gonçalves stated that the initial cut was two and a half hours and the final cut ended at 118 minutes. Todd Haynes explained in an October 2015 interview: [...] "We cut a lot of scenes; it was too long, and they were all well-performed and nicely shot—we never, in my opinion, cut <b>things</b> <b>because</b> they were poorly executed. It was just a paring-down process, which all movies do." ...|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{widespread}} rumors, Usher stated, [...] "People assume <b>things,</b> <b>because</b> as I said, I pull from {{my personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music." [...] He added that he loved Chilli, however, [...] "...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash..." [...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that happened to my main girl." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new <b>things</b> <b>because</b> those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E
